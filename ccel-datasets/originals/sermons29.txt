The Star and the Wise Men

   (No. 1698)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, December 24th, 1882, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [1]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Now Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the
   king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
   Where is he that is born King of the Jews'? for we have seen his star
   in the east, and are come to worship him. When they had heard the king,
   they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went
   before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
   When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy."
   Matthew 2:1-2, 9-10.

   SEE, DEAR FRIENDS, the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ even in his state
   of humiliation! He is born of lowly parents, laid in a manger, and
   wrapped in swaddling bands; but, lo! the principalities and powers in
   the heavenly places are in commotion. First, one angel descends to
   proclaim the advent of the new-born King and suddenly there is with him
   a multitude of the heavenly host singing glory unto God. Nor was the
   commotion confined to the spirits above; for in the heavens which
   overhang this card, there is a stir. A star is deputed on behalf of all
   the stars, as if he were the envoy and plenipotentiary of all worlds to
   represent them before their King. This star is put in commission to
   wait upon the Lord, to be his herald to men afar off, his usher to
   conduct them to his presence, and his body-guard to sentinel his
   cradle. Earth, too, is stirred. Shepherds have come to pay the homage
   of simple-minded ones: with all love and joy they bow before the
   mysterious child; and after them from afar come the choice and flower
   of their generation, the most studious minds of the age. Making a long
   and difficult journey, they too at last arrive, the representatives of
   the Gentiles. Lo! the kings of Seba and Sheba offer giftsgold,
   frankincense, and myrrh. Wise men, the leaders of their peoples, bow
   down before him, and pay homage to the Son of God. Wherever Christ is
   he is honorable. "Unto you that believe he is honor." In the day of
   small things, when the cause of God is denied entertainment, and is
   hidden away with things which are despised, it is still most glorious.
   Christ, though a child, is still King of kings; though among the oxen,
   he is still distinguished by his star.

   Beloved friends, if wise men of old came to Jesus and worshipped,
   should not we come also? My intense desire this morning is that we all
   may pay homage to him of whom we sing, "Unto us a child is born; unto
   us a son is given." Let those of us who have long worshipped, worship
   anew with yet lowlier reverence and intenser love. And God grant-oh,
   that he would grant it!that some who are far off from him spiritually,
   as the Magi were far off locally, may come to-day and ask, "Where is he
   that is born King of the Jews? for we have come to worship him." May
   feet that have been accustomed to broad roads, but unaccustomed to the
   narrow path, this day pursue that way till they see Jesus, and how
   before him with all their hearts, finding salvation in him. These wise
   men came naturally, traversing the desert; let us come spiritually,
   leaving our sins. These were guided by the sight of a star; let us be
   guided by faith in the divine Spirit, by the teaching of his word and
   all those blessed lights which the Lord uses to conduct men to himself.
   Only let us come to Jesus. It was well to come unto the babe Jesus, led
   by the feeble beams of a star; you shall find it still more blessed to
   come to him now that he is exalted in the highest heavens, and by his
   own light reveals his own perfect glory. Delay not, for this day he
   cries, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest."

   This morning let us try to do three things. First, let us gather light
   from this star; secondly, let us gather wisdom from those wise men; and
   thirdly, let us act as wise men helped by our own particular star.

   I. First, then, LET US GATHER LIGHT FROM THIS STAR. May the Spirit of
   the Lord enable us so to do.

   I suppose you have each one his own imagination as to what this star
   was. It would seem to have been altogether supernatural, and not a
   star, or a comet of the ordinary kind. It was not a constellation, nor
   a singular conjunction of planets: there is nothing in the Scriptures
   to support such a conjecture. In all probability it was not a star in
   the sense in which we now speak of stars: for we find that it moved
   before the wise men, then suddenly disappeared, and again shone forth
   to move before them. It could not have been a star in the upper spheres
   like others, for such movements would not have been possible. Some have
   supposed that the wise men went in the direction in which the star
   shone forth in the heavens, and followed the changes of its position:
   but it could not in that case have been said that it stood over the
   place where the young child was. If the star was at its zenith over
   Bethlehem, it would have been in its zenith over Jerusalem too; for the
   distance is so small that it would not have been possible to observe
   any difference in the position of the star in the two places. It must
   have been a star occupying quite another sphere from that in which the
   planets revolve. We believe it to have been a luminous appearance in
   mid-air; probably akin to that which led the children of Israel through
   the wilderness, which was a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
   Whether it was seen in the daylight or not we cannot tell. Chrysostom
   and the early fathers are wonderfully positive about many things which
   Scripture leaves in doubt, but as these eminent divines drew upon their
   imagination for their facts, we are not under bonds to follow them.
   They aver that this star was so bright as to be visible all day long.
   If so, we can imagine the wise men travelling day and night; but if it
   could be seen only by night, the picture before us grows far more
   singular and weirdlike as we see these easterns quietly pursuing their
   star-lit way, resting perforce when the sun was up, but noiselessly
   hurrying at night through slumbering lands. These questions are not of
   much importance to us, and therefore we will not dwell long upon them.

   Only here is a first lesson: if it should ever be that men should fail
   to preach the gospel, God can conduct souls to his Son by a star. Ah!
   say not only by a star, but by a stone, a bird, a blade of grass, a
   drop of dew.

   "Remember that Omnipotence
   Has servants everywhere."

   Therefore, despond not when you hear that one minister has ceased to
   preach the gospel, or that another is fighting against the viral truth
   of God. Their apostasy shall be to their own loss rather than to the
   hurt of Jesus and his church; and, sad though it be to see the lamps of
   the sanctuary put out, yet God is not dependent upon human lights, he
   is the Shekinah light of his own holy place. Mortal tongues, if they
   refuse to preach his word, shall have their places supplied by books in
   the running brooks and sermons in stones. The beam shall cry out of the
   wall, and the timber shall answer it. When chief priests and scribes
   have all gone out of the way, the Lord puts stars into commission, and
   once more in very deed the heavens are telling the glory of God, and
   the firmament is showing his handiwork. Sooner than lack speakers for
   the incarnate God, mountains and hills shall learn eloquence and break
   forth into testimony. Jehovah's message shall be made known to the
   utmost ends of the earth. God shall save his own elect; he shall give
   to Christ to see of the travail of his soul and to be satisfied. His
   counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure. Hallelujah!

   Now, when the Lord does use a star to be his minister, what is the
   order of his ministry? We may learn by this enquiry what kind of
   ministry God would have ours to be if we are stars in his right hand.
   We also shine as lights in the world: let us see how to do it.

   We notice, first, that star-preaching is all about Christ. We do not
   know what the color of the star was, nor the shape of the star, nor to
   what magnitude it had attained; these items are not recorded, but what
   is recorded is of much more importance; the wise men said"We have seen
   his star." Then the star which the Lord will use to lead men to Jesus
   must be Christ's own star. The faithful minister, like this star,
   belongs to Christ; he is Christ's own man in the most emphatic sense.
   Before we can expect to be made a blessing, dear friends, we must
   ourselves be blessed of the Lord. If we would cause others to belong,
   to Jesus, we must belong wholly to Jesus ourselves. Every beam in that
   star shone forth for Jesus. It was his star, always, and only, and
   altogether. It shone not for itself, but only as his star: as such it
   was known and spoken of"we have seen his star." As I have already
   said, there is no note taken of any peculiarity that it had except this
   one, that it was the star of the King. I wish that you and I, whatever
   our eccentricities or personalities may be, may never make so much of
   them as to attract men's attention to them. May people never dwell upon
   our attainments or our deficiencies, but may they always observe this
   one thing, that we are men of God, that we are ambassadors of Christ,
   that we are Christ's servants, and do not attempt to shine for
   ourselves, or to make ourselves conspicuous; but that we labor to shine
   for him, that his way may be known upon earth, his saving health among
   all people. Brother, it is well for us to forget ourselves in our
   message, to sink ourselves in our Master. We know the names of several
   of the stars, yet they may each one envy that star which remains
   anonymous, but can never be forgotten because men who sought the King
   of Israel knew it as "his star." Though you be but a very little star,
   twinkling for Jesus; however feeble your light may be, be it plain that
   you are his star, so that if men wonder what you are, they may never
   wonder whose you are, for on your very forefront it shall be written,
   "Whose I am and whom I serve." God will not lead men to Christ by us
   unless we are Christ's heartily, wholly, unreservedly. In his temple
   our Lord uses no borrowed vessels; every bowl before the altar must be
   his own. It is not consistent with the glory of God for him to use
   borrowed vessels. He is not so poor as that comes to. This lesson is
   worthy of all acceptation. Are you in a hurry to preach, young man? Are
   you sure you are Christ's? Do you think it must be a fine thing to hold
   a company or people listening to your words? Have you looked at it in
   another light,? Have you weighed the responsibility of having to speak
   as Christ would have you speak, and of yielding yourself in your entire
   personality to the utterance of the mind of God? You must be
   consecrated and concentrated if you hope to be used or the Lord. If you
   have one ray, or ten thousand rays, all must shine with the one design
   of guiding men to Jesus. You have nothing now to do with any object,
   subject, design, or endeavor, but Jesus only: in him, and for him, and
   to him must you live henceforth, or you will never be chosen of the
   Lord to conduct either wise men or babes to Jesus. See ye well to it
   that perfect consecration be yours.

   Note next that true star-preaching leads to Christ. The star was
   Christ's star itself, but it also led others to Christ. It did this
   very much because it moved in that direction. It is a sad thing when a
   preacher is like a sign-post pointing the way but never following it,
   on his own account. Such were those chief priests at Jerusalem: they
   could tell where Christ was born, but they never went to worship him;
   they were indifferent altogether to him and to his birth. The star that
   leads to Christ must always be going to Christ. Men are far better
   drawn by example than driven by exhortation. Personal piety alone can
   be owned of God to the production of piety in others. "Go," say you;
   but they will not go. Say "come," and lead the way: then they will
   come. Do not the sheep follow the shepherd? He who would lead others to
   Christ should go before them himself, having his face towards his
   Master, his eyes towards his Master, his steps toward his Master, his
   heart towards his Master. We are so to live that we may without
   boasting exhort those around us to have us for an example. Oh, that all
   who think themselves to be stars would themselves diligently move
   towards the Lord Jesus. The star in the east led wise men to Christ
   because it went that way itself: there is a wisdom in example which
   truly wise men are quick to perceive. This star had such an influence
   upon the chosen men that they could not but follow it: it charmed them
   across the desert. Such a charm may reside in you and in me, and we may
   exercise a powerful ministry over many hearts, being to them as
   loadstones, drawing them to the Lord Jesus. Happy privilege! We would
   not, merely show the road, but induce our neighbors to enter upon it.
   We read of one of old, not that they told him of Jesus, but that "they
   brought him to Jesus." We are not only to tell the story of the cross,
   but we are to persuade men to fly to the Crucified One for salvation.
   Did not the king in the parable say to his servants, "Compel them to
   come in." Assuredly he girds his own messengers with such a compelling
   power that men cannot hold out any longer, but must follow their lead
   and bow at the King's feet. The star did not draw, "as it were with a
   cart rope," nor by any force, material and physical; yet it drew these
   wise men from the remote east right to the manger of the new-born
   child. And so, though we have no arm of the law to help us, nor
   patronage, nor pomp of eloquence, nor parade of learning, yet we have a
   spiritual power by which we draw to Jesus thousands who are our joy and
   crown. The man sent of God comes forth from the divine presence
   permeated with a power which makes men turn to the Savior and live. Oh!
   that such power might go forth from all God's ministers yea, from all
   God's servants engaged in street-preaching, in Sunday-schools, in
   tract-visitation, and in every form of holy service. God uses those
   whose aim and intent it is to draw men to Christ. He puts his Spirit
   into them, by which Spirit they are helped to set forth the Lord Jesus
   as so lovely and desirable that men run to him and accept his glorious
   salvation. It is a small thing to shine, but it is a great thing to
   draw. Any cast-away may be brilliant; but only the real saint will be
   attractive for Jesus. I would not pray to be an orator, but I do pray
   to be a soul-winner. Do not aim, beloved brethren, at anything short of
   leading men to Jesus. Do not be satisfied to lead them to orthodox
   doctrine, or merely to bring them to a belief in those views which you
   hold to be Scriptural, valuable as that way be. It is to the person of
   the incarnate God that we must bring them to his feet we must conduct
   them that they may worship him: our mission is not accomplished, it is
   a total failure, unless we conduct our hearers to the house where Jesus
   dwells, and then stand over them, keeping watch over their souls for
   Jesu's sake.

   Once more, the star which God used in this case was a star that stopped
   at Jesus: it went before the wise men till it brought them to Jesus,
   and then it stood still over the place where the young child was. I
   admire the manner of this star. There are remarkable stars in the
   theological sky at the present, time: they have led men to Jesus, so
   they say, and now they lead them into regions beyond, of yet
   undeveloped thought. The gospel of the Puritans is "old-fashioned";
   these men have discovered that it is unsuitable for the enlarged
   intellects of the times; and so these stars would guide us further
   still. To this order of wandering stars I do not belong myself, and I
   trust I never shall. Progress beyond the gospel I have no desire for.
   "God forbid that I should glory save ill the cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ." When the star had come to the place where the young child was,
   it stood still: and so should the gracious mind become settled, fixed,
   immovable. The wise men knew where to find that star, and where to find
   the young child by it: so be it with us. Oh, you that have hitherto
   been diligent in leading souls to Christ, never indulge for a single
   moment the notion that you need a broader philosophy or a deeper
   spirituality than are to be found in Jesus. Abide in him. Cry, "Oh God,
   my heart is fixed. My heart is fixed." There is nothing beyond Christ
   which is worth a moment's thought. Do not lose your paradise in Christ
   for another taste of that tree of knowledge of good-and-evil which
   ruined our first parents. Stick you to the old points: your one subject
   Christ, your one object to bring men to Christ, your one glory the
   glory of Christ. Standing by your Lord, and there alone, from this day
   to the last day, you will secure a happy, honored, and holy life. They
   said of Greece after her fall that it had become so ruined that you
   might search for Greece in Greece and fail to find it: I fear I must
   say that some professed preachers of the gospel have roamed so far away
   from it that you cannot find the gospel in their gospel, nor Christ
   himself in the Christ they preach. So far have some diverged from the
   grand essential soul-saving truth beyond which no man ought to dare to
   think of going, that they retain nothing of Christianity but the name.
   All that is beyond truth is a lie; anything beyond revelation is at
   best a minor matter, and most probably is an old wives' fable, even
   though he may be of the masculine gender who invented it. Stand you to
   your colors you who hope to be used of the Lord. Abide so that men
   shall find you in twenty years' time shining for Jesus and pointing to
   the place where the Savior is to be found, even as you are doing now.
   Let Jesus Christ be your ultimatum. Your work is done when you bring
   souls to Jesus, and help to keep them there, by being yourself
   "steadfast, unmovable." Be not carried away from the hope of your
   calling; but hold fast even the form of sound words, for it may be that
   in letting go the form you may lose the substance also.

   II. Now that we have somewhat rejoiced in the light of the star, let us
   see if we can GATHER WISDOM FROM THE WISE MEN. Perhaps you have heard
   the "much speaking" of tradition as to who they were, whence they came,
   and how they traveled. In the Greek church, I believe, they know their
   number, their names, the character of their retinue, and what kind of
   ornaments were on their dromedaries' necks. Details which are not found
   in the word of God you may believe or not, at your pleasure, and you
   will be wise if our pleasure is not to believe too much. We only know
   that they were Magi, wise men from the East, possibly of the old Parsee
   religionwatchers if not worshippers of the stars. We will not
   speculate about them, but learn from them.

   They did not content themselves with admiring the star and comparing it
   with other stars, and taking notes as to the exact date of its
   appearance, and how many times it twinkled, and when it moved, and all
   that; but they practically used the teaching of the star. Many are
   hearers and admirers of God's servants, but they are not wise enough to
   make fit and proper use of the preaching. They notice the peculiarity
   of the preacher's language, how much he is like one divine, how much he
   is unlike another; whether he coughs too often, or speaks too much in
   his throat; whether he is too loud or too low; whether he has not a
   provincial tone, whether there may not be about him a commonness of
   speech approaching to vulgarity; or, on the other hand, whether he may
   not be too florid in his diction. Such fooleries as these are the
   constant observations of men for whose souls we labor. They are
   perishing, and yet toying with such small matters With many it is all
   they go to the house of God for, to criticise in this paltry fashion. I
   have even seen them come to this place with opera glasses, as if they
   came hither to inspect an actor who lived and labored to arouse their
   leisure hours. Such is the sport of fools; but these were wise men, and
   therefore practical men. They did not become star-gazers, and stop at
   the point of admiring the remarkable star; but they said, "Where is he
   that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east,
   and are come to worship him." They set out at once to find the now-born
   King, of whose coming the star was the signal. Oh, my dear hearers, how
   I wish that you were all wise in this same manner! I would sooner
   preach the dullest sermon that was ever preached than preach the most
   brilliant that was ever spoken if I could by that poor sermon lead you
   quite away from myself to seek the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the one
   thing I care about. Will you never gratify me by enquiring after my
   Lord and Master? I long to hear you say, "What is the man talking
   about? He speaks about a Savior; we will have that Savior for
   ourselves. He talks about pardon through the blood of Christ; he speaks
   about God coming down among men to save them; we will find out if there
   is any reality in this pardon, any truth in this salvation. We will
   seek Jesus, and find for ourselves the blessings which are reported to
   be laid up in him." If I heard you all saying this I should be ready to
   die of joy.

   Is not this a good day on which to set out to find your Savior? Some of
   you that have postponed it long, would it not be well to set out at
   once ere this expiring year has seen its last day? These wise men
   appear to have set out as soon as they discovered the star: they were
   not among those who have time to waste in needless delays. "There is
   the star," said they; "away we go beneath its guidance. We are not
   satisfied with a star, we go to find the King whose star it is!" And so
   they set out to find Christ immediately and resolutely.

   Being wise men, they persevered in their search after him. We cannot
   tell how far they journeyed. Travelling was extremely difficult in
   those times. There were hostile tribes to avoid, the broad rivers of
   the Tigris and the Euphrates to cross, and trackless deserts to
   penetrate; but they made nothing of difficulty or danger. They set out
   for Jerusalem, and to Jerusalem they came, seeking the King of the
   Jews. If it be true that God has taken upon himself our nature, we
   ought to resolve to find him, let it cost what it may. If we must
   circumnavigate the globe to find a Savior, the distance and the expense
   ought to be nothing so long as we may but reach him. Were the Christ in
   the bowels of the earth, or in the heights of heaven we ought not to
   rest till we come at him. Everything that was necessary for their
   expedition the wise men soon gathered together, regardless of expense;
   and off they went following the star that they might discover the
   Prince of the kings of the earth.

   At length they came to Jerusalem, and here new trials awaited them. It
   must have been a great trouble to them when they asked, "Where is he
   that is born King of the Jews?" and the people shook their heads as if
   they thought the question an idle one. Neither rich nor poor in the
   metropolitan city knew anything of Israel's King. The ribald multitude
   replied, "Herod is king of the Jews. Mind how you speak of another
   king, or your head may have to answer for it. The tyrant brooks no
   rival." The wise men must have been more astonished still when they
   found that Herod was troubled. They were glad to think that he was born
   who was to usher in the age or gold; but Herod's face grew blacker than
   ever at the bare mention of a king of the Jews. His eyes flashed, and a
   thundercloud was upon his brow; a dark deed of murder will come of it,
   though for the moment he conceals his malice. There is tumult all
   through the streets of Jerusalem, for no man knows what grim Herod may
   do now that he has been roused by the question, "Where is he that is
   born King of the Jews? Thus there was a ferment in Jerusalem, beginning
   at the palace; but this did not deter the wise men from their search
   for the promised Prince. They did not pack up their bales and go back
   and say, "It is useless to try to discover this questionable personage
   who is unknown even in the country of which he is King, and who appears
   to "be terribly unwelcome to those who are to be his subjects. We must
   leave to another day the solution of the question: "Where is he that is
   born King of the Jews?'"

   These earnest-minded seekers were not dispirited by the clergy and the
   learned men when they came together. To the chief priests and scribes
   the question was put, and they answered the enquiry as to where Christ
   would be born, but not a mother's son among them would go with the wise
   men to find this new-born King. Strange apathy! Alas, how common! Those
   who should have been leaders were no leaders; they would not even be
   followers of that which is good, for they had no heart towards Christ.
   The wise men rose superior to this serious discouragement. If the
   clergy would not help them they would go to Jesus by themselves. Oh,
   dear friend, if you are wise you will say, "I will find Christ alone if
   none will join me: if I dig to the center, I will find him; if I fly to
   the sun, I will find him; if all men put me off, I will find him; if
   the ministers of the gospel appear indifferent to me, I will find him:
   the kingdom of heaven or old suffered violence, and the violent took it
   by force, and so will I." The first Christians had to leave all the
   authorized teachers of the day behind, and to come out by themselves:
   it will be no strange thing if you should have to do the same. Happy
   will it be if you are determined to go through floods and flames to
   find Christ; for he will be found of you. Thus these men were wise
   because, having started on the search, they persevered in it till they
   found the Lord and worshipped him.

   Notice that they were wise because, when they again saw the star, "they
   rejoiced with exceeding great joy." While enquiring among the priests
   at Jerusalem they were perplexed, but when the star shone out again,
   they were at ease and full of joy: this joy they expressed, so that the
   evangelist recorded it. In these days very wise people think it
   necessary to repress all emotion, and appear like men of stone or ice.
   No matter what happens, they are stoical, and raised far above the
   enthusiasm of the vulgar. It is wonderful how fashions change, and
   folly stands for philosophy. But these wise men were children enough to
   be glad when their perplexity was over, and the clear light shone
   forth. It is a good sign when a man is not ashamed to be happy because
   he hears a plain, unmistakable testimony for the Lord Jesus. It is good
   to see the great man come down from his pedestal, and, like a little
   child, rejoice to hear the simple story of the cross. Give me the
   hearer who looks not for fineries, but cries out, "Lead me to Jesus. I
   want a guide to Jesus, and nothing else will suit me." Why, truly, if
   men did but know the value of things they would rejoice more to see a
   preacher of the gospel than a king. If the feet of the heralds of
   salvation be blessed, how much more their tongues when they tell out
   the tidings of a Savior. These wise men, with all their mystic learning
   were not ashamed to rejoice because a little star lent them its beams
   to conduct them to Jesus. We unite with them in rejoicing over a clear
   gospel ministry. For us all else is darkness, sorrow, and vexation of
   spirit; but that which leads us to our own glorious Lord is spirit, and
   light, and life. Better the sun should not shine than that a clear
   gospel should not be preached. We reckon that a country flourishes or
   decays according as gospel light is revealed or withdrawn.

   Now follow these wise men a little further. They have come to the house
   where the young child is. What will they do? Will they stand looking at
   the star? No: they enter in. The star stands still, but they are not
   afraid to lose its radiance, and behold the Sun of righteousness. They
   did not cry, "We see the star, and that is enough for us; we have
   followed the star, and it is all we need to do." Not at all. They lift,
   the latch, and enter the lowly residence of the babe. They see the star
   no longer, and they have no need to see it, for there is he that is
   born King of the Jews. Now the true Light has shone upon them from the
   face of the child; they behold the incarnate God. Oh, friends! how wise
   you will be if, when you have been led to Christ by any man, you do not
   rest in his leadership, but must see Christ for yourselves. How much I
   long that you may enter into the fellowship of the mystery, pass
   through the door, and come and behold the young child, and bow before
   him. Our woe is that so many are so unwise. We are only their guides,
   but they are apt to make us their end. We point the way, but they do
   not follow the road; they stand gazing upon us. The star is gone; it
   did its work, and passed away: Jesus remains, and the wise men live in
   him. Will any of you be so foolish as to think only of the dying
   preacher, and forget the ever-living Savior? Come, be wise, and hasten
   to your Lord at once.

   These men were wise, last of alland I commend their example to
   you-because when they saw the child they worshipped. Theirs was not
   curiosity gratified, but devotion exercised. We, too, must worship the
   Savior, or we shall never be saved by him. He has not come to put away
   our sins, and yet to leave us ungodly and self-willed. Oh you that have
   never worshipped the Christ of God, may you be led to do so at once! He
   is God over all, blessed for ever, adore him! Was God ever seen in such
   a worshipful form before? Behold he bows the heavens; he rides upon the
   wings of the wind; he scatters flames of fire; he speaks, and his dread
   artillery shakes the hills: you worship in terror. Who would not adore
   the great and terrible Jehovah? But is it not much better to behold him
   here, allied to your nature, wrapped like other children in swaddling
   clothes, tender, feeble, next akin to your own self? Will you not
   worship God when he thus comes down to you and becomes your brother,
   born for your salvation? Here nature itself suggests worship: O may
   grace produce it! Let us hasten to worship where shepherds and wise men
   and angels have led the way.

   Here let my sermon come to a pause even as the star did. Enter the
   house and worship! Forget the preacher. Let the starlight shine for
   other eyes. Jesus was born that you might be born again. He lived that
   you might live. He died that you might die to sin. He is risen, and
   to-day he maketh intercession for transgressors that they may be
   reconciled to God through him. Come, then; believe, trust, rejoice,
   adore! If you have neither gold, frankincense, nor myrrh, bring your
   faith, your love, your repentance, and falling down before the Son of
   God pay him the reverence of your hearts.

   III. And now I turn to my third and last point, which is this: LET US
   ACT AS WISE MEN UNDER THE LIGHT OF OUR STAR. We too have received light
   to lead us to the Savior: I might say that for us many stars have shone
   to that blessed end. I will, however, on this point content myself with
   asking questions.

   Do you not think that there is some light for you in your particular
   vocation, some call from God in your calling? Listen to me, and then
   listen to God. These men were watchers of the stars; therefore a star
   was used to call them. Certain other men soon after were fishermen; and
   by means of an amazing take of fish the Lord Jesus made them aware of
   his superior power, and then he called them to become fishers of men.
   For a star-gazer a star; for a fisherman a fish. The Master-Fisher hath
   a bait for each one of his elect, and oftentimes he selects a point in
   their own calling to be the barb of the hook. Were you busy yesterday
   at your counter? Did you bear no voice saying "Buy the truth and sell
   it not"? When you closed the shop last night did you not bethink
   yourself that soon you must close it for the last time? Do you make
   bread? and do you never ask yourself, "Has my soul eaten the bread of
   heaven?" Are you a farmer? do you till the soil? Has God never spoken
   to you by those furrowed fields and these changing seasons, and made
   you wish that your heart might be tilled and sown.? Listen! God is
   speaking! Hear, ye deaf; for there are voices everywhere calling you to
   heaven. You need not go miles about to find a link between you and
   everlasting mercy: the telegraphic wires are on either side of the
   road, God and human souls are near each other. How I wish that your
   common vocation would be viewed by you as concealing within itself the
   door to your high vocation. Oh that the Holy Spirit would turn your
   favourite pursuits into opportunities for his gracious work upon you.
   If not among the stars, yet among the flowers of the garden, or the
   cattle of the hills, or the waves of the sea may he find a net in which
   to enclose you for Christ. I wish that those of you who conclude that
   your calling could never draw you to Christ would make a point of
   seeing whether it might not be so. We are to learn from ants, and
   swallows, and cranes, and conies; surely we need never be short of
   tutors. It did seem that a star was an unlikely thing to head a
   procession of eastern sages, and yet it was the best guide that could
   be found; and so it may seem that your trade is an unlikely thing to
   bring you to Jesus, and yet the Lord may so use it. There may be a
   message from the Lord to thee in many a left-handed providence; a voice
   for wisdom may come to thee from the month of an ass; a call to a holy
   life may startle thee from a bush, a warning may flash upon thee from a
   wall, or a vision may impress thee in the silence of night when deep
   sleep falleth upon men. Only be thou ready to hear and God will find a
   way of speaking to thee. Answer the question as the wise men would have
   answered it, and say, "Yes, in our calling there is a call to Christ."

   Then, again, what should you and I do better in this life than seek
   after Christ! The wise men thought all other pursuits of small account
   compared with this. "Who is going to attend to that observatory and
   watch the rest of the stars?" They shake their heads, and say they do
   not know: these things must wait; they have seen his star, and they are
   going to worship him. But who will attend to their wives and families,
   and all besides, while they make this long journey? They reply that
   every lesser thing must be subordinate to the highest thing. Matters
   must be taken in proportion, and the search after the King of the Jews,
   who is the desire of all nations, is so out of all proportion great
   that all the rest must go. Are not you, also, wise enough to judge in
   this sensible fashion? Do you not think, dear friends, it would be well
   to use all to-morrow in seeking Jesus? It will be a leisure day, could
   you spend it better than in Seeking your Redeemer? If you were to take
   a week, and give it wholly to your own soul, and to seeking Christ,
   would it not be well spent? How can you live with your soul in
   jeopardy? Oh that you would say, "I must get this matter right; it is
   an all-important business, and I must see it secure." This would be no
   more than common-sense. If you are driving, and a trace is broken, do
   you not stop the horse, and get the harness right? How, then, can you
   go on with the chariot of life when all its harness is out of order,
   and a fall means eternal ruin? If you will stop driving to arrange a
   buckle for fear of accident, I would beg of you to stop anything and
   everything to see to the safety of your soul. See how the engineer
   looks to the safety-valve: are you content to run more desperate risks?
   If your house were not insured, and you carried on a hazardous trade,
   the probability is you would feel extremely anxious until you had
   arranged that matter: but your soul is uninsured, and it may burn for
   ever,will you not give heed to it? I beseech you be just to
   yourself,kind to yourself. Oh! see to your eternal well-being. You are
   not certain that you will get home to dinner to-day. Life is frail as a
   cobweb. You may be in hell before yon clock strikes one! Remember that.
   There is not a step between you and everlasting destruction from the
   presence of God if you are as yet unregenerate; and your only hope is
   to find the Savior, trust the Savior, obey the Savior. Wherefore, like
   these wise men, put everything on one side, and set out now upon an
   earnest, resolute, persevering endeavor to find Jesus. I was about to
   sayresolve to find Jesus, or to die; but I will change the words, and
   sayresolve to find him, and live.

   When we do come near to Jesus, let us ask ourselves this question, "Do
   we see more in Jesus than other people do?" for if we do, we are God's
   elect taught of God, illuminated by his Spirit. We read in the
   Scriptures that when these wise men saw the young child they fell down
   and worshipped him. Other people might have come in and seen the child,
   and said, "Many children are as interesting as this poor woman's babe."
   Ay, but as these men looked, they saw: all eyes are not so blessed.
   Eyes that see are gifts from the All-seeing One. Carnal eyes are blind;
   but these men saw the Infinite in the infant; the Godhead gleaming
   through the manhood; the glory hiding beneath the swaddling bands.
   Undoubtedly there was a spiritual splendor about this matchless child!
   We read that Moses' father and mother saw that he was a "goodly child";
   they saw he was "fair unto God," says the original. But when these
   elect men saw that holy thing which is called the Son of the Highest,
   they discovered in him a glory all unknown before. Then was his star in
   the ascendant to them: he became their all in all, and they worshipped
   with all their hearts. Have you discovered such glory in Christ? "Oh!"
   says one, "you are always harping upon Christ and his glory. You are a
   man of one idea!" Precisely so. My one idea is that he is "altogether
   lovely," and that there is nothing out of heaven nor in heaven that can
   be compared with him even in his lowest and weakest estate. Have you
   ever seen as much as that in Jesus? If so, you are the Lord's; go you,
   and rejoice in him. If not, pray God to open your eyes until, like the
   wise men, you see and worship.

   Lastly, learn from these wise men that when they worshipped they did
   not permit it to be a mere empty-handed adoration. Ask yourself, "What
   shall I render unto the Lord?" Bowing before the young child, they
   offered "gold, frankincense and myrrh," the best of metals and the best
   of spices; an offering to the King of gold; an offering to the priest
   of frankincense; an offering to the child of myrrh. Wise men are
   liberal men. Consecration is the best education. To-day it is thought
   to be wise to be always receiving; but the Savior said, "It is more
   blessed to give than to receive." God judges our hearts by that which
   spontaneously comes from them: hence the sweet cane bought with money
   is acceptable to him when given freely. He doth not tax his saints or
   weary them with incense; but he delights to see in them that true love
   which cannot express itself in mere words, but must use gold and myrrh,
   works of love and deeds of self-denial, to be the emblems of its
   gratitude. Brothers, you will never get into the heart of happiness
   till you become unselfish and generous; you have but chewed the husks
   of religion which are often bitter, you have never eaten of the sweet
   kernel until you have felt the love of God constraining you to make
   sacrifice. There is nothing in the true believer's power which he would
   not do for his Lord: nothing in our substance which we would not give
   to him, nothing in ourselves which we would not devote to his service.

   God give to you all grace to come to Jesus, even though it be by the
   starlight of this Sermon, for his love's sake! Amen.

                        Supposing Him to be the Gardener

   A Sermon

   (No. 1699)

   Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, December 31st, 1882, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "Supposing him to be the gardener."--John 20:15.

   I WAS sitting about a fortnight ago in a very lovely garden, in the
   midst of all kinds of flowers which were blooming in delightful
   abundance all around. Screening myself from the heat of the sun under
   the overhanging boughs of an olive, I cast my eyes upon palms and
   bananas, roses and camellias, oranges and aloes, lavender and
   heliotrope. The garden was full of color and beauty, perfume and
   fruitfulness. Surely the gardener, whoever he might be, who had framed,
   and fashioned, and kept in order that lovely spot, deserved great
   commendation. So I thought, and then it came to me to meditate upon the
   church of God as a garden, and to suppose the Lord Jesus to be the
   gardener, and then to think of what would most assuredly happen if it
   were so. "Supposing him to be the gardener," my mind conceived of a
   paradise where all sweet things flourish and all evil things are rooted
   up. If an ordinary worker had produced such beauty as I then saw and
   enjoyed on earth, what beauty and glory must surely be brought forth
   "supposing him to be the gardener"! You know the "him" to whom we
   refer, the ever-blessed Son of God, whom Mary Magdalene in our text
   mistook for the gardener. We will for once follow a saint in her
   mistaken track; and yet we shall find ourselves going in a right way.
   She was mistaken when she fell into "supposing him to be the gardener";
   but if we are under his Spirit's teaching we shall not make a mistake
   if now we indulge ourselves in a quiet meditation upon our ever-blessed
   Lord, "supposing him to be the gardener."

   It is not an unnatural supposition, surely; for if we may truly sing

   "We are a garden walled around,

   Chosen and made peculiar ground,"

   that enclosure needs a gardener. Are we not all the plants of his right
   hand planting? Do we not all need watering and tending by his constant
   and gracious care? He says, "I am the true vine: my Father is the
   husbandman," and that is one view of it; but we may also sing, "My
   well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: and he fenced it,
   and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest
   vine"--that is to say, he acted as gardener to it. Thus has Isaiah
   taught us to sing a song of the Well-beloved touching his vineyard. We
   read of our Lord just now under these terms--"Thou that dwellest in the
   gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice." To what purpose does he
   dwell in the vineyards but that he may see how the vines flourish and
   care for all the plants? The image, I say, is so far from being
   unnatural that it is most pregnant with suggestions and full of useful
   teaching. We are not going against the harmonies of nature when we are
   "supposing him to be the gardener."

   Neither is the figure unscriptural; for in one of his own parables our
   Lord makes himself to be the dresser of the vineyard. We read just now
   that parable so full of warning. When the "certain man" came in and saw
   the fig tree that it brought forth no fruit, he said unto the dresser
   of his vineyard, "Cut it down: why cumbereth it the ground?" Who was it
   that intervened between that profitless tree and the axe but our great
   Intercessor and Interposer? He it is who continually comes forward with
   "Let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dung it." In
   this case he himself takes upon himself the character of the
   vine-dresser, and we are not wrong in "supposing him to be the
   gardener."

   If we would be supported by a type, our Lord takes the name of "the
   Second Adam," and the first Adam was a gardener. Moses tells us that
   the Lord God placed the man in the garden of Eden to dress it and to
   keep it. Man in his best estate was not to live in this world in a
   paradise of indolent luxury, but in a garden of recompensed toil.
   Behold, the church is Christ's Eden, watered by the river of life, and
   so fertilized that all manner of fruits are brought forth unto God; and
   he, our second Adam, walks in this spiritual Eden to dress it and to
   keep it; and so by a type we see that we are right in "supposing him to
   be the gardener." Thus also Solomon thought of him when he described
   the royal Bridegroom as going down with his spouse to the garden when
   the flowers appeared on the earth and the fig tree had put forth her
   green figs; he went out with his beloved for the preservation of the
   gardens, saying, "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the
   vines: for our vines have tender grapes." Neither nature, nor
   Scripture, nor type, nor song forbids us to think of our adorable Lord
   Jesus as one that careth for the flowers and fruits of his church. We
   err not when we speak of him, "supposing him to be the gardener." And
   so I sat me still, and indulged the suggested line of thought, which I
   now repeat in your hearing, hoping that I may open many roads of
   meditation for your hearts also. I shall not attempt to think out such
   a subject thoroughly, but only to indicate in which direction you may
   look for a vein of precious ore.

   I. "Supposing him to be the gardener," we have here THE KEY TO MANY
   WONDERS in the garden of his church.

   The first wonder is that there should be a church at all in the world;
   that there should be a garden blooming in the midst of this sterile
   waste. Upon a hard and flinty rock the Lord has made the Eden of his
   church to grow. How came it to be--here an oasis of life in a desert of
   death? how came faith in the midst of unbelief, and hope where all is
   servile fear, and love where hate abounds? "Ye are of God, little
   children, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one." Whence this
   being "of God" where all beside is fast shut up in the devil? How came
   there to be a people for God, separated, and sanctified, and
   consecrated, and ordained to bring forth fruit unto his name? Assuredly
   it could not have been so at all if the doing of it had been left to
   man. We understand its existence, "supposing him to be the gardener,"
   but nothing else can account for it. He can cause the fir tree to
   flourish instead of the thorn, and the myrtle instead of the briar; but
   no one else can accomplish such a change. The garden in which I sat was
   made on the bare face of the rock, and almost all the earth of which
   its terraces were composed had been brought up there, from the shore
   below, by hard labor, and so upon the rock a soil had been created. It
   was not by its own nature that the garden was found in such a place;
   but by skill and labor it had been formed: even so the church of God
   has had to be constructed by the Lord Jesus, who is the author as well
   as the perfecter of his garden. Painfully, with wounded hands, has he
   built each terrace, and fashioned each bed, and planted each plant. All
   the flowers have had to be watered with his bloody sweat, and watched
   by his tearful eyes the nail-prints in his hands, and the wound in his
   side are the tokens of what it cost him to make a new Paradise. He has
   given his life for the life of every plant that is in the garden, and
   not one of them had been there on any other theory than "supposing him
   to be the gardener."

   Besides, there is another wonder. How comes the church of God to
   flourish in such a clime? This present evil world is very uncongenial
   to the growth of grace, and the church is not able by herself alone to
   resist the evil influences which surround her. The church contains
   within itself elements which tend to its own disorder and destruction
   if left alone; even as the garden has present in its soil all the germs
   of a tangled thicket of weeds. The best church that ever Christ had on
   earth would within a few years apostatise from the truth if deserted by
   the Spirit of God. The world never helps the church; it is all in arms
   against it; there is nothing in the world's air or soil that can
   fertilise the church even to the least degree. How is it, then, that
   notwithstanding all this, the church is a fair garden unto God, and
   there are sweet spices grown in its beds, and lovely flowers are
   gathered by the Divine hand from its borders? The continuance and
   prosperity of the church can only be accounted for by "supposing him to
   be the gardener." Almighty strength is put to the otherwise impossible
   work of sustaining a holy people among men; almighty wisdom exercises
   itself upon this otherwise insuperable difficulty. Hear ye the word of
   the Lord, and learn hence the reason for the growth of his church
   below. "I, the Lord, do keep it: I will water it every moment; lest any
   hurt it, I will keep it night and day." That is the reason for the
   existence of a spiritual people still in the midst of a godless and
   perverse generation. This is the reason for an election of grace in the
   midst of surrounding vice, and worldliness, and unbelief. "Supposing
   him to be the gardener," I can see why there should be fruitfulness,
   and beauty, and sweetness even in the center of the wilderness of sin.

   Another mystery is also cleared up by this supposition. The wonder is
   that ever you and I should have been placed among the plants of the
   Lord. Why are we allowed to grow in the garden of his grace? Why me,
   Lord? Why me? How is it that we have been kept there, and borne with in
   our barrenness, when he might long ago have said, "Cut it down: why
   cumbereth it the ground?" Who else would have borne with such
   waywardness as ours? Who could have manifested such infinite patience?
   Who could have tended us with such care, and when the care was so
   ill-rewarded who would have renewed it so long from day to day, and
   persisted in designs of boundless love? Who could have done more for
   his vineyard? who could or would have done so much? An mere man would
   have repented of his good intent, provoked by our ingratitude. None but
   God could have had patience with some of us! That we have not long ago
   been slipped off as fruitless branches of the vine; that we are left
   still upon the stem, in the hope that we may ultimately bring forth
   fruit, is a great marvel. I know not how it is that we have been
   spared, except upon this ground--"supposing him to be the
   gardener"--for Jesus is all gentleness and grace, so slow with his
   knife, so tardy with his axe, so hopeful if we do but show a bud or
   two, or, perchance, yield a little sour berry--so hopeful, I say, that
   these may be hopeful prognostics of something better by-and-by.
   Infinite patience! Immeasurable longsuffering! where are ye to be found
   save in the breast of the Well-beloved? Surely the hoe has spared many
   of us simply and only because he who is meek and lowly in heart is the
   gardener.

   Dear friends, there is one mercy with regard to this church which I
   have often had to thank God for, namely, that evils should have been
   shut out for so long a time. During the period in which we have been
   together as pastor and people, and that is now some twenty-nine years,
   we have enjoyed uninterrupted prosperity, going from strength to
   strength in the work of the Lord. Alas! we have seen many other
   churches that were quite as hopeful as our own rent with strife,
   brought low by declension, or overthrown by heresy. I hope we have not
   been apt to judge their faults severely; but we must be thankful for
   our own deliverance from the evils which have afflicted them. I do not
   know how it is that we have been kept together in love, helped to
   abound in labor, and enabled to be firm in the faith, unless it be that
   special grace has watched over us. We are full of faults; we have
   nothing to boast of; and yet no church has been more divinely favored:
   I wonder that the blessing should have lasted so long, and I cannot
   make it out except when I fall into "supposing him to be the gardener."
   I cannot trace our prosperity to the pastor, certainly; nor even to my
   beloved friends the elders and deacons, nor even to the best of you
   with your fervent love and holy zeal. I think it must be that Jesus has
   been the gardener, and he has shut the gate when I am afraid I have
   left it open; and he has driven out the wild boar of the wood just when
   he had entered to root up the weaker plants. He must have been about at
   nights to keep off the prowling thieves, and he must have been here,
   too, in the noontide heat to guard those of you who have prospered in
   worldly goods, from the glare of too bright a sun. Yes, he has been
   with us, blessed be his name! Hence all this peace, and unity, and
   enthusiasm. May we never grieve him so that he shall turn away from us;
   but rather let us entreat him, saying, "Abide with us. Thou that
   dwellest in the gardens, let this be one of the gardens in which thou
   dost deign to dwell until the day break and the shadows flea away."
   Thus our supposition is a key to many wonders.

   II. Let your imaginations run along with mine while I say that
   "supposing him to be the gardener" should be A SPUR TO MANY DUTIES.

   One of the duties of a Christian is joy. That is a blessed religion
   which among its precepts commands men to be happy. When joy becomes a
   duty, who would wish to neglect it? Surely it must help every little
   plant to drink in the sunlight when it is whispered among the flowers
   that Jesus is the gardener. "Oh," you say, "I am such a little plant; I
   do not grow well; I do not put forth so much leafage, nor are there so
   many flowers on me as on many round about me!" It is quite right that
   you should think little of yourself: perhaps to droop your head is a
   part of your beauty: many flowers had not been half so lovely if they
   had not practiced the art of hanging their heads. But supposing him to
   be the gardener," then he is as much a gardener to you as he is to the
   most lordly palm in the whole domain. In the Mentone garden right
   before me grew the orange and the aloe, and others of the finer and
   more noticeable plants; but on a wall to my left grew common
   wallflowers and saxifrages, and tiny herbs such as we find on our own
   rocky places. Now, the gardener had cared for all of these, little as
   well as great; in fact, there were hundreds of specimens of the most
   insignificant growths all duly labelled and described. The smallest
   saxifrage could say, "He is my gardener just as surely as he is the
   gardener of the Gloire de Dijon or Mar'chal Neil." Oh feeble child of
   God, the Lord taketh care of you! Your heavenly Father feedeth ravens,
   and guides the flight of sparrows: should he not much more care for
   you, oh ye of little faith? Oh little plants, you will grow rightly
   enough. Perhaps you are growing downward just now rather than upward.
   Remember that there are plants of which we value the underground root
   much more than we do the hull above ground. Perhaps it is not yours to
   grow very fast; you may be a slow-growing shrub by nature, and you
   would not be healthy if you were to run to wood. Anyhow, be this your
   joy, you are in the garden of the Lord, and, "supposing him to be the
   gardener," he will make the best of you. You cannot be in better hands.

   Another duty is that of valuing the Lord's presence, and praying for
   it. We ought whenever the Sabbath morning dawns to pray our
   Well-beloved to come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruits. What
   can we do without him? All day long our cry should go up to him, "O
   Lord, behold and visit this vine, and the vineyard which thy right hand
   has planted." We ought to agonize with him that he would come and
   manifest himself to us as he does not unto the world. For what is a
   garden if the gardener never comes near it? What is the difference
   between it and the wilderness if he to whom it belongs never lifts up
   spade or pruning-hook upon it? So that it is our necessity that we have
   Christ with us, "supposing him to be the gardener;" and it is our bliss
   that we have Christ walking between our beds and borders, watching
   every plant, training, tending, maturing all. "Supposing him to be the
   gardener," it is well, for from him is our fruit found. Divided from
   him we are nothing; only as he watches over us can we bring, forth
   fruit. Let us have done with confidence in man, let us forego all
   attempts to supply facts of his spiritual presence by routine or rant,
   ritualism or rowdyism; but let us pray our Lord to be ever present with
   us, and by that presence to make our garden grow.

   "Supposing him to be the gardener," there is another duty, and that is,
   let each one of us yield himself up entirely to him. A plant does not
   know how it ought to be treated; it knows not when it should be watered
   or when it should be kept dry: a fruit-tree is no judge of when it
   needs to be pruned, or digged, or dunged. The wit and wisdom of the
   garden lieth not in the flowers and shrubs, but in the gardener. Now,
   then, if you and I are here to-day with any self-will and carnal
   judgment about us, let us seek to lay it all aside that we may be
   absolutely at our Lord's disposal. You might not be willing to put
   yourself implicitly into the hand of any mere man (pity that you
   should); but, surely, thou plant of the Lord's right-hand planting,
   thou mayest put thyself without a question into his dear hand. "
   Supposing him to be the gardener," thou mayest well say, "I would
   neither have will, nor wish, nor wit, nor whim, nor way, but I would be
   as nothing in the gardener's hands, that he may be to me my wisdom and
   my all. Here, kind gardener, thy poor plant bows itself to thy hand;
   train me as thou wilt. Depend upon it, happiness lives next door to the
   spirit of complete acquiescence in the will of God, and it will be easy
   to exercise that perfect acquiescence when we suppose the Lord Jesus to
   be the gardener. If the Lord hath done it; what has a saint to say? Oh
   thou afflicted one, the Lord hath done it: wouldest thou have it
   otherwise? Nay, art thou not thankful that it is even so, because so is
   the will of him in whose hand thy life is, and whose are all thy ways?
   The duty of submission is very plain, "supposing him to be the
   gardener."

   One more duty I would mention, though others suggest themselves.
   "Supposing him to be the gardener," then let us bring forth fruit to
   him. I do not address a people this morning who feel no care as to
   whether they serve God or not. I believe that most of you do desire to
   glorify God; for being saved by grace, you feel a holy ambition to show
   forth his praises who has called you out of darkness into his
   marvellous light. You wish to bring others to Christ, because you
   yourselves have been brought to life and liberty in him. Now, let this
   be a stimulus to your fruitbearing, that Jesus is the gardener. Where
   you have brought forth a single cluster, bring, forth a hundred!
   "supposing him to be the gardener." If he is to have the honor of it,
   then labor to do that which will give him great renown. If our
   spiritual state were to be attributed to ourselves, or to our minister,
   or to some of our fellow Christians, we might not feel that we were
   tinder a great necessity to be fruitful; but if Jesus be the gardener,
   and is to bear the blame or the honor of what we produce, then let us
   use up every drop of sap and strain every fibre, that, to the utmost of
   which our manhood is capable, we may produce a fair reward for our
   Lord's travail. Under such tutorship and care we ought to become
   eminent scholars. Doth Christ train us? Oh let us never cause the world
   to think meanly of our Master. Students feel that their alma mater
   deserves great things of them, so they labor to make their university
   renowned. And so, since Jesus is tutor and university to us, let us
   feel that we are bound to reflect credit upon so great a teacher, upon
   so divine a name. I do not know how to put it, but surely we ought to
   do something worthy of such a Lord. Each little flower in the garden of
   the Lord should wear its, brightest hues, and poor forth its rarest
   perfume, because Jesus cares for it. The best of all possible good
   should be yielded by every plant in our Father's garden, supposing
   Jesus to the gardener.

   Thus much, then, on those two points--a key to many wonders, and a spur
   to many duties.

   III. Thirdly, I have found in this supposition A RELIEF FROM CRUSHING
   RESPONSIBILITY. One has a work given him of God to do, and if he does
   it rightly he cannot do it carelessly. The first thing when he wakes he
   asks, "How is the work prospering?" and the last thought at night is,
   "What can I do to fulfill my calling?" Sometimes the anxiety even
   troubles his dreams, and he sighs, "O Lord, send now prosperity!" How
   is the garden prospering which we are set to tend? Are we
   broken-hearted because, nothing appears to flourish? Is it a bad
   season? or is the soil lean and hungry? It is a very blessed relief to
   an excess of care if we can fall into the habit of "supposing him to be
   the gardener." If Jesus be the Master and Lord in all things it is not
   mine to keep all the church in order. I am not responsible for the
   growth of every Christian, nor for every backslider's errors, nor for
   every professor's faults of life. This burden must not lie on me so
   that I shall be crushed thereby. "Supposing him to be the gardener,"
   then, the church enjoys a better oversight than mine; better care is
   taken of the garden than could be taken by the most vigilant watchers,
   even though by night the frost devoured them, and by day the heat.
   "Supposing him to be the gardener," then all must go well in the long
   run. He that keepeth Israel doth neither slumber nor sleep; we need not
   fret and despond. I beg you earnest workers, who are becoming
   depressed, to think this out a little. You see it is yours to work
   under the Lord Jesus; but it is not yours to take the anxiety of his
   office into your souls as though you were to bear his burdens. The
   under-gardener, the work-man in the garden, needs not fret about the
   whole garden as though it were all left to him. No, no; let him not
   take too much upon himself. I pray you, bound your anxiety by the facts
   of the case. So you have a number of young people around you, and you
   are watching for their souls as they that must give account. This is
   well; but do not be worried and wearied; for, after all, the saving and
   the keeping of those souls is not in your hands, but it rests with One
   far more able than yourself. Just think that the Lord is the gardener.
   I know it is so in matters of providence. A certain man of God in
   troublous times became quite unable to do his duty because he laid to
   heart so much the ills of the age; he became depressed and disturbed,
   and he went on board a vessel, wanting to leave the country, which was
   getting into such a state that he could no longer endure it. Then one
   said to him, Mr. Whitelock, are you the manager of the world? No, he
   was not quite that. "Did not God get on pretty well with it before you
   were born, and don't you think he will do very well with it when you
   are dead?" That reflection helped to relieve the good man's mind, and
   he went back to do his duty. I want you thus to perceive the limit of
   your responsibility: you are not the gardener himself; you are only one
   of the gardener's boys, set to run on errands, or to do a bit of
   digging, or to sweep the paths. The garden is well enough managed even
   though you are not head manager in it.

   While this relieves us of anxiety it makes labor for Christ very sweet,
   because if the garden does not seem to repay us for our trouble we say
   to ourselves, "It is not, my garden after all. Supposing him to be the
   gardener,' I am quite willing to work on a barren piece of rock, or tie
   up an old withered bough, or dig a worthless sod; for, if it only
   pleases Jesus, the work is for that one sole reason profitable to the
   last degree. It is not mine to question the wisdom of my task, but to
   set about it in the name of my Master and Lord. Supposing him to be the
   gardener,' lifts the ponderous responsibility of it from me, and my
   work becomes pleasant and delightful."

   In dealing with the souls of men, we meet with cases which are
   extremely difficult. Some persons are so timid and fearful that you do
   not know how to comfort them; others are so fast and presumptuous that
   you hardly know how to help them. A few are so double-faced that you
   cannot understand them, and others so fickle that you cannot hold them.
   Some flowers puzzle the ordinary gardener: we meet with plants which
   are covered with prickles, and when you try to train them they wound
   the hand that would help them. These strange growths would make a great
   muddle for you if you were the gardener; but "supposing him to be the
   gardener," you have the happiness of being able to go to him
   constantly, saying, "Good Lord, I do not understand this singular
   creature; it is as odd a plant as I am myself. Oh, that thou wouldest
   manage it, or tell me how. I have come to tell thee of it."

   Constantly our trouble is that we have so many plants to look after
   that we have not time to cultivate any one in the best manner, because
   we have fifty more all wanting attention at the time; and then before
   we have done with the watering-pot we have to fetch the hoe and the
   rake and the spade, and we are puzzled with these multitudinous cares,
   even as Paul was when he said, "That which cometh upon me daily, the
   care of all the churches." Ah, then, it is a blessed thing to do the
   little we can do and leave the rest to Jesus, "supposing him to be the
   gardener."

   In the church of God there is a discipline which we cannot exercise. I
   do not think it is half so hard to exercise discipline as it is not to
   be able to exercise it when yet you feel that it ought to be done. The
   servants of the householder were perplexed when they might not root up
   the tares. "Didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? From whence then
   hath it tares?" "An enemy hath done this." "Wilt thou then that we go
   and gather them up?" "Not so," said he, "lest ye root, up the wheat
   with them." This afflicts the Christian minister when he must not
   remove a pestilent, hindering weed. Yes, but "supposing him to be the
   gardener," and it is his will to let that weed remain, what have you
   and I to do but to hold our peace? He has a discipline more sure and
   safe than ours, and in due time the tares shall know it. In patience
   let us possess our souls.

   And then, again, there is that succession in the garden which we can
   not keep up. Plants will die down, and others must be put into their
   places or the garden will grow bare, but we know not where to find
   these fresh flowers. We say, "When yonder good man dies who will
   succeed him?" That is a question I have heard many a time, till I am
   rather weary of it. Who is to follow such a man? Let us wait till he is
   gone and needs following. Why sell the man's coat when he can wear it
   himself? We are apt to think when this race of good brethren shalt die
   of it that none will arise worthy to unloose the latchets of their
   shoes. Well, friend, I could suppose a great many things, but this
   morning my text is, "Supposing him to be the gardener," and on that
   supposition I expect that the Lord has other plants in reserve which
   you have not yet, seen, and these wilt exactly fit into our places when
   they become empty, and the Lord will keep up the true apostolical
   succession till the day or his second advent. In every time of darkness
   and dismay, when the heart sinks and the spirits decline, and we think
   it is all over with the church of God, let us fall back on this,
   "Supposing him to be the gardener," and expect to see greater and
   better things than these. We are at the end of our wits, but he is not
   at the beginning of his yet: we are nonplussed, but he never will be;
   therefore let us wait and be tranquil, "supposing him to be the
   gardener."

   IV. Fourthly, I want you to notice that this supposition will give you
   A DELIVERANCE FROM MANY GLOOMY FEARS. I walked down the garden, and I
   saw a place where all the path was strewn with leaves and broken
   branches, and stones, and I saw the earth upon the flower-beds, tossed
   about, and roots lying quite out of the ground: all was in disorder.
   Had a dog been amusing himself? or had a mischievous child been at
   work? If so, it was a great pity. But no: in a minute or two I saw the
   gardener come back, and I perceived that he had been making all this
   disarrangement. He had been cutting, and digging, and hacking, and
   mess-making; and all for the good of the garden. It may be it has
   happened to some of you that you have been a good deal clipped lately,
   and in your domestic affairs things have not been in so fair a state as
   you could have wished: it may be in the Church we have seen ill weeds
   plucked up, and barren branches lopped, so that everything is en
   deshabille. Well, if the Lord has done it out, gloomy fears are idle.
   "Supposing him to he the gardener," all is well.

   As I was talking this over with my friend, I said to him--"Supposing
   him to be the gardener," then the serpent will have a bad time of it.
   Supposing Adam to be the gardener, then the serpent gets in and has a
   chat with his wife, and mischief comes of it; but supposing Jesus to be
   the gardener, woe to thee, serpent: there is a blow for thy head within
   half a minute if thou dost but show thyself within the boundary. So, if
   we are afraid that the devil should get in among us let us always in
   prayer entreat that there may be no space for the devil, because the
   Lord Jesus Christ fills all, and keeps out the adversary. Other
   creatures besides serpents intrude into gardens; caterpillars and
   palmerworms, and all sorts of destroying creatures are apt to devour
   our churches. How can we keep them out? The highest wall cannot exclude
   them: there is no protection except one, and that is, "supposing him to
   be the gardener." Thus it is written, "I will rebuke the devourer for
   your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither
   shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the
   Lord of hosts."

   I am sometimes troubled by the question, What if roots of bitterness
   should spring up among us to trouble us? We are all such fallible
   creatures, supposing some brother should permit the seed of discord to
   grow in his bosom, then there may be a sister in whose heart the seeds
   will also spring up, and from her they will fly to another sister, and
   be blown about till brethren and sisters are all bearing rue and
   wormwood in their hearts. Who is to prevent this? Only the Lord, Jesus
   by his Spirit. He can keep out this evil, "supposing him to be the
   gardener." The root which beareth wormwood will grow but little where
   Jesus is. Dwell with us, Lord, as a church and people: by thy Holy
   Spirit reside with us and in us, and never depart from us, and then no
   root of bitterness shall spring up to trouble us.

   Then comes another fear. Suppose the living waters of God's Spirit
   should not come to water the garden, what then? We cannot, make them
   flow, for the Spirit is a sovereign, and he flows where he pleases. Ah,
   but the Spirit of God will he in our garden, "supposing our Lord to be
   the gardener." There is no fear of our not being watered when Jesus
   undertakes to do it. "He will pour water on him that is thirsty, and
   floods upon the dry ground." But what if the sunlight of his love
   should not shine on the garden? If the fruits should never ripen, if
   there should be no peace, no joy in the Lord? That cannot happen
   "supposing him to be the gardener;" for his face is the sun, and his
   countenance scatters those health-giving beams, and nurturing warmths,
   and perfecting influences which are needful for maturing the saints in
   all the sweetness of grace to the glory of God. So, "supposing him to
   be the gardener" at this the close of the year, I fling away my doubts
   and fears, and invite you who bear the church upon your heart to do the
   same. It is all well with Christ's cause because it is in his own
   hands. He shall not fail nor be discouraged. The pleasure of the, Lord
   shall prosper in his hands.

   V. Fifthly, here is A WARNING FOR THE CARELESS, "supposing him to be
   the gardener." In this great congregation many are to the church what
   weeds are to a garden. They are not planted by God; they are not
   growing under his nurture, they are bringing forth no fruit to his
   glory. My dear friend, I have tried often to get at you, to impress
   you, but I cannot. Take heed; for one of these days, "supposing him to
   be the gardener," he will reach you, and you shall know what that word
   meaneth, "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath, not planted shall
   be rooted up." Take heed to yourselves, I pray.

   Others among us are like the branches of the vine which bear no fruit.
   We have often spoken very sharply to these, speaking honest truth in
   unmistakable language, and yet we have not touched their consciences.
   Ah, but "supposing him to be the gardener," he will fulfill that
   sentence: "Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away."
   He will get at you, if we cannot. Would God, ere this old year were
   quite dead, you would turn unto the Lord with full purpose of heart; so
   that instead of being a weed you might become a choice flower; that
   instead of a dry stick, you might be a sappy, fruit-bearing, branch of
   the vine. The Lord make it to be so; but if any here need the caution,
   I pray them to take it to heart at once. "Supposing him to be the
   gardener," there will be no escaping from his eye; there will be no
   deliverance from his hand. As "he will thoroughly purge his floor, and
   burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire," so he will thoroughly
   cleanse his garden and cast out every worthless thing.

   VI. Another set of thoughts may well arise as A QUIETUS TO THOSE WHO
   COMPLAIN, "Supposing him to be the gardener." Certain of us have been
   made to suffer much physical pain, which often bites into the spirits,
   and makes the heart to stoop: others have suffered heavy temporal
   losses, having had no success in business, but, on the contrary, having
   had to endure privation, perhaps even to penury. Are you ready to
   complain against the Lord for all this? I pray you, do not so. Take the
   supposition of the text into your mind this morning. The Lord has been
   pruning you sharply, cutting off your best boughs, and you seem to be
   like a thing despised that is constantly tormented with the knife. Yes,
   but "supposing him to be the gardener," suppose that your loving Lord
   has wrought it all, that from his own hand all your grief has come,
   every cut, and every gash, and every slip: does not this alter the
   case? Hath not the Lord done it? Well, then, if it be so, put your
   finger to your lip and be quiet, until you are able from your heart to
   say, "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the
   name of the Lord." I am persuaded that the Lord hath done nothing amiss
   to any one of his people; that no child of his can rightly complain
   that he has been whipped with too much severity; and that no one branch
   of the vine can truthfully declare that it has been pruned with too
   sharp an edge. No; what the Lord has done is the best that could have
   been done, the very thing that you and I, if we could have possessed
   infinite wisdom and love, would have wished to have done; therefore let
   us stop each thought of murmuring, and say, "The Lord hath done it,"
   and be glad.

   Especially I speak to those who have suffered bereavement. I can hardly
   express to you how strange I feel at this moment when my sermon revives
   a memory so sweet dashed with such exceeding bitterness. I sat with my
   friend and secretary in that garden some fifteen days ago, and we were
   then in perfect health, rejoicing in the goodness of the Lord. We
   returned home, and within five days I was smitten with disabling pain;
   and worse, far worse than that, he was called upon to lose his wife. We
   said to one another as we sat there reading the word of God and
   meditating, "How happy we are! Dare we think of being so happy? Must it
   not speedily end?" I little thought I should have to say for him,
   "Alas, my brother, thou art brought very low, for the delight of thine
   eyes is taken from thee." But here is our comfort: the Lord hath done
   it. The best rose in the garden is gone. Who has taken it? The gardener
   came this way and gathered it. He planted it and watched over it, and
   now he has taken it. Is not this most natural? Does anybody weep
   because of that? No; everybody knows that it is right, and according to
   the order of nature that he should come and gather the best in the
   garden. If you are sore troubled by the loss of your beloved, yet dry
   your grief by supposing him to be the gardener." Kiss the hand that has
   wrought you such grief? Brethren beloved, remember the next time the
   Lord comes to your part of the garden, and he may do so within the next
   week, he will only gather his own flowers, and would you prevent his
   doing so even if you could?

   VII. "Supposing him to be the gardener," then there is AN OUTLOOK FOR
   THE HOPEFUL. "Supposing him to be the gardener," then I expect to see
   in the garden where he works the best possible prosperity: I expect to
   see no flower dried up, no tree without fruit: I expect to see the
   richest, rarest fruit, with the daintiest bloom upon it, daily
   presented to the great Owner of the garden. Let us expect that in this
   church, and pray for it. oh, if we have but faith we shall see great
   things. It is our unbelief that straitens God. Let us believe great
   things from the work of Christ by his Spirit in the midst of his
   people's hearts, and we shall not be disappointed.

   "Supposing him to be the gardener," then, dear friends, we may expect
   divine intercourse of unspeakable preciousness. Go back to Eden for a
   minute. When Adam was the gardener, what happened? The Lord God walked
   in the garden in the cool of the day. But "supposing him to be the
   gardener," then we shall have the Lord God dwelling among us, and
   revealing himself in all the glory of his power, and the plenitude or
   his Fatherly heart; making us to know him, that we may be filled with
   all the fullness of God. What joy is this!

   One other thought. "Supposing him to be the gardener," and God to come
   and walk among the trees of the garden, then I expect he will remove
   the whole of the garden upward with himself to fairer skies; for he
   rose, and his people must rise with him. I expect a blessed
   transplantation of all these flowers below to a clearer atmosphere
   above, away from all this smoke and fog and damp, up where the sun is
   never clouded, where flowers never wither, where fruits never decay.
   Oh, the glory we shall then enjoy up yonder, on the hills of spices in
   the garden of God. "Supposing him to be the gardener" what a garden
   will he form above, and how shall you and I grow therein, developing
   beyond imagination." It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we
   know that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see
   him as he is." Since he is the author and finisher or our faith, to
   what perfection will he conduct us, and to what glory will he bring us!
   Oh, to be found in him! God grant we may be! To be plants in his
   garden, "Supposing him to be the gardener," is all the heaven we can
   desire.

A Monument for the Dead, and a Voice to the Living

   (No. 1700)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, January 7th, 1883, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [2]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the
   man which doeth those things shall live by them. But the righteousness
   which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who
   shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)
   Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again
   from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy
   mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
   that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
   believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
   shalt be saved." Romans 10:5-9.

   YOU see by this mourning that our church has been bereaved. I have lost
   a friend tender and true to me, and my heart is too full for utterance.
   [1] I scarcely knew what to preach from this morning; but at last I
   settled in my mind that I would raise a memorial to my departed friend
   by preaching a sermon which should be connected with himself. Therefore
   I cast about me, and I considered what subject he would wish me to
   preach from if he were sitting behind me this morning as he was last
   Lord's-day. I had no difficulty in answering that question. His life
   and death pointed in one direction. He was a man of rare common sense,
   straightforward and downright in his aims, and most pithy in his
   speech, with such a mixture of mother-wit that he might have been taken
   for John Ploughman's brother, as indeed he was. He cared nothing for
   oratory, which I have heard him call "a flash in the pan"; he delighted
   in the plain, solid gospel of Jesus Christ. I know that he would have
   said to me,Give them Christ crucified, and salvation by grace through
   faith, as plainly as ever you can; for when he was sore sick and in the
   very agony of death, he repeated as his dying creed

   "Nothing in my hand I bring:
   Simply to thy cross I cling."

   and in his own quaint way he added, "They may talk as much as ever they
   like, but the whole of it lies in Jack the Huckster's verse

   'I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all
   But Jesus Christ is my an in all.'"

   You will find that story in the first volume of my sermons. [2] In
   Park-street early in my ministry I told the story, and it did my friend
   good, and helped to rest his soul all those years ago, so that he
   remembered it and repeated it at the last. For his sake let me tell it
   again.

   This Huckster Jack was a poor, wicked fellow, who had gone about from
   village to village, swearing, drinking, huckstering and perhaps
   pilfering. Some thought him half-witted, but the story would show his
   wind to be sound enough. He heard a poor woman sing somewhere

   I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all;
   But Jesus Christ is my all in all."

   He remembered the words, and what was better, he felt their sense; and
   he kept on humming them to himself till God's good Spirit engraved them
   on his heart. There they were recorded, and Jack was a new man and a
   saved man. So he essayed to join himself unto the church, but the
   brethren looked suspiciously at him and enquired, "What is your
   experience?" He said he had no experience but this

   "I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all
   But Jesus Christ is my all in all."

   The good elders very properly asked, "Are you converted? Have you been
   born again?" and Jack replied, "I do not know much about these things;
   but this I do know and am sure of

   'I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all
   But Jesus Christ is my all in all.'

   They put him back for awhile, to try if he would grow in his knowledge,
   but he never went an inch beyond the first standard. He know what he
   did know, and to that he held fast

   "I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all
   But Jesus Christ is my all in all."

   Well, they must take him into the church; they could not well refuse a
   man with such a confession of faith; and when he was in the church,
   walking with the brethren, he was happier than the rest of them, at
   which they greatly marvelled, and one said to him, "Brother Jack, don't
   you sometimes feel doubts and fears? "Doubts," he said, "what do you
   mean? I never doubt that

   'I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all;'

   for I have daily proofs of it, and why should I doubt that

   'Jesus Christ is my all in all'?

   for he says he is, and I must believe him." "Ah, well," said one,
   "sometimes I enjoy good frames and feelings, and feel very happy, and
   then I lose them, and sink in spirit." Jack answered, "I never get
   lower than I am, for I am down at the bottom

   'A poor sinner, and nothing at all.'

   I cannot get lower than that, can I? But I am also at the top,

   'for Jesus Christ is my all in all,'

   and I cannot get higher than that, can I?" They tried him many ways
   with their blessed experience, of which you and I have got cart-loads,
   perhaps waggon-loads; but he could not be drawn out of his one firm
   position. They tried him with their various attainments, depressions,
   anxieties, quibbles, and questions; but still the huckster would not
   budge. He had bought the truth and would not sell it, and so he stuck
   to

   "I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all;
   But Jesus Christ is my all in all."

   The conies are a feeble folk, yet have they their habitations among the
   rocks: they are safe, but they keep to their hiding place.

   Of course our new Perfection brethren, spick and span saints as they
   are, are not like Jack, they are not "poor sinners, and nothing at
   all," and I am afraid lest some of them should find out that Jesus
   Christ is not their all in all. But if you and I are as he was, "poor
   sinners, and nothing at all," we may, with firm and resolute grip, lay
   hold upon the other line, "But Jesus Christ is my all in all." Christ's
   fullness is meant for our emptiness; Christ's righteousness is meant
   for our sin, salvation is for the lost. When you and I are no longer
   sinners, Christ is no longer our Savior; when you and I no more need
   him, then we shall not have him. Our need is our warrant, and if that
   be gone, all is gone. Jesus did not bleed and die to be a superfluity
   to us: he cattle to meet a grim necessity. As long as we are nothing
   Christ is our all in all; we may be sure of that, and that is just the
   gospel in a nutshell. I want to preach that same gospel this morning,
   in the hope that in after days this word may be scattered far and wide,
   and some Jack the Huckster, or some other like him, may find himself to
   be utterly empty and undone, and may then know that Christ is ordained
   to be his salvation. Jesus came into the world to save real sinners,
   not sham sinners; for he is a real, and not a pretended Savior. He
   saves those who are always confessors of sin, always needy in
   themselves, and therefore always glad of him. Even in their best estate
   the saved ones need their Lord: even if we walk in the light as God is
   in the light, and have fellowship with him, we still sin, and still the
   blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.

   I now plunge into my text. Notice, first, what Moses said. Moses said,
   "That the man which doeth those things shall live by them." Next, what
   the gospel says: "But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on
   this wise," and so on. Thirdly, we shall consider what the Scripture
   saith: "Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed." Then,
   fourthly, we will hear what experience saith; for we may bring in the
   experience of believers to back up the declarations of God.

   I. I invite your earnest attention to the first pointWHAT MOSES SAITH:
   "Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man
   which doeth those things shall live by them." This is a clear
   statement. There is no mystery or obscurity about it. You need not go
   to the universities and earn a degree of D.D. in order to understand
   this declaration: it is as plain as words can make it. If you wish to
   be saved by the law you must do its commands and you shall live. The
   law is written in the ten commandments; you know them; and if you
   desire to live by them you must keep them. It will not suffice for you
   to learn those commands by heart, or to write them up in your churches,
   or to read them over and say, "Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline
   our hearts to keep this law": all that may be well enough, but it is
   not to the point. If you are to be saved by the commandments you must
   do them: that is clear. Moses does not allow any person to dream that
   under the law he can be saved in any other way than by perfect
   obedience thereto. "For not the hearers of the law are just before God,
   but the doers of the law shall be justified." Whatever it is that God
   has commanded, you must do; whatever he forbids, you must avoid; for by
   such obedience alone can you live.

   Mark you, Moses does not tone down the law to suit our fallen state, or
   talk of our doing our best and God's being satisfied with our imperfect
   obedience. No, he says only, "He that doeth those things shall live by
   them." He demands perfect and entire obedience, if life is to come of
   it. He does not say that if you have broken the law you may still live
   by some other means. No, if the law is once broken it is all over with
   you as to salvation thereby: one single fault takes away the
   possibility of your ever being justified by the law. "He that doeth
   those things," that is, always, without exception, with all his heart
   and soul and strength"he shall live by them"; but nobody else. Be he
   Jew or be he Gentile, his only righteousness by law must come through
   the doing of the law. Moses says nothing about wearing phylacteries, or
   washing hands, or offering incense, or performing ceremonies in order
   to righteousness. No; clear, straight, cutting like a sharp razor, he
   puts before us the single sentence, "He that doeth those things shall
   live by them."

   Judge ye whether any one of us has fulfilled the whole law. To my mind
   this word of Moses is conclusive that none of us can possibly live by
   the works of the law. We cannot keep the law now, for we have already
   broken it: the vase is fractured, and to talk of keeping it entire is
   nonsense. But even if it were not already broken, should we get through
   to-morrow with its temptations, bearing such a heart as we have within
   us, without breaking that perfect and spotless law? I am sure we should
   not. You that hope to be saved by your works are indulging a forlorn
   hope; what never you may do or be in the future, the past has already
   ruined you. The way to heaven up the steep sides of Sinai is
   inaccessible to trembling feet like ours. If you were to be saved by
   the law you should have begun without sin, continued without sin, and
   then it would be needful to end without sin. There would not be a
   moment of your life in which you could be at peace, for there would
   always be the fear that in some unguarded instant you would transgress,
   and lose all. But why talk I so? It is no longer in our power to dream
   of a perfect, life-long obedience. We went astray from the womb,
   speaking lies; we were rebellious to our parents in our childhood, and
   wayward in our youth; in our early manhood we were carried about with
   this passion and with that, and since then all kinds of evils have led
   us astray. We are as full of evil as an egg is full of meat, and our
   heart is like a cage of unclean birds. I can say no less. The hope of
   salvation by works is black despair; yet we have a set of men on the
   face of the earth who are always wanting us to preach up this hopeless
   hope, and urging us to lay this heavy burden upon the shoulders of
   dying men. They would have us proclaim salvation by the works of the
   law. This, they say, would at least make men moral and keep them sober:
   whereas even in this they err against the light; for it has been proved
   by history that such preaching makes men worse and worse. The idea of
   salvation by works sits like an awful incubus upon the breast of
   humanity, and presses out of the soul all hope, thus robbing man of
   strength to attempt true holiness. When a man has lost all hope he
   throws the reins upon his neck and runs into all manner of iniquity,
   judging that he may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.

   Clear, then, as possible it must be to every man among us who will
   think, that if the only way of salvation by the works of the law is by
   the keeping of the law in its entirety, then that road is closed
   against us, and the sooner we have done with it the better; for then we
   shall turn our thoughts in the right direction, and travel on the way
   which the Lord in great mercy has prepared for us. This is what Moses
   saith: hear it and be humbled.

   II. Now I ask you to listen to WHAT THE GOSPEL SAITH. "The
   righteousness which is of faith," or believing, "speaketh on this wise,
   Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring,
   Christ down from above:) or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is,
   to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is
   nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of
   faith, which we preach; that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
   Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him
   from the dead, thou shalt be saved."

   Now observe, first, that the gospel claims to be like the law in its
   clearness. Moses claimed for the law which God had given to the people
   through him that it was clear, and within the range of their knowledge
   and understanding. I will read his exact words to you. Turn to
   Deuteronomy 30:11. "For this commandment which I command thee this day,
   it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven,
   that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it
   unto us, that we may bear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea,
   that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it
   unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the word is very nigh unto
   thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it." Now Paul
   here very adroitly takes these words out of the mouth of Moses, alters
   them somewhat, and as good as says, "It was the boast of the law that
   it was clear, known, and accessible to the people; but much more is
   this the glory of the gospel." Did not I show you just now that when
   Moses spoke he did not mystify the matter, but put it plainly, "The man
   that doeth those things shall live by them." So also the gospel by no
   means involves itself in obscurity, but says, Believe and live, quite
   as distinctly as Moses said, "Do and live." Here you have it, "Believe
   in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Moses' utterance
   was single and by itself. He did not say, "Do and thou shalt live, and
   yet there is another way." No; under the law it was nothing but "Do and
   live; leave undone and die." So the gospel does not propose a second
   way, and suggest "a larger hope," but it declares with solemn decision,
   "He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
   believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." It is just as
   clear as ever the law was, and quite as sharply distinct. Herein is no
   mystery: Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, and
   whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.
   Wrapping everything up into one, the gospel says, "Trust thou in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and thy sins shall be forgiven thee, and thou shalt
   be saved." This believing, or trusting, is the whole of the matter, and
   neither heaven above nor the abyss beneath will ever reveal another
   salvation.

   I want to call your special attention to the fact that Paul borrows the
   words of Moses; for his intent was the ending of all fears. No man
   among us doubts that if he had performed the law of God the Lord would
   give him life; but it is equally certain that if we have believed in
   the Lord Jesus Christ we have eternal lire. No trembling sinner doubts
   but that by the breaking of the law we are condemned: be you equally
   sure of it, that by not believing you are condemned. As no keeper of
   the law would have been lost on any ground whatever, so no believer in
   Christ shall be lost on any ground whatever; as no breaker of the law
   could escape punishment, so no unbeliever in Christ can he saved. The
   gospel states its message as clearly as the law. As positively as the
   law utters its promise and threat, so positively and unalterably doth
   the gospel deliver its decree. The believer in Jesus shall be saved
   because he is a believer; and Christ's veracity is staked
   thereon:"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
   everlasting life."

   Oh, but this is a very blessed thing to have to say to you. I do not
   come to-day with a gospel veiled in mystery and shrouded in doubt; I do
   not bring a message which you cannot understand or receive; neither do
   I come with "ifs" and "buts" and "peradventures," but with this,
   "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." "He
   that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." "Whosoever believeth in
   him hath everlasting life." This is as certain and clear as the
   utterance of that dreadful roll of thunder which has just now left on
   your minds the thought, "He that doeth these things shall live by
   them."

   Let us go a little further. What saith the gospel? Why, next, it
   forbids the questions of despair. "The righteousness which is of faith
   speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into
   heaven? or, Who shall descend into the deep?" When a man is at length
   awakened to a sense of sin he cries, "I long to be saved! All that I
   have and all that I am I would give to escape from the righteous wrath
   of God. Sirs, what must I do to be saved? Surely it would need that I
   mount to heaven to own my sin, or dive to hell to bear its punishment.
   I want a righteousness which would need as much labor to produce as a
   climb to heaven would need; and I require an expiation for sin as great
   as though a man were plunged into the abyss itself, and there were made
   to suffer the divine anger. How is it possible that I can be saved?
   "This wail of despair takes many forms: one man puts it thus: "What
   doings can I perform by which I can be saved?

   'Could my zeal no respite know,
   Could my tears for ever flow,
   All for sin could not atone.'"

   Another, despairing of deliverance by his doings, runs upon his
   feelings, and cries, "If I am to be saved, surely I shall need to
   experience joys like those which are felt by spirits before the throne.
   If I had a sense of sin as deep as that of lost souls in hell, I could
   hope that I should be saved." Thus the second man looks to excitements
   and feelings just as the first looked to works and self-denials. Now,
   the gospel forbids us to dream in this fashion. Talk not thus. Say not
   even in thy heart that by these doings or feelings thou canst be saved.
   Perhaps thou wouldst be ashamed to say it with thy lips; but do not say
   it at all; do not say that the way to heaven is hard, or mysterious, or
   in any degree apart from the simple act of believing. Do not suppose
   that anything is wanted as to doings or feelings in order to complete
   the righteousness which is wrought out by the Lord Jesus, and imputed
   by God to the believer.

   Ah, then the heart foolishly cries, "I must know a great deal; as much
   as if I had been to heaven and seen for myself, or as if I had dived
   into the depths and made discoveries there." No, you must not: the
   gospel is simple; salvation is as plain as a pikestaff; familiar an
   homespun; easy as the A B C of your childhood. Say not in thine heart
   that thou must be educated, trained, and made into a scholar. No,
   confess yourself a sinner; trust in the sinner's Savior, and you are
   saved.

   "Ah, well," says one, "I know I must undergo a singular
   experience-either I must be carried right away to heaven with delirious
   delight, or be plunged into the waves of hell in frightful despair."
   No, my dear friend, do not say that even in your thought. The
   righteousness of faith lies not in dreams and visions, delusions or
   depressions: it lies only in reliance upon the work of Jesus finished
   for you. Go not to the loom to weave a righteousness. The garment is
   woven already; put it on; Christ gives it to you. Dig not into the
   bowels of the earth to find the gold of salvation. Christ holds it out
   to you: take it freely, and be rich for ever. So one of the first works
   of the gospel is silencing the questions of our unbelief.

   Next, this precious gospel translates these questions, and then answers
   them. Listen. A voice cries "Who shall ascend into heaven?" The gospel
   replies, if you did ascend to heaven what would you do there, without
   Christ, the anointed Savior? You say, "Who shall descend into the
   deep?" Listen, man. If you were to descend there, what would you do
   without him whom God has anointed to save? If you find him in it will
   not much matter where you find him, in heaven or in the deep, for he
   must be almighty everywhere. Now hearken. Thou sayest, "Who shall
   ascend into heaven?" the top and bottom of such an ascent must be, "to
   bring Christ down." Hear this! Jesus has come down: years ago be left
   the glories of his Father. Hast thou not heard the tale? Being Pure,
   blazing, glorious Godhead, "Light of lights, very God of very God," on
   a sudden they found him in a stable hanging on a woman's breast. Angels
   saw him and wondered. He came down, indeed, when he was born; and,
   being down so low as that, he descended to the carpenter's shop, to the
   weariness of the well's brink, and to a thirst which made him say,
   "Give me to drink." Lower than that, he descended to being "despised
   and rejected of men." he was Lord of heaven and earth, and yet they
   called him Beelzebub, and talked of him as a drunken man and a
   wine-bibber. Having descended all that length he went lower still.
   Listen,angels, you will not weary while I tell the story over againhe
   went into Gethsemane where he put on the crimson garment of his own
   bloody sweat; and then to Pilate's hall, where they did falsely accuse
   him, and spit on him, and scourge him, and make a jest of him; and then
   to that cross whereon they nailed him in his nakedness, so that he hung
   in agony, to die in fever and in thirst, till he cried, "It is
   finished." He descended into the grave, so that he dwelt among the
   dead! We know not how low he went, but we are told that "he descended
   into the lower parts of the earth." Oh, my bearer, our salvation lies
   in this! Not in our descending, but in Christ's descending our hope is
   to be found. Listen to it, lost ones; you need not climb to heaven:
   Christ has come down from heaven to you; and if you lie among the
   spiritually dead to-day, or think you do, he has come down to you, and
   you need not enquire bow you can go up to him. No prayers, or tears,
   are wanted to bring him down: he has already come and is near at hand.
   You asked, "Who shall descend into the deep?" Now listen. Here is your
   answer. You need not "bring up Christ again from the dead," for the
   Lord has risen indeed. His soul scarce descended among the shades
   before it quitted them for ever; that day he died he was in Paradise,
   and the thief was with him there as a trophy. Up also his body rose on
   the light of the third day; and he sojourned for forty days among his
   disciples. At the close of that period he rose into the air, ascending
   high. As they watched him rising higher, and yet higher, at last a
   cloud received him: he has gone up to the Father's throne, as the
   sinner's Savior: at the throne he stands to-day to intercede for
   sinners, and from that throne he bends to comfort those who come to
   him. Now, your hope lies wholly in what this Son of God did in his
   descent and ascent. God has brought him again from the dead and exalted
   him at his own right hand, and this is not for himself, but for all
   those who trust in him. His death is instead of the death of our souls:
   his life is the life of our spirits. Now, soul, thou hast nothing to do
   with asking vain questions; thou hast to accept the result of the
   Savior's actual performances. The saving work is done, done by him who
   was anointed of the Lord to do it. Look to him and salvation is thine.
   Thy salvation rests in Jesus, rest thou in Jesus. Throw thyself upon
   him now; even as a babe casts itself upon its mother's breast. Have
   done with every other confidence. What canst thou need more than to
   rely upon the Anointed of the Lord?

   Now, Paul declares, or rather the gospel speaking for itself declares,
   this word of life by faith in the risen Christ to be near us, that is,
   to be accessible to us. As your next door neighbor's house is not hard
   to get at, so neither is salvation by the gospel. It is nigh you; it is
   nigh you now: it will never be nigher than it is at this moment. You
   may now believe in Christ and live eternally. Difficulty there is none:
   only believe and thou art saved. It is not a mystical, obscure thing;
   it is near and familiar. Believe in Christ as you would believe in your
   friend: believe that he died for sinners, and trust in him for
   salvation. If God has made you feel yourself a sinner, then Christ is
   such a Savior as you need and you may have him at once: the only
   difficulty lies in the way being so easy that you can hardly think it
   can be so. Have done with doings, and feelings, and trust yourself with
   Christ. "The word is nigh thee." It is simple; indeed, so simple that
   people try to obscure it in order to understand it. It is such milk for
   babes that I have known people refuse such plain truth because they
   were not willing to be treated like little children. Just as I lean all
   my weight upon this rail so do I lean my soul wholly upon Christ. If
   what Christ has done will not save a sinner I am damned; for I have
   nothing else to depend upon; but if it will save, and sure I am that it
   will, I am saved as surely as Christ has risen from the dead. This is
   the substance of the matterChrist saves, and we trust. This is what
   that word of faith says, even the gospel which we preach. I am afraid
   we say a great deal at times which rather lumbers and cumbers the
   gospel than makes it clear. Perhaps I am doing the same this morning,
   but I do not mean to do it. I mean to let it stand out simply before
   you, that the incarnation, the life, the death, and the resurrection of
   Christ are the one foundation upon which we must depend for eternal
   salvation, and upon that alone; and if we do so depend we shall most
   assuredly be saved.

   Yet note, that Paul opens this up into two things. He says, "If thou
   shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine
   heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." So
   there must be confession with the mouth. Do not leave that out. Do not
   suppose that you can be a believer and conceal your faith. As I said
   the other day, Do not behave like a rat behind the wainscot, only
   daring to come out in the dark. That is not Christ's way. If you trust
   in him with your heart, trust him openly, and confess him with your
   mouth, owning that he is your Lord, and your Savior. He has put the two
   things together,"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved."
   The believing and the confession of that believing in God's own way are
   never to be separated, for "With the heart man believeth unto
   righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
   See ye well to this.

   III. Thirdly, let us consider, WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAITH; "Whosoever
   believeth on him shall not be ashamed." "Whosoever." Whatever man in
   all the world, throughout all the ages, shall come and trust himself on
   Christ shall never be ashamed of having done so. You, dear friend, down
   the aisle there, it you trust in Christ you shall never be ashamed of
   your hope. You, up there in the gallery, however guilty you may have
   been, or however moral you may have been, it matters not, if your one
   hope is in what Christ has done, you shall never turn round on your
   dying bed, and cry, "I made a mistake in trusting Christ." You know
   what Cardinal Bellarmine said: he was a great antagonist of Luther, and
   thought that we might trust in our works; but, looking it all over, he
   admitted that inasmuch as no man could be quite sure that he had done
   enough good works, it was perhaps best on the whole and safest to trust
   altogether to the blood and merits of Jesus Christ. I have always felt
   obliged to the Cardinal for that admission; because the best is good
   enough for me, and since trusting in Jesus is the safest, I intend to
   stick to it even to the end. There is really no other hope, for if you
   get a little bit of your own works put into the building, of your hope,
   you have just so much rotten timber in the fabric, and that rot will
   plague the whole house, and turn it into dust at the last. No man that
   rested in Christ, and Christ alone, ever was ashamed of his hope; and
   none ever shall be. There is sure ground here. The Rock of Ages never
   fails.

   What else does the Scripture say? It says that no man is forbidden to
   believe; "for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
   the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him." There
   never was a sinner yet to whom God said, "You must not trust my Son":
   on the contrary, it is written, "Him that cometh to me I will in no
   wise cast out." What about the doctrine of election? I need not speak
   about it this morning: I believe it, and rejoice in it: but it is not
   at all contrary to this precious truth. Read this verse, "All that the
   Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in
   no wise cast out." Whoever will in the whole world believe in Christ
   may do so; he is neither too old or too young, or too rich, or too
   poor, or too wicked, or too moral; if he will but trust Christ he shall
   be saved, and he is fully allowed and permitted, yea, commanded to
   believe and live.

   Once, again, though your faith should only be strong enough to lead you
   to pray, yet it shall save you, for "Whosoever shall call on the name
   of the Lord shall be saved." Suppose your faith cannot work miracles;
   never mind about miracles. Suppose you cannot walk on the sea, like
   Peter: never mind; you are not called to do it. Can your faith pray?
   Can it cry? Then call upon the Lord, and you shall be saved. Poor dear
   heart, if you can but trust Christ, even though the feeblest possible
   manifestation of it should be the only thing visible, namely, your
   calling upon God in prayer, it must and shall save you.

   IV. Now, I hope I have put it plainly. I have tried my best; and so I
   close by bidding you hear WHAT EXPERIENCE SAITH. What does experience
   say about believing in Christ! Experience says, and we are some of us
   here to say it, that it is the grandest way of living in the world. I
   assure you that I daily find the value of living by faith. In hours of
   dire distress and great heaviness of spirit, of which I know enough, I
   prove the power of faith in Jesus. Ah, my Lord, what should I do then
   if I could not as "a poor sinner, and nothing at all" find Christ to be
   my "all in all." Fair-weather sailors, who go out in their little
   painted perfection boats, are people who have had small temptation and
   little soul-trouble. They are generally gentlemen in good health, with
   regular incomes and sweet tempers, and so they soon reach their
   imaginary sinlessnessvain creatures that they are; but you never get
   any of that among the poor, suffering, tried people of God. In stormy
   weather our beauty and glory soon turn pale; when the devil meets us
   face to face, he cracks up our tinsel perfection with a blow. He laughs
   at all our comeliness, he knows that it is a hollow cheat, a vile sham.
   In the moments when the soul is in the lowest depths, faith is the only
   way to live. That mode of living which will do for the depths is safe
   for the heights.

   How blessed it is when a child of God has actually fallen into sin,God
   keep us so that we never may,but if guilt is on the soul, what is a
   poor creature to do? He can do nothing unless he has learned this
   precious truth, that he is nothing at all, and Jesus Christ is his all
   in all. Then he knows that Jesus will blot out his transgressions, and
   create in him a clean heart, and restore him to himself again, though
   now, like David, his sin is ever before him.

   Yes, and I find a self-denying, Christ-exalting faith to be good in
   times of jubilation and success. The only way to keep right and humble
   is to be nothing, and let Jesus be all in all. If God has blessed your
   ministry or other holy work, the devil whispers, "You are a pretty
   fellow; you have done wonders"; and up you will go if you are not
   steadied by the firm conviction that you may not glory, since you are
   nothing at all in yourself, and your sole help is in Jesus your Lord.
   When God gives you growth in grace and fruitfulness in good works it
   will be your safety to be as little as ever you were, and to trust in
   nothing but the work of the Lord. This blessed faith keeps men down
   when they are apt to go up, and up when otherwise they would be apt to
   go down. It is a holy balancing pole: we can walk the narrowest line
   with this in our hands, and fear no fall. Ourselves nothing, Christ
   everythingthat is it. Keep to it.

   Now as to the test of death. Does this sort of faith enable men to face
   death with courage? I have had almost thirty years among you, and God
   has been very gracious to us, so that we have lost very few
   comparatively by death; but now many are going home, and, according to
   the course of nature, many of our honored brethren and sisters will
   soon follow. As to those who have been called home, how have they died?
   I have the deep satisfaction of saying that when our dear brethren and
   sisters fall asleep they reflect honor upon the gospel which we have
   preached. Ask those who have seen them die. These dear ones at this
   hour look back upon me and say, "Go on: preach the same gospel to
   others; for we found it blessed truth to die upon." Look at our dear,
   departed brother, Mr. Higgs, the last who has crossed the stream. His
   sons and daughters will tell you that his death was sad to them, but
   not to him. He suffered agonizing pain, but his peace was as deep as
   the sea. He had no uncertainty; he was as sure of his safety as it it
   had been a matter of calculation by the rules of arithmetic. He knew
   whom he had believed, and knew what the Lord had done for him, and he
   could not see a weak point in it all. He spent the whole night in
   trying to cheer and comfort others: he had no trembling thought about
   himself. He did not say, "Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my
   friends, for the hand of the Lord hath touched me." No; he knew that
   Christ was the resurrection and the life, and he was ready to depart.
   He wished his beloved ones to go to their beds; and since they would
   stop with him, he desired them to sing." "What shall we sing?" "Sing"
   said he,

   "For ever with the Lord,
   Amen, so let it be."

   It is hard singing when your father is dying, but it was not hard to
   him. He bade them read that chapter, "Let not your hearts be troubled";
   and, as they read it, he did not take the verses, and apply them to
   himself. No, he directed the comfort to his dear wife, for she had
   greater need of it than he had his faith was firm. It was for her he
   cared, and for those about him as for himself, all was rest. One said
   somewhat roughly to him a fortnight before, "Don't be downhearted; you
   may got better yet." "Stop a minute," said he. "What do you mean? I
   have never been down-hearted at anything my life; certainly not at the
   thought of dying. If it was the Lord's will that I should die in the
   street at this moment, I would cheerfully go." He never said a word
   more than he felt; yet that was the style of man. God send us more like
   himmen to whom religion is for home consumption. Not a pretty toy for
   Sundays, but food to live upon; a common-sense hope; a blunt man's
   religion that he can carry into business. One reported to me the other
   day a word which cheered me much. An Italian gentleman, who has known
   me since I have been at Mentone, was asked, "Are you a Catholic?" "No,
   I am not." "Are you a Protestant?" I am not sure, for I know little
   about it." "What are you?" "I am of Mr. Spurgeon's religion, which
   makes people happy themselves, and causes them to do good to others." I
   thank God he could say that of my religion: it did this for my dear
   friendit made him a happy man, whose pleasure it was to please others:
   and now he has passed away in full sunlight into a still brighter noon.
   Amen, so let it be.

   The top and bottom of the matter is, "Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ." Be nothing; be nobody; and trust Him. Do not believe in
   yourself, but believe in Jesus. Have as many good works as you can cram
   into your life, but never tell anybody about them, or think anything of
   them. The best of them are but filthy rags: stow them all away in the
   coal-hole, and look to the merits of your Lord for salvation. Go to
   Jesus for everything. He says, "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
   in the fire, that thou may be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest
   be clothed." Take his counsel. As he whom we sorrow for today could die
   peacefully, and even merrily, so shall you and I if we rely on the same
   Savior. When our time comes to depart, we shall just step aside and
   say, "Good-bye, dear friends, awhile: we will meet again in the home of
   the blessed." I hear him say so at this moment; and I answer him, "Dear
   brother, we will be with you speedily."

Gladness For Sadness

   (No. 1701)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 14, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Make us glad according to the days in which You have afflicted us, and
   the years in which we have seen evil. Let Your work appear to Your
   servants, and Your glory to their children. And let the beauty of the
   Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands for us;
   yes, establish the work of our hands." Psalm 90:15-17.

   TO understand this Psalm, you must observe its black border. Remember
   the sorrows of Moses, the man of God, who saw a whole generation die in
   the wilderness and was, himself, denied admission to the promised land.
   The man, Moses, was greatly afflicted. I might almost call him, as far
   as his life in the wilderness was concerned, "a man of sorrows and
   acquainted with grief." He dug the desert till it became a cemetery,
   for he lived amid 40 years of funerals. This 90th Psalm is saturated
   with the griefs of a sentenced generation, by whom it could be truly
   said, "We are consumed by Your anger, and by Your wrath are we
   troubled."

   We have, in our own case, as a Church and people, a double black border
   to surround our text this morning, for death has despoiled us a second
   time. We were, last Wednesday, burying our honored deacon, William
   Higgs, and at the moment of our meeting for that solemn purpose,
   another greatly esteemed deacon, William Mills, (William Mills, Esq.,
   for many years a beloved deacon of the Church in the Metropolitan
   Tabernacle, was taken to his rest January 12th, 1883, at the age of
   sixty-two), was suddenly stricken down with paralysis, to linger for a
   few hours and then to breathe out his soul unto God. I shall not trust
   myself to speak about him, for this double loss has, to a great extent,
   unnerved me. But this I must say, that he was an experienced and mature
   Christian and, above all, a quiet, diligent, loving, gracious servant
   of our common Master, whose care was the poor of the Church, to whom he
   distributed our alms with discretion and tenderness.

   It was pleasant to hear from him the story of his Christian experience.
   His was a calm and lowly walk. Of late, being weakly, he was much at
   home and there the Psalms of David and the Morning and Evening Portions
   were his comfort. He was always a source of strength to his pastor and
   his Brothers and Sisters, always of great service to the Church, far
   more so than the mass of our people will ever know--but of late he
   ripened and mellowed into an unusual sweetness and spirituality. My
   last interview with him gave me a high idea of his thorough composure
   and his perfect preparedness to commune with the glorified host above.
   He is gone--gone happily and safely Home. He had no pain or struggle,
   but gradually melted into eternal life. To us who remain, one sorrow
   has succeeded another to keep our wound bleeding and smarting.

   How well did Moses pray, "Return, O Lord, how long? And let it repent
   You concerning Your servants." Oh that our God would no more put His
   hand into the bitter box, as Herbert calls it, but now change His
   dispensation and revive the spirit of His contrite ones! On our part,
   as we are made to sympathize with the man of God in this Psalm, so let
   us imitate his example. Like he in multiplied bereavements, let us be
   like he in Grace and faith! Observe that the first word of this painful
   Psalm is, "Lord, You have been our dwelling place," as if, touched by
   the rod, the sufferer remembered his Father. Will the hypocrite always
   call upon God? No, and when God deals roughly with him, he will kick
   against the pricks.

   But the child of God, when he is smitten, turns to the hand that smote
   him and cries, "Show me why You contend with me?" If foxes and wolves
   are prowling about, and the shepherd's dog appears, they fly here and
   there as far away as they can. But when the dog is sent after the
   sheep, he fetches them back to the shepherd. Trouble drives away the
   carnal man from his pretended religion, but it gathers the true sheep
   together and, being awakened and alarmed, they seek the

   Good Shepherd. The more of grief we feel, the more of Grace we
   need--and the nearer to our Comforter we come! Closer to God is the cry
   of the troubled saint!--

   "Nearer, my God, to Thee! Nearer to Thee! Even though it be a cross
   Thatraises me; Still all my cry shall be, Nearer, my God, to Thee!
   Nearer to Thee!"

   Observe, also, that this Psalm is "a prayer of Moses." The comfort of a
   child of God in the darkness is prayer. Adversity, blessed of the Holy
   Spirit, calls our attention to the promises. The promises quicken our
   faith. Faith betakes itself to prayer--God hears and answers our cry!
   This is the chain of a tried soul's experience. Brothers and Sisters,
   as we suffer tribulation, as we know the promise, let us immediately
   exercise faith and turn in prayer to God, for surely never did a man
   turn to God but the Lord also turned to Him! If we are set a-praying,
   we may depend upon it--the Lord is set on blessing! Blessings are on
   the way from Heaven--their shadow falls upon us even now!

   I desire, at this time, to stir you up to a joyful expectancy! These
   clouds mean rich, refreshing showers. These sharp frosts foretell heavy
   sheaves. The Lord, by the Divine Spirit, make the Words of our text to
   be our prayer this morning! May the Lord Jesus present our supplication
   to the Father. The petition seems to me to be, first, for proportionate
   glad-ness--"Make us glad according to the days in which You have
   afflicted us, and the years in which we have seen evil." And, secondly,
   our prayer is for peculiar gladness, a gladness which is described in
   the 16th and 17th verses--"Let Your work appear unto Your servants, and
   Your glory unto their children. And let the beauty of the Lord our God
   be upon us: and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish
   the work of our hands."

   I. First, then, beloved Friends, our prayer this morning as a Church
   and people should be for PROPORTIONATE GLADNESS--that our God, who has
   filled one scale with grief, would fill the other scale with Grace till
   they balance each other! Inasmuch as He has poured out of His vial,
   certain drops of wormwood, we pray Him to measure out the same quantity
   of the consolation of love, whereby our hearts shall be comforted. May
   our Covenant God, who has chastened us heavily, now revive us
   graciously!

   We begin here by noticing that evidently the prayer desires a gladness
   of the same origin as the sadness. The Psalm plainly ascribes the
   sadness to the Lord--"You turn man to destruction; and say, Return, you
   children of men." "We are consumed by Your anger, and by Your wrath are
   we troubled." God is seen in bereavements--death comes distinctly at
   His command--second causes are left behind. Since we have a distinct
   idea that the sadness comes from God, our text expresses an equally
   distinct desire that the gladness may come from God. We beg for Divine
   comfort under Divine chastening. The words of the prayer are eminently
   simple and childlike--"Make us glad."

   They seem to say, "Father! You have made us sad; now make us glad! You
   have saddened us grievously; now therefore, O Lord, most heartily
   rejoice us." The prayer as good as cries, "Lord, no one but Yourself
   can make us glad under such affliction, but You can bring us up from
   the lowest deep. The wound goes too near the heart for any human
   physician to heal us; but You can heal us even to the making of us
   glad!" The prayer is full of buoyant hope, for it does not merely say,
   "Comfort us; bear us up; keep our heads above water; prevent us from
   sinking in despair"--no, but--"Make us glad." Reverse our state: lift
   us up from the depths to the heights. "Make us glad!"

   I hear the music of hope drowning the discord of fear; the songs of a
   joyous faith rising above the mournful dirges of grief! The appeal is
   to only the Lord! Moses entreats Jehovah, Himself, to kindle the lamps
   of joy within the tabernacles of Israel. It is healthy sadness which
   the Lord sends and it is equally safe gladness which God gives! If we
   make ourselves merry, we may be mere mimics of mirth. If outward goods
   make us merry, we may be no better than the rich fool in the parable!
   But if our God makes us glad, we may take our fill of delight and fear
   no ill consequences! The wine of the Kingdom cheers, but never
   intoxicates! The bread of God strengthens, but never surfeits! Neither
   pride, nor worldliness, nor carelessness comes of feasting at the table
   of our God!

   Come, then, let us together breathe this prayer--"Make us glad!" Let us
   paraphrase the expression, thus, "Lord, You are the Maker of all
   things, make us glad! By Your Word You did make the light; make light
   for us! You will make new these worn-out skies and much-polluted earth;
   come, then, and make us new and restore unto us the joy of Your sal-

   vation!" The parallel lies much in the source to which both sadness and
   gladness are ascribed. Lord, make both our summers and our winters, our
   calms and our storms, for everything is good which comes from You, and
   it is our joy that our times are in Your hands.

   But now notice that a proportion is insisted upon--"Make us glad
   according to the days in which You have afflicted us, and the years in
   which we have seen evil." This is an original prayer, full of thought
   and hope. Truly, also, it is a philosophical prayer--one which is in
   accordance with the harmonies of Nature and consonant with all the ways
   of God. I have been told that on the Scot lakes, the depth of the lake
   is almost always the same as the height of the surrounding hills. And I
   think I have heard that the same is true of the great ocean--so that
   the greatest depth is probably the same as the greatest height.

   Doubtless, the law of equilibrium is manifest in a thousand ways. Take
   an instance in the adjustment of days and nights. A long night reigns
   over the north of Norway--in these wintry months they do not even see
   the sun! But mark and admire their summers--then the day banishes the
   light altogether and you may read your Bible by the light of the
   midnight sun! Long wintry nights find compensation in a perpetual
   summer day! There is a balance about the conditions of the peoples of
   differing lands. Each country has its drawbacks and its advantages. I
   believe it is so with the life of God's people--the Lord also maintains
   a balance in them. "As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
   consolation also abounds by Christ."

   The great Father permits some to be little in Israel, but they are none
   the less dear to Him for that! Such are like the minnow which swims a
   pool proportioned to its size--no great tempest sweeps over the tiny
   stream--its ruffles and its calms suit its little inhabitants. Another
   of God's children is made for great service. He may be compared to
   leviathan, for whom the ocean is prepared--with billows, tempests and
   hurricanes in due proportion. The great Architect draws everything to
   scale! While some lives are wisely arranged upon a small scale, others
   are fashioned for wider spheres and made to do business on the great
   waters! These have greater tribulations, but they also have greater
   consolations!

   God knows how to manage us all and we have, each one, a place in His
   thoughts. Wisdom allots each one his talent and his work--his strength
   and his trial. What would a sparrow do with an eagle's wings? Given the
   eagle's wings and the eagle's eyes, there must be a soaring up above
   the Alps, a companionship with winds and lightning! To the tiny
   hummingbird God appoints no flight into the upper air, but allots it
   flowers and sunshine nearer the ground. He knows the way of His people
   and His love is over all! The good Lord measures out the dark and the
   light in due proportions--and the result is life sad enough to be safe,
   and glad enough to be desirable!

   I do not believe that our mortal life is fitly set forth by the Thane's
   parable, when he said to the Saxon king, "Have you marked, O king, when
   you are sitting in your hall and the fires are lit, and the lamps are
   burning, how the sparrow comes flying out of the thick darkness, passes
   through the window, glides into the bright and cheerful light, and then
   flits out again into the darkness? Such is our life--an interval of
   light amidst a long darkness." It is not so! If a Believer flits out of
   the light, he glides into the light again! If we traverse a stretch of
   darkness, we may expect an equal breadth of brightness! If today we
   sail a stormy main, we may hop, tomorrow, that the sea will be as
   glass. We have our changes, but the preponderance of life is not to
   misery.

   Rainy days are many and yet, in the long run, they are outnumbered by
   the seasons of fair weather. God makes us glad according to the days in
   which He has afflicted us and the years in which we have seen evil! It
   may not be said of God's children that we are a wretched company.
   Though truly, if only in this life we had hope, we should be, of all
   men, most miserable. Yet, since that hope is sure, we are, of all men,
   the most happy! We shall not say, when life is ended here below, that
   it was an evil thing to have lived! We have the promise of the life
   that now is as well as of that which is to come! "Happy are you, O
   Israel," is for the present as well as for the future!

   God has blessed us and we are blessed--and it is not for us to speak as
   if the blessing were in vain. Now, if it is so, that our gladness and
   our sadness are balanced, let us accept them, by turns, with gratitude!
   Let us notice, further, that sorrow is the herald of joy. Did I not
   tell you but a few Sundays ago how I sat in health and strength and joy
   in the olive gardens, and said to my friend--

   "Should we expect some danger near When we perceive too much delight?"

   The apprehension was soon justified, as it has often been! But let us
   not forget the other side of this Truth of God--we may expect some
   mercy, near, when we are bowed with heaviest grief! Among the ashes of
   sorrow we shall find live coals of joy! Grief is God's usher of the
   black rod, sent to intimate that in the majesty of His Grace, the Lord
   is drawing near to us.

   There will be first, to us, even as there was to Israel, the sound of
   Egypt's chariots, the cry of her horsemen and a descent into the depths
   of the sea--and then shall come the far-resounding, never-forgotten
   shout of victory! The rage of Pharaoh, the darkness of the night and
   the march through the Red Sea must prepare the way for Miriam's timbrel
   and the loud refrain, "Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously; the horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea!" Israel
   must make bricks without straw before Moses shall come! If I had been a
   little child among the Israelites, I think I should have known, when
   father set the bitter herbs upon the table, that the lamb was roasting,
   somewhere, and would be set out, too. "With bitter herbs shall you eat
   it"--and so, if there are bitter herbs, the dainty dish is near!

   Job did not know, and he could not guess it, but in the light of Job's
   book we ought to know that the preparation for making a man twice as
   rich as he was before is to take away all that he has. Oftentimes, in
   building a bigger house, it is the way of wisdom to clear away the old
   building altogether. Keeping up the old structure is often an expensive
   economy--it is better to demolish it. Even so do I believe that the
   adversities of the saints are to their lasting profit by removing that
   which would bind greater prosperity. Troubles come clothed in black,
   but to the eyes of faith they carry silver trumpets and proclaim the
   approach of great mercies! God is hastening in the richness of His
   favor to bless His children! Sorrow is the outrider of joy!

   A step further and we have it thus--sorrow often prepares for joy. It
   might not be safe, dear Brother, that you should enjoy worldly
   prosperity at the outset of life. Your adversities in business are
   meant to teach you the worthless-ness of earthly things so that when
   you have them, you may not be tempted to make idols of them! I am
   persuaded that many men have been ruined by rising suddenly to fame and
   power! Had they, at first, been abused and trod down like mire in the
   streets, their spirits might have been hardened to endure that sharpest
   of all tests, namely, human honor-- for, "as the fining pot for silver,
   and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise." You are not ready
   yet, dear Brothers and Sisters, to bear the weight of an elevated
   superstructure--you must be dug out, first, and a deep foundation must
   be laid to bear a lofty building!

   In the spiritual life, God does not run us up with glittering virtues
   all of a sudden, but deep prostration of spirit and thorough
   humiliation prepare the under-courses! And then, afterwards, stone upon
   stone, as with rows of jewels, we are built up to be a palace for the
   indwelling of God! Sorrow furnishes the house for joy. The preparation
   for an eternal Heaven is temporary affliction. Jesus has gone to
   prepare Heaven for us, but He has left His Cross behind Him that the
   Holy Spirit may, by its means, prepare us for Heaven! You could not
   enjoy the rest of Paradise if you had not first known the labors of
   pilgrimage! You could not understand the boundless joy of Heaven if
   your hearts had not been enlarged by the endurance of tribulation! Let
   not this be forgotten, then--our troubles build a house and spread a
   table for our joys.

   Did you ever read of a Roman triumph? Have you ever stood upon the Via
   Sacra which led up to the Capitol? There, when the glad day was come,
   the people crowded all along the road. Every roof was loaded--the very
   chimney tops bore each a man, while along the sacred way the conqueror
   rode, drawn by white horses, amid the blast of trumpets and the
   thundering acclamations of myriads. What glory! What renown! Rome's
   millions did their best to crown their hero. But there had been to him
   full many a battle before that hour of pride! Victory needs conflict as
   its preface. The conqueror's scars are his truest decorations. His
   wounds are his best certificates of valor. Because he had been
   smothered with the dust and defiled with the blood of battle, the hero
   stood erect and all men paid him reverence.

   It must be so in the present condition of things. No man can wear the
   garland till he has first contended for it--

   "Surely we must fight if we would reign. Increase our courage, Lord!"
   The way to the crown is by the cross--the palm branch comes not to the
   idle hand--

   "The path of sorrow and that path, alone, Leads to the place where
   sorrow is unknown." Once again, let me say to you, dear Friends, there
   is such a connection between sorrow and joy that no saint ever has a
   sorrow but what it has a joy wrapped in it. It is a rough oyster, but a
   pearl lies within those shells if you will but look for it! Do not
   think I mock at grief by saying that it is the husk of joy. Far from
   it! I would console grief by asserting sol-

   emnly that within the black envelope of affliction there is a precious
   love token from God--you can be sure of that. We find the treasure of
   communion with Christ in the earthen vessel of sorrow. We ask to have
   fellowship with Jesus in His sufferings and we cannot do so unless we
   suffer. It is a joy to remember in our woe that by these things we are
   made like our Lord and conformed to His image! If there were only this
   comfort, it might suffice to sweeten every suffering!

   Beside this, there is generally, with sorrow, a manifestation of the
   Lord amid our weakness. I have known many forms of happiness, but I
   think, upon the whole, I consider the purest and sweetest to be that of
   fainting in weakness upon the breast of Jesus and dying into His life.
   "Oh to be nothing, nothing, only to lie at His feet!" To be as a lily
   broken off at the stalk and, therefore, taken up into His hands! This
   is unutterable happiness! The Lord's love to His poor and afflicted
   ones is most choice and tender. "He carries the lambs in His bosom."
   Favored feebleness to be thus laid in the Heaven of Jesus' bosom! I
   love to cower down under the Divine wings like a chick under the hen,
   finding myself by losing myself in God! I have found it precious to
   feel that no more strength is left with which to suffer and, therefore,
   I must die away into the Divine will!

   Certain is it that in every tribulation there are consolations, even as
   every night has its own stars. I am sure, dear Brothers and Sisters,
   you that grieve most, today, for the departed, possess a joy which
   outweighs your mourning--it is a great sorrow to lose a father, but it
   is a greater joy to know that your father is not really lost, but
   translated to the skies! It is a great grief to part with a true
   Brother and fellow laborer, but it is happiness to know that he is
   promoted to the peerage of the skies! We might, each one, say of our
   departed friend, "Let us go, that we may die with him." These good men
   have a head start on us--they are preferred before us--they have first
   seen the King in His beauty!

   One of them, at least, has reached his reward before his spiritual
   father--he who is my joy and crown is in Heaven before me! Verily,
   there are first that shall be last. Our hold on the invisible is
   strengthened by the departure of our Brothers and Sisters. We have more
   in Heaven to love, more fraternal meetings to anticipate and so we have
   new links with the eternal. Did I not say, truly, that every sorrow
   contains a joy?

   Once more, the day will come when all the sorrows of God's sending will
   be looked upon as joys. Hear this! By some strange alchemy, known only
   to "the King eternal, immortal, invisible," our sorrows shall be turned
   into joys! You see this in your own homes--I quote it because it is the
   Lord's own metaphor--a woman, when she is in travail, has sorrow
   because her hour is come. But soon she remembers no more her travail,
   for joy that a man is born into the world! Our troubles and travails
   are sharp, but they will all be forgotten in the joy that will come of
   them. Before we enter Heaven we shall thank God for most of our
   sorrows--and when we are once in Glory we shall thank Him for all of
   them!

   Perhaps in Heaven, among all the things which have happened to us that
   will excite our wonder and delight, our furnace experience and the
   hammer and the file will take the lead. Sorrow will contribute rich
   stanzas to our everlasting Psalm. Therefore comfort one another with
   these words and breathe the prayer, each one, today, "Make us glad
   accordingly to the days in which You have afflicted us, and the years
   in which we have seen evil." In each case may Divine Love weigh out the
   ingredients of a sanctified life according to the art of the
   apothecary, each one in due proportion!

   II. Bear with me while I come to the second part of my subject which I
   desire to make eminently practical. The gladness desired is also
   described--it is PECULIAR GLADNESS. The Psalmist wishes for a fourfold
   gladness--the first is gladness at the sight of God's Work.
   Notice--"YOUR work." There is always something cheering in God's work.
   Have you ever felt it so? I think you must have done so. When Mungo
   Park was cheered by that little bit of moss which he picked up in the
   wilderness, he was but comforted as many of us have been. The flowers
   of the garden, the wild beauties of the forest, the chance tufts by the
   roadside are all God's work and, therefore, breathe consolation to
   God's servants.

   Nature is kind--her stars speak light to our hearts! Her winds chase
   away our gloom and her waves flash with health for us. Nature is a fond
   stepmother to the Lord's children because she is, like ourselves, the
   work of the Lord. When we are in deep tribulation it is a sweet quietus
   to survey the handiwork of our Father in Heaven. His work in
   Providence, also, is often a consolation to us. Let us but see what God
   has done for His people and for ourselves in years past, and we are
   cheered! Trouble, itself, when we see it to be God's work, has lost its
   terror.

   A certain Persian nobleman found himself surrounded by soldiers who
   sought to take him prisoner. He drew his sword and fought right
   valiantly--and might have escaped had not one of the company said, "The
   king has sent us to convey you to himself." He sheathed his sword at
   once. Yes, we can contend against what we call a misfortune, but when

   we learn that the Lord has done it, our contest is ended, for we joy
   and rejoice in what the Lord does! Or, if we cannot get the length of
   rejoicing in it, we acquiesce to His will. This is our song--

   "I would not contend with Your will, Whatever that will may decree! But
   oh, may each trial I feel Unite me more fondly to Thee." Brothers and
   Sisters, the great comfort which this Church needs, now, is to see
   God's work in the midst of her revived and glorified. If the Lord will
   but come among us and save men. And if He will build up and edify His
   people and give them help to accomplish their holy service--this will
   be our richest possible comfort--"Let Your work appear unto Your
   servants." Lord, our Brothers and Sisters fade away! They go into the
   shadow land and we see them no more. But, oh, if we can see Your hand
   at work among us, we shall not be discouraged! We mourn the loss of our
   Brothers' work, but we will not be disheartened if we see Your work!
   May the Lord make you to see His work on your own hearts, dear Brothers
   and Sisters! May He make you to see His work in the congregation, in
   the Sunday school and everywhere throughout the world, bringing men to
   Himself--and you will find therein a sovereign balm for all your
   wounds.

   The next consolation is also a very rich one--gladness at the
   Revelation of God to our children--"And Your glory to their children."
   If our God will but make His glory to be seen by our children, what
   more can we ask? "I have no greater joy than this, that my children
   walk in the Truth of God." No better comfort can be found for bereaved
   mothers than to see their sons and daughters converted! There is a
   sorrow for those who have departed, but I could almost say, "Weep not
   for the dead, neither bewail them"--for there is a sharper grief, by
   far, and that is our anxiety for those who survive and yet are dead
   unto God!

   Did you ever see a chain gang of convicts marching to their labor? I
   could wish never to see the sad scene again. Suppose that among those
   convicts there was a boy of yours! Ah me! Ah me! It were better for you
   that he had never been born! But think of those who are prisoners in
   the chains of sin. Is there a boy or girl of yours in such bonds? Oh,
   then, I am sure you will pray the Lord to rescue you from so sharp a
   trial--and to set your sons and daughters free from the fetters of
   iniquity. Pray, each one of you, fervently, "O Lord, let Your glory as
   their Emancipator appear to my children and then do what You will."

   Did you ever visit a condemned cell? To peep through the gate and to
   see a man sitting there, condemned to die, is enough to make one faint!
   Suppose it were your boy! Suppose it were your husband! Suppose it were
   your brother! But listen--"He that believes not is condemned already."
   Pardon us, dear unconverted relatives, if we say that we feel more
   sorrow for you living than we do for our gracious ones who are dead,
   for yours is a terrible plight, to be, even now, sitting in the
   condemned cell--doomed to be taken out to execution before long unless
   Infinite Mercy shall grant a free pardon.

   What dreadful sights must meet the eyes upon a battlefield! If I see a
   man bleeding by a common cut, my heart is in my mouth and I cannot bear
   the sight! But what must it be to see men dismembered, disemboweled,
   writhing to and fro in the last agonies of death! What horror to walk
   among mounds of dead bodies and stumble at each stop over a human
   corpse! Yet, what is natural death compared with spiritual death? What
   terror to dwell in the same house with relatives who are dead while
   they live--dead unto God! The thought is full of anguish. If God will
   quicken our spiritually dead. If He will give life to those who are
   "free among the slain, as they that go down into the Pit," what a
   consolation we shall

   find!

   Did you see that alarming fire the other day? Did you hear of the hotel
   in flames--the one in which there were many guests in the upper
   story--and the flames had grasped the whole edifice, so that numbers
   perished? It must be dreadful to see persons at the upper windows of a
   burning house and to be powerless to rescue them. But if your child
   were there-- your boy, your girl, or if your husband or your wife were
   there, or even if anyone you knew were there--your grief would have a
   double sting about it and you would cry, "Lord, do what You will with
   me, but save those precious lives!" Remember, then, that your ungodly
   friends are in the same condition, and what greater mercy can God
   bestow upon you than for Him to make His glory to be seen by your
   children in their eternal salvation? Therefore I turn your thoughts to
   that prayer. May you breathe it now and may the Lord, for Christ's
   sake, answer it right speedily--

   "Let your glory appear unto our children."

   The third consolation which Moses here describes is gladness at beauty
   bestowed--"Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us." Sorrow mars
   the countenance and clothes the body with sackcloth. But if the Lord
   will come to us and adorn us with His beauty, then the stains of
   mourning will speedily disappear! Brothers and Sisters, what a beauty
   is this which the Lord gives--"the beauty of the Lord our God!" This
   comeliness is the beauty of His Grace, for our covenant God is the God
   of all Grace! If the Lord makes us to know that we are His, our faces
   shine. If He fills us with His life and love, then brightness flashes
   from the eyes and there is a Grace about every movement! This "beauty"
   means holiness, for holiness is the beauty of God!

   If the Holy Spirit works in you the beauty of holiness, you will rise
   superior to your afflictions. If this Church shall be made the holier
   by its bereavements, we shall gain much by our losses. This beauty of
   the Lord must surely mean His Presence with us. As the sun beautifies
   all things, so does God's Presence! When we know that Jesus is with us.
   When we feel that He is our Helper. When we bask in His love, when He
   abides with us in power--this is the beauty of the saints! If we have
   Christ in us, Christ with us, we can bear any amount of trouble!--

   "I can do all things, or can bear

   All suffering if my Lord is there." This beauty gives to the Believer
   an attractiveness in the eyes of men. They perceive that we have been
   with Jesus and they behold our faces shining like the faces of angels!
   It is a great thing when a Christian is so happy, so holy and so
   heavenly that he attracts others to Christ and people seek his company
   because they perceive that he has been in the company of the blessed
   Lord! God give you this, and if you have it, dear Friends, you may
   forget your sorrows--they are transfigured into joy!

   The last comfort that Moses speaks of is gladness at our own world
   being established--"Establish the work of our hands upon us; yes,
   establish the work of our hands." Do you notice the wonderful blending
   in the 15th and 17th verses? There it is, "Let Your work appear to Your
   servant." Here it is, "Let our work be established." Alas, I have heard
   divines rightly say that salvation is God's work and then they have
   harshly added that, in our preaching of the Gospel, we make it out to
   be our own work. Thus they speak hard things against us and their
   speech is not after the Lord's mind. Others, again, make out this work
   to be so much man's work that God is forgotten!

   Neither of these is correct--we must blend the two! To build up the
   Church and win souls for Jesus is, first of all, God's work and then
   our work! Why should a Christian work to win souls? Answer--because God
   works in him to win souls! Remember the verses--"Work out your
   salvation with fear and trembling." Why? "For it is God that works in
   you to will and to do of His good pleasure." God works to set us
   working--our work is the result of His work! Our work is often a very
   effectual means of comfort to us. On the battlefield of Gettysburg
   there had been a terrible fight and among the wounded lay a certain
   chaplain of the name of Eastman who had been seriously injured in the
   back by his horse falling upon him.

   The dark and dreary night came on and, as he lay in intense pain,
   unable to rise, he heard a voice at a little distance cry, "O God!" His
   interest was excited and he rolled himself over and over through pools
   of blood--and among the slain--till he reached the side of the dying
   man. And there they lay--talking of Jesus and His free salvation! The
   man expired in hope! And just then two soldiers came and told Eastman
   that a captain was dying a little further down the field and they must
   carry him there--so he was borne in anguish upon the work of mercy--and
   while the night wore on, he spoke of Jesus to many dying men. Could he
   have had a surer relief from his pain? I think not! Why, it seems to me
   that to lie there on his back with nothing to do but moan and groan
   would have been horrible! But in all his pain and anguish, to be
   carried about to proclaim mercy to dying men made the anguish of an
   injured back endurable! So is it when you miss a friend, or have lost
   property, or are heavy in spirit--you shall find your surest comfort in
   serving God with all your might.

   The text prays for our work that it may succeed--"Establish the work of
   our hands." Oh, if God will but prosper us in our work for Him, how
   happy we shall be! One day this week I had a great lift up out of deep
   distress when I was informed that a captain was here, last Sunday
   morning, and was so impressed that he found the Savior and made the
   fact known at one of the noonday Prayer Meetings, asking for himself
   that he might be kept faithful to his God. This is good. We do not
   always see our seed grow so quickly as that. It is wet weather just
   now, the damp of sorrow is on all things,

   and so the seed sown in tears is speedily reaped in joy! Is not this
   something to comfort us? Let us pray God to send us more of it, that by
   conversions our work may prosper.

   Then we pray that our work may be lasting--that is the chief point. I
   look forward to the future of this Church with prayerful, hopeful
   anxiety! I am not old--not very old at any rate--but I am not all that
   I was in my earlier days. And I mistrust whispers that soon things will
   decline. The other day a certain great preacher said that after a
   preacher had been for a while in a place, all the heroism, all the
   earnestness, all the fervor which characterizes new efforts would be
   gone. He said the best thing would be to disband the Church and let
   them begin, again, under a new leader. That may look like a practical
   idea, but I do not quite see it--nor does it commend itself, to me, as
   sound and true. If a Church is a man's work, it is dependent upon a
   man--and when he is gone, the best thing we can do with it is to let it
   dissolve!

   But I desire to see built up on this spot, by God's hand, a Church
   which will endure till the coming of the Lord! Though dear ones, who
   seemed to be pillars, are taken away, the Lord will find other pillars!
   And though just now there are breaches in Zion's wall, here and there,
   yet the wall shall again be repaired and not a broken place shall
   remain! If we may see this accomplished, we shall be abundantly
   comforted. "Establish the work of our hands for us; yes, establish the
   work of our hands." We belong to an established Church--established not
   by men, but by the Lord! This Church will flourish when you and I have
   passed into our rest.

   Meanwhile, I beg you to take a deep interest in it and do all you can
   for its prosperity. Make it more and more be the model of what a Church
   of Christ should be. I long that the Truth of God which I have preached
   may be established in all the earth. They say that Calvinism is at a
   great discount now--perhaps it is. Yet, to me, it seems that its Free
   Grace spirit is far more spread than ever and is quietly saturating all
   true evangelical preaching. If it is so, that the Doctrines of Grace
   are now despised, we still hope that we shall live to see them brought
   to the front, again! Or, if not, we shall leave behind such a testimony
   that, in years to come, the Gospel of the Grace of God will be read by
   thousands!

   At this time I beg for the loving help of you all, for the Church
   itself. Our institutions deserve your zeal, liberality and
   prayerfulness. But do not forget the old house at home, the mother of
   these efforts. The Church, itself, needs your love, your prayers, your
   help, your sustenance! I say this to you, my dear Friends, who have
   been with me long--be you this day what you were at first--be as knit
   together and as earnest as you were when you had a boy preacher to lead
   you and you loved him and helped him to do good service for the Lord.
   For nearly 30 years God has been with us--let us begin, again, from
   this date and see if we cannot complete the 30 years of blessing and,
   if the Lord permits us, let us add another 20 years to it and make up
   half-a-century of prosperity!

   Who knows? Only let us carefully watch the present and see that nothing
   declines. Let each one be eager to keep the sacred cause in a healthy
   condition. God will establish His work upon us from day to day--and
   this shall be our comfort. Keep everything in the best possible working
   order! Plead with the Holy Spirit to clothe us with His power. Maintain
   all forms of holy labor vigorously and sustain every fund by your
   spontaneous liberality. Never need pressing, but let each one enquire,
   "What can I do to keep the Church well supplied to God's glory?" I
   believe this is the way to Church comfort. God will comfort Zion; He
   will comfort all her waste places! But we must, each one, take pleasure
   in her stones and favor the dust thereof.

   Close up your ranks! Leave no empty spaces. Let every man stand closer
   to his fellow--and then--"Forward!" Forward to a fuller consecration
   and a braver faith in God! Forward to more Grace and higher holiness!
   And so shall we wipe away our tears and praise the name of the Lord!
   And He will remember us and, by a plenitude of blessing, make up to us
   all that we have lost. A blessing is coming! Be ready for it! Amen.

On Laying Foundations

   (No. 1702)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 21, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and not do the things which I say?
   Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings, and does them, I will show
   you whom he is like: he is like a man which built a house, and dug
   deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the
   stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it
   was founded upon a rock. But he that hears, and does not, is like a man
   that without a foundation built a house upon the earth; against which
   the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin
   of that house was great." Luke 6:46-49.

   THESE parables describe two classes of hearers, but they say nothing of
   those who are not hearers. Their position and prospects we must infer
   from what is said of hearers. Our Lord Jesus Christ has come into the
   world to tell us of the Father's love. And never man spoke as He spoke
   and yet there are many who refuse to hear Him. I do not mean those who
   are far away, to whom the name of Jesus is well-near unknown, but I
   mean persons in this land and especially in this great and
   highly-favored city who willfully refuse to hear Him whom God has
   anointed to bring tidings of salvation! Our Lord Jesus is proclaimed, I
   was about to say, upon the housetops in this city, for even in their
   music halls and theaters, Christ is preached to the multitude! And at
   the corners of our streets His banner is lifted up--and yet there are
   tens of thousands to whom the preaching of the Gospel is as music in
   the ears of a corpse!

   They shut their ears and will not hear, though the testimony is
   concerning God's own Son, eternal life and the way to escape from
   everlasting wrath! To their own best interests, to their eternal
   benefit, men are dead--nothing will secure their attention to their
   God. To what, then, are these men like? They may fitly be compared to
   the man who built no house whatever and remained homeless by day and
   without shelters by night. When worldly trouble comes like a storm,
   those persons who will not hear the Words of Jesus have no consolation
   to cheer them. When sickness comes, they have no joy of heart to
   sustain them under its pains. And when death, that most terrible of
   storms, beats upon them, they feel its full fury, but they cannot find
   a hiding place.

   They neglect the housing of their souls and when the hurricane of
   Almighty Wrath shall break forth in the world to come they will have no
   place of refuge. In vain will they call upon the rocks to fall upon
   them and the mountains to cover them! They shall be, in that day,
   without a shelter from the righteous wrath of the Most High. Alas, that
   any being who wears the image of man should be found in such a plight!
   Homeless wanderers in the day of tempest! How my soul grieves for them!
   Yet, what excuse will those men invent who have refused, even, to know
   the way of salvation? What excuse can the most tender heart make for
   them?

   Will they plead that they could not believe? Yet they may not say that
   they could not hear--and faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the
   Word of God! Oh my Friend, if the Word of God comes to you and you
   decline to hear it and, therefore, do not believe in Jesus, but die in
   your sins--what is this but soul-suicide? If a man dies of a disease
   when infallible medicine is to be had, must not his death lie at his
   own door? If a man perishes of hunger when bread is all around him and
   others feed to the full, but he will not have it, will any man pity
   him? Surely not a drop of pity will be yielded to a lost soul with
   which he may relieve the torment of his conscience, for all holy
   intelligences will perceive that the sinner chose his own destruction!

   This shall ever press upon the condemned conscience, "You knew the
   Gospel, but you did not attend to it: you knew that there was salvation
   and that Christ was the Savior, and that pardon was proclaimed to
   guilty men, but you would not afford time from your farm and from your
   merchandise, from your pleasures and from your sins, to learn how you

   could be saved. That which cost God so dearly, you treated as a
   trifle." Ah, my dear Friends, may none of you belong to the non-hearing
   class!

   It is not to such that I shall, this morning, address myself, and yet I
   could not enter upon my discourse without a word of loving
   expostulation with them. Let me part with them by quoting the warning
   Words of the Holy Spirit, "See that you refuse not Him that speaks. For
   if they escaped not who refused Him that spoke on earth, much more
   shall not we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaks from Heaven."
   Our earnest attention will now be given to those who are hearers of the
   Word of God and are somewhat affected by it. All hearers are builders
   of houses for their souls--they are, each one, doing something to set
   up a spiritual habitation.

   Some of these go a considerable distance in this house-building and
   even crown the structure by publicly confessing Christ. They say unto
   Him, "Lord, Lord!" They meet with His followers and join with them in
   reverence to the Master's name, but they do not obey the Lord. They
   hear Him, but they fail to do the things which He says. Therefore they
   are mistaken builders, who fail in the foundation, and make nothing
   sure except that their house will come down about their ears! Others
   there are, and we trust they will be found to be many among us, who are
   building rightly, building for eternity--constructing a dwelling place
   with a foundation of rock and walls of well-built stone--of which the
   Lord Christ is both Foundation and Cornerstone.

   I am anxious to speak, at this time, to those who are just beginning to
   build for eternity. I am indeed happy to know that there are many such
   among us. May the Holy Spirit bless this sermon to them!

   I. Our first subject will be A COMMON TEMPTATION WITH SPIRITUAL
   BUILDERS. A common temptation with hearers of the Word of God,
   according to the two parables before us, is to neglect foundation
   work--to get hurriedly over the first part of the business--and run up
   the building quickly. They are tempted to assume that all is done which
   is said to be done--to take it for granted that all is right which is
   hoped to be right and then to go on piling up the walls as rapidly as
   possible. The great temptation, I say, with young beginners in
   religious life, is to skimp on the foundation and treat those things
   lightly which are of the first importance.

   The same temptation comes to us throughout the whole of life, but to
   young beginners it is especially perilous. Satan would have them
   neglect the fundamental principles upon which their future hope and
   character are to rest, so that in a future trying hour, from need of a
   solid foundation, they may yield to evil and lose the whole of their
   life building. This temptation is all the more dangerous, first,
   because these young beginners have no experience. Even the most
   experienced child of God is often deceived--how much more the pilgrim
   who has but just entered the wicket gate! The tried saint sometimes
   mistakes that for a virtue which is only a gilded fault and he fancies
   that to be genuine which is mere counterfeit! How, then, without any
   experience, whatever, can the mere babe in Grace escape deception
   unless he is graciously preserved?

   Newly awakened and rendered serious, earnest hearts get to work in the
   Divine life with much hurry, seizing upon that which first comes to
   hand, building in heedless haste, without due care and examination.
   Something must be done and they do it without asking whether it is
   according to the teaching of the Lord. They call Jesus, "Lord," but
   they do what others say, rather than what Jesus says. Satan is sure to
   be at hand at such times that he may lead the young convert to lay, in
   place of Gospel repentance, a repentance that needs to be repented
   of--and instead of the faith of God's elect-- a proud presumption or an
   idle dream. For that love of God which is the work of the Spirit of
   God, he brings mere natural affection for a minister and he says,
   "There, that will do! You must have a house for your soul to dwell in.
   There are the materials, pile them up."

   Like children at play upon the beach, the anxious heap up their
   sandcastles and please themselves with them, for they are ignorant of
   Satan's devices. I am, for this reason, doubly anxious to save my
   beloved young friends from the Deceiver! The common temptation is,
   instead of really repenting, to talk about repentance. Instead of
   heartily believing, to say, "I believe," without believing. Instead of
   truly loving, to talk of love, without loving! Instead of coming to
   Christ, to speak about coming to Christ, and profess to come to Christ,
   and yet not to come at all! The character of Talkative in Pilgrim's
   Progress is ably drawn. I have met the gentleman many times and can
   bear witness that John Bunyan was a photographer before photography was
   invented!

   Christian said of him "He talks of prayer, of repentance, of faith and
   of the new birth, but he knows but only to talk of them. I have been in
   his family and his house is as empty of religion as the white of an egg
   is of savor." We have too

   many such persons around us who are, as to what they say, everything
   that is to be desired and yet they are proven to be mere shams. As
   tradesmen place dummies in their shops, papered and labeled to look
   like goods, while yet they are nothing of the sort, so are these men
   marked and labeled as Christians, but the Grace of God is not in them!
   Oh that you young beginners may be on the alert, that you be not
   content with the form of godliness, but are made to feel the power

   of it!

   There is this to help the temptation, too, that this plan for the
   present saves a great deal of trouble. Your mind is distressed and you
   need comfort--well, it will comfort you to say, "Lord, Lord," though
   you do not the things that Christ says. If you admit the claims of
   Jesus to be Lord, even though you do not believe on Him for salvation
   and so neglect the main thing which He commands, you will find some
   ease in the admission. He bids you repent of sin, trust His blood, love
   His Word and seek after holiness--but it is much easier to admire these
   things without following after them in your life. To feign repentance
   and faith is not difficult, but genuine godliness is heart work and
   requires thought, care, sincerity, prayerfulness and watchfulness.

   Believe me, real religion is no sport! He that would be saved will find
   it to be no jesting matter. "The kingdom of Heaven suffers violence,"
   and he that is easy about the thing, and thinks it is nothing more than
   the magician's, "Heigh, presto, done," has made a fatal mistake!
   "Strive," says Christ, "to enter into the strait gate." The Spirit
   strives in us mightily and often works us to an agony. The crown of
   eternal Glory is not won without fighting, nor the prize of our high
   calling received without running--yet, by just making a holy
   profession, and by practicing an outward form--a man imagines that the
   same result is produced as by seeking the Lord with his whole heart and
   believing in the Lord Jesus. If it were so, there would be a fine broad
   road to Heaven and Satan, himself, would turn pilgrim! Believe me, dear
   Hearers, this saving of trouble will turn out to be a making of trouble
   and, before matters end, the hardest way will turn out to be the
   easiest way!

   This kind of building without a foundation has this advantage to back
   up the temptation--it enables a man to run up a religion very quickly.
   He makes splendid progress! While the anxious heart is searching after
   the Truth of God in the inward parts and begging to be renewed by
   Grace, his exulting friend is as happy as he can be in a peace which he
   has suddenly obtained without question or examination. This rapid
   grower never asks, "Has my religion changed my conduct? Is my faith
   attended by a new nature? Does the Spirit of God dwell in me? Am I
   really what I profess to be, or am I but a bastard professor, after
   all?" No, he puts aside all enquiry as a temptation of the devil! He
   takes every good thing for granted and votes that all is gold which
   glitters!

   Look how fast he goes! The fog is dense, but he steams through it,
   heedless of danger! He has joined the Church--he has commenced work for
   God! He is boasting of his own attainments--he hints that he is
   perfect! But is this mushroom building safe? Will it pass muster in the
   last, great survey? Will it stand should a tempest happen? The chimney
   shaft is tall, but is it safe? Yes, there's the rub! This is the
   question which makes an end of much of the boasting which is all around
   us. It is better to tremble at God's Word than boldly to presume. It is
   better to be fearful, lest, after all, we may be castaways, than to
   harden one's forehead with vain confidence. When a man travels upon a
   wrong road, the faster he runs, the further he will go astray.

   Remember the advice to go slowly and the old proverb which says, "The
   more haste the less speed." If you build quickly because you build
   without a foundation, your time and toil are thrown away. How common,
   how deceptive is this temptation! The young beginner, the man who is
   just awakened to seek the Lord, will find a great many to help him in
   his mistake, should he neglect the foundation. Kind, good, Christian
   friends often, without a thought of doing so, help to mislead seeking
   souls. "Yes," they say, "you are converted," and so, perhaps, the
   person would be if all he said were true! But it is said without
   feeling; it comes from the lips, only, and does not come from the
   heart! And, therefore, it is ruinous to encourage him. A kindly
   assurance from a Christian friend may breed false confidence if that
   assurance was mistakenly given.

   In these days, we do not meet with many Christians who err by dealing
   too severely with converts--the shot strikes the other target. Our
   forefathers were possibly too suspicious and jealous, but nowadays we
   nearly all err in the opposite direction--we are so anxious to see
   everybody brought to Christ that our wish may tend to delude us into
   the belief that it is so. We are so willing to cheer and comfort those
   who seek the Lord, that we may fall into the habit of prophesying
   smooth things and thus shun everything which tends to probe and test,
   lest it should also discourage. Let us beware lest

   we cry, "Peace, peace," where there is no peace! It will be a sad thing
   to breed hypocrites when we were looking for converts.

   I have heard of one who had been into the Enquiry Room a dozen times
   and when, on another occasion, she was invited to go there, she said,
   "I really do not know why I should go, for I have been told that I was
   saved 12 times, already, and I am not a bit better than before they
   told me so." It would be better to send some home weeping rather than
   rejoicing! Many a wound needs the knife more than the plaster. You may
   be comforted by well-meant assurances of tender friends and yet that
   comfort may be all a lie! I therefore warn you against any peace except
   that which comes from doing that which Jesus commands, or, in other
   words, against any confidence except that which rests in only Jesus and
   is attended with repentance, faith and a life of obedience to your
   Lord.

   No doubt man are encouraged in slight building by the fact that so many
   professors are making a fair show and yet their building is without
   foundation. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that in all Churches
   there are persons who have no depth of spiritual root and, we are
   afraid, no real spiritual life. We cannot root them up, though we fear
   that they are tares, for we are assured that we would unavoidably root
   up the wheat with them--and this our Master forbids. There is nothing
   about their outward conduct which we could lay hold upon as a proof of
   their being deceivers, and yet a cold chill runs through us when we
   talk with them, for they have no warmth, no life and nothing of the
   Lord about them.

   We miss in their conversation that sweet spirituality, that holy
   unction, that blessed humility which are sure to be present when men
   are truly familiar with the Lord and have entered into living union
   with Him. People of this order mix up with us in our holy
   convocations--and when they come across the newly-awakened ones--they
   talk of Divine things in such an off-hand and flippant manner that they
   do serious mischief. They speak about conversion as if it were a mere
   trifle, a matter as easy as kissing your hand--and those who are
   hopeful, and over whom our hearts are yearning--are turned aside by
   them. Young people are apt to think, "So-and-So is a member of the
   Church and he is never very precise. If a lukewarm profession satisfies
   him, why should it not satisfy me!"

   Ah, my dear Friends, you would not say so in business! If you knew a
   man was trading without capital and likely to come to bankruptcy, you
   would not say, "I may do the same." If you saw a man venturing into
   deep water who could not swim, and you felt sure that he would
   ultimately drown, you would not follow his example and drown, too. No,
   no! Do not let these frothy professors be beacons to you. Get away from
   Mr. Talkative, lest he make you as hollow a drum as he is! Beware of
   loose professors who are as wreckers' lights that lure men upon the
   rocks. Make sure work for eternity and bid triflers be gone.

   Again, there is always, at the back of all this, an inducement to build
   without a foundation because it will not be known and possibly may not
   be found out for years. Foundation work is quite out of sight--and the
   house can be built up and be very useful in a great many ways--and it
   may stand a good while without the underground work, for houses without
   foundations do not tumble down at once--they will stand for years.
   Nobody knows how long they may stay up. Perhaps they may even be
   inhabited with comfort till the last great flood. Death, alone, will
   discover some impostors. Therefore, because the ill-founded house will
   do for the present--and can be used and may bring immediate comfort--
   many people consider it economical to leave out the foundation as a
   needless superfluity.

   If they are questioned as to their vital godliness, they grow
   angry--"What business have you to enter into my private business? Why
   should you meddle with the secrets of my soul?" Ah, dear Friend, if we
   were cruel to you and wished you to be deceived, we would hold our
   tongues, or speak to you with the voice of flattery! But as we love you
   and as we hope to be blessed, in years to come, through your true and
   holy consecration to Christ, we are intensely earnest that you should
   begin aright. We would have you build that which will not need to be
   pulled down, again--work that will stand when the waters are out and
   the stream beats vehemently upon it! I dread that any man should perish
   without religion, but I dread far more that any man should perish with
   it, finding his faith to have been false, after all!

   If you build, build what is worth building! If you must be builders for
   your souls, and surely you must, or else be shelterless, then take heed
   on what foundation you build and be careful what you build, lest, after
   all, you suffer the loss of all your labor in that last tremendous day!
   How sad it will seem to dwell near the gates of Heaven--and spend your
   lives among those who are to be its future inhabitants--and then for
   lack of sincerity and truth, to be shut out of the Celestial City! How
   terrible to find out by experience that there is a back way to the
   gates of Hell even from the gates of Heaven! God grant it be not so
   with one of us here present.

   O you builders, care not merely for the present, but build for death,
   judgment and eternity! This part of our discourse is not only for young
   people, but for us all--for old as well as young. Depend upon it, there
   is not one man among us but what has need to search himself and see
   whether the foundation of his faith has been truly laid or not.

   II. So I advance to the second step, where we will consider--A WISE
   PRECAUTION WHICH SAFE BUILDERS

   NEVER FORGET. They dig deep and never rest till they have a good
   substantial foundation--they are glad to get to the bottom of all the
   loose earth and to build on the rock. Let me commend this wise
   precaution to all of you. Follow the text and learn to see to your
   sincerity. The Lord Jesus says, "Why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and do
   not the things which I say?" May the Holy Spirit make you true to the
   core. Be afraid to say a word more than you feel. Never permit yourself
   to speak as if you had an experience of which you have only read. Let
   not your outward worship go a step beyond the inward emotion of your
   soul. If Christ is truly your Lord, you will obey Him--if He is not
   your Lord, do not call Him so.

   It is a great point in all your religious thoughts, beliefs, words and
   acts to have the heart moving in all. It is an awful thing to make a
   high profession of sanctity and yet live in the indulgence of secret
   vice. Such persons will listen to my observation and commend me for my
   faithfulness and yet continue in their hypocrisy! This is most painful.
   These men can speak the Jew's language and yet the tongue of Babylon is
   more natural to them--they follow Christ, but their hearts are with
   Belial. Ah, me! My soul is sick at the thought of them. Be true! Be
   true! If truth will carry you no further than despair, better that you
   stop in despair than gain a hope by a lie! Do not live on fiction,
   profession, presumption. Eat that which is good and feed only upon the
   Truth of God. Remember that when you build with wood, hay and stubble
   of mere notion, you are only gathering materials for your own funeral
   pile in that day when the fire shall devour all lovers and makers of a
   lie. Be true as steel! Every wise builder for his soul must mind that.

   The next thing is thoroughness. For observe, according to our Lord, the
   wise builder dug deep. You cannot do a right thing too well. Dig deep
   if you dig a foundation. If it is repentance, let it be an intensely
   earnest repentance, including a vehement hatred of every form of sin.
   If you make confession before God, confess with your very soul and not
   only with your lips--lay bare your spirit before the glance of Deity.
   If it is faith that you talk of, believe right up to the hilt. Do not
   go in for that kind of skeptical believing which is so common,
   nowadays. If you believe, believe! If you repent, repent! In the
   purging of the soul, there is nothing like sweeping out every particle
   of the old leaven of falsehood. And in bringing in the good things into
   the heart, there is nothing like bringing in everything that Christ
   prescribes--so that of His fullness we may receive not only Grace, but
   Grace for Grace, Grace upon Grace, all the Grace that is needed!

   Be downright in everything. The wise builder dug through the earth and
   continued his digging till he reached rock. And then he dug into the
   rock and struck out a trench in which he might lay his foundation, for
   he could not be content unless he made sure and thorough work of it.
   Sincerity and thoroughness are fine building materials! Next to that
   add self-renunciation, for that is in the parable. When a man digs a
   deep foundation, he has much earth to throw out. So he that builds for
   eternity has a great deal to get rid of. Self-trust must go at the
   beginning! Love of sin must follow-- worldliness, pride, self-seeking,
   all sorts of iniquity--these must be cast aside. There is very much
   rubbish and the rubbish must go! You cannot make sure work for eternity
   without clearing away much which flesh and blood would like to retain.
   See to this and count the cost.

   Then must come solid principle. The man who is determined that if he
   does build, he will build securely, digs down to the rock. He says, "I
   believe in God, He is my Helper. I believe in Christ Jesus and on His
   atoning sacrifice and living intercession I build my eternal hopes. I
   also build on the Doctrine of Grace, for the Lord has said it--By Grace
   are you saved, through faith. I build on Scripture--nothing but the
   warrant of the Word of God will do for me." What God has said is a
   rock--what man teaches is mere shifting sand! What a blessed thing it
   is to get down to the eternal principles of Divine Truth! You that pick
   up your religion from your mothers and fathers--you that follow it
   because it happened to be in the family--what are you worth in the day
   of trouble? You are blown down like a booth, or a hut of twigs!

   But you that know what you believe and why you believe it--you who,
   when you put your foot down, know what you are standing upon and are
   persuaded that you have firm rock beneath you--you are the men and
   women who will stand fast when mere pretenders are burled out of their
   place! Oh, my dear seeking Friends, fix upon true principles and be not
   content with lies! These truthful principles must be firmly adhered to.
   Bind your building to the rock. A house will not stand merely because
   it is on the rock--you must get its foundation into the rock. The house
   must take a grip of

   the rock and the rock must grasp the house. The more you can get the
   house to be a bit of the rock and the rock, as it were, to grow up into
   the house, the more secure you are.

   It is of no use saying, "Yes, I confide in Christ, in Grace, in
   Revelation," unless your very life enters into these things and they
   enter into you! Hypocrites, Job says, are stolen away in the night.
   They are easily removed. The inventor of some new notion comes along,
   cracks up his novel wares, and silly souls are at once taken in by him.
   Christ may go, Grace may go and the Bible may go, too--their new master
   has them wholly in his power. We do not need such unsubstantial men! We
   care not for these speculating builders whose carcasses are all around
   us! We have had enough of castles in the air--we need true men who will
   stand fast like the mountains--while errors, like clouds, blow over
   them! Remember the huge shaft at Bradford and how many were slain by
   its fall? Let it teach you to hold hard to foundation Truths of God and
   never depart from them.

   The man in the second parable did not build as he should. What may I
   say of him? I will say three words. First, he was a man who had nothing
   out of sight--you could see all his house when you looked at it. If you
   can see all a man's religion at a glance, he has no religion worth
   having! Godliness lies most in secret prayer, private devotion and
   inward Grace. The wise builder had the most costly part of his house
   buried in the ground, but the other man showed all that he had above
   ground. He is a poor tradesman who has no stock but that which he puts
   into the window. He will not last long who has no capital. He cannot
   long stand who has no backbone within. Beware of a religion of show!

   Next, this man had nothing to hold to. He built a house, but it stood
   upon the loose soil. He easily dug into that and stuck up his house but
   his walls had no holdfast. Beware of a religion without holdfasts! "But
   if I get a grip upon a doctrine, they call me a bigot" you say. Let
   them do so! Bigotry is a hateful thing and yet that which is now abused
   as bigotry is a great virtue and greatly needed in these frivolous
   times! I have been inclined, lately, to start a new denomination, and
   call it, "the Church of the Bigoted." Everybody is getting to be so
   oily, so plastic, so untrue, that we need a race of hard-shells to
   teach us how to believe!

   Those old-fashioned people who, in former ages, believed something and
   thought the opposite of it to be false, were truer folk than the
   present time-servers. I should like to ask the divines of the broad
   school whether any doctrine is worth a man's dying for it. They would
   have to reply, "Well, of course, if a man had to go to the stake or
   change his opinions, the proper way would be to state them with much
   diffidence and to be extremely respectful to the opposite school." But
   suppose he is required to deny the Truth of God? "Well, there is much
   to be said on each side, and probably the negative may have a measure
   of truth in it as well as the positive. At any rate, it cannot be a
   prudent thing to incur the odium of being burned, and so it might be
   preferable to leave the matter an open question for the time being."

   Yes, and as these gentlemen always find it unpleasant to be unpopular,
   they soften down the hard threats of Scripture as to the world to come
   and put a color upon every doctrine to which worldly-wise men object!
   The teachers of doubt are very doubtful teachers! A man must have
   something to hold to, or he will neither bless himself or others. Bring
   all the ships into the pool but do not moor or anchor one of them--let
   each one be free! Wait for a stormy night and they will dash against
   each other--and great mischief will come of this freedom! Perfect love
   and charity will not come through our being all unmoored, but by each
   having his proper moorings and keeping to them in the name of God. You
   must have something to hold to!

   But the builder in the parable had not, and so he perished. The foolish
   builder had nothing to resist outward circumstances. On summer days his
   house was a favorite resort and was considered to be quite as good as
   his neighbor's in all respects. Frequently he rubbed his hands and
   said, "I do not see but what my house is quite as good as his and
   perhaps a little better! The fact is, I had a few pounds to spare which
   I did not bury in the ground, as he did, and with it I have bought many
   a little ornament, so that my habitation has a finer look than his
   building." So it seemed--but when the torrent came raging down the
   mountain side, his building, having nothing with which to resist the
   violence of the flood, fell down at once--and not a trace of it
   remained when the storm had ceased. Thus do men fail because they offer
   no resistance to forces which drive them into sin--the great current of
   evil finds in them victims--not opponents.

   III. Thirdly, we will now gather from our text A SET OF ARGUMENTS
   URGING US TO TAKE CARE OF THE

   FOUNDATION. I will glance over these arguments, wishing much that I had
   time to enforce them. The first is this. We ought to build with a good
   foundation at the beginning, because otherwise we shall not build well
   in any other part of the house. Bad work in the foundation influences
   all the rest of the courses. In the Revised Version, at the end of the
   48th

   verse, instead of, "For it was founded upon a rock," we read, "Because
   it had been well built." The house was built well at the bottom and
   that led the workman to put in good work all the way up, so that all
   through, "it had been well

   built."

   The other man built badly underground and did the same up to the roof!
   When you get into the habit of slovenly work in secret, the tendency is
   to be slovenly in public, too. If the underground part of our religion
   is not firmly laid upon Christ, then in the upper part there will be
   rotten work, half-baked bricks, mud instead of mortar and a general
   skimping of everything. When a great Grecian artist was fashioning an
   image for the temple, he was diligently carving the back part of the
   goddess, and one said to him, "You need not finish that part of the
   statue, because it is to be built into the wall." He replied, "The gods
   can see in the wall." He had a right idea of what is due to God! That
   part of my religion which no man can see should be as perfect as if it
   were to be observed by all. The Day shall declare it! When Christ shall
   come, everything shall be made known and published before the universe.
   Therefore see to it that it is fit to be thus made known.

   See, again, that we ought to have good foundations when we look at the
   situation where the house is to be built. It is clear from this parable
   that both these houses were built in places not far from a river, or
   where streams might be expected to come. Certain parts of the South of
   France are marvelously like Palestine and, perhaps at the present
   moment, they are more like what the Holy Land was in Christ's day than
   the Holy Land is now. When I reached Cannes, last year, I found that
   there had been a flood in the town. This flood did not come by reason
   of a river being swollen, but through a deluge of rain. A waterspout
   seems to have burst upon the hillside tearing up earth, rocks, stones
   and then hurrying down to the sea. It rushed across the railway station
   and poured down the street which led to it, drowning several persons in
   its progress.

   When I was there a large hotel--I should think five stories high--was
   shored up with timber and was evidently doomed, for when this stream
   rushed down the narrow street it undermined the lower courses of the
   building and, as there were no foundations at all able to bear such a
   test, the whole structure was rendered unsafe. The Savior had some such
   case in His mind's eye. A torrent of water would come tearing down the
   side of the mountain--and if a house were built on the mere earth, it
   would be carried away--but if it were fastened into the rock so that it
   became part and parcel of it, then the flood might rush all around it,
   but it would not shake the walls.

   Beloved builder of a house for your soul, your house is so situated
   that one of these days there must come great pressure upon it. "How do
   you know?" Well, I know that the house in which my soul lives is
   pitched just where winds blow, waves rise and storms beat. Where is
   yours? Do you live in a snug corner? Yes, but one of these times you
   will find that the snug corner will be no more shielded than the open
   riverside, for God so orders Providence that every man has his test
   sooner or later! It may be that you think yourself past temptation, but
   the idea is a delusion, as time will show! Perhaps from the very fact
   that you seem quite out of the way, a peculiar temptation may befall
   you. Therefore, I pray you, because of the exposed condition of your
   life's building, build upon a good foundation!

   The next argument is, build deep, because of the ruin which will result
   from a bad foundation. The foolish builder's house was without a
   foundation. Notice that word, "without a foundation." Write down the
   expression and see whether they apply to you or not. What happened to
   this house without a foundation? The stream beat vehemently on it! The
   river's bed had long been dry, but suddenly it was flooded and the
   torrent rolled with tremendous power. Perhaps it was persecution.
   Perhaps it was prosperity. Perhaps it was trouble, or temptation.
   Perhaps it was prevalent skepticism or death, but, whatever--the flood
   beat vehemently upon that house!

   And now we read the next word--"And immediately it fell." It did not
   stand a prolonged assault! It was captured at once. "Immediately it
   fell." What? In a minute all that fair profession gone? "Immediately it
   fell." Why, that is the man I shook hands with the other Sunday and
   called him, "Brother," and he has been seen drunk! Or he has been in
   the frivolous assembly, using unhallowed language! Or he has become an
   utter doubter all on a sudden! It is sorrowful work burying our
   friends, but it is much more sorrowful work to lose them in this
   fashion--and yet so they vanish. They are gone! Even as Job says "the
   east wind carries him away and he departs." "Immediately" they fall and
   yet we thought so highly of them--and they thought so highly of
   themselves. "Immediately it fell"--their profession could not endure
   trial--and all because it had no foundation!

   Then it is added, "And the ruin of that house was great." The house
   came down with a crash and it was all the man had. The man was an
   eminent professor and, therefore, his ruin was all the more notable. It
   was a great fall because it could never be built up, again. When a man
   dies a hypocrite, certainly there is no hope of restitution for him. By
   the stream the very debris of the ruined house was swept away. Nothing
   was left. Oh, men, if you lose a battle, you may fight, again, and win
   another. If you fail in business you may start, again, in trade and
   realize a fortune. But if you lose your souls, the loss is
   irretrievable! Once lost, forever lost! There will be no second
   opportunity! Do not deceive yourselves about that. Therefore, dig deep
   and lay every stone most firmly upon the foundation of rock.

   For lastly, and perhaps this will be the best argument, observe the
   effect of this good, sure building--this deep building. We read that
   when the flood beat upon the wise man's house, "it could not shake it."
   That is very beautiful. Not only could it not carry it away, but, "it
   could not shake it." I see the man--he lost his money and became poor,
   but he did not give up his faith--"It could not shake it." He was
   ridiculed and slandered. And many of his former friends gave him the
   cold shoulder--but, "It could not shake it." He went to Jesus under his
   great trial and he was sustained-- "It could not shake it." He was very
   sick and his spirit was depressed within him, but he still held to his
   confidence in Christ--"It could not shake it."

   He was near to death. He knew that he must soon depart out of this
   world, but all the pains of death and the certainty of dissolution
   could not shake him. He died as he lived--firm as a rock, rejoicing as
   much as ever, nay--rejoicing more because he was nearer to the Kingdom
   and to the fruition of all his hopes! "It could not shake it." It is a
   grand thing to have a faith which cannot be shaken! I saw, one day, a
   number of beech trees which had formed a small forest-- they had all
   fallen to the ground through a storm. The fact was they leaned upon one
   another, to a great extent, and the thickness of the forest prevented
   each tree from getting a firm hold of the soil. They kept each other up
   and also forced each other to grow up tall and thin, to the neglect of
   a strong root growth. When the storm forced down the first few trees,
   the others readily followed one after the other.

   Close to that same spot, I saw another tree in the open, bravely
   defying the blast, in solitary strength. The hurricane had beaten upon
   it, but it had endured all its force unsheltered! That lone, brave tree
   seemed to be better rooted than before the storm. I thought, "Is it not
   so with professors?" They often hold together and help each other to
   grow up, but if they have not firm personal roothold, when a storm
   arises they fall in rows. A minister dies, or certain leaders are taken
   away--and over go the members by departure from the faith and from
   holiness! I would have you be self-contained, growing, each man, into
   Christ for himself, rooted and grounded in love and faith and every
   holy Grace. Then when the worse storm that ever blew on mortal man
   shall come, it will be said of your faith, "It could not shake it."

   I beseech you who are now seeking Christ to take care that you build
   well, that you may stand long in our Zion, steadfast and unmovable. God
   grant it for Christ's sake. Amen.

Hands Full of Honey

   (No. 1703)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 28, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Samson turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold,
   there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion. And he
   took some in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and
   mother, and he gave some to them, and they did eat: but he did not tell
   them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the Lion."
   Judges 14:8,9.

   IT was a singular circumstance that a man unarmed should have slain a
   lion in the prime of its vigor and yet, more strange that a swarm of
   bees should have taken possession of the dried carcass and have filled
   it with their honey. In that country, what with beasts, birds, insects
   and the dry heat, a dead body is soon cleansed from all corruption and
   the bones are clean and white. Still, the killing of the lion and the
   finding of the honey make up a remarkable story. These singular
   circumstances became, afterwards, the subject of a riddle--but with
   that riddle we have no concern at this time. Samson, himself, is a
   riddle! He was not only a riddle-maker, but he was, himself, an enigma
   very difficult to explain.

   With his personal character I have, at this time, little or nothing to
   do. We are not, today, resting at the house of "Gains, my host," where
   the pilgrims amused themselves with a dish of nuts after dinner, but we
   are on the march and must attend to the more important matter of
   refreshing and inspiriting those who are in our company. Neither are we
   going to discuss difficulties, but as Samson took the honey without
   being stung, so would we gain instruction without debate.

   We have, in these days, so much to do that we must make practical use
   of every incident that comes before us in the Word of God. My one
   design is to cheer the desponding and stir up all God's people to
   greater diligence in His service. I conceive that the text may
   legitimately be employed for this purpose. By the help of the Divine
   Spirit, even after this lapse of time, we may find honey in the lion!
   The particular part of the incident which is recorded in these two
   verses appears to have been passed over by those who have written upon
   Samson's life--I suppose it appeared to be too inconceivable. They are
   taken up with his restive riddle, but they omit the far more natural
   and commendable fact or his bringing forth the honey in his hands and
   presenting it to his father and mother.

   This is the little scene to which I direct your glances. It seems to me
   that the Israelite hero, with a slain lion in the background, standing
   out in the open road with his hands laden with masses of honeycomb and
   dripping with honey, which he holds out to his parents, makes a fine
   picture, worthy of the greatest artist. And what a type we have here of
   our Divine Lord and Master, Jesus, the conqueror of death and Hell! He
   has destroyed the lion that roared upon us and upon Him. He has shouted
   victory "over all our foes." "It is finished" was His note of triumph
   and now He stands in the midst or His Church with His hands full of
   sweetness and consolation, presenting them to those of whom He says,
   "these are My brother and sister and mother."

   To each one of us who believe in Him, He gives the luscious food which
   He has prepared for us by the overthrow of our foes. He bids us come
   and eat that we may have our lives sweetened and our hearts filled with
   joy. To me, the comparison seems wonderfully apt and suggestive! I see
   our triumphant Lord laden with sweetness, holding it forth to all His
   Brothers and Sisters, and inviting them to share in His joy. But,
   Beloved, it is written, "As He is, so are we, also, in this world." All
   that are true Christians are, in a measure, like the Christ whose name
   they bear--and it is to His image that we are finally to be conformed.
   When He shall appear, we shall be like He, for we shall see Him as He
   is. And, meanwhile, in proportion as we see Him, now, "we are changed
   into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the

   Lord."

   The Samson type may well serve as the symbol of every Christian in the
   world. The Believer has been helped by Divine Grace in his spiritual
   conflicts and he has known "the victory which overcomes the world, even
   our faith." He has

   thus been made more than a conqueror through Him that loved us and now
   he stands in the midst of his fellow men inviting them to Jesus. With
   the honey in his hands, which he continues to feast upon, he displays
   the heavenly sweetness to all that are round about him, saying, "O
   taste and see that the Lord is good! blessed is the man that trusts in
   Him." I have before now met with that popular artist, Gustave Dore,
   [1832-1883] and suggested subjects to him. Had he survived among us,
   and had another opportunity occurred, I would have pressed him to
   execute a statue of Samson handing out the honey--strength distributing
   sweetness!

   And it might have served as a perpetual reminder of what a Christian
   should be--a Conqueror and a Comforter, slaying lions and distributing
   honey! The faithful servant of God wrestles with the powers of evil,
   but with far greater delight he speaks to his friends and companions,
   saying, "Eat that which is good and let your souls delight themselves
   in sweetness." Set the statue before your mind's eye and now let me
   speak about it. Three touches may suffice. First, the Believer's life
   has its conflicts. Secondly, the Believer's life has its sweets. And,
   thirdly, the Believer's life leads him to communicate of those sweets
   to others. Here is room for profitable meditation!

   I. First, then, THE BELIEVER'S LIFE HAS ITS CONFLICTS. To become a
   Christian is to enlist as a soldier. To become a Believer is to enter
   upon a pilgrimage and the road is often rough--the hills are steep, the
   valleys are dark, giants block the way and robbers lurk in corners! The
   man who reckons that he can glide into Heaven without a struggle has
   made a great mistake. No cross, no crown--no sweat, no sweet--no
   conflict, no conquest. These conflicts, if we take the case of Samson
   as our symbol, begin early in the life of the Believer. While Samson
   was a child, the Spirit of the Lord moved him in the camps of Dan--see
   the last verse of the 13th chapter.

   And as soon as he was on the verge of manhood, he must match himself
   with a lion! God, who intended that His servant should smite the
   Philistines and should check their proud oppression of His people,
   Israel, began early to train the hero for his life's conflict. So, when
   Samson was going to seek a wife, he turned aside into the vineyards of
   Timnath and a lion roared upon him. Yes, and the young Believer, who as
   yet has not wrestled with the Powers of Darkness, will not be long
   before he hears the roar of the lion and finds himself in the presence
   of the great Adversary. Very soon we learn the value of the prayer,
   "Deliver us from the Evil One!"

   Most of the Lord's servants have been men of war from their youth up.
   This early combat with the savage beast was intended by God to let
   Samson know his strength, when under the influence of the Spirit, and
   to train him for his future combats with Israel's enemies. He that is
   to smite the Philistines hip and thigh with a great slaughter, until he
   has laid them heaps on heaps by his single prowess, must begin by
   tearing a lion apart with his naked hands! He was to learn war in the
   same school as another and a greater hero, who afterwards said, "Your
   servant slew both the lion and the beast, and this uncircumcised
   Philistine shall be as one of them."

   Soldiers are made by war. You cannot train veterans or create victors
   except by battles. As in the wars of armies, so is it in spiritual
   contests--men must be trained for victory over evil by combat with it.
   Therefore, "it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth,"
   for it will not gall his shoulders in later years. It is assuredly a
   dangerous thing to be altogether free from trouble--in silken ease the
   soldier loses his prowess. Look at Solomon, one of the greatest and
   wisest, and yet, I might say, one of the least and most foolish of men.
   It was his fatal privilege to sit upon a throne of gold and sun himself
   in the brilliance of unclouded prosperity. And, therefore, his heart
   soon went astray and he fell from his high places.

   Solomon, in his early days, had no trouble, for no war was raging,
   then, and no enemy worth notice was then living. His life ran smoothly
   and he was lulled into a dreamy sleep, the sleep of the voluptuous. He
   had been happier far had he been like his father, called, from his
   earliest days, to trial and conflict, for this might have taught him to
   stand fast upon the pinnacle of glory whereon the Providence of God had
   placed him. Learn, then, O young Brother, that, if, like Samson, you
   are to be a hero for Israel, you must early be subjected to suffering
   and daring, in some form or other! When you step aside and seek for
   meditation in the quiet of the vineyard, a young lion may roar upon you
   even as in the earliest days of your Lord and Master's public service
   He was led into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.

   These conflicts, dear Friends, may often be very terrible. By a young
   lion is not meant a whelp, but a lion in the fatness of its early
   strength and not yet slackened in its pace, or curbed in its fury by
   growing years. Fresh and furious, a young lion is the worst kind of
   beast that a man can meet with! Let us expect, as followers of Christ,
   to meet with strong temptations, fierce persecutions and severe trials
   which will lead to stern conflicts. Do not reckon, you that are yet
   put-

   ting on the harness, that you shall soon put it off, or that when you
   take it off, it will be quite as bright as it is today! It will be
   dimmed with blood and dust--and battered by many a blow. Perhaps your
   foe may find a way to pierce it, or at least to wound you between its
   joints. I would have every man begin to be a soldier of the Cross, but
   I would, at the same time, have him count the cost for it is no child's
   play! And if he thinks it will be such, he will be grievously
   disappointed.

   A young Believer will, all of a sudden, have a doubt suggested to him
   of which he never heard before--and it will roar upon him like a young
   lion. Neither will he see, all at once, how to dispose of it. Or he may
   be placed in singular circumstances where his duty seems to run counter
   to the most tender instincts of his nature. Here, too, the young lion
   will roar upon him. Or, one for whom he has an intense respect may
   treat him badly because he is a follower of Christ-- and the affection
   and respect which he feels for this person may make his opposition the
   more grievous. In this, also, it is with him as when a lion roars. Or
   he may suffer a painful bereavement, or sustain a severe loss. Or he
   may have a disease upon him with consequent pains and depressions--all
   of these may cast the shadow of death upon his spirit, so that, again,
   a young lion roars upon him.

   Brother, Sister, let us reckon upon this and not be dismayed by it,
   since in all this is the life of our spirit. By such lessons as these
   we are taught to do service for God, to sympathize with our fellow
   Christians and to value the help of our gracious Savior. By all these
   we are weaned from earth and made to hunger for that eternal Glory
   which is yet to be revealed, of which we may truly say, "No lion shall
   be there, neither shall any ravenous beast go up there." These present
   evils are for our future good--their terror is for our teaching! Trials
   are sent us for much the same reason that the Ca-naanites were
   permitted to live in the Holy Land, that Israel might learn war and be
   equipped for battles against foreign foes!

   These conflicts come early and they are very terrible and, moreover,
   they happen to us when we are least prepared for them. Samson was not
   hunting for wild beasts. He was engaged on a much more tender business.
   He was walking in the vineyards of Timnath, thinking of anything but
   lions, "and behold," says the Scripture, "a young lion roared against
   him." It was a remarkable and startling occurrence! He had left his
   father and mother and was quite alone. No one was within call to aid
   him in meeting his furious assailant. Human sympathy is exceedingly
   precious, but there are points in our spiritual conflict in which we
   cannot expect to receive it. To each man there are passages in life too
   narrow for walking two abreast. Upon certain crags we must stand alone.
   As our constitutions differ, so our trials, which are suited to our
   constitutions, must also differ.

   Each individual has a secret with which no friend can interfere, for
   every life has its mystery and its hidden treasure. Do not be ashamed,
   young Christian, if you meet with temptations which appear to you to be
   quite singular--we have, each one, thought the same of our trials. You
   imagine that no one suffers as you do, whereas no temptation has
   happened unto you but such as is common to man--and God will, with the
   temptation, make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it. Yet,
   for the time being, you may have to enter into fellowship with your
   Lord when He trod the winepress alone, and of the people there was none
   with Him. Is not this for your good? Is not this the way to strength?

   What kind of piety is that which is dependent upon the friendship of
   man? What sort of religion is that which cannot stand alone? Beloved,
   you will have to die alone and you need, therefore, Divine Grace to
   cheer you in solitude. The dear wife can attend you, weeping, to the
   river's brink, but into the chill stream she cannot go with you--and if
   you have not a religion which will sustain you in the solitudes of
   life--of what use will it be to you in the grim lonesomeness of death?
   Thus I reckon it to be a happy circumstance that you are called to
   solitary conflict so that you may test your faith and see of what stuff
   your hope is made!

   The contest was all the worse for Samson, that in addition to being
   quite alone, "there was nothing in his hands." This is the most
   remarkable point in the narrative. He had no sword or hunter's spear
   with which to wound the lordly savage--he had not, even, a stout staff
   with which to ward off his attack. Samson stood all unarmed, an
   unarmored man in the presence of a raging beast! So we, in our early
   temptations, are apt to think that we have no weapon for the war and we
   not know what to do. We are made to cry out, "I am unprepared! How can
   I meet this trial? I cannot grasp the enemy to wrestle with him. What
   am I to do?" Herein will the splendor of faith and Glory of God be made
   manifest, when you shall slay the lion, and yet it shall be said of
   you, "he had nothing in his hands"--nothing but that which the world
   sees not and values not!

   Now, go one step further, for time forbids our lingering here. I invite
   you to remember that it was by the Spirit of God that the victory was
   won. We read, "And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and he
   tore him as he would have torn a kid." Let the Holy Spirit help us in
   our trouble and we need neither company nor weapon! But without Him
   what can we do? Good Bishop Hall says, "If that roaring lion that goes
   about continually seeking whom he may devour, finds us alone among the
   vineyards of the Philistines, where is our hope? Not in our heels--he
   is swifter than we! Not in our weapons--we are naturally unarmed! Not
   in our hands which are weak and languishing--but in the Spirit of God,
   by whom we can do all things! If God fights in us, who can resist us?
   There is a stronger lion in us than that against us," There is only one
   necessity--to be endowed with power from on high--the power of the Holy
   Spirit!

   Helped by the Spirit of God, the Believer's victory will be complete!
   The lion shall not be driven away, but torn in pieces. Girt with the
   Spirit's power, our victory shall be as easy as it will be
   perfect--Samson tore the lion as though it were a little lamb, or a kid
   of the goats. Well said Paul, "I can do all things through Christ that
   strengthens me." Sin is soon overcome, temptations are readily refused,
   affliction is joyfully borne, persecution is gladly endured when the
   Spirit of Glory and of Peace rests upon us! With God all things are
   possible and as the Believer is with God, it comes to pass that all
   things are possible to him that believes!

   If we were surrounded by all the devils in Hell, we need not fear them
   for an instant if the Lord is on our side. We are mightier than all
   Hell's legions when the Spirit is mightily upon us! If we were to be
   beaten down by Satan until he had set his foot upon our chest to press
   the very life out of us, yet if the Spirit of God helped us, we would
   reach out our hand and grasp the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word
   of God, and we would repeat the feat of Christian, against Apol-lyon,
   when he gave the fiend such grievous wounds that he spread his dragon
   wings and flew away! Therefore fear not, you tried ones, but trust in
   the Spirit of God and your conflict shall speedily end in victory!

   Sometimes our conflict is with past sin. We doubtfully enquire, "How
   can it be forgiven?" The temptation vanishes before the sight of the
   dying Redeemer! Then inbred lusts roar against us and we overcome it
   through the blood of the Lamb, for "the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,
   cleanses us from all sin." Sometimes a raging corruption, or a strong
   habit wars upon us--and then we conquer by the might of the sanctifying
   Spirit of God who is with us and shall be in us forever! Or else it is
   the world which tempts and our feet have almost gone--but we overcome
   the world through the victory of faith!

   And if Satan raises pride of life against us--the lust of the flesh,
   the lust of the eyes and the life all at once--we are still delivered,
   for the Lord is a wall of fire round about us! The inward fire bravely
   resists all sin and God's help is given to Believers to preserve them
   from all evil in the moment of urgent need, even as He helped His
   martyrs and confessors to speak the right words when called,
   unprepared, to confront their adversaries! Care not, therefore, oh you
   truster in the Lord Jesus, how fierce your enemy may be this day! As
   young David slew the lion and the bear and slew the Philistine, too,
   even so shall you go from victory to victory! " Many are the
   afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them
   all." Therefore, with a lion-like spirit, meet lions which seek to
   devour you!

   II. Now, then, we, come to our second head, which is--THE BELIEVER'S
   LIFE HAS ITS SWEETS. We are not always killing lions--we are sometimes
   eating honey! Certain of us do both at a time--we kill lions and yet
   cease not to eat honey--and truly it has become so sweet a thing to
   enter into conflict for Christ's sake, that it is a joy to contend
   earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. The same Lord who
   has bid us, "quit yourselves like men; be strong," has also said,
   "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again, I say, rejoice."

   The Believer's life has its sweets and these are of the choicest--for
   what is sweeter than honey? What is more joyful than the joy of a
   saint? What is more happy than the happiness of a Believer? I will not
   condescend to make a comparison between our joy and the mirth of
   fools--I will go no further than a contrast. Their mirth is as the
   crackling of thorns under a pot, which spit fire and make a noise and a
   flash--but there is no heat and they are soon gone out--nothing comes
   of it, the pot is long in boiling.

   But the Christian's delight is like a steady coal fire. You have seen
   the grate full of coals, all burning red and the whole mass of coal has
   seemed to be one great glowing ruby! And everybody who has come into
   the room, out of the cold, has delighted to warm his hands, for it
   gives out a steady heat and warms the body even to its marrow. Such are
   our joys! I would sooner possess the joy of Christ five minutes than I
   would revel in the mirth of fools for half a century! There is more
   bliss in the tear of repentance than in the laughter of gaiety--our
   holy sorrows are sweeter than the world-

   lings' joys. But, oh, when our joys grow full, Divinely full, then they
   are unspeakably like those above--and Heaven begins below!

   Did you never cry for joy? You say, perhaps, "Not since I was a child."
   Nor have I, but I have always remained a child as far as Divine joy is
   concerned. I could often cry for joy when I know whom I have believed
   and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed to
   Him! Ours is a joy which will bear thinking over. You can dare to pry
   into the bottom of it and test its foundation! It is a joy which does
   not grow stale. You may keep it in your mouth by the years together,
   and yet it never sours. You may return to it again and again, and
   again, and find it still as fresh as ever. And the best of it is there
   is no repentance after it. You are never sorry that you were so glad!

   The world's gay folk are soon sick of their drink, but we are only
   sorry that we were not gladder, still, for our gladness sanctifies! We
   are not denied any degree of joy to which we can possibly attain, for
   ours is a healthy, health-giving delight! Christ is the fullness of joy
   to His people and we are bid to enjoy Him to the fullest! Christians
   have their sweets and those are, as honey and the honeycomb, the best
   of the best! Of these joys there is plenty, for Samson found, as it
   were, a living spring of honey, since he discovered a swarm of bees. So
   abundant was the honey that he could take huge masses of the comb and
   carry it in his hands and go away with it, bearing it to others. In the
   love of Christ; in pardoned sin; in acceptance in the Beloved; in
   resting in God; in perfectly acquiescing in His will; in the hope of
   Heaven there is such joy that none can measure it. We have such a
   living swarm of bees to make honey for us in the precious promises of
   God, that there is more delight in store than any of us can possibly
   realize!

   There is infinitely more of Christ beyond our comprehension than we
   have as yet been able to comprehend. How blessed to receive of His
   fullness, to be sweetened with His sweetness and yet to know that
   infinite goodness still remains! Perhaps some of you have enjoyed so
   much of Christ that you could hardly bear any more--but your largest
   enjoyments are only as tiny shells filled by a single wave of the
   sea--while all the boundless ocean rolls far beyond your perception! We
   have exceedingly great joy, yes, joy to spare! Our Master's wedding
   feast is not so scantily furnished that we have to bring in another
   seat for an extra guest, or murmur to ourselves that we had better not
   invite at random lest we should be swarmed by too great a crowd.

   No, rather the pillared halls of mercy in which the King makes His
   feast are so vast that it will be our life-long business to furnish
   them with guests, compelling more and more to come in, that His house
   may be filled and that His royal festival may make glad ten thousand
   times ten thousand hearts! Dear Friends, if you want to know what are
   the elements of our joy, I have already hinted at them, but I will, for
   a moment, enlarge them. Our joys are often found in the former places
   of our conflicts. We gather our honey out of the lions which have been
   slain for us or by us. There is, first, our sin. A horrible lion that!
   But it is a dead lion, for Grace has much more abounded over abounding
   sin. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, I have never heard of any dainty in all
   the catalog of human joys that could match a sense of pardoned sin!
   Full forgiveness! Free forgiveness! Eternal forgiveness! See, it
   sparkles like dew of Heaven!

   To know that God has blotted out my sin is knowledge rich with
   unutterable bliss! My soul has begun to hear the songs of seraphim when
   it has heard that note, "I have blotted out your sins like a cloud, and
   as thick cloud your iniquities." Here is choice honey for you! The next
   dead lion is conquered desire. When a wish has arisen in the heart
   contrary to the mind of God and you have said--"Down with you! I will
   pray you down. You used to master me--I fell into a habit and I was
   soon overcome by you--but I will not, again, yield to you. By God's
   Grace I will conquer you." I say, when at last you have obtained the
   victory, such a sweet contentment perfumes your heart that you are
   filled with unspeakable joy and you are devoutly grateful to have been
   helped by the Spirit of God to master your own spirit. Thus you have
   again eaten spiritual honey!

   When you are ale to feel in your own soul that you have overcome a
   strong temptation, the fiercer it was and the more terrible it was, the
   louder has been your song and the more joyful your thanksgiving! To go
   back to Mr. Bunyan, again, when Christian had passed through the Valley
   of the Shadow of Death during the night, and when he had come entirely
   out of it and the sun rose, you remember he looked back. (A pause). He
   was long in taking that look, I guarantee you! What thoughts he had
   while looking back! He could just discern that narrow track with the
   quagmire on one side and the deep ditch on the other--and he could see
   the shades out of which the hobgoblins hooted and the fiery eyes
   glanced forth! He looked back by sunlight and thought within himself,
   "Ah me! What goodness has been with me! I have gone through all that
   and yet I am unharmed!"

   What a happy survey it was to him! Ah, the joy of having passed through
   temptation without having defiled one's garments! How must Shadrach,
   Meshach and Abednego have felt when they stepped out of the fiery
   furnace and were not even singed, neither had the smell of fire passed
   upon them! Happy men were they to have lived in the center of the
   seven-times-heated furnace where everything else was consumed! Here,
   again, is "a piece of the honeycomb." We find honey, again, from
   another slain lion--namely, our troubles after we have been enabled to
   endure them. This is the metal of which our joy-bells are cast! Out of
   the brass of our trials, we make the trumpets of our triumph! He is not
   the happy man who has seen no trouble, but, "blessed is he that endures
   temptation, for when he is tried, he shall receive a crown of life that
   fades not away."

   Death, too. Oh, the honey that is found in dead death! Death is,
   indeed, dead! We triumph over him and are no more afraid of him than
   little children are of a dead lion! We pluck him by the beard, and say
   to him, "O Death, where is your sting? O Grave, where is your victory?"
   We even look forward to the time of our departure with delight, when we
   shall leave this heavy clay and on spirit wings ascend unto our Father
   and our God! You see, there is a rich store of honey for God's people
   and we do not hesitate to eat it! Let others say what they will, we are
   a happy people, happy in Christ, happy in the Holy Spirit, happy in God
   our Father! So that Believers have their sweets.

   III. But the third is the point I want to dwell upon--THE BELIEVER'S
   LIFE LEADS HIM TO COMMUNICATE OF THESE SWEETS. As soon as we have
   tasted the honey of forgiven sin and perceived the bliss that God has
   laid up for His people in Christ Jesus, we feel it to be both our duty
   and our privilege to communicate the good news to others. Here let my
   ideal statue stand in our midst--the strong man, conqueror of the
   lion--holding forth his hands full of honey to his parents. We are to
   be modeled according to this fashion.

   And, first, we do this immediately. The moment a man is converted, if
   he would let himself alone, his instincts would lead him to tell his
   fellows. I know that the moment I came out of that little chapel in
   which I found the Savior, I needed to pour out my tale of joy! I could
   have cried with Cennick--

   "Now will I tell to sinners round, What a dear Savior I have found!
   I'll point to Your redeeming blood, And say, 'Behold the way to God!'"
   I longed to tell how happy my soul was and what a deliverance I had
   obtained from the crushing burden of sin! I longed to see all others
   come and trust my Lord and live! I did not preach a sermon, but I think
   I could have told out all the Gospel in that first hour!

   Did not you, my Friend, feel much the same? Did not your tongue long to
   be telling of what the Lord had done for you? Perhaps you are one of
   those proper and retiring people who are greatly gifted at holding
   their tongues and, therefore, you left the feet of Jesus in
   silence--silence which angels wondered at! Is that why you have held
   your tongue ever since? Perhaps if you had begun to speak, then, you
   would have continued your testimony to this day! I repeat my assertion
   that it is the instinct of every new-born soul to communicate the glad
   tidings which Grace has proclaimed in his heart. Just as Samson had no
   sooner tasted of the honey than he carried a portion of it to his
   father and mother, so do we hasten to invite our neighbors to Christ!

   My dear young Friend, as soon as ever you know the joy of the Lord,
   open your mouth in a quiet, humble way and never allow yourself to be
   numbered with the deaf and dumb! Let no one stop you from unburdening
   your heart! Do not follow the bad example of those who have become dumb
   dogs because of their cowardice at the beginning. The Believer will do
   this, first, to those who are nearest to him. Samson took the honey to
   his father and mother who were not far away. With each of us, the most
   natural action would be to tell a brother or a sister or a fellow
   workman, or a bosom friend. It will be a great joy to see them eating
   the honey which is so pleasant to our own palate!

   It is most natural in a parent, at once, to wish to tell his children
   of Divine Love--have you all done so? You pray for your children, but
   many of you would be the means of answering your own prayers if you
   would a talk with them, one by one! This may appear difficult, but once
   commenced, it will soon grow easy--and, indeed, if it is difficult, we
   should aspire to do it for that very reason! Should we not do many a
   difficult thing for Him who overcame all difficulties for us? At the
   least, do not deny to your own children the personal testimony of their
   father or their mother to the surpassing power of Grace and the
   unutterable sweetness of Divine Love. Tell it to those who are nearest
   to you. The Believer will do this as best he can.

   Samson, you see, brought the honey to his father and mother in a rough
   and ready style going on eating it as he brought it. If I wished to
   give honey to my father and mother, I should do it up rather
   daintily--I would at least put it in as respectable a dish as our
   kitchen could afford--but there were no plates and dishes out there in
   that Timnath vineyard and so his own hands were the only platters upon
   which Samson could present the delicacy! "He took some in his hands,
   and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat."
   Perhaps you think, "If I am to speak to any person upon true religion,
   I should like to do it in poetry." Better do it in prose, for perhaps
   they will take more notice of your verse than of your subject. Give
   them the honey in your hands and if there is no dish, they cannot take
   notice of the dish.

   "Yes, but, I should like to do it very properly," says one. "It is a
   very important matter. I should like to speak most correctly." But my
   judgment is, that as you will not be likely to attain correct speech
   all in a hurry and your friends may die while you are learning your
   grammar and your rhetoric, you had better tell them of Jesus according
   to your present ability! Tell them there is life in a look at Jesus!
   Tell them the story, simply, as one child talks to another. Carry the
   honey in your hands, though it drips all round--no hurt will come of
   the spilling--there are always little ones waiting for such drops. If
   you were to make the Gospel drip about everywhere and sweeten all
   things, it would be no waste, but a blessed gain to all around!
   Therefore, I say to you, tell of Jesus Christ as best you can and never
   cease to do so while life lasts.

   But then Samson did another thing and every true Believer should do it,
   too--he did not merely tell his parents about the honey, but he took
   them some of it. I do not read, "And he told his father and mother of
   the honey," but I read, "and he took some in his hands." Nothing is so
   powerful as an exhibition of Grace, itself, to others. Do not talk
   about it, but carry it in your hands! "I cannot do that," says one.
   Yes, you can, by your life, your temper, your spirit, your whole being!
   If your hands serve God, if your heart serves God, if your face beams
   with joy in the service of God, you will carry Grace wherever you go
   and those who see you will perceive it! You will hardly have need to
   say, "Come and partake of Grace," for the Grace of God in you will be
   its own invitation and attraction! Let our lives be full of Christ and
   we shall preach Christ! A holy life is the best of sermons!
   Soul-winning is worked by a winning life more surely than by winning
   words.

   Take note, also, that Samson did this with great modesty. We have
   plenty of people about, nowadays, who could not kill a mouse without
   publishing it in the Gospel Gazette! But Samson killed a lion and said
   nothing about it. He holds the honey in his hands for his father and
   mother--he shows them that--but we are specifically informed that he
   told not his father or his mother that he had taken it out of the
   carcass of the lion. The Holy Spirit finds modesty so rare that He
   takes care to record it! In telling your own experience, be wisely
   cautious. Say much of what the Lord has done for you, but say little of
   what you have done for the Lord! You need not make much effort to be
   brief on that point, for I am afraid that there is not much of it, if
   all were told! Do not utter a self-glorifying sentence! Let us put
   Christ to the front--and the joy and blessedness that comes of faith in
   Him--but as for ourselves, we need not speak a word except to lament
   our sins and shortcomings.

   The sum of what I have to say is this--if we have tasted any joy in
   Christ; if we have known any consolation of the Spirit; if faith has
   been to us a real power and if it has worked in us peace and rest, let
   us communicate this blessed discovery to others. If you do not do so,
   mark you, you will have missed the very objective for which God has
   blessed you! I heard the other day of a Sunday school address in
   America which pleased me much. The teacher, speaking to the boys, said,
   "Boys, here's a watch, what is it for?" The children answered, "To tell
   the time." "Well," he said, "suppose my watch does not tell the time,
   what is it good for?" "Good-for-nothing, Sir." Then he took out a
   pencil. "What is this pencil for?" "It is to write with, Sir." "Suppose
   this pencil won't make a mark, what is it good for?" "Good-for-nothing,
   Sir."

   Then he took out his pocket knife. "Boys, what is this for?" They were
   American boys and so they shouted--"to whittle with"--that is to
   experiment on any substance that came in their way by cutting a notch
   in it. "But," he said, "suppose it will not cut, what is the knife good
   for?" "Good-for-nothing, Sir." Then the teacher asked, "What is the
   chief end of man?" And they replied, "To glorify God." "But suppose a
   man does not glorify God, what is he good for?" "Good-for-nothing,
   Sir." That brings out my point most clearly--there are many professors
   of whom I will not say that they are good-for-nothing, but I think if
   they do not soon stir themselves up to glorify God by proclaiming the
   sweetness

   of God's love, it will go hard with them! Remember how Jesus said of
   the savorless salt, "Henceforth it is good for nothing"?

   What were you converted for? What were you forgiven for? What were you
   renewed for? What have you been preserved on earth for but to tell
   others the glad tidings of salvation and so to glorify God? Then go out
   with your hands full of the honey of Divine Love and hold it out to
   others! You must assuredly do good by this--you cannot possibly do
   harm. Samson did not invite his father and mother to see the lion when
   he was alive and roaring--he might have done some hurt in that case, by
   frightening them, or exposing them to injury. But he settled the lion
   business, himself, and when it came to honey, he knew that even his
   mother could not be troubled about that! Therefore he invited them both
   to share his gains. When you get into a soul-conflict, do not publish
   your distress to all your friends, but fight manfully in God's
   name--and when you possess the joy of Christ and the love of the Spirit
   and Grace is abundant in your soul--then tell the news to all around!

   You cannot do any hurt by such a proceeding! Grace does good and no
   harm, all its days. Even if you blunder over it, you will do no
   mischief. The Gospel spilled on the ground is not lost! Good, and only
   good must come of making known salvation by Jesus Christ! It will be
   much better for you to tell of the sweets of godliness than it will be
   to make riddles about the doctrine of it. Samson, afterwards, made a
   riddle about his lion and the honey--and that riddle ended in fighting
   and bloodshed. We have known certain Christians spend their lives in
   making riddles about the honey and the lion, by asking tough doctrinal
   questions which even angels cannot answer. "Riddle me this," they say,
   and then it has ended in a fight and brotherly love has been murdered
   in the fray.

   It is much better to bring your hands full of honey to those who are
   needy and present it to them that they may eat of it, than it is to
   cavil and discuss. No hurt can come of telling what the Lord has done
   for your soul and it will keep you out or mischief. Therefore, I would
   stir up all Christian people to continue, from day to day, exhibiting
   to needy sinners the blessedness of Christ, that unbelievers may come
   and eat thereof. By doing this you will be blessing men far more than
   Samson could bless his parents, for our honey is honey unto eternity,
   our sweets are sweets that last to Heaven and are best enjoyed there!
   Call upon others to taste and see that the Lord is good and you shall
   have, therein, much joy! You shall increase your own pleasure by seeing
   the pleasure of the Lord prospering in your hands.

   What bliss awaits useful Christians when they enter into Heaven, for
   they shall be met there by many who have gone before them whom they
   were the means of turning to Christ! I often inwardly sing when I
   perceive that I can scarcely go into any town or village but what
   somebody hunts me up to say to me, "Under God I owe my salvation to
   your sermons or to your books." What will be the joys of Heaven when we
   shall meet those who were turned to righteousness by our holding forth
   the Word of Life! Our Heaven will be seven heavens as we see them
   there! If you have done nothing but exhibit in your lives the precious
   results of Grace, you will have done well. If you have presented to
   your companions Truths of God that were sweetness, itself, to you, and
   tried to say in broken accents, "Oh that you knew this peace!" it shall
   give you unspeakable joy to meet those in Glory who were attracted to
   Christ by such a simple means!

                             All Joy in All Trials

   A Sermon

   (No. 1704)

   Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, February 4th, 1883, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
   knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let
   patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
   wanting nothing."--James 1:2-4.

   James calls the converted among the twelve tribes his brethren.
   Christianity has a great uniting power: it both discovers and creates
   relationships among the sons of men. It reminds us of the ties of
   nature, and binds us with the bonds of grace. Every one that is born of
   the Spirit of God is brother to every other that is born of the same
   Spirit. Well may we be called brethren, for we are redeemed by one
   blood; we are partakers of the same life; we feed upon the same
   heavenly food; we are united to the same living head; we seek the same
   ends; we love the same Father: we are heirs of the same promises; and
   we shall dwell for ever together in the same heaven. Wherefore, let
   brotherly love continue; let us love one another with a pure heart
   fervently, and manifest that love, not in word only, but in deed and in
   truth. Whatever brotherhood may be a sham, let the brotherhood of
   believers be the most real thing beneath the stars.

   Beginning with this word "brethren," James shows a true brotherly
   sympathy with believers in their trials, and this is a main part of
   Christian fellowship. "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the
   law of Christ." If we are not tempted ourselves at this moment, others
   are: let us remember them in our prayers; for in due time our turn will
   come, and we shall be put into the crucible. As we would desire to
   receive sympathy and help in our hour of need, let us render it freely
   to those who are now enduring trial. Let us remember those that are in
   bonds, as bound with them, and those that suffer affliction as being
   ourselves in the body. Remembering the trials of his brethren, James
   tries to cheer them, and therefore he says, "My brethren, count it all
   joy when ye fall into divers trials." It is a part of our high calling
   to rise ourselves into confidence; and it is also our duty to see that
   none of our brethren despond, much less despair. The whole tendency of
   our holy faith is to elevate and to encourage. Grace breeds no sorrow,
   except the healthy sorrow which comes with saving repentance and leads
   to the joy of pardon: it comes not to make men miserable, but to wipe
   all tears from their eyes. Our dream is not of devils descending a
   dreary staircase to hell, but of angels ascending and descending upon a
   ladder, the top of which leads to the shining throne of God. The
   message of the gospel is one of joy and gladness, and were it
   universally understood and received this world would be no longer a
   wilderness, but it would rejoice and blossom as the rose. Let grace
   reign in all hearts, and this earth will become a temple filled with
   perpetual song; and even the trials of life will become causes of the
   highest joy, so beautifully described by James as "all joy," as if
   every possible delight were crowded into it. Blessed be God, it is our
   work, not to upbraid, but to cheer all the brotherhood: we walk in a
   light which glorifies everything upon which it falls, and turns losses
   into gains. We are able in sober earnest to speak with the afflicted,
   and bid them be patient under the chastening hand of God; yea, to count
   it all joy when they fall into divers trials because those trials will
   work out for them such signal, such lasting good. They may be well
   content to sow in tears since they are sure to reap in joy.

   Without further preface we will come at once to the text; and observe
   that in speaking about affliction, for that is the subject of the text,
   the apostle notes, first, the essential point which is assailed by
   temptation, namely, your faith. Your faith is the target that all the
   arrows are shot at; the furnace is kindled for the trial of your faith.
   Notice, secondly, the invaluable blessing which is thus gained, namely,
   the proving of your faith, discovering whether it be the right faith or
   no. This proof of our faith is a blessing of which I cannot speak too
   highly. Then, thirdly, we may not overlook the priceless virtue which
   is produced by this process of testing, namely, patience; for the
   proving of your faith produces patience, and this is the soul's surest
   enrichment. Lastly, in connection with that patience we shall note the
   spiritual completeness which is thus promoted:--"That ye may be perfect
   and entire, lacking nothing." Perhaps you have noticed that little
   variations I have made in the text; but I am now following the Revised
   Version, which gives an admirable rendering. I will read it. "Count it
   all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations; knowing
   that the proof of your faith worketh patience. And let patience have
   its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in
   nothing."

   I. First, let us think a little upon THE ESSENTIAL POINT WHICH IS
   ASSAILED by temptation or trial. It is your faith which is tried. It is
   supposed that you have that faith. You are not the people of God, you
   are not truly brethren unless you are believers. It is this faith of
   yours which is peculiarly obnoxious to Satan and to the world which
   lieth in the wicked one. If you had not faith they would not be enemies
   of yours; but faith is the mark of the chosen of God, and therefore his
   foes become the foes of all the faithful, spitting their venom
   specially upon their faith. God Himself hath put enmity between the
   serpent and the woman, between the serpent's seed and the woman's seed;
   and that enmity must show itself. The serpent bites at the heel of the
   true seed: hence mockings, persecutions, temptations, and trials are
   sure to beset the pathway to faith. The hand of faith is against all
   evil, and all evil is against faith. Faith is that blessed grace which
   is most pleasing to God, and hence it is the most displeasing to the
   devil. By faith God is greatly glorified, and hence by faith Satan is
   greatly annoyed. He rages at faith because he sees therein his own
   defeat and the victory of grace.

   Because the trial of your faith brings honour to the Lord, therefore
   the Lord Himself is sure to try it that out of its trial praise may
   come to his grace by which faith is sustained. Our chief end is to
   glorify God, and if our trials enable us more fully to answer the end
   of our being it is well that they should happen unto us. So early in
   our discourse we see reason to count it all joy when we fall into
   manifold trials.

   It is by our faith that we are saved, justified, and brought near to
   God, and therefore it is no marvel that it is attacked. It is by
   believing in Christ that we are delivered from the reigning power of
   sin, and receive power to become the sons of God. Faith is as vital to
   salvation as the heart is vital to the body: hence the javelins of the
   enemy are mainly aimed at this essential grace. Faith is the standard
   bearer, and the object of the enemy is to strike him down that the
   battle may be gained. If the foundations be removed what can the
   righteous do? If the cable can be snapped whither will the vessel
   drift? All the powers of darkness which are opposed to right and truth
   are sure to fight against our faith, and manifold temptations will
   march in their legions against our confidence in God.

   It is by our faith that we live; we began to live by it, and continue
   to live by it, for "the just shall live by faith." Once let faith go
   and our life is gone; and hence it is that the powers which war against
   us make their main assault upon this royal castle, this key of the
   whole position. Faith is your jewel, your joy, your glory; and the
   thieves who haunt the pilgrim way are all in league to tear it from
   you. Hold fast, therefore, this your choice treasure.

   It is by faith, too, that Christians perform exploits. If men of old
   wrought daring and heroic deeds it was by faith. Faith is the fighting
   principle and the conquering principle: therefore it is Satan's policy
   to slay it even as Pharaoh sought to kill the male children when Israel
   dwelt in Egypt. Rob a Christian of his faith and he will be like Samson
   when his locks were cut away: the Philistines will be upon him and the
   Lord will have departed from him. Marvel not if the full force of the
   current shall beat upon your faith, for it is the foundation of your
   spiritual house. Oh that your faith may abide steadfast and unmovable
   in all present trials, that so it may be found true in the hour of
   death and in the day of judgment. Woe unto that man whose faith fails
   him in this land of peace, for what will he do in the swelling of
   Jordan?

   Now, think of how faith is tried. According to the text we are said to
   fall into "manifold temptations" or into "divers temptations"--that is
   to say, we may expect very many and very different troubles. In any
   case these trials will be most real. The twelve tribes to whom this
   epistle was written were a specially tried people, for in the first
   place they were, as Jews, greatly persecuted by all other nations, and
   when they became Christians they were cruelly persecuted by their own
   people. A Gentile convert was somewhat less in peril than a Jewish
   Christian, for the latter was crushed between the upper and nether
   millstones of Paganism and Judaism. The Israelitish Christian was
   usually so persecuted by his own kith and kin that he had to flee from
   them, and whither could he go, for all other people abhorred the Jews?
   We are not in such a plight, but God's people even to this day will
   find that trial is no sham word. The rod in God's house is no toy to
   play with. The furnace, believe me, is no mere place of extra warmth to
   which you may soon accustom yourself: it is often heated seven times
   hotter, like the furnace of Nebuchadnezzar and God's children are made
   to know that the fire burns and devours. Our temptations are no
   inventions of nervousness nor hobgoblins of dreamy fear. Ye have heard
   of the patience of Job--his was real patience, for his afflictions were
   real. Could each tried believer among us tell his own story I do not
   doubt we would convince all who heard us that the troubles and
   temptations which we have endured are no fictions of romance, but must
   be ranked among the stern realities of actual life.

   Ay, and note too, that the trials of Christians are such as would in
   themselves lead us into sin, for I take it that our translators would
   not have placed the word "temptation" in the text, and the Revisionists
   would not have retained it, if they had not felt that there was a
   colouring of temptation in its meaning, and that "trial" was hardly the
   word. The natural tendency of trouble is not to sanctify, but to induce
   sin. A man is very apt to become unbelieving under affliction: that is
   a sin. He is apt to murmur against God under it: that is a sin. He is
   apt to put forth his hand to some ill way of escaping from his
   difficulty: and that would be sin. Hence we are taught to pray, "Lead
   us not into temptation; because trial has in itself a measure of
   temptation"; and if it were not neutralized by abundant grace it would
   bear us towards sin. I suppose that every test must have in it a
   measure of temptation. The Lord cannot be tempted of evil, neither
   tempteth he any man; but this is to be understood of his end and
   design. He entices no man to do evil; but yet He tries the sincerity
   and faithfulness of men by placing them where sin comes in their way,
   and does its best or its worst to ensnare them: His design being that
   the uprightness of His servants may thus be proved, both to themselves
   and others. We are not taken out of this world of temptation, but we
   are kept in it for our good. Because our nature is depraved it makes
   occasions for sin, both out of our joys and our trials, but by grace we
   overcome the tendency of nature, and so derive benefit from
   tribulation. Do I not speak to many here who at times feel strong
   impulses towards evil, especially in the darksome hour when the spirit
   of evil walks abroad? Have you not been made to tremble for yourselves
   in season of fierce trial, for your feet were almost gone, your steps
   had well-nigh slipped. Is there any virtue that has not been
   weather-beaten? Is there any love that has not at times been so tried
   that it threatened to curdle into hate? Is there any good thing this
   side heaven which has marched all the way in silver slippers? Did ever
   a flower of grace blossom in this wretched clime without being tried
   with frost or blight? Our way is up the river; we have to stem the
   current, and struggle against a flood which would readily bear us to
   destruction. Thus, not only trials, but black temptations assail the
   Christian's faith.

   As to what shape they take, we may say this much: the trial or
   temptation of each man is distinct from that of every other. When God
   did tempt Abraham he was bidden to take his son, his only son, and
   offer him upon a mountain for a sacrifice. Nobody here was ever tried
   in that way: nobody ever will be. We may have the trial of losing our
   child, but certainly not the trial of having a command to offer him in
   sacrifice. That was a trial peculiar to Abraham: necessary and useful
   to him, though never proposed to us. In the case of the young man in
   the gospels, our Lord Jesus tried him with, "If thou wouldest be
   perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
   shalt have treasure in heaven." Some have dreamed that it must
   therefore be the duty of everybody to part with their possessions: but
   this is idle. It would not be the duty of any man to offer up his only
   son; and it is not the duty of every man to part with all his goods.
   These were tests to particular persons; and others equally special and
   searching have been applied in other cases. We are not to try
   ourselves, nor to desire other men's trials; it will be well if we
   endure those which the Lord appoints for us, for they will be wisely
   chosen. That which would most severely test me would perhaps be no
   trial to you; and that which tries you might be no temptation to me.
   This is one reason why we often judge one another so severely, because
   feeling ourselves to be strong in that particular point we argue that
   the fallen one must have been strong in that point too, and therefore
   must have willfully and earnestly have determined to do wrong. This may
   be a cruel supposition. We hastily conclude that the temptation must
   have been as feeble in his case as it would have been in our own; which
   is a great mistake, for a temptation which to you or to me would be no
   temptation at all, may be to another individual, of a peculiar
   constitution and under singular circumstances, a most fierce and
   terrible blast from the adversary, before which he falls mournfully,
   but not with malice aforethought. Divers trials, says the apostle, and
   he knew what he said.

   And, dear friends, sometimes these divers trials derive great force
   from their seemingly surrounding us, and cutting off escape: James
   says,--"Ye fall into divers temptations": like men who fall into a pit,
   and do not know how to get out; or like soldiers who fall into an
   ambuscade; or travellers in the good old times when two or three
   footpaths surrounded them and made them feel that they had fallen into
   bad hands. The tempted see not which way to turn; they appear to be
   hemmed in; they are as a bird that is taken in the fowler's snare. This
   it is that makes calamity of our manifold temptations, that they hedge
   up our way, and unless faith finds the clue we wander in a thorny maze.

   At times temptation comes suddenly upon us, and so we fall into it.
   When we were at rest, and were quiet, suddenly the evil came, like a
   lion leaping from the thicket. When Job's children were eating and
   drinking in their elder brother's house, then suddenly a wind came from
   the wilderness, and the patriarch was bereaved: the cattle were
   ploughing, the sheep were grazing, the camels were at their service,
   and in a moment, by fire from heaven, and by robber bands, the whole of
   these possessions vanished. One messenger had not told his story before
   another followed at his heels; Job had no breathing time, the blows
   fell thick and fast. The trial of our faith is most severe when divers
   trials happen to us when we look not for them. It is not strange in the
   light of these things that James should say, "Count it all joy when ye
   fall into divers trials"?

   Those were the days of tumults, imprisonment, crucifixion, sword, and
   fire. Then the amphitheatre devoured Christians by thousands. The
   general cry was "The Christians to the lions!" Do you wonder if
   sometimes the bravest were made to say, Is our faith really true? This
   faith which is abhorred of all mankind, can it be divine? Has it come
   from God? Why, then, does He not interpose and deliver His people?
   Shall we apostatise? Shall we deny Christ and live, or shall we go on
   with our confession through innumerable torments even to a bloody
   death? Will fidelity answer after all? Is there a crown of glory? is
   there an eternity of bliss? Is there in very deed a resurrection of the
   dead? These questions came into men's minds then, and were fairly
   faced: the faith of martyrs was not taken up at second hand, or
   borrowed from their parents; they believed for themselves in downright
   earnest. Men and women in those days believed in such a way that they
   never flinched nor started aside from fear of death; indeed, they
   pressed forward to confess their faith in Jesus in such crowds that at
   last the heathen cried, "There must be something in it: it must be a
   religion of God, or how could these men so gladly bear their troubles?"
   This was the faith of God's elect, the work of the Holy Ghost.

   You see, then, the main point of attack is our faith, and happy is the
   man whose shield can catch and quench all the fiery darts of the enemy.

   II. That we may make the text more clear we shall next notice THE
   INVALUABLE BLESSING WHICH IS GAINED BY THE TRIAL OF OUR FAITH. The
   blessing gained is this, that our faith is tried and proved. Two
   Sabbaths ago I addressed you upon the man whose bad foundations led to
   the overthrow of his house; and I know that many said after the
   sermon:--"God grant that we may not be like him: may we have a firm
   foundation for our soul to rest on." Then you went home, and you sat
   down and said, "Have I this sure foundation?" You began to question,
   argue, reason, and so on, and your design was a good one. But I do not
   reckon that much came of it; our own looking within seldom yields solid
   comfort. Actual trial is far more satisfactory; but you must not try
   yourself. The effectual proof is by trials of God's sending. The way of
   trying whether you are a good soldier is to go down to the battle: the
   way to try whether a ship is well built is, not merely to order the
   surveyor to examine her, but to

   send her to sea: a storm will be the best test of her staunchness. They
   have built a new lighthouse upon the Eddystone: how do we know that it
   will stand? We judge by certain laws and principles, and feel tolerably
   safe about the structure; but, after all, we shall know best if
   after-years when a thousand tempests have beaten upon the lighthouse in
   vain. We need trials as a test as much as we need divine truth as our
   food. Admire the ancient types placed in the ark of the covenant of
   old: two things were laid close together,--the pot of manna and the
   rod. See how heavenly food and heavenly rule go together: how our
   sustenance and our chastening are equally provided for! A Christian
   cannot live without the manna nor without the rod. The two must go
   together. I mean this, that it is as great a mercy to have your
   salvation proved to you under trial as it is to have it sustained in
   you by the consolations of the Spirit of God. Sanctified tribulations
   work the proof of our faith, and this is more precious than that of
   gold which perisheth, though it be tried by fire.

   Now, when we are able to bear it without starting aside, the trial
   proves our sincerity. Coming out of a trouble the Christian says to
   himself, "Yes, I held fast mine integrity, and did not let it go.
   Blessed be God, I was not afraid of threatening; I was not crushed by
   losses; I was kept true to God under pressure. Now, I am sure that my
   religion is not a mere profession, but a real consecration to God. It
   has endured the fire, being kept by the power of God."

   Next, it proves the truthfulness of our doctrinal belief. Oh, yes, you
   may say, "I have heard Mr. Spurgeon expound the doctrines, and I have
   believed them." This is poor work; but if you have been sick, and found
   a comfort in those doctrines, then you are assured of their truth. If
   you have been on the borders of the grave, and the gospel has given you
   joy and gladness, then you know how true it is. Experimental knowledge
   is the best and surest. If you have seen others pass through death
   itself triumphantly you have said, "This is proof to me: my faith is no
   guess-work: I have seen for myself." Is not this assurance cheaply
   purchased at any price? May we not count it all joy when the Lord puts
   us in the way of getting it? It seems to me that doubt is worse than
   trial. I had sooner suffer any affliction than be left to question the
   gospel or my own interest in it. Certainly it is a jewel worth
   purchasing even with our heart's blood.

   Next, your own faith in God is proved when you can cling to Him under
   temptation. Not only your sincerity, but the divinity of your faith is
   proved; for a faith that is never tried, how can you depend upon it?
   But if in the darkest hour you have still said, "I cast my burden upon
   the Lord, and He will sustain me," and you find He does sustain you,
   then is your faith that of God's elect. If in temptation you cry to God
   in prayer that you may keep your garment unspotted, and He helps you to
   do so, then also are you sure that yours is the faith which the Spirit
   begets in the soul. After a great fight of affliction, when I come
   forth a conqueror, I know that I do believe in God, and I know that
   this faith makes me a partaker of covenant blessings; from this I may
   fairly argue that my faith is of the right kind.

   I find it especially sweet to learn the great strength of the Lord in
   my own weakness. We find out under trial where we are most weak, and
   just then in answer to prayer strength is given answerable to the need.
   The Lord suits the help to the hindrance, and puts the plaster on the
   wound. In the very hour when it is needed the needed grace is given.
   Does this not tend to breed assurance of faith?

   It is a splendid thing to be able to prove even to Satan the purity of
   your motives. That was the great gain of Job. There was no question
   about his outward conduct, but the question was about his motive. "Ah,"
   says the devil, "he serves God for what he gets out of Him. Hast Thou
   not set a hedge about him and all that he has? His is cupboard love: he
   cares nothing for God Himself, he only cares for the reward of his
   virtue." Well, he is tried, and everything is taken away, and when he
   cries, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him," when he blesses
   the taking as well as the giving God, then the devil himself could not
   have the prudence to accuse him again. As to Job's own conscience, it
   would be quite settled and confirmed as to his pure love to God. My
   brethren, I reckon that the endurance of every imaginable suffering and
   trial would be a small price to pay for a settled assurance, which
   would for ever prevent the possibility of doubt. Never mind the waves
   if they wash you upon this rock. Therefore, when you are tempted,
   "Count it all joy" that you are tried, because you will thus receive a
   proof of your love, a proof of your faith, a proof of your being the
   true-born children of God.

   James says, "Count it." A man requires to be trained to be a good
   accountant; it is an art which needs to be learned. What muddles some
   of us would make if we had to settle accounts and manage disbursements
   and incomings without the aid of a clerk! How we should get entangled
   with balances and deficits! We could much easier spend money than count
   it. But when a man once knows the science of book-keeping, and gets
   into the way of it, he readily arrives at the true position of affairs.
   He has learned to count, and no error escapes his eye. James gives us a
   ready reckoner, and teaches us in our troubles how to count. He sets
   before us a different kind of measure from that which carnal reason
   would use: the shekel of the sanctuary was very different from the
   shekel in common commerce, and so is the counting of faith far other
   than that of human judgment. He bids us take our pen and sit down
   quickly and write at his correct dictation. You are going to write
   down, "Manifold temptations;" that would be so much on the wrong side:
   but instead thereof he bids you set down the proving of your faith, and
   this one asset transforms the transaction into a substantial gain.
   Trials are like a fire; they burn up nothing in us but the dross, and
   they make the gold all the purer. Put down the testing process as a
   clear gain, and, instead of being sorry about it, count it all joy when
   ye fall into divers trials, for this bestows upon you a proof of your
   faith. So far there is sufficient ground for counting all trials joy.
   Now, let us go a little further.

   III. Let us think of THE PRICELESS VIRTUE WHICH IS PRODUCED BY TRIAL,
   namely, patience; for the proof of your "faith worketh patience."
   Patience! We all have a large stock of it--until we need it, and then
   we have none. The man who truly possesses patience is the man that has
   been tried. What kind of patience does he get by the grace of God?
   First, he obtains a patience that accepts the trials as from God
   without a murmur. Calm resignation does not come all at once; often
   long years of physical pain, or mental depression, or disappointment in
   business, or multiplied bereavements, are needed to bring the soul into
   full submission to the will of the Lord. After much crying the child is
   weaned; after much chastening the son is made obedient to his Father's
   will. By degrees we learn to end our quarrel with God, and to desire
   that there may not be two wills between God and ourselves, but that
   God's will may be our will. Oh, brother, if your troubles work you to
   that, you are a gainer, I am sure, and you may count them all joy.

   The next kind of patience is when experience enables a man to bear
   ill-treatment, slander, and injury without resentment. He feels it
   keenly, but he bears it meekly. Like his Master, he opens not his mouth
   to reply, and refuses to return railing for railing. Contrariwise he
   gives blessing in return for cursing; like the sandal-wood tree which
   perfumes the axe which cuts it. Blessed is that holy charity which
   hopeth all things, endureth all things, and is not easily provoked. Ah,
   friend, if the grace of God by trial shall work in you the quiet
   patience which never grows angry, and never ceases to love, you may
   have lost a trifle of comfort, but you have gained a solid weight of
   character.

   The patience which God works in us by tribulation also takes another
   form, namely, that of acting without undue haste. Before wisdom has
   balanced our zeal we are eager to serve God all in a hurry, with a rush
   and a spurt, as if everything must be done within the hour or nothing
   would ever be accomplished. We set about holy service with somewhat
   more of preparedness of heart after we have been drilled in the school
   of trial. We go steadily and resolutely about work for Jesus, knowing
   what poor creatures we are, and what a glorious Master we serve. The
   Lord our God is in no hurry because He is strong and wise. In
   proportion as we grow like the Lord Jesus we shall cast aside
   disturbance of mind and fury of spirit. His was a grand life-work, but
   He never seemed to be confused, excited, worried, or hurried, as
   certain of His people are. He did not strive nor cry, nor cause His
   voice to be heard in the streets. He knew His hour was not yet come,
   and there were so many days in which He could work, and therefore He
   went steadily on till He had finished the work which His Father had
   given Him to do. That kind of patience is a jewel more to be desired
   than the gem which glitters on the imperial brow. Sometimes we blunder
   into a deal of mischief, making more haste than speed; and we are sure
   to do so when we forget to pray, and fail to commit our matters into
   the Divine hands. We may run with such vehemence that we may stumble,
   or lose our breath: there may be in our random efforts as much undoing
   as doing, for want of possessing our souls in patience.

   That is a grand kind of patience, too, when we can wait without
   unbelief. Two little words are good for every Christian to learn and to
   practise--pray and stay. Waiting on the Lord implies both praying and
   staying. What if the world is not converted this year! What if the Lord
   Jesus does not come to-morrow! What if still our tribulations are
   lengthened out! What if the conflict is continued! He that has been
   tried and by grace has obtained the true profit of his trials, both
   quietly waits and joyfully hopes for the salvation of God. Patience,
   brother! Is this high virtue scarce with thee? The Holy Spirit shall
   bestow it upon thee through suffering.

   This patience also takes the shape of believing without wavering, in
   the very teeth of strange providences and singular statements, and
   perhaps inward misgivings. The established Christian says, "I believe
   my God, and therefore if the vision tarry I will wait for it. My time
   is not yet come. I am to have my worst things first and my best things
   afterwards, and so I sit me down at Jesus' feet and tarry his leisure."

   Brothers and sisters, if, in a word, we learn endurance we have taken a
   high degree. You look at the weather-beaten sailor, the man who is at
   home on the sea: he has a bronzed face and mahogany-coloured flesh, he
   looks as tough as heart of oak, and as hardy as if he were made of
   iron. How different from us poor landsmen. How did the man become so
   inured to hardship, so able to breast the storm, so that he does not
   care whether the wind blows south-west or north-west? He can go out to
   sea in any kind of weather; he has his sea legs on: how did he come to
   this strength? By doing business in great waters. He could not have
   become a hardy seaman by tarrying on shore. Now, trial works in the
   saints that spiritual hardihood which cannot be learned in ease. You
   may go to school for ever, but you cannot learn endurance there: you
   may colour your cheek with paint, but you cannot give it that ingrained
   brown which comes of stormy seas and howling winds. Strong faith and
   brave patience come of trouble, and a few men in the church who have
   thus been prepared are worth anything in times of tempest. To reach
   that condition of firm endurance and sacred hardihood is worth all the
   expense of all the heaped-up troubles that ever come upon us from above
   or from beneath. When trial worketh patience we are incalculably
   enriched. The Lord give us more of this choice grace. As Peter's fish
   had the money in its mouth, so have sanctified trials spiritual riches
   for those who endure them graciously.

   IV. Lastly, all this works something better still, and this is our
   fourth head: THE SPIRITUAL COMPLETENESS PROMOTED. "That ye may be
   perfect and entire, wanting nothing." Brethren, the most valuable thing
   a man can get in this world is that which has most to do with his
   truest self. A man gets a good house; well, that is something: but
   suppose he is in bad health, what is the good of his fine mansion? A
   man is well clothed and well fed: that is something: but suppose he
   shivers with ague, and has no appetite through indigestion. That spoils
   it all. If a man is in robust health this is a far more valuable boon.
   Health is far more to be prized than wealth, or honour, or learning: we
   all allow that, but then suppose that a man's innermost self is
   diseased while his body is healthy, so that he is disgraced by vice or
   fevered with passion, he is in a poor plight, notwithstanding that he
   has such a robust frame? The very best thing is that which will make
   the man himself a better man; make him right, and true, and pure, and
   holy. When the man himself is better, he has made an unquestionable
   gain. So, if our afflictions tend, by trying our faith, to breed
   patience, and that patience tends to make us into perfect men in Christ
   Jesus, then we may be glad of trials. Afflictions by God's grace make
   us all-around men, developing every spiritual faculty, and therefore
   they are our friends, our helpers, and should be welcomed with "all
   joy."

   Afflictions find out our weak points, and this makes us attend to them.
   Being tried, we discover our failures, and then going to God about
   those failures we are helped to be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

   Moreover, our trials, when blessed of God to make us patient, ripen us.
   I do not know how to explain what I mean by ripening, but there is a
   sort of mellowness about believers who have endured a great deal of
   affliction that you never meet in other people. It cannot be mistaken
   or imitated. A certain measure of sunlight is wanted to bring out the
   real flavour of fruits, and when a fruit has felt its measure of
   burning sun it develops a lusciousness which we all delight in. So is
   it in men and women: a certain amount of trouble appears to be needful
   to create a certain sugar of graciousness in them, so that they may
   contain the rich, ripe juice of a gracious character. You must have
   known such men and such women, and have said to yourselves, "I wish I
   could be like them, so calm, so quiet, so self-contained, so happy, and
   when not happy, yet so content not to be happy; so mature in judgment,
   so spiritual in conversation, so truly ripe." This only comes to those
   in whom the proof of their faith works experience, and then experience
   brings forth the fruits of the Spirit. Dear brothers and sisters, there
   is a certain all-roundness of spiritual manhood which never comes to us
   except by manifold temptations. Let me attempt to show you what I mean.
   Sanctified trials produce a chastened spirit. Some of us by nature are
   rough and untender; but after awhile friends notice that the roughness
   is departing, and they are quite glad to be more gently handled. Ah,
   that sick chamber did the polishing; under God's grace, that depression
   of spirit, that loss, that cross, that bereavement,--these softened the
   natural ruggedness, and made the man meek and lowly, like his Lord.
   Sanctified trouble has a great tendency to breed sympathy, and sympathy
   is to the church as oil to machinery. A man that has never suffered
   feels very awkward when he tries to sympathize with a tried child of
   God. He kindly does his best, but he does not know how to go to work at
   it; but those repeated blows from the rod make us feel for others who
   are smarting, and by degrees we are recognized as being the Lord's
   anointed comforters, made meet by temptation to succour those who are
   tempted.

   Have you never noticed how tried men, too, when their trouble is
   thoroughly sanctified, become cautious and humble? They cannot speak
   quite so fast as they used to do: they do not talk of being absolutely
   perfect, though thy are the very men who are Scripturally perfect; they
   say little about their doings, and much about the tender mercy of the
   Lord. They recollect the whipping they had behind the door from their
   Father's hands, and they speak gently to other erring ones. Affliction
   is the stone which our Lord Jesus throws at the brow of our giant
   pride, and patience is the sword which cuts off its head.

   Those, too, are the kind of people who are most grateful. I have known
   what it is to praise God for the power to move one leg in bed. It may
   not seem much to you, but it was a great blessing to me. They that are
   heavily afflicted come to bless God for everything. I am sure that
   woman who took a piece of bread and a cup of water for her breakfast,
   and said, "What, all this, and Christ too!" must have been a tried
   woman, or she would not have exhibited so much gratitude. And that old
   Puritan minister was surely a tried man, for when his family had only a
   herring and a few potatoes for dinner, he said, "Lord, we bless Thee
   that Thou hast ransacked sea and land to find food for us this day." If
   he had not been a tried man, he might have turned up his nose at the
   meal, as many do at much more sumptuous fare. Troubled men get to be
   grateful men, and that is no small thing.

   As a rule, where God's grace works, these come to be hopeful men. Where
   others think the storm will destroy the vessel, they can remember
   storms equally fierce which did not destroy it, and so they are so calm
   that their courage keeps others from despair.

   These men, too, become unworldly men. They have had too much trouble to
   think that they can ever build their nest in this black forest. There
   are too many thorns in their nest for them to reckon that this can be
   their home. These birds of paradise take to their wings, and are ready
   to fly away to the land of unfading flowers.

   And these much-tempted ones are frequently the most spiritual men, and
   out of this spirituality comes usefulness. Mr. Greatheart, who led the
   band of pilgrims up to the celestial city, was a man of many trials, or
   he would not have been fit to lead so many to their heavenly rest; and
   you, dear brother, if ever you are to be a leader and a helper, as you
   would wish to be, in the church of God, it must be by such means as
   this that you must be prepared for it. Do you not wish to have every
   virtue developed? Do you not wish to become a perfect man in Christ
   Jesus? If so, welcome with all joy divers trials and temptations; fly
   to God with them; bless Him for having sent them: ask Him to help you
   to bear them with patience, and then let that patience have its perfect
   work, and so by the Spirit of God you shall become "perfect and entire,
   lacking in nothing." May the Comforter bless this word to your hearts,
   for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

The Hearing of Faith

   (No. 1705)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 11, 1883,

   BY C, H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "This only would I learn of you, did you receive the Spirit by the
   works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?" Galatians 3:2.

   A GREAT delusion is upon the heart of man as to his salvation. His ways
   are perverse. He does not love the Law of God, no, his mind is opposed
   to it and yet he sets up to be its advocate. When he understands the
   spirituality and severity of the Law, he reckons it to be a sore burden
   and yet, when the Gospel is preached and set forth as the gift of
   Sovereign Grace and he is bid, simply, to accept it by an act of faith
   in Christ Jesus, the man professes great concern about the Law, lest it
   should be made void by the freeness of Grace! He takes the broken
   pieces of the two tables of the Law and hurls them at the Cross! It is
   not that man loves the Law of God, but that he does not love the God of
   the Law! Hence he will resort to any pretense to oppose that way of
   salvation which God has appointed.

   Doubtless, if it had been possible for the Lord to have set forth
   another way of salvation, man would have opposed that, also, for he is
   determined to walk contrary to God. Be that as it may, there is a
   constant animosity in the minds of unregenerate men against the way of
   salvation by faith in Christ--and to oppose it, they set up the
   pretense of salvation by the works of the Law. Brothers and Sisters, in
   all our hearts there is this natural enmity to God and to the
   sovereignty of His Grace. Therefore it is that Believers have often to
   complain of the difficulties of faith. Faith in itself is, or ought to
   be, the easiest thing in the world, for a creature to believe in its
   Creator, for a child to believe in his father, ought to be the simplest
   and most natural thing in the world! But by reason of the corruption
   that remains, even, in the regenerate, there is always a struggling
   against this simple way of faith.

   There are times with the best man, when, in recollection of his many
   sins, Conscience says, "How can you believe that you are justified and
   accepted while so much of evil is found in you?" Unless we cleave to
   the promise of God and to His free mercy in Christ Jesus it will, then,
   go hard with us. The soul of the most sincere and upright man may be
   driven to despair by a sight of his own imperfections unless he clings
   to that righteousness by which sinners are justified through faith in
   Christ Jesus. Beloved, if this warfare is discovered, even, in the
   minds of those who are born-again, we must not wonder that it rages in
   the unregenerate!

   One would have thought that the moment we preached salvation by faith
   every sinner would have leaped up and accepted it. It is so simple, so
   easy, that surely every man would wish in this way to be forgiven and
   justified! Instead of which, all the reasoning, all the thoughtfulness,
   yes, all the cunning of unregenerate human nature is stirred up to
   fight against the method of deliverance by faith in Christ Jesus. "It
   is too good to be true," says one. Another cries, "If this is preached,
   it will lead men to think little of moral excellence." A third finds,
   in the Doctrines of Grace, inducements to inaction and so on, without
   end. These quibblings take hundreds of shapes, but, after all, they
   come to this--proud sinners must dictate to their offended Lord and be
   forgiven on their own terms.

   It would appear that God does not know the best way of saving men and
   men are so wise that they amend His methods! Is not this a refinement
   of blasphemy? It is a hideous farce to see a rebellious sinner suddenly
   become jealous about good works and greatly concerned for public
   morality! Does it not make laughter in Hell to see licentious men
   censuring the pure Gospel of the Lord Jesus and quibbling at free
   forgiveness because it might make men less mindful of purity? It makes
   one sick to see the hypocrisy of legalists! The reason of this
   contention lies in the fact that man is not only poor, but proud. He is
   not only guilty, but conceited, so that he will not humble himself to
   be saved upon terms of Divine charity. He will not consent to believe
   God--he prefers to believe in the proud falsehoods of his own
   heart--which delude him into the flattering hope that he may merit
   eternal life!

   Against this wicked spirit our text enters the fight. Let us see how it
   conducts the combat. The argument of the text is a very plain and
   powerful one. Paul puts it thus--"The Holy Spirit has been received by
   you Galatians. How did you receive the Holy Spirit--by the works of the
   Law or by the hearing of faith?" They were bound to admit, each one for
   himself, that they received the Holy Spirit by faith and by no other
   means! Now, the Holy Spirit is the choicest of all the gifts of God
   which are received into the soul--it is by the Spirit the work of the
   Lord Jesus is known and received! The Holy Spirit is, Himself, the seal
   of Divine favor and the token that we are at peace with God. I might
   almost say that the reception of the Holy Spirit is salvation--for when
   He enters into us, we are saved from death in sin, from the love of
   sin, from the power of sin and from the terror of sin!

   When He reigns in the heart, all the Divine Graces of a perfect
   character attend upon Him as courtiers upon a king. He becomes the
   source of life, light, love and liberty to our souls--and He even
   sanctifies our bodies. Know you not that your bodies are the temples of
   God when the Holy Spirit comes to dwell in them? To whom, then, the
   Holy Spirit is given, salvation is given in the highest sense! But how
   is that Holy Spirit received? The question is soon answered. He is not
   received by the works of the Law, but by the hearing of faith. I am
   going to handle this fact, first, as an argument of experience for all
   the people of God and, secondly, as an argument, at least, of
   observation for those who are seeking after Christ. May the Holy Spirit
   graciously aid us in our discourse.

   I. First, then, here is AN ARGUMENT OF EXPERIENCE FOR THE PEOPLE OF
   GOD. Before I dwell upon the personal experience of Believers who are
   here present, I would remind you of the experience of the Church of God
   as it is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. The book of the Acts of
   the Apostles is a confirmation of the correct answer to my text. The
   disciples were met together after our Lord's ascension and the Holy
   Spirit descended upon them--but in what way? Simply by their obeying
   the command of the Lord Jesus, "who commanded them that they should not
   depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which,
   says He, you have heard of Me."

   The gift was received by the hearing of faith, which led them to united
   prayer and waiting. They performed no ceremonies and entered upon no
   labors--the watchword was, "Tarry you till you are endowed with power
   from on high." The power came that they might work and not because they
   had worked! The gift of the Spirit came according to promise and not
   according to works! Very speedily the Spirit of God fell upon the
   people and 3,000 of them were converted and baptized. How came the
   Spirit of God upon Parthians, Medes, Elamites, the dwellers in
   Mesopotamia and so forth? Was it by the works of the Law?

   No, Beloved! Peter thus preached (Acts 2:38)--"Repent and be baptized,
   every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
   and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." When the thousands
   believed in Christ Jesus and confessed their faith by Baptism, the Holy
   Spirit was given them. So was it also in Samaria--"When they believed
   Philip preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God and the name
   of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women." And then we
   read that the Apostle Peter went to them and these Believers received
   the Holy Spirit--certainly not by the works of the Law, but by the
   hearing of faith were they thus blessed! Turn to the story of
   Cornelius. That good man had abounded in almsgiving and prayer--and yet
   the Holy Spirit fell not upon him.

   But, when the "hearing of faith" came, and they were assembled in the
   house with one accord to listen to Peter, then the Holy Spirit fell
   upon all them that heard the Word of God. "And they of the circumcision
   which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because
   that on the Gentiles, also, was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit!
   For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then answered
   Peter, "Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
   which have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?"

   Was it not the same when Paul went out and preached among the Gentiles?
   It was, indeed, so--startlingly so--that the news came to the Hebrew
   Christians who were at Jerusalem and no small dissension and
   disputation was the consequence! Here had been no circumcision, no
   proselyting to Judaism, no observation of any part of the Mosaic ritual
   and yet they heard that the Holy Spirit had fallen upon the
   Gentiles--and they had not even known the Law, much less fulfilled it!
   It needed all of Peter's influence to stem the flood. Hear how he puts
   it--"God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should
   hear the Word of the Gospel and believe. And God, which knows the
   hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as He did
   unto us." The Holy Spirit was received by believing Gentiles in every
   place where Paul had preached and, therefore, he could refer to these
   Galatians and use their experience to correct their errors. The fact
   that the Holy Spirit is given to the hearing of faith and not as a
   reward of works, runs like a silver thread

   through the whole of the Acts of the Apostles! Why, then, should men
   look to the works of the Law for that which was never given except to
   faith? What an infatuation to look to the mirage when a real well is
   open at their feet!

   Now I come to your own experience. You, beloved Friends, if you are,
   indeed, in Christ Jesus, have received the Holy Spirit! But how? Let us
   go over the list of His operations upon your minds. You received
   enlightenment by His means, by which you were led to understand the way
   of salvation and to behold the Glory of God in the face of Jesus
   Christ. Did you attain to that enlightenment by the works of the Law?
   Was it so in any one case? It has been my privilege to know many of you
   and to remember your confessions of faith--you told me that when you
   were seeking salvation by your own works you were blind and saw not the
   Light of God. The more you strove and the more you struggled, the more
   intense the midnight grew about you until you well-near despaired!

   Light came by a look at the Crucified! It came only by the hearing of
   faith! After that, you received peace, which peace, I trust, you enjoy
   this morning--"The peace of God which passes all understanding." But
   did you receive that peace while you were trusting in ceremonies, in
   baptism, or in the Lord's Supper, or in your own works? I know you did
   not, for true peace of conscience comes not in at that door! Did you
   obtain peace while you tried to repent so much, to weep so much, to
   feel so much, or to do so much? No, Brothers and Sisters, not an atom
   of peace ever came to your spirit until you looked away from yourself
   to the Lord Jesus, of whom you heard that He was able to save even the
   chief of sin-ners--and in whom you, therefore, by the Grace of God,
   believed! When faith came, peace grew out of it as a fruit of the Holy
   Spirit.

   Since then, you have received the Holy Spirit to help you in your
   sanctification, but you have obtained no sanctifica-tion apart from
   believing. If you have reached after sanctification by your own
   efforts, made in unbelief, you have never succeeded. Unbelief works
   towards sin and never towards sanctification! Our good works are fruits
   of sanctification, not causes of it, and if we put the fruit where the
   root should be, we greatly err. If you have gone out to fight against a
   temptation in your own strength, have you ever returned a conqueror? It
   has been written of all other Believers, "They overcame through the
   blood of the Lamb," and this is true of you, also. Sanctification does
   not come to us from self-reliance, but as a work of the Spirit received
   by faith in Christ. Believing in Him, He is "made of God unto us
   wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption."

   You have had besides, dear Friends, another gift of the Holy Spirit,
   namely, that of communion with God. But did you ever commune with the
   holy God on the footing of your own goodness? Never! Abraham never
   spoke with Jehovah on legal terms, for when he interceded with the
   Lord, he said, "I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord--I that am
   but dust and ashes." Yet he spoke with God in wondrous nearness and
   that is the point of it--to be dust and ashes in your own sight--and
   yet to commune with God as a friend! This is the daring of faith! This
   the Lord delights in! David said, "So foolish was I, and ignorant: I
   was as a beast before You. Nevertheless I am continually with You: You
   have held me by my right hand." A beast in his own esteem, and yet
   upheld by God, Himself, and allowed to live in favored fellowship with
   Him!

   Dear Friends, there is no communion with God except by faith, without
   which we cannot ever please God. The favorites of Heaven are, in every
   case, men who believe in God! Faith has the golden key of the ivory
   palaces. Faith opens the secret chambers of communion to those who love
   her. The works of the Law bring no nearness to God, in token whereof,
   none might come near to Sinai and if so much as a beast touched the
   mountain, it must be stoned or thrust through with a dart. And you,
   dear Friends, have received the Holy Spirit, often, as your Helper in
   prayer--"The Spirit also helps our infirmity." And I am sure it never
   was by the works of the Law. When infirmity has stopped your prayers
   and you could not cry as you would, then you have had no room to boast
   of good works--and yet then the Spirit has made "intercession for you
   with groans that could not be uttered." Your infirmity made you feel
   that it was by Grace, and by Grace, alone, that you were helped in your
   time of need.

   Now, as to the Holy Spirit's office of sealing the soul and working
   full assurance in the heart--as to the Holy Spirit's being the earnest
   of the future Glory, the pledge of joys to come--in all these, Grace
   reigns, and not merit! He that dwells in the least degree upon any
   phantom merit of his own has no earnest of the inheritance whatever! In
   fact, for him there is no inheritance, since an inheritance does not
   come by works. Neither has he that trusts in his works any pledge of
   joys to come, for he does not know that he has done enough to secure
   them. Neither can he have any comfortable rest in God, for his work is
   not finished and, therefore, he cannot rest. You know it, you that have
   toiled to save

   yourselves! Every Christian here must confess, "It is even so--we have
   received everything by faith and nothing by merit."

   Well, then, the inference is this--do not pump a dry well! If there is
   a fountain that is always flowing and overflowing, keep to it. Do not
   commit the double evil of forsaking the fountain of Living Water and
   hewing out for yourselves broken cisterns. Wait at that door which you
   have received everything as yet and do not go where you have received
   nothing except conviction and condemnation! Look not to Moses to bring
   you into Canaan--that can only be done by Joshua Jesus. Now, mark this
   inference--let every child of God ponder it--keep to "the hearing of
   faith." When you are under a sense of backsliding; when you feel
   unworthy to be called God's child; when you have erred and strayed from
   His ways like a lost sheep, do not rush like a madman to the Law, for
   that would be to leap into the fire! But say, "Lord, I believe in You.
   As a sinner I trust the sinner's Substitute."

   Whether you did truly come to Christ at the first, or not, is a point
   which you need not discuss, but begin again! Take with you, words, and
   come, by faith, to Jesus, and say, "Heal my backsliding. Receive me
   graciously and love me freely." By faith we can be restored, but never
   by doubting and despairing. We can only come to Christ by faith at
   first, and we can only return to Him in the same way! If you begin to
   doubt the mercy and love of God to you, you will backslide more and
   more! Your hope lies in holding on to this--"Be I what I may, yet God
   has not changed and there is still forgiveness with Him, that He may be
   feared. Therefore I will go with the language of the 51st Psalm upon my
   tongue and the penitence of David in my heart, and I will say, 'Create
   in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within

   me.'"

   Stick to your faith in Christ! Do not think that the greatness of your
   sin exceeds His atoning merit! Do not doubt but that He will still
   cleanse you and love you as before! Suppose you have not backslidden,
   but yet you are in the presence of a tremendous inward conflict. I will
   suppose that you are led to question whether you are the children of
   God at all, and persuaded to doubt your sonship. Now, be resolved to
   hold on to your faith in your heavenly Father! The devil is saying to
   you, "f you are the son of God." Do not yield to his "if." This is the
   way in which he attacked your Savior in the wilderness! A question
   about our sonship is the very point of the devil's sword and it is
   dipped in deadly poison-- therefore guard yourself with that Word of
   God, "To as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the
   sons of God, even to as many as believed on His name."

   Say, "I believe in Jesus Christ my Lord, who died for the ungodly, and
   in Him I am assured of being a child of God." You cannot resist
   temptation by doubting! Doubting is weakness--in believing is your
   might. "How can I believe," asks one. The elect of God believe--those
   who are born from above believe their Father's Word. If you can
   believe, you shall win great victories, but if you cast away your
   confidence, the battle is already lost. Above all, or over all, carry
   the shield of faith! Be sure to do this in the evil day when sin
   prevails. Is this too hard for you? What? Has it come to this, that
   when you feel you are a saint you can then trust to Christ? That is,
   you can trust Him when you can do without Him! Poor sham of faith! The
   genuine faith is a sinner's faith which trusts the Savior when signs,
   evidences and marks are all hid-den--and sin and temptation hold the
   upper seats.

   To believe that I, a sinner, am forgiven by the free Grace of God--that
   I, a poor, imperfect being, am yet accepted of God--this is faith! May
   we have power to trust the Lord Jesus in earnest; to trust Him with
   real sin and real unworthi-ness. Do this, dear Friends, with regard to
   the whole of your life's struggle. Some begin their religious life in
   the Spirit by faith, but they fancy that the rest of their spiritual
   life will have to be by works. They forget that the just shall live by
   faith. Those who say that though they are children of God, they may
   perish, after all, have not the true Gospel ring about them. If they
   are children of God, can they perish? How? Why? "Well, we must be
   watchful and prayerful." Precisely so! But is there no provision made
   to secure that you shall be watchful and prayerful? If not, then I tell
   you, Brothers and Sisters, you will never get to Heaven!

   You will fail in this watchfulness of yours and then where are you? My
   hope of Heaven lies in the belief that the Lord Jesus has redeemed me
   and will keep me! He will make me watchful and prayerful and work in
   me, by His Spirit, all else that is essential to my safety. "I know
   whom I have believed," and I am not afraid to add, "I am persuaded that
   He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him until that
   day." Brothers and Sisters, it is by such faith that we receive the
   Spirit--not by legal works and fears. At this present moment you are
   saved by faith, alone, are you not? Yes. Then I would persuade you to
   extend that faith over the whole area of your life. Believe for final
   preservation. Believe for com-

   plete salvation. Is it not written "He that believes on Him has
   everlasting life"? Can that life which is everlasting come to an end?
   Can eternal life expire? "Faithful is He that has called you, who also
   will do it."

   "Oh," you say, "I am half afraid to believe so bravely, for it might
   make me careless." This is a mistake--faith works by love, it never
   tends to sloth. My dear Friend, if you look to yourself in any degree
   your foot is beginning to slip. Put the future where you put the past,
   namely, into the hands of Him that is able to keep you from falling!
   Believe in Jesus for a life as well as for an hour, and He will keep
   you with spotless garments to the end! Stand on the sure rock of the
   Lord's finished work and not on the dubious ground of your own
   carefulness. Works done by the efforts of our own strength are poor
   things, but the work of the Grace of God upon our spirit is precious.
   Let all be of Grace and nothing of self! The two will no more go
   together than oil and water will mix. Do not try to trust partly in
   Christ and partly in self--as well yoke an archangel with an ant, or a
   cherub with a cricket! Salvation is of the Lord, alone, from first to
   last!

   Brothers and Sisters, let us keep in this condition when we are
   comparing ourselves with other saints of God. I sometimes read
   biographies which make me cover my face for shame because I fall so far
   short of the attainments of certain Believers. This humbling is good
   for us. What ought we to do when we feel it? To begin to doubt the Lord
   and imagine that the Lord Jesus cannot or will not save us? Far from
   it! Faith should rise by observing what the Lord has done for other
   poor sinners like ourselves, for He is able to do the same for us.
   Remember that the safety of the weak and of the strong Believer rests
   upon the same foundation!

   This may be seen in a figure. On board one of the fine steamboats which
   flit between England and America I see a strong, hardy, vigorous man.
   Will he get to America safely? Yes, if the ship does. But look, yonder
   is a little child which cannot walk and has to be carried in its
   mother's arms. Will it reach America safely? Yes, if the ship does.
   Both the robust man and the little infant, all being well, will reach
   their journey's end--if the ship does. Their safety lies in the same
   place. Their condition does not affect their transit. But is there no
   difference between the child and the man? Assuredly, a great deal of
   difference as to many things--but there is no difference about the fact
   that their passage across the ocean depends upon the steamboat, rather
   than upon themselves!

   So, if you meet with a great saint, say to yourself, "My honored
   Brother will get to Heaven through Jesus Christ. And I, a poor babe in
   Grace, shall get to Heaven in the same way." I want you children of God
   to feel this. Are you on board the Covenant transport? Does the
   blood-red flag fly at the masthead? Then, if the weakest Believer is
   not safely carried into port, neither will the strongest child of God
   reach the fair havens! If that ship of Free Grace goes down, Peter and
   Paul must sink as well as ourselves, for we are at sea in the same
   vessel! Our confidence is in no measure or sense in what we are, but
   altogether in what Christ is on our behalf! We depend on Jesus and rest
   in Jesus by a simple faith and the brightest of martyrs and Apostles
   has no surer ground to rest on!

   When you come to die, do not look upon death through the glass of the
   Law, for if so, it will be terrible for you! But believe this--that to
   die by faith is to enter into life! I hardly like to use the word,
   death in such a connection, for it is not dying at all, but "departing
   out of this world unto the Father." By faith, to die is such sweet work
   as you, poor Despondency, and you, Much-Afraid, will be able to
   accomplish as safely as Valiant-for-Truth, or Great-Heart himself! By
   faith we swallow up death in victory! They that have served God for 50
   years faithfully and without fault, when they come to die, have, in
   every case gathered up their feet in the bed and said, "Into Your hands
   I commit my spirit." But never has one of them died pleading his own
   religiousness and claiming a reward as due to his works! Trusting in
   Jesus is the universal spirit of the most praiseworthy Believers!

   Well, if they flung every other hope away except that which was
   presented to them in Christ, you, dear Friend, need not hesitate to do
   the same! And as they were secure and triumphant, even so shall you be!
   This is the argument, then-- you have obtained nothing except by the
   hearing of faith--therefore, keep to the way of faith even to your last
   hour, for wisdom teaches you to do so.

   II. But now I want to throw all my strength into the second part of the
   sermon, which is this--I want to use this AS AN ARGUMENT DERIVED FROM
   OBSERVATION FOR THE USE OF SEEKERS. I say "observation," but in part,
   it might be called an argument from experience, for, at any rate, on
   the negative side it is so. Listen, dear Hearer, you have not yet found
   rest, you are not yet saved--and so far you have obtained no advantage
   by the works of the Law. By your own honesty, generosity and
   righteousness, you have not been justified, nor have you received a new
   heart, or any other gift of the Spirit. Why continue at this
   unprofitable business?

   Some try Church attendance, Chapel attendance, Bible-reading,
   sacraments, forms of prayer and the like--but nothing comes of it. Hear
   how they repeat their Ave Marias and their Pater Nosters! And not only
   Romanists, but so-called Protestants are puffed up with the hope that
   by formal worship they will be saved! But they make no headway and are
   still without salvation! Let me ask you work-trusters, have you any
   rest? Are you prepared to die? Would you be willing to die at once? No!
   Your position is one of unrest, fear and dread! Why not abandon this
   vain method of building, for "unless the Lord builds the house they
   labor in vain that build it!" Instead of following out your own way of
   salvation by the works of the Law, why not try the Lord's appointed way
   of the hearing of faith?

   Has He not said, "Hear and your soul shall live"? Are willing to let me
   explain it? The "hearing of faith"--this is the way by which the Spirit
   of God comes to men. "What kind of hearing," asks one, "is that?" Well,
   to begin with, it is personal hearing, listening to the Word of God for
   yourself. I have heard of one who had a dream in which he thought he
   stood at the gates of Heaven and his wife with him. She went in, but
   the pointer shut him out, saying, "The other day you said to your wife,
   'Mistress, you may go to Church and pray for us both,' and now she
   shall go to Heaven for you both, and you must stay outside." Is not
   that just? There must be a personal hearing! I pray you, do not absent
   yourselves from the hearing of the Word of God, for, "faith comes by
   hearing, and hearing by the Word of God."

   That last sentence reminds me that the hearing must be the hearing of
   the Gospel. I wish people were more careful upon that point. You will
   not receive the Holy Spirit by merely hearing a man talk. He may be
   eloquent, he may be clever and he may be pious, but mark you, if he
   does not preach the Gospel, saving faith cannot come of your hearing
   it! Too many people go to that place of worship which is nearest to
   their houses and never mind what is preached so long as there is an
   attractive service. Oh, Sirs, do not thus play the fool with
   yourselves! The faith that saves you cannot come to you by hearing
   anything which comes first--it only comes by hearing the testimony of
   the Spirit to the appointed Savior!

   The right kind of hearing is an attentive hearing. There is a great
   difference between hearing and hearing. If I were to say, "There is a
   ship going to sail next Tuesday for New Zealand," the most of you would
   hear it and think no more of it. But suppose there should be a person
   here who is in great haste to reach New Zealand? He will catch at my
   words and be round in the vestry to make further enquiries. This is the
   kind of hearing which the Gospel requires! You are in one of our great
   stations and you hear a person say, "That train is for Exeter." The
   information is lost upon you, for you are bound for Oxford and it is as
   though you heard it not. But suppose you were bound for Exeter? You
   would catch at the sound and make use of the news!

   Now, I am talking about the salvation of man from the power of sin; the
   salvation of man from the guilt of sin; the preparation of man for a
   holy life on earth and an eternal life of bliss in Heaven--if you have
   the hearing of faith, you will feel that this subject is one which
   concerns yourself--you will be anxious to know more about it and you
   will give your mind to its consideration! This is the sort of hearing
   by which faith comes. Do not lend your ears to others, but hear for
   yourself! Go where the Gospel is preached and hear it with both your
   ears. Drink it in as an ox drinks at the stream. Treasure up every word
   as the ants store up grain. Test all as goldsmiths test gold--and then
   receive the Truth of God as babes drink in milk from the breast. This
   is "the hearing of faith."

   "But what is this faith," asks one, "this 'hearing of faith?'" I will
   try to work out the idea. You begin with hearing the Gospel and
   believing that it comes from God. I suppose nearly everybody here
   believes the Bible to be the Word of God. Very well, when you hear that
   teaching which is consistent with Scripture, the hearing of faith is to
   accept it as God's Word and, therefore, true and worthy of your
   reverent attention. The Gospel is the voice of God and it comes by the
   Spirit of God--a belief of this Truth of God will help you to hear it
   reverently--and it will prepare your mind to receive it. Then remember,
   if it is God's Word, a genuine faith in God knows of no difficulties
   whatever! A man who believes the Bible to be Inspired, just as readily
   believes that the whale swallowed Jonah, or that Joshua stopped the
   sun, as he believes that Abraham interceded for Sodom, or that Paul was
   a prisoner at Rome.

   Knowing the Gospel to be God's Testimony, we believe it all! That is
   the way in which to hear the Gospel. Say to yourself, "This is God's
   Gospel. It is wonderfully grand and good, and it is not, therefore, a
   matter of doubt. That I may be saved in one single minute by believing
   in Jesus; that every sin I have ever committed, however black, may all
   be washed away as the clock ticks again--these are wonderful things and
   I believe them because the Lord has said so. It is not mine to quibble,
   question, or argue--if there are any difficulties in these great
   promises, those difficulties belong to

   God--not to me. Let the Lord promise what He pleases, I am ready to
   believe it because He is able to perform His own word."

   Then, "the hearing of faith" signifies, further, that we venture our
   eternal interests upon the truth of what we hear. I use the word,
   "venture," advisedly. One of our hymns puts it--

   "Venture on Him, venture wholly, Let no other trust intrude."

   I have heard critics object that it is no venture, but a certainty,
   when men trust in Christ. But I venture to assert that when a man is in
   trouble of spirit, faith is a venture to him--it appears to him to be
   the greatest venture possible! He that says, "This Gospel which I have
   heard is true and I will venture my soul upon the truth of it," he is
   the man who has given to the Gospel "the hearing of faith"! Let me try
   to set forth faith yet again--this bridge is strong enough to carry me
   over the stream, therefore I am going over the stream upon it. That is
   real faith. Faith is a most practical principle in daily life. The most
   of trade hangs on trust. When a man sows wheat, he has to scatter it
   into the furrows and lose it. He does so because he has faith that God
   will send a harvest.

   When the sailor loses sight of the shore, he has to sail by
   faith--believing in his compass, he feels safe though he may not see
   land for weeks! Faith is the hand which receives what God presents to
   us and, therefore, it is a simple child-like thing. When a child has an
   apple offered to him, the child may know nothing about the orchard in
   which the apple grew, and he may know nothing of the mechanism of his
   hand and arm, but it is quite enough for him to take the apple. Faith
   does the most effectual thing for the soul when it takes what God
   gives! All the rest may be or may not be, faith is the main thing. When
   God holds out to me, salvation by Christ Jesus, I need not ask anything
   further about it, but just take it to myself and be at once saved, for
   by faith the Spirit of God is received.

   Once more, "the hearing of faith" is when a man hears and accepts the
   Gospel and then holds to it under opposition. When conscience reminds
   you that you are a guilty man, you must still hold to peace by the
   blood of Jesus. What says the Word of God? It tells you that he that
   believes in Jesus is not condemned and you must believe that, whatever
   your own judgment and feelings may say. When the devil, as the accuser
   of the Brethren, howls out, "You cannot be saved! Look at your
   imperfections and transgressions!" then reply, "But I am saved,
   whatever my imperfections and my sins may be, for it is written, 'He
   that believes and is baptized shall be saved.' I have obeyed both
   precepts and, therefore, I shall be saved, despite your rage."

   Poor Sinner, have you not seen that this is the way the Holy Spirit has
   come to others? Your Christian friends have all told you that this is
   the way they obtained mercy. Will you not make an attempt in the same
   way, and hear and believe as a little child? Believe God's Word! Do not
   wish to be anything or to do anything--just trust in what Jesus is and
   did. You shall have the Holy Spirit and you shall feel as you have
   never felt before, if you will have "the hearing of faith." I need your
   attention for a minute while I mention some of the points in the Gospel
   out of which this "hearing of faith" generally comes. What truth is it
   which men most readily believe? The first is this. A man says, "I
   cannot believe," but he can hear, and he hears that God has sent forth
   His Son Jesus Christ to be the Savior of men. "God has sent Him," he
   says, "the offended God has appointed a Mediator. Christ does not come
   as an amateur, but as an Ambassador authorized of Heaven." "Then," he
   says, "I will trust Him whom God has ordained to be a Savior."

   Next, while listening to the Gospel, the man hears about the Person of
   the Lord and sees who He is, namely, that He is God's only-begotten
   Son, equal and co-eternal with the Father and yet, He is, in the
   fullest sense, Man, in our nature. I have known many a soul say, "I can
   trust Jesus, since He is God and able to save me, and Man, and thus
   willing to save me." By that celestial lamp many have seen their way to
   faith. Oh, that faith may come to you while you are hearing me! Another
   very blessed nail on which faith loves to hang all its weight is the
   sufferings of Christ--for, being found in fashion as a Man, He humbled
   Himself and became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross. See
   Him languishing upon the cruel tree, bleeding out His life for unworthy
   men, His enemies, that they might live through Him!

   Many and many a time that sight has turned a doubter into a Believer.
   Thousands have seen the Cross and felt that they must believe. Another
   nail of which many have learned to hang all their hope has been
   Christ's risen power. They have heard of Him, that He is now in Glory,
   at the right hand of God, making intercession for transgressors--and
   this has been the star of hope to the desponding. Is it not a joy that
   God also has highly exalted Him, so that He is able to save to the
   uttermost all that come unto God by Him? Myriads of tremblers have felt
   faith leap up from their hearts like the

   water from the rock in the wilderness, when Christ has been set before
   them as exalted to be a Prince and a Savior, giving both repentance and
   remission of sins. They have been trying to believe, before, but now
   they believe without trying!

   Trying to believe is a very stupid operation--you cannot do it! Minds
   work not so. But when a man sees a thing to be true, he believes it as
   a matter of course. He is convinced by the blessed fact of Christ's
   Resurrection and Ascension that He is able to save, and so he trusts
   Him to save him. Thus he receives the Spirit. I have known many that
   have been led to believe by hearing of the work and Grace of the Holy
   Spirit. They have heard the preacher say that the Holy Spirit can raise
   men from their death in sin; that He can renew the heart; that He can
   change the will and conquer the passions. They have said, "Is it so? Is
   God, Himself, willing to work with me to make me holy? Then I will
   trust Him." Thus faith comes.

   Sometimes, also, when we have preached free forgiveness, full
   redemption, irreversible acceptance, infinite love, boundless Grace,
   unchallengeable justification--when we have declared that the Lord's
   mercy endures forever and that men have but to look to Jesus and then
   and there find eternal life--then faith has dropped on men's minds as
   dew upon the grass! Our Hearers have felt that such tidings must be
   true, for nobody could have invented them! The Gospel has the stamp of
   Deity upon it and this commends it to man's heart. Free Grace and dying
   love are worthy of faith and they win faith! I pray that all of you who
   are seekers may give up all trying to feel, trying to work, trying to
   be, and may just come and put your trust in Jesus! Then shall you be
   saved and then you may work, feel and do as much as you like.

   Then shall you abound in good works and the more the merrier! Then you
   shall fight with sin and overcome it! Then shall you set up a high
   standard and reach it! Then shall you strive after holiness and
   manifest it. But do not begin where you ought to leave off! Do not put,
   as the proverb has it, the cart before the horse! Do not place the top
   of the house where the foundation ought to be! But as you never did
   obtain anything by the works of the Law, come and try "the hearing of
   faith," and you shall receive all that you need in Christ Jesus. God
   grant it, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

The Cast-Off Sash

   (No. 1706)

   DELIVERED AT THE THURSDAY EVENING LECTURE,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Thus said the Lord unto me, Go and get a linen sash, and put it around
   your waist, and put it not in water. So I got a sash, according to the
   word of the Lord, and put it around my waist. And the word of the Lord
   came unto me the second time, saying, Take the sash that you acquired,
   which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it
   there in a hole of the rock. So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as
   the Lord commanded me. And it came to pass after many days, that the
   Lord said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the sash from
   there, which I commanded you to hide there. Then I went to the
   Euphrates, and dug, and took the sash from the place where I had hid
   it: and, behold, the sash was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
   Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Thus says the Lord,
   After this manner willImar thepride of Judah, and the great pride of
   Jerusalem. This evil people, who refuse to hear My words, who follow
   the dictates of their hearts and walk after other gods, to serve them,
   and to worship them, shall even be as this sash, which is good for
   nothing. For as the sash clings to the waist of a man, so ha ve I
   caused to cling unto Me the whole house of Israel and the whole house
   of Judah, says the Lord; that they might be unto Me for a people, and
   for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not
   hear." Jeremiah 13:1-11.

   GOD'S servants, in olden times, were very anxious to be understood when
   they spoke. They were not content because the people listened to them,
   or because they were to their hearers as "a very lovely song of one
   that has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument." They
   reckoned the people's approval of their style to be proof of its
   failure. Had it wounded their hearts, it would not have gratified their
   tastes. They wanted the Truth of God to go home to men, so that they
   could no longer discuss modes of speech, or methods of action, but
   would be compelled to remember the message and feel its force. They
   reckoned that they had done nothing unless they riveted attention,
   excited thought and impressed the heart.

   Oh that all preachers were as solemnly in earnest in all their
   addresses as Jeremiah was--we might then hope to see more true
   conversions and less of the flimsy religion of the day! The people of
   Israel and Judah were so sunk in thoughtlessness that it was absolutely
   necessary to do something more than speak. Prophet after Prophet had
   spoken, "but they would not hear." Even though Jeremiah, the most
   plaintive of all the Prophets, spoke in such melting tones that it must
   have been difficult to turn away from him with indifference, yet they
   remained so hardened that God described them as, "this evil people, who
   refuse to hear My words, who follow the dictates of their hearts."

   Though the Prophet wept, entreated and persuaded, yet they regarded him
   not, but turned on their heels and went, each one, his own way to his
   merchandise, to his idolatry, to his adultery, or to his oppression.
   Therefore the Lord bade His servants add to their speech certain
   symbols which the people would see with their eyes, which would be
   talked about as strange things and so, would excite attention and
   command consideration. Perhaps, by this means the Lord would extort
   from some of them a deeper thought, and bring them penitently to their
   knees. It is better for preachers to do odd things than for men to be
   lost!

   If plain talk fails, we may even use emblems and signs, for we cannot
   let the careless ones perish without another attempt to get at them. Oh
   that by any means we might save some! In many instances the Prophets
   were told to do singular things and among the rest was this--Jeremiah
   must take a linen sash, put it about his waist and wear it there till
   the people had noticed what he wore and how long he wore it. This sash
   was not to be washed--this was to be a matter ob-

   served of all observers--for it was a part of the similitude. Then he
   must make a journey to the distant river Euphrates and take off his
   sash and bury it there. When the people saw him without a sash, they
   would make remarks and ask what he had done with it, and he would reply
   that he had buried it by the river of Babylon.

   Many would count him mad for having walked so far to get rid of a
   sash--250 miles was certainly a great journey for such a purpose!
   Surely he might have buried it nearer home, if he must bury it at all.
   There was the Jordan--he might have gone to its bank, dug a hole and
   hid the garment there, if he thought it well to do so. There would be a
   good deal of talk about Jeremiah's eccentric conduct, but the more
   thoughtful would endeavor to spell out his meaning, for they would feel
   sure that he meant much by it. Soon the Prophet goes a second time to
   the Euphrates and they say one to another--The Prophet is a fool! The
   spiritual man is mad! See what a trick he is playing. Nearly a thousand
   miles the man will have walked in order to hide a sash and to dig it
   up, again! What will he do next?

   Whereas plain words might not have been noticed, this little piece of
   acting commanded the attention and excited the curiosity of the people.
   Blame us not if we sometimes dramatize the Truth of God--we must win
   men's hearts--and to do so we dare even run the risk of being called
   theatrical! Jeremiah might have been ridiculed as an actor, but he
   would not have fretted much under the charge if he saw that he had
   succeeded in teaching the people the Truth which God would have them
   learn. When our young folks cannot learn by books, we try the
   kindergarten method, and we will sooner teach them by toys than leave
   them ignorant! Even so was it with the old Prophets. They would use
   emblems rather than leave the people in the dark.

   The record of this singular transaction has come to us and we know
   that, as a part of Holy Scripture, it is full of instruction. Thousands
   of years will not make it so antique as to be valueless! The Word of
   the Lord never becomes old so as to lose its vigor--it is still as
   strong, for all Divine purposes, as when first of all Jehovah spoke it!
   This Bible is the oldest of instructors and yet it wears the dew of its
   youth! Like the sea, it is ancient as the ages, but time has written no
   furrow on its brow. It is always venerable, yet ever novel--eternal,
   yet always fresh. Even the symbol of Jeremiah, which was so strikingly
   adapted to his age and time, is quite as well suited to this present
   year of Grace. May the Holy Spirit give us all instruction thereby.

   I. And, first, in our text we have AN HONORABLE EMBLEM of Israel and
   Judah. We may say, in these days, an emblem of the Church of God. I say
   it is an honorable emblem. I hardly know of one which is more so except
   when the Church is called a Crown of Glory, or a Royal Diadem, or,
   better still, the Bride, the Lamb's Wife. The people were compared to a
   linen sash with which the Prophet, in the type, girt himself, but which
   God explains to be His sash, "for as the sash clings to the waist of a
   man, so have I caused to cling unto Me the whole house of Israel and
   the whole house of Judah, says the Lord."

   Notice first, then, that God had taken this people to be bound to
   Himself. He had taken them to be as near to Him as the sash is to the
   Oriental when he binds it about his waist. The eastern merchant or
   worker does not go out without his sash--it is an essential part of his
   dress, keeping all the rest together--and so the Lord declares that He
   had taken His people and had bound them about Himself to be near to Him
   and fastened about Him, so that He would not go forth without them.
   Often He speaks of them as "a people near to Me." Had they acted as
   they should have done, so as to be not only the natural but the
   spiritual seed of Israel, they would have enjoyed what every true
   Believer may enjoy, namely clinging unto God as a sash clings unto a
   man, for the Lord's own sanctified ones are bound unto God by God,
   Himself, so as never to be torn away from Him.

   I invite you, beloved of the Lord, to consider your choice privilege in
   thus being, as it were, girt about the waist of God. It is a wonderful
   metaphor. In infinite condescension the Lord has put it so--the
   Believer's place is near his God in intimate, continuous, open
   fellowship. What can be more intimately associated with a man's most
   vital parts than his belt? What can be nearer to the life of God than
   His living people? The traveler in the East takes care that his sash
   shall not go unfastened--he girds himself securely before he commences
   his work or starts upon his journey, and God has bound His people round
   about Him so that they shall never be removed from Him. "I in them,"
   says Christ, even as a man is in his belt.

   "Who shall separate us?" says Paul. Who shall ungird us from the heart
   and soul of our loving God? "They shall be Mine, says the Lord." They
   are His and always shall be His! Neither shall any tear them away from
   Him, for by Covenant and by promise are they bound up with the life of
   God. Yet remember that there are many who, like the Jewish people,

   bear the name of Israel, but they are not the true Israel. They are
   bound about God nominally, as it were, but yet they are not spiritually
   united to Him. And concerning such, this parable tells us much that is
   worthy of solemn consideration. May the Holy Spirit warn all professors
   by this instructive image! If we are, indeed, what we profess to be,
   then we shall cling to God forever, as it is written, "I will put My
   fear in their hearts, and they shall not depart from Me." Our faith
   will encompass Christ our Lord! Our love will embrace Him! Our patience
   will surround Him! Our hope will encircle Him world without end!

   In all our service we shall endeavor to cling fast to God. If anything
   comes between us and God, it will be our sorrow, a trouble not to be
   endured. Nothing shall seduce the faithful from their hold upon God,
   for He who bound them about Himself will allow no enemy to unloose His
   sash. Whatever the world may do by way of bribe, or by way of threats,
   we shall hold fast to Him and shall not let Him go! And all for this
   reason--that unchanging Love and infinite Wisdom have bound us too fast
   for us to be unloosed again. Because the Lord's own love has bound us
   to Himself, therefore we bind ourselves to Him by steadfast Covenant--

   "Loved of our God, for Him again

   With love intense we burn!

   Chosen of Him before time began,

   We choose Him in return."

   And, as nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
   Jesus our Lord, so nothing shall separate our love from God whom we
   love in Christ Jesus our Lord!

   What a privilege this is--that the Lord should cause us to cling to
   Him, to be to Him for a people, for a name, for a praise and for a
   glory! Pardon me if I speak feebly, my heart loses utterance in
   contemplating the gracious imagery here set before us. But Jeremiah's
   sash was a linen one--it was the sash peculiar to the priests, for such
   was the Prophet. He was "the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were
   in Anathoth." Thus the type represents chosen men as bound to God in
   connection with sacrifice. The people of the Lord are the very sash of
   the Most High in this sense, that if there is priestly work to do, He
   puts us about Him and makes us to be the instruments of this hallowed
   service.

   For us, our blessed Lord girt Himself with a linen sash! For us, He,
   even now, is girt about the paps with a golden sash and now, for Him,
   we, also, become priests and kings unto God and His continued priestly
   work among men is done by us. I mean, not by ministers, alone, but by
   all the inheritance of God--by all the blood-washed ones, by all the
   regenerate ones--for you are "a royal priesthood, a peculiar people."
   God has made His people to be "a nation of priests" and it is ours to
   offer sacrifice to God continually, the sacrifice of prayer and
   thanksgiving. We know of no order of priests, save the whole body of
   the faithful, who present their bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
   acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

   That is why a linen sash was specified rather than any other. We are
   bound to the Most High, for solemn priesthood, to minister among the
   sons of men holy things. The Lord Jesus is now blessing the sons of men
   as Aaron blessed the peo-ple--and we are the sash with which He girds
   Himself in the act of benediction by the Gospel. The sash is also used
   by God always in connection with work. When eastern men are about to
   work in real earnest, they gird up their loins. Our garments in this
   country are close-fitting and convenient, but the Oriental's robes
   would always be in his way whenever he had work to do if he did not
   tightly strap them around him.

   Whenever we read of earnest work to be done we read of this sash--so
   when God comes to do work among the sons of men, we always hear of this
   sash, which sash we are, or may be, if we are unto God what we ought to
   be. When the Lord works righteousness in the earth, it is by means of
   His chosen ones. When He publishes salvation and makes known His Grace,
   His saints are around Him. When sinners are to be saved, it is by His
   people. When error is to be denounced, it is by our lips that He
   chooses to speak. When His saints are to be comforted, it is by those
   who have been comforted by His Holy Spirit and who, therefore, tell
   about the consolations which they have, themselves, enjoyed. The sash
   of the Lord's workday robes is His people!

   He says, "Gather My people unto Me; those that have made a covenant
   with Me by sacrifice." When He comes--not to Judgment, for that is His
   strange work--but for mercy and salvation, then He comes girt about
   with His redeemed! Blessed are they whose happy lot it is to be
   connected with God in His sacred acts and in all His glorious work of
   salvation! I cannot explain my deep emotion, but my heart would utter
   weighty words if it could talk without my lips, for I am awe-stricken
   at the bare idea of our being used as the sash of the Divine Strength,
   clinging unto God as a sash cleaves unto the waist of a man! How
   blessed a thing it is to be bound to God, bound for hallowed service,
   being set apart for the

   Master's most personal and honorable use! Blessed are you who were once
   worthless and useless, but are now made so precious in His sight that
   you are bound around Him for His use in the highest exercises of His
   Grace among the sons of men!

   Moreover, the sash was intended for ornament. It does not appear that
   it was bound about the priest's waists under his garments, for if so,
   it would not have been seen and would not have been an instructive
   symbol--this sash must be seen, since it was meant to be a type of a
   people who were to be unto God, "for a people, and for a name, and for
   a praise, and for a glory." Is not this wonderful beyond all wonder,
   that God should make His people His Glory? Yet so it is, for true
   Believers become an ornament unto God, adorning the doctrine of God,
   their Savior, in all things. Is it not written, "You shall also be a
   crown of glory in the hands of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the
   hands of your God"? Like as when a man puts on his jewels, or a prince
   puts on his royal attire, so does God regard His elect "as the jewels
   of a crown," and to prove His value of them, He arrays Himself with His
   people as with a sash!

   Can it be so, that God is glorified in His saints? Is it so that
   Christ, Himself, is admired in them that believe as well as by them
   that believe? Do we, after all, illustrate the magnificence of God and
   show to principalities and powers in the heavenly places what God can
   do? Yes, it is so! You can easily perceive what true glory God has in
   us if we are sincere. Is it not to His honor that we, who were
   disobedient and obstinate and hard-hearted should, by His love, be
   subdued to the obedience of the faith? Does not this show His
   Glory--that we creatures, possessed of the very dangerous possession of
   a free will, nevertheless, without violating that will, are led to obey
   His commands with pleasure and delight?

   Is it not to the praise of His Grace that we, who are, under some
   aspects, the meanest of His creatures, seeing that we have been guilty
   of such gross sin, are, nevertheless, set next to Himself and made to
   be His dear children? Next to God, the Redeemer, comes man, the
   redeemed! Yes, God and man are united--wondrously united in the Person
   of the Lord Jesus Christ. What can more grandly set forth the adorable
   love and goodness of Jehovah!? What great things God has done for us,
   already, in having taken us up out of the horrible pit and out of the
   miry clay! Let this stand as His beautiful sash--that He passes by
   transgression, iniquity and sin. Let this be His Divine adornment--that
   He is the Lord God, merciful and gracious. Hallelujah!

   But how much greater things He will yet do for us! I know that He has
   taken us from the dunghill, but then it follows that He has set us
   among princes, even the princes of His people. We are not always
   sitting among princes, yet, but we shall be elevated to the throne
   before long! Our spirits, rid of this clay, shall rise up among
   spiritual dignities and powers, not second to the most exalted of
   them--and then shall an astonished universe behold the mercy of the
   Lord! Yet once more, when the blast of the archangel shall have
   awakened the sleeping dead, even these poor material bodies, made like
   unto Christ's glorious body, shall share the glory of the Son of Man.
   Truly "it does not yet appear what we shall be" for there are great
   things, yet, for men--and the race of men to whom God has had a special
   favor shall yet be highly exalted and have dominion over all the works
   of His hands and He shall put all things under his feet.

   In all this, the exceeding riches of Divine Grace shall be resplendent
   and thus man shall be as a jeweled sash unto the Lord of hosts. Oh,
   majesty of love! Infinity of Grace! Here seraphs may admire and adore.
   My Brothers and Sisters, beloved in the Lord, muse much upon this
   figure of a sash! Silently meditate upon it and try to understand it.
   We are the sash that God causes to cling unto His waist and that no
   mere poverty-stricken sash of a beggar, but the sash of a royal priest,
   worn by Him in sacrifice and labor, and regarded as His ornament and
   glory! Oh the splendor of Jehovah's love to His people!

   II. But now, alas, we have to turn our eyes sorrowfully away from this
   surpassing glory! These people who might have been the glorious sash of
   God, displayed in their own persons A FATAL MISSION. Did you notice it?
   Thus says the Lord unto Jeremiah, "Go and get you a linen sash, and put
   it around your waist, and put it not in water." Ah, me! There is the
   mischief--the unwashed sash is the type of an unholy people who have
   never received the great cleansing. God is pure and holy and He will
   wear clean garments, but of this garment it is said, "Put it not in
   water." The priests of Jehovah were continually washing, but of this
   sash, we read, "Put it not in water."

   Now, when a man seems to be bound to God, and to be used of God, if he
   has never undergone the great cleansing, he will sooner or later come
   to a terrible end. "If I wash you not, you have no part with Me," is a
   very solemn word from the Lord Jesus, Himself. Oh, my Brothers and
   Sisters, I invite you to meditate upon this for a moment! No nearness
   to God can save you if you have never been washed by the Lord Jesus! No
   official connection can bless you if you have never

   been washed in His most precious blood! No matter though you may seem
   to be an ornament of the Church and all men may think so, and even good
   men may bless God for you--if you have never been washed--you are not
   Christ's!

   If Jesus Christ, your Lord and Master, has never enabled you to say,
   "We have washed our robes and made them white in the blood of the
   Lamb," then, the great cleansing having been omitted, you will be shut
   out of the marriage supper of the Lamb. Oh the terror of that
   sentence--"Put it not in water"! Surely, this is what Satan
   desires--his malice cannot exceed the wish that we may never be
   cleansed from our iniquities! How accursed are those of whom Solomon
   says, "There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet
   is not washed from their filthiness." If that one, first, perfect
   washing has never exercised its purifying influence upon you, my
   Brothers, it is all in vain for you to bear the vessels of the Lord and
   to be thought to be great and to be eminent in His house, for you must
   be put away!

   On the spot let each one of us pray, "Wash me, and I shall be whiter
   than snow." God loves purity and will not keep unholy men in nearness
   to Himself. Here is the alternative for all professors--you must be
   washed in the blood of Christ, or be laid aside--which shall it be? The
   Prophet was bid not to put it in water, which shows that there was not
   only an absence of the first washing, but there was no daily cleansing.
   Take heed, Beloved, that you omit not those after-washings which must
   follow the washing in the blood of the Lamb. When our blessed Lord took
   a towel and a basin and went to wash the disciples' feet, He did not
   perform a superfluous action! Peter was misguided when he said "You
   shall never wash my feet." It is necessary that we be washed every day.
   Even "if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have
   fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son
   cleanses us from all sin."

   We are constantly defiling our feet by marching through this dusty
   world and every night we need to be washed. There is sin within us as
   well as sin outside us and even if we do not leave our chamber, but
   have to lie upon a sickbed all day long, impatience is quite enough to
   defile our feet--and we greatly need to be cleansed. The first grand
   washing is never repeated--that great bath does its work so effectually
   that the putting away of guilt is perfected once and for all and
   forever! When our Lord bowed His head and gave up the ghost, He offered
   an effectual Atonement by which all the guilt of His redeemed was
   eternally put away. "This Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for
   sins forever, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high"--and
   he that has that one washing needs not except to wash his feet.

   But the foot-bath is always necessary. Stains of pilgrimage, stains of
   service, stains of grief, stains of pleasure, stains of our holy
   things--these must still be put away. What with pride, or doubt, or
   ill-desire, or imagination, or anger, or forgetfulness or error, we are
   always being defiled and always need to be put in water to undergo that
   washing in water by the Word of God of which the Apostle speaks. If,
   dear Friends, you and I live without washing, we live in a way that
   renders us unfit for Divine service! And have you not found it so? I
   know this, that if you suffer a sin to lie on your conscience, you
   cannot serve God aright while it is there. If you have transgressed as
   a child and you do not run and put your head into your Father's bosom
   and cry, "Father I have sinned!" you cannot do God's work.

   The external part of it you may perform, though there will often be a
   great weakness even there. But as for the spiritual and vital part, it
   will be sadly deficient. If you try to write the epistle of life with
   an unwashed hand, it will tremble and every line you write will be in
   the shaky handwriting of paralysis. "He that has clean hands shall wax
   stronger and stronger," but the foul hand shall wax weaker and weaker!
   There must be this washing or there cannot be abundant working. If you
   do not know yourself to be "accepted in the Beloved." If you do not
   know yourself to be clean every whit, you will not be happy with God!
   And when you are not happy with Him, your mind will be taken off from
   work for Him to work for yourself. You will be thinking about your own
   imperfection rather than His perfection--the sin of any single day,
   though it will not destroy you, will grieve you.

   A stone in your shoe, though almost invisible, will spoil a day's
   journey. It is not a great rock to grind you to powder. It is only a
   little stone, but your foot will blister before you have walked many
   miles. Ah me, how great the pain of a single unconfessed sin! The best
   thing you can do is to take off your shoe at once and remove the stone
   before you, again, put down your foot. So it is with every little
   sin--if it is only a thought, if it is only a look the wrong way--go to
   your Father and get rid of it! Do not live a day out of fellowship with
   God, no, nor an hour under the Lord's frown! You know how it is with
   your dear child when he has done wrong. He does not expect that you
   will turn him out of doors and say, "You shall not be my child," but he
   does expect you to be grieved with him!

   Children are believers in the "final perseverance" of parental
   love--they expect always to be your children--but if you are a wise
   father, they do not feel happy when they have done wrong. You have not,
   perhaps, found out their disobe-

   dience, but the kiss at night is not half as warm as usual, for they
   are afraid that Father will soon know of their fault and will be angry.
   When God deals with us as a father who has seen his child's
   naughtiness, there is no peace or rest in our spirit. Even
   chastisement, however, is better borne than a sense of having offended.
   If you gave your naughty child a good whipping at once, it would
   comfort him, for your displeasure would be over--but as long as you do
   not chastise him, but only say, "No, my Child, I cannot have dealings
   with you while you act so. I have no word of love for you, for you are
   so wicked"--then the dear child will be sorely troubled until your
   anger is over. He will be ready to break his little heart until you
   forgive him and comfort him, saying, "I shall put the matter away this
   time, for I see you are sorry, and I hope you will not behave so badly
   again."

   Brethren, this holy, filial fear of the Lord is not servitude under the
   Law; it is not trying to be saved by what we do--it is the discipline
   of the Father's house and that is what we attend to when we ask for
   daily washing. There was a fatal flaw about this sash--it had never
   been washed--and it is a fatal thing if you and I can go from day to
   day without being cleansed by our blessed Lord. Oh Lord, purge me by
   Your continual pardon! Cleanse me this day from every spot, for Your
   sweet mercy's sake! But observe, once again, that the more this sash
   was used, the more it gathered great and growing defilement. It was a
   Prophet that wore it, but even with such wear the unwashed sash began
   to be spotted and stained. And as he might not put it into water, the
   more often the Prophet went out to his daily work--the more the sash
   was used--the more service it performed, the more worn and dirty it
   became.

   It will be just the same with us if no water is applied and there is no
   application of the cleansing blood of Christ. Without the Atonement,
   the more we do, the more we shall sin. Our very prayers will turn into
   sin! Our godly things will breed evil! We shall be preaching and when
   we preach we shall preach our condemnation! We shall gather our class
   about us and talk to them of good things--and all the while there will
   be in our consciences the thought that we are not acting as we talk, or
   living as we tell them to live--and we shall be growing blacker and
   more defiled from hour to hour. Oh, Lord, deliver us from this! Save us
   from being made worse by that which should make us better! Save us from
   turning even our service into sin, our prayers into abominations and
   our Psalms into mockery! Let us be Your true people and therefore let
   us be washed that we may be clean, that You may gird Yourself with us.

   III. Very soon that fatal flaw in the case here mentioned led, in the
   third place, to A SOLEMN JUDGMENT. It was a solemn judgment upon the
   sash, looking at it as a type of the people of Israel. First, the sash,
   after Jeremiah had made his long walk in it, was taken off and put
   away. It is an awful thing when God takes off the man that has once
   appeared to be on Him and lays him aside, as He did Saul when He
   finally gave him up and took the kingdom from him. Yes, and it is a
   solemn thing, also, when the Lord takes off the man that has been
   really bound to Him and, for a time, lays him aside and says, "I cannot
   use you. I cannot wear you as Mine. I cannot work with you. You can be
   no ornament to Me--you are defiled." He puts away the spoiled sash--in
   other words, He works no longer with the backsliding professor.

   This is a terrible thing to happen to any man. I would rather suffer
   every sickness in the list of human diseases than that God should put
   me aside as a vessel in which He has no pleasure, and says to me, "I
   cannot wear you as My sash, nor acknowledge you as Mine before men."
   That would be a dreadful thing! Is there one here who has come into
   that condition? Has the Lord left you to your backsliding? Learn the
   lesson of my text! What you need, my Friend, is to be cleansed in the
   double stream which John of old saw flowing from the Redeemer's riven
   side! You need spiritual cleansing before the Lord can put you on,
   again, and use you, again, and be one with you, again--and before you
   can be, again, unto Him a praise and a glory. While you are unclean you
   are dishonoring Him and He must set you aside.

   After that sash was laid aside, the next thing for it was hiding and
   burying. It was placed in a hole of the rock by the river of the
   captivity and left there. Many a hypocrite has been served in that way.
   God has said to His servants, "Put Him out of the Church. He is
   defiled." And there has been nothing heard of him any more. He may have
   been offended at being put aside and have gone into the world
   altogether--and though he once seemed to be as the very sash of God,
   yet he has rotted and decayed into corruption and open transgression,
   for the raw material of hypocrisy soon decays and turns into
   loathsomeness. The worst things are frequently the rot of the best
   things and so the worst characters grow out of those who apparently
   were once the best.

   Thus, this sash is put away, hidden and left. God will have nothing to
   do with it! He has put it aside. And now the sash spoils. It was put, I
   dare say, where the dampness and the wet acted upon it, and so, when,
   in about 70 days, Jeremiah came back to the spot, there was nothing but
   an old rag instead of what had once been a pure white linen sash.

   He says, "Behold the sash was marred; it was profitable for nothing."
   So, if God were to leave any of us, the best men and the best women
   among us would soon become nothing but marred sashes instead of being
   as fair white linen. Alas, for certain goodly professors that did
   appear to be very fine, once, what rotten old rags they come to be when
   they are put into the hole and left to themselves!

   We have seen it. They have only been fit, at last, to be put upon the
   dust heap with useless things. They have fallen into such a horrible
   condition of mind that they can do evil without check of
   conscience--they have forgotten how to blush! The same persons who did
   run well (what hindered them?) are now found, not only sleeping in the
   harbors of sloth, but rioting in chambers of wantonness! The glorious
   sash of God, as the man seemed to be, becomes a mass of rottenness!
   What does the text say? Let me read the words, for I should not like to
   say them of myself--"Behold, the sash was marred, it was profitable for
   nothing." And again in the 10th verse--"Which is good for nothing." So
   may men become who have not been washed! So will they become unless
   God, in His infinite mercy, gives them speedily expiation through His
   Son, renewing by His Spirit.

   I desire to profit you all and so I want to notice how true this is of
   the real children of God. I could speak this even weeping. There are
   certain real children of God whom God greatly honored at one time, so
   that they were as His sash. But they were proud and were soon defiled
   with other sins. And so the Lord has laid them aside from His service.
   They are still His, but He has put them under discipline--and as a part
   of that discipline He has banished them from His public service. They
   were once everywhere in the Lord's battles, but now they are nowhere.
   He knows where He has put them and they will remain there till their
   pride is quite gone.

   When the Lord has effected this purpose, His wandering servant will
   come back with an altered tale, and you shall hear him as he laments
   himself and cries--"I do not feel fit to be in God's Church! I have
   walked in such a way that if I were cast off altogether it would be my
   just deserts. Oh that I may be forgiven." The deep repentance of
   returning wanderers makes you feel that they are the children of God
   though they have dishonored Him--and you welcome their return, saying,
   "Come with us, and enjoy the means of Grace." Alas, they answer--

   "The saints are comforted, we know, Within the house of prayer; We
   often go where others go, And find no comfort there."

   One man sighs, "I have a Sunday school class, and I teach it, but I do
   not feel tenderly for the children as I once did. There is no power
   about me. I am a branch of the tree that appears to have no sap in it.
   I bear no fruit. Alas," he cries, "I do not enjoy private prayer and
   when I pray, and pour out my soul before God, I do not obtain a
   comfortable answer! I am as one that is forgotten." Is it at all
   amazing that God frowns when we disobey? The Lord will not hear those
   who decline to hear Him! If we are deaf to His Commandments, He will be
   deaf to our prayers. You have become defiled, for you have not watched
   your steps, and now the Lord cannot be in communion with you. You have
   not been careful and so the sash has become foul with public spots and
   private foulnesses!

   And the Lord says, "I cannot use that man; I cannot be in fellowship
   with him. If I would, it would ruin him." If God were to be kind and
   tender to His children when they are living in sin, it would encourage
   them in evil and they would go from bad to worse! If a Believer grieves
   God, he must be grieved, himself. The heavenly Father takes down the
   rod and though it is more pain to Him than it is to us, He will not
   spare us for our crying. Just because He loves us He will lay on His
   strokes thick and heavy, one after the other, perhaps in sharp
   affliction, but very often in a continuous and growing loss of all that
   made us happy and useful.

   Alas! Alas! The sash is marred and the Lord has hid it out of His
   sight! Oh, what a mercy it is that the Lord can take that sash and wash
   it and make it as good as new, and even better than at the first! He
   can give back to the man his old joy with an added experience which
   will make him humble and tender. He can restore his former usefulness
   and even increase it by teaching him to deal gently with others that
   err and, by enabling him to prize and value the mercy of God. Did you
   ever get into a corner and sing that verse, "Love I much? I've more
   forgiven. I'm a miracle of Grace"? Those sweet lines have often charmed
   my inmost heart. I have wanted to love my Lord infinitely! I have
   wished that I could love Him as much as seven million hearts put
   together could love Him!

   I would love Him as much as the whole universe could love Him! I wish I
   had His Father's love to Him, for what do I not owe Him for all His
   wonderful mercy to me? And do you not feel the same? Are you not, also,
   great debtors to Sover-

   eign Grace? If you do not at any time kindle love and gratitude, I am
   afraid that you are put in the hole with the sash and that you are
   rotting away. Sad case for you! Certain of God's people are marvelously
   high-minded--they cannot sit anywhere but in the big armchair, or at
   the head of the table. They cannot mingle with any of us common
   Christians at all because they are perfect--and we are a long way from
   making any claim to such a degree of excellence. Some of the hymns that
   we are glad to sing are not good enough for them, for they cry, "We
   hate hymns of this style! They are so below our experience."

   These are the dons and grandees of the Court of Arrogance! When I see
   fine professors coming in with the seven league boots on, I am always
   afraid that they are not God's children at all because I have never
   read of any true saints who said much in praise of themselves and I
   have read of so many gracious persons whose tone and temper were the
   very reverse of this lofty boasting! I have seen God's poor little
   child like Moses in a basket on the Nile with crocodiles all round
   ready to devour him--and when I have looked at him, I have always
   noticed that which the Holy Spirit took pains to record--"Behold, the
   babe wept." This was the real Moses--those crystal drops are the tokens
   of a goodly child! The tears of God's babes are wonderfully precious
   and they have great power with Him.

   The dragons of Nilus cannot devour a weeping Moses. "When I am weak,
   then am I strong." When you are so weak that you cannot do much more
   than cry, you coin diamonds with both your eyes! The sweetest prayers
   God ever hears are the groans and sighs of those who have no hope in
   anything but His love! There is music in our moaning to His kind and
   tender ears. He can restore you, even though you are as the marred
   sash. And when He once puts you on again, you will cling to His waist
   more closely than ever, praying that He will bind you fast about Him.
   But the worst part of it--and this I finish with--is that this relates
   undoubtedly to many mere professors whom God takes off from Himself,
   laying them aside and leaving them to perish.

   And what is His reason for doing so? He tells us this in the text--He
   says that this evil people refused to receive God's words. Dear
   Friends, never grow tired of God's Word! Never let any book supplant
   the Bible! Love every part of Scripture and take heed to every Word
   that God has spoken. Let it all be a Divine Word to you, for if not,
   when you begin to pick and choose about God's Word, and do not like
   this, and do not like that, you will soon become like a marred
   sash--for the base-hearted professor is detected by his not loving the
   Father's words.

   Next to that, we are told that they walked in the dictates of their
   hearts. That is a sure sign of the hypocrite or the false professor. He
   makes his religion out of himself, as a spider spins a web out of his
   own bowels! What sort of theology it is, you can imagine, now that you
   know its origin! This base professor grows his theology on his own back
   as the snail produces her shell! He is everything to himself--his own
   savior, his own teacher, his own guide! He knows so much, that if the
   world would only sit at his feet, it would become a wonderfully learned
   world in a very short time, so great a Rabbi is he! When a man is so
   puffed up that his own imagination is his inspiration, and his
   obstinacy holds him fast in his own opinion, then he has become as the
   sash which was taken from the Prophet's waist and put into a hole to
   rot away.

   Upon all this there followed actual transgression--"They walked after
   other gods to serve them and to worship them." This happens, also, to
   the base professor. He keeps up the name of a Christian for a little
   while and seems to be as God's sash. But by-and-by he falls to
   worshipping gold, or drink, or lust. Bacchus, or Venus becomes his
   deity. He turns aside from the infinitely glorious God and so he falls
   from one degradation to another till he hardly knows himself! He
   becomes as a rotten sash "which profits nothing." Neither God nor man
   are benefited by him. The Lord save you, dear Friends, from being found
   insincere in the day when He searches the heart. May He also save us
   from failing to be washed in the most precious blood. Is not this a fit
   subject for immediate and continuous prayer? See to it! The Lord bless
   you for His name's sake. Amen.

"Herein Is Love"

   (No. 1707)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 18, 1883,

   BY C, H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent
   His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved
   us, we ought, also, to love one another." 1 John 4:10,11.

   THE Law commands love, indeed, all its precepts are summed up in that
   one word, "love." More widely read it runs thus--"You shall love the
   Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all
   your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as
   yourself--yet all this amounts only to, "You shall love." But the Law,
   by reason of our depravity, never produced love. We were commanded to
   love, but we did no such thing. The spirit that is in us is selfish and
   it lusts to envy and to enmity. Why do wars and fights come among us?
   Come they not from our lusts? Since the Fall, man has become man's
   bitterest foe upon the earth--and the world is full of hate,
   slandering, struggles, fighting, wounding, and slaying--all that the
   Law can do is to show the wrong of enmity and threaten punishment. It
   cannot supply an unregenerate heart with a fountain of love.

   Man remains unloving and unlovable till the Gospel takes him in hand
   and, by Grace, accomplishes that which the Law could not do, in that it
   was weak through the flesh. Love is winning many hearts to the Kingdom
   of God and its reign shall extend till love shall rule over the whole
   earth. And so the Kingdom of God shall be set up among men and God
   shall dwell among them. At the present moment love is the
   distinguishing mark of the people of God. Jesus said, "By this shall
   all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love, one to
   another." And John said, "We know that we have passed from death unto
   life because we love the Brethren." The man whose spirit is selfish has
   not the spirit of Christ and, "if any man have not the spirit of Christ
   he is none of His."

   The man whose spirit is that of envy and contention is evidently no
   follower of the lowly and loving Jesus--and those who do not follow
   Jesus are none of His. They that are Christ's are filled with His love.
   "Everyone that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not
   knows not God; for God is Love." God is the center of the Believer's
   love. The saints are an inner circle specially beloved and all mankind
   are embraced within the circumference of the ring of love. "He that
   dwells in love dwells in God, and God in Him" and he, alone, is a child
   of God whose spirit is kindly and affectionate and who seeks, wherever
   he is, to promote peace, goodwill towards men.

   The saints begin with love to God. That must always hold the highest
   place, for God is the best and noblest Being, and we owe Him all our
   hearts. Then comes, for Jesus' sake, love to all who are in Christ.
   There is a peculiarly near and dear relationship existing between one
   child of God and all the rest. Loving Him that begat, we love all them
   that are begotten of Him! Should not a child love his brothers with a
   tender, peculiar affection? This principle of love, once implanted,
   induces in the heart of the converted man a love towards all mankind.
   Not that he can take any complacency in the wicked--God, Himself,
   cannot do that, for His holiness abhors all iniquity. The love desired
   is not the love of complacency, but the love of benevolence, so that we
   wish well and, to the utmost of our power, would do well unto all those
   that dwell upon the face of the earth. In this holy charity, this
   unselfish love, be you imitators of God as dear children.

   Our heavenly Father is kind to the unthankful and to the evil, and so
   must we be, desiring that even the most abandoned may yet be rescued
   and made right and good. Love desires to create that which is lovable
   even in the most unlovable of mankind and, God helping the effort, she
   succeeds. I hear one say, "This is a vast idea. Are we to love at this
   rate? Where is the love to come from? Our hearts are narrow, men are
   unworthy, provocations are numerous, another spirit is abroad in the
   world--where is this love to come from? Where is this flood of love
   which is to cover the tops of the mountains of man's unworthiness to
   come from?"

   Have you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in
   search of the depths? Yes, by the leadings of God's Spirit, we will
   search out the springs of the sea of love! Only in one place shall we
   find love enough for our supreme

   purpose, which is also the purpose of the Lord, Himself. There is one
   shoreless ocean into which we may be baptized and out of which we may
   be filled until we overflow! Where is the unfailing motive of Love? For
   Love is tried and hardly put to it to hold her own! Can we find a
   motive that will never fail, even towards the most provoking of
   mankind? Can we find an argument for affection which shall help us in
   times of ingratitude, when base returns threaten to freeze the very
   heart of charity? Yes, there is such a motive! There is a force by
   which even impossibilities of love can be accomplished and we shall be
   supplied with a perpetual constraint moving the heart to ceaseless
   charity!

   Come with me, then, in the first place, to notice the infinite spring
   of love--"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that God loved
   us." Secondly, let us observe the marvelous outflow of that love--"God
   sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins." And then, thirdly,
   let us notice the overflow of that love in us, when it fills our hearts
   and runs over to others. "Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought, also,
   to love one another."

   I. First, THE INFINITE SPRING OF LOVE. Our text has two words upon
   which I would place an emphasis-- "not," and "but." The first is,
   "not." " Herein is love, not"-- "not that we loved God." Very naturally
   many conclude that this means, "not that we loved God first." That is
   not exactly the Truth of God taught here, but still it is a weighty
   Truth, and is mentioned in this same chapter in express words--"We love
   Him because He first loved us" (v. 19). The cause of love in the
   universe is not that man loved God first! No being in existence could
   love God before God loved him, for the existence of such a being is due
   to God's previous love!

   His plans of love were all laid and many of them carried out before we
   were born. And when we were born, we, none of us, loved God first so as
   to seek after God before He sought after us--so as to desire
   reconciliation with God before He desired reconciliation with us. No,
   whatever may be said about free will as a theory, it is never found as
   a matter of fact that any man, left to himself, ever woos his God, or
   pines after friendship with his Maker. If he repents of sin, it is
   because the Spirit of God has first visited him and shown him his sin!
   If he desires restoration, it is because he has, first of all, been
   taught to dread the wrath of God and to long for holiness--

   "No sinner can be beforehand with Thee! Your Grace is most so vereign,
   Most rich, and most free."

   We inscribe a negative in black capital letters upon the idea that
   man's love can ever be prior to the love of God. That is quite out of
   the question. "Not that we loved God."

   Take a second sense--that is, not that any man did love God at all by
   nature, whether first or second; not that we, any one of us, ever did
   or ever could have an affection towards God while we remained in our
   state by nature. Instead of loving God, man is indifferent to God. "No
   God," says the fool in his heart and, by nature, we are all such fools.
   It is the sinner's wish that there were no God. We are atheistic by
   nature and if our brain does not yield to atheism, yet our heart does.
   We wish that we could sin according to our own will and that we were in
   no danger of being called to account for it. God is not in all our
   thoughts, or, if He does enter there, it is as a terror and a dread.

   No, worse than that--man is at enmity with God by wicked works! The
   holiness which God admires, man has no liking for! The sin which God
   abominates has about it sweetness and fascination for the unrenewed
   heart, so that man's ways are contrary to the ways of God. Man is
   perverse. He cannot walk with God, for they are not agreed. He is all
   evil and God is all goodness and, therefore, no love to God exists in
   the natural heart of man. He may say that he loves God, but then it is
   a god of his own inventing and not Jehovah, the God of the Bible, the
   only living and true God. A just God and a Savior, the natural mind
   cannot endure--the carnal mind is enmity against God, is not reconciled
   to God and, neither, indeed, can be! The unregenerate heart is, as to
   love, a broken cistern which can hold no water.

   In our natural state, there is none that does good, no, not one. So is
   there, also, none that loves God, no, not one! We come nearer to John's
   meaning when we look at this negative as applying to those who do love
   God. "Not that we loved God"--that is, that our love to God, even when
   it does exist, and even when it influences our lives, is not worthy to
   be mentioned as a fountain of supply for love. The Apostle points us
   away from it to something far more vast and then he cries, "Herein is
   love." I am looking for "the springs of the sea," and you point me to a
   little pool amid the rocks which has been filled by the flowing tide. I
   am glad to see that pool--how bright! how blue! how like the sea from
   where it came! But do not point to this as the source of the great
   water floods, for if you do, I shall smile at your childish ignorance
   and point you to you great rolling main which tosses its waves on high.

   What is your little pool to the vast Atlantic? Do you point me to the
   love in the Believer's heart and say, "Herein is love"? You make me
   smile. I know that there is love in that true heart, but who can
   mention it in the Presence of the great rolling ocean of the love of
   God, without bottom and without shore? The word, "not," is not only
   upon my lips but in my heart as I think of the two things--"NOT that we
   loved God, but that God loved us." What poor love ours is at its very
   best when compared with the love with which God loves us! Let me use
   another figure. If we had to enlighten the world, a child might point
   us to a bright mirror reflecting the sun. And he might cry, "Herein is
   light!" You and I would say, "Poor child, that is but borrowed
   brightness. The light is not there, but yonder, in the sun!"

   The love of saints is nothing more than the reflection of the love of
   God! We have love, but God IS Love. When I think of the love of certain
   saints to Christ, I am charmed with it, for it is a trait of the Spirit
   not to be despised. When I think of Paul the Apostle counting all
   things but loss for Christ. When I think of our missionaries going, one
   after another, into malarious parts of the African coast and dying for
   Christ. And when I read the Book of Martyrs and see confessors standing
   on the firewood, burning quick to the death, still bearing witness to
   their Lord and Master--I rejoice in the love of saints to their Lord!
   Yet this is but a stream! The unfathomable deep, the eternal source
   from which all love proceeds infinitely exceeds all human affection and
   it is found in God, and in God alone! "Herein is love, not that we
   loved God, but that God loved us."

   Let us contrast our love to God with His love to us. Dear Brothers and
   Sisters, we do love God and we may well do so, since He is infinitely
   lovable. When the mind is once enlightened, it sees everything that is
   lovable about God. He is so good, so gracious, so perfect that He
   commands our admiring affection. The spouse in the Song, when she
   thought of her Beloved, mentioned all manner of beauties and then
   cried, "Yes, He is altogether lovely!" It is natural, therefore, that
   one who sees God should love Him. But, now, think of God's love to
   us--is it not incomparably greater, since there was nothing lovely in
   us whatever, and yet He loved us? In us there is, by nature, nothing to
   attract the affection of a holy God, but quite the reverse--and yet He
   loved us. Herein, indeed, is love! When we love God, it is an honor to
   us! It exalts a man to be allowed to love a Being so glorious!

   A philosopher once wrote that for a man to speak of being the friend of
   God was too daring and, in the reverence of this thoughtful heathen,
   there was much to admire, for, indeed, there is an infinite difference
   between the glorious God and the sinful creature, man! Though God, in
   condescension, allows us to call Him, Friend, and Jesus says, "You are
   My friends," yet this is beyond reason, and is a sweet Revelation of
   the Holy Spirit. What an uplifting there is in it for us! On the other
   hand, God's love to us can add nothing to Him. It gives, but receives
   not. Divine Love can have no recompense. That He, the Infinite, should
   stoop to love the finite--that He, the infinitely pure, should love the
   guilty--this is a vast condescension.

   See, moreover, what it involved, for this love rendered it necessary
   that in the Person of His dear Son, God should be "despised and
   rejected of men," should make Himself of no reputation and should even
   be numbered with the transgressors. "Herein is love." When we love God,
   we are gainers by the deed. He that loves God does, in the most
   effectual manner, love himself. We are filled with riches when we
   abound in love to God--it is our wealth, our health, our might and our
   delight! But God gains nothing by loving us. I hardly like to set the
   two in contrast, for our love is so poor and pitiable a thing as
   compared with the immeasurable love of God. It is our duty to love
   God--we are bound to do it. As His creatures we ought to love our
   Creator! As preserved by His care, we are under obligation to love Him
   for His goodness! We owe Him so much that our utmost love is a mere
   acknowledgment of our debt.

   But God loved us to whom He owed nothing at all! Whatever might have
   been the claims of a creature upon his Creator, we forfeited them all
   by our rebellion! Sinful men had no rights towards God except the right
   of being punished. Yet the Lord manifested boundless love to our race,
   which was only worthy to be destroyed. Oh words! How you fail me! I
   cannot utter my heart by these poor lips of clay! Oh God, how infinite
   was Your love which was given without any obligation on Your
   part--freely and unsought--and all because You will to love! Yes You
   love because You are Love! There was no cause, no constraint, no claim
   why You should love mankind except that Your own heart led You to do so
   What is man that You are mindful of him? "Herein is love, not that we
   loved God, but that God loved us."

   I have thus pointed out the wellhead of love--let us draw from it and
   from none other! If you go into the world and say, "I am to love my
   fellow men because I love God," the motive is good, but it is
   questionable, limited and variable. How much better to argue--"I am to
   love my fellow men because God loves me." When my love grows cold
   towards

   God, and when, by reason of my infirmity and imperfection, I am led,
   even, to question whether I love God at all, then my argument and my
   impulse would fail me if it came from my own love to God. But if I love
   the fallen because God loved me, then I have an unchanging motive, an
   unquestionable argument and a forcible impulse not to be resisted!
   Therefore the Apostle cried, "The love of Christ constrains us." It is
   always well for a Christian to have the strongest motive and to rely
   upon the most potent and perpetual force and, therefore, the Apostle
   bids us look to Divine Love and not to our own. " Herein is love," he
   says, "not that we loved God, but that God loved us."

   So far the "not." Let us turn to the, "but." "But that He loved us." I
   have nothing new to say, nor do I wish to say anything new. But I would
   like you to meditate on each one of these words--"He loved us." Three
   words, but what weight of meaning! "He," who is infinitely holy and
   cannot endure iniquity--"He loved us" "He," whose glory is the
   astonishment of the greatest of intelligent beings--"He loved us."
   "He," whom the Heaven of heavens cannot contain, "loved us." "He" who
   is God all-sufficient and needs nothing of us--neither can, indeed,
   receive anything at our hands--"He loved us." What joy lies sleeping
   here! Oh, that we could wake it up! What hope, too, for hopeless
   sinners because, "God loved us."

   If a man could know that he was loved of all his fellow men, if he
   could have it for certain that he was loved by all the angels, doted on
   by cherubim and seraphim, yet these were but so many drops and all put
   together could not compare with the main ocean contained in the fact
   that, "God loved us!" Now ring that second silver bell--"He loved us."
   I do not think the Apostle is, here, so much speaking of God's special
   love to His own elect as of His love to men in general. He saw our race
   ruined in the Fall and He could not bear that man should be destroyed.
   Lord, what is man that You visit him in love? Yet He did so visit him.
   The Lord's love made Him lament man's revolt and cry, "I have nourished
   and brought up children and they have rebelled against Me!" And He bade
   Heaven and earth witness to His grief.

   He saw that sin had brought men into wretchedness and misery and would
   destroy them forever, but He would not have it so. He loved them with
   the love of pity, with the love of sweet and strong benevolence and He
   declared it with an oath--"As I live, says the Lord, I have no pleasure
   in the death of him that dies, but that he turn unto Me and live."
   "Herein is love." But if you and I are reconciled to God, we can lay
   the emphasis, each one for himself, upon this word, "love," and view it
   as special, effectual, electing love. Let each Believer say, "He loved
   me, and gave Himself for me." Then what force is in my text, "He loved
   us"--it is not enough that He pitied us, or spared us, or helped us,
   but, "He loved us."

   It has often made me rise from my seat to think that God loves me! I
   could not sit still and hear the thrilling Truth! Such knowledge is too
   wonderful for me! It is high, I cannot attain unto it. It is sweet to
   be loved even by a dog. It is sweet to be loved by a babe. It is sweet
   to be loved by a friend--it is sweet to be loved by God's people--but,
   oh, to be loved by God and to know it! This is paradise! Would a man
   need any other Heaven than to know for certain that he enjoyed the love
   of God? Note the third word. "He loved us"--"us"--the most
   insignificant of beings. There is an anthill somewhere--it is no matter
   to you where it is. It teems with ants. Stir the nest and they swarm in
   armies. Think of one of them. No, you do not need to know anything
   about him! His business is no concern of yours, so let him go. But that
   ant, after all, is more considerable to you than you are to God. "All
   the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing."

   What are you, even, in this great city?--One man, one woman in London,
   in England, in the population of the world--what a cipher you are! Yet
   what is the population of this world compared with the universe? I
   suppose that all these stars which we see at night, all the countless
   worlds within our range of vision, are but as a little dust in a lone
   corner of God's great house! The whole solar system and all the systems
   of worlds we have ever thought of, are but as a drop in a bucket
   compared with the boundless sea of creation! And even that is as
   nothing compared to the infinite God! And yet, "He loved us"--the
   insignificant creatures of an hour!

   What is more, He loved us though in our insignificance we dared to
   rebel against Him! We boasted against Him. We cried, "Who is Jehovah?"
   We lifted up our hand to fight with Him. Ridiculous rebellion! Absurd
   warfare! Had He but glanced at us and annihilated us, it would have
   been as much as we could merit at His hands! But to think that He
   should love us--love us, mark you--when we were in rebellion against
   Him. This is marvelous! Observe that the previous verse speaks of us as
   being dead in sin. "In this was manifested the love of God toward us,
   because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we
   might live through Him." Then we were dead, dead to all goodness, or
   thought or

   power of goodness--criminals shut up in the condemned cell--and yet God
   loved us with a great love even when we were dead in trespasses and
   sins!

   Child of God, God's love to you today is wonderful! But think of His
   love to you when you were far gone in rebellion against Him. When not a
   throb of holy, spiritual life could be found in your entire being--yet
   He loved you and sent His Son that you might live through Him!
   Moreover, He loved us when we were steeped in sin. Does not our text
   tell us so? For He sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins and
   this implies that we needed to be reconciled! Our righteous Judge was
   angry with us. His righteous wrath smoked against our evil and yet,
   even then, "He loved us." He was angry with us as a Judge, but yet He
   loved us! He was determined to punish and yet resolved to save! This is
   a world of wonders! I am utterly beaten by my text! I confess myself
   mastered by my theme!

   But who among us can measure the unfathomable? "Herein is love," that
   God freely, out of the spontaneous motion of His own heart, should love
   us! This is the argument for love! This is the inexhaustible Fountain
   out of which all love must come. If we desire love, may we come and
   fill our vessels here and bear it out to others. Love springing from
   our own bosoms is feeble and scant--but the love of God is a great
   deep, forever fresh, full and flowing. Here are those springs of the
   sea of which we spoke--

   "Herein is love!"

   II. I need your attention a little longer while I speak as best I can
   upon THE MARVELOUS OUTFLOW OF THAT LOVE. "Herein is love, not that we
   loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the
   propitiation for our sins." Beloved, the love of God is seen in
   creation! He that studies the mechanism of the human frame and of its
   surroundings will see much of Divine kindness there. The love of God is
   to be seen in Providence! He that watches the loving hand of God in
   daily life will not need to look far before he sees tokens of a
   Father's care. But if you want to know when the great deep of God's
   love was broken up and arose in the fullness of its strength to prevail
   over all. If you would see it revealed in a deluge, like Noah's flood,
   you must wait till you see Jesus born at Bethlehem and crucified on
   Calvary, for His mission to men is the most Divine manifestation of
   love!

   Consider every word--"He sent His Son." God "sent." Love caused that
   mission. If there was to be reconciliation between God and man, man
   ought to have sent to God--the offender ought to be the first to apply
   for forgiveness! The weaker should apply to the greater for help. The
   poor man should ask of him who distributes alms. But, "Herein is love,"
   that God "sent." He was first to send an embassy of peace. Today "we
   are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we
   pray you in Christ's stead, be you reconciled to God." Oh, the wonder
   of this, that God should not wait till rebellious men had sent to His
   throne for terms of reconciliation, but should commence negotiations
   Himself!

   Moreover, God sent such a One--He "sent His Son." If men send an
   embassy to a great power, they select some great one of their nation to
   wait upon the potent prince. But if they are dealing with a petty
   principality, they think a subordinate person quite sufficient for such
   a business. Admire, then, the true love of the infinitely gracious God,
   that when He sent an embassy to men, He did not commission an angel nor
   even the brightest spirit before His Throne, but He sent His Son--oh,
   the love of God to men! He sent His equal Son to rebels who would not
   receive Him, would not hear Him, but spat upon Him, scourged Him,
   stripped Him, slew Him! Yes, "He spared not His own Son, but freely
   delivered Him up for us all." He knew what would come of that sending
   of Him and yet He sent Him!--

   "Jesus, commissioned from above,

   Descends to men below,

   And shows from where the springs of love

   In endless currents flow.

   He whom the boundless Hea ven adores,

   Whom angels long to see,

   Quit with joy those blissful shores,

   Ambassador to me!

   To me, a worm, a sinful clod,

   A rebel all forlorn:

   A foe, a traitor, to my God,

   And of a traitor born."

   Note further, not only the grandeur of the Ambassador, but the
   tenderness of the relationship existing between him and the offended
   God. "He sent His Son." The previous verse says, "His only-begotten
   Son." We cannot speak of God except after the manner of men, for God,
   in all His Glory is incomprehensible. But speaking after the manner of
   men, what must it have cost Jehovah to take His only Son from His bosom
   to die? Christ is the Father's Self--in essence they are One--there is
   but one God. We do not understand the mystery of the Trinity in unity,
   but we believe it. It was God Himself who came here in the Person of
   His dear Son! He underwent all--for we are "the flock of God which He
   has purchased with His own blood."

   Remember Abraham with the knife unsheathed and wonder as you see him
   obey the Voice which says, "Take, now, your son, your only son, Isaac,
   whom you love, and offer him for a sacrifice." Remember yet again that
   the Lord actually did what Abraham, in obedience, willed to do--He gave
   up His Son! "It pleased the Father to bruise Him; He has put Him to
   grief." Christ's death was, in fact, God in human form suffering for
   human sin! God Incarnate bleeding because of our transgressions! Are we
   not, now, carried away with the streams of love? I speak my best, my
   Brothers and Sisters, but if my words were what they ought to be, they
   would set your souls on fire! Is not all Heaven still astounded at the
   death of the Only-Begotten? It has not recovered from its amazement
   that the Heir of all things should bow His head to death! How can I
   fitly tell you how much God loved the world when He gave His
   Only-begotten to die that sinners might live?

   Go a step further. "God sent His Son to be a propitiation," that is, to
   be not only a reconciler, but the Reconciliation! His sacrifice of
   Himself as the Atonement through which mercy is rendered possible in
   consistency with justice! I have heard men say with scorn that God
   required a sacrifice before He would be reconciled, as if that were
   wrong on the part of the Judge of All! But let me whisper in their
   ears--God required it, it is true, for He is just and holy. But God
   found it Himself! Remember that--Jehovah found the Ransom which He
   demanded! It was Himself, His own Son, one with Himself, that became
   the Propitiation and the Reconciliation!

   It was not that God the Father was unkind and could not be placated
   unless He smote His Son--but that God the Father was so kind that He
   could not be unjust! So supremely loving that He must devise a way by
   which men could be justly saved! An unjust salvation would have been
   none at all. The Lord found the Reconciliation--I will not say in the
   sufferings of Christ, though that is true! I will not say in the death
   of Christ, though that is true! But I will put it in Scriptural
   words--and here we have it in 1 John 2:2! "He"--that is, Jesus,
   Himself--"is the propitiation for our sins." The Sent One, in Himself,
   as well as in all that He did and all that He suffered, is the
   Reconciliation between God and man! "Herein is love!" In order that
   there might be peace and love between man and God, God finds the
   Sin-Offering! He becomes, Himself, the Atonement, that love might reign
   supreme!

   What seems to me the most wonderful thing of all is that the Lord Jesus
   should deal, not only with our sorrow, but with our sin, for, "He is
   the propitiation for our sins." That God should deal with us as to our
   virtues, if we had any! That He should deal with us as to our love, if
   we had any, might not seem so difficult. But that He should send His
   Son to dwell with us as sinners--yes, and to come into contact with our
   sins, and thus to take the sword, not only by its hilt, but by its
   blade, and plunge it into His own heart, and die because of it--this is
   a miracle of miracles! O Friends, Christ never gave Himself for our
   righteousness, but He laid down His life for our SINS! He viewed us as
   sinners when He came to save us. "Jesus Christ came into the world to
   save sinners."

   If I had not found Christ till this very minute, I hope I should find
   Him, now, as my mind drinks in this doctrine! By God's Spirit there
   seems to me to be such a window opened that even despair may see the
   light, for if the thing which God sent His Son to deal with was the sin
   of man, then I, even though I am nothing but a mass of loathsomeness
   and sin, may yet enjoy the infinite love of God! Oh, guilty ones, hear
   these words which are more sweet than music and more full of delight
   than all poetry! Even the harps of angels never rise to higher measures
   than these which I do so poorly and simply rehearse in your ears! Hear
   these glad tidings, that God, who made the heavens and the earth--whom
   you have of-fended--wills not that you die, but loves you so greatly
   that He opens up a road of reconciliation through the body of His own
   dear Son!

   There was no other way by which you could be reconciled to God, for had
   He reconciled you to a part of Himself and not to His justice, you had
   not been, in very truth, at all reconciled to God. It is now to God
   completely just, holy, whose anger burns against sin! It is to Him that
   you are reconciled by faith in Christ Jesus, through the laying down of
   His life for men! Oh that God would bless this to all who hear the glad
   tidings!

   III. We come at last to think of the CONSEQUENT OUTFLOW OF LOVE FROM
   US--"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought, also, to love one another."
   Our love, then, to one another is simply God's love to us, flowing into
   us and flowing out again. That is all it is! "Herein is love, not that
   we loved God, but that God loved us," and then we love others. You have
   seen a noble fountain in a continental city adorning a public square.
   Look how the water leaps into the air! And then it falls into a
   circular basin which fills and pours out its fullness into another,
   lower down, and this, again, floods a third. Hear the merry splash as
   the waters fall in showers and cataracts from basin to basin!

   If you stand at the lower basin and look upon it and say, "Herein is
   water," that is true, and will be true of the next higher one and so
   forth. But if you would express the truth as to where the water really
   is, you may have to look far away, perhaps upon a mountain's side, for
   there is a vast reservoir from which pipes are laid to bring these
   waters and force them to their height that they may descend so
   beautifully. Thus the love we have to our fellow creatures drops from
   us like the descending silvery cataract from the full basin--but the
   first source of it is the immeasurable love of God which is hidden away
   in His very essence--the love which never changes and never can be
   diminished! "Herein is love!"

   If you and I desire to love our fellow Christians and to love the
   fallen race of man, we must be joined on to the aqueduct which conducts
   love from this eternal source, or else we shall soon fail in love.
   Observe, Brothers and Sisters, then, that as the love of God is the
   source of all true love in us, so a sense of that love stimulates us.
   Whenever you feel that you love God, you overflow with love to all
   God's people! I am sure you do. It is when you get to doubt the love of
   God that you grow hard and cold. But when you are fired with the love
   of a dying Savior who gave Himself for you, you feel as if you loved
   every beggar in the street--and you long to bring every harlot to
   Christ's dear feet--you cannot help it!

   Man, if Christ baptizes your heart into His love, you will be covered
   with it and filled with it! Your love will respect the same persons as
   God's love does, and for the same reasons. God loves men! So will you.
   God loves them when there is no good in them, and you will love them in
   the same way. Sometimes the wickedness of men kindles in the heart of a
   true Christian a stronger affection for them. The deeper down they are,
   the more they need a Savior. Did not our Moravian Brothers and Sisters
   feel, when they went out as missionaries, that they would prefer to go,
   first, to the most barbarous tribes? They said, "The more degraded they
   are, the more they need a Savior." And should not the missionary spirit
   make Believers feel that if men are sunk until they are as low as
   brutes, and as savage as devils, that this is the stronger reason for
   our being eager to bring them to Christ?

   I hope that abominable spirit which used to come in among Christian
   people has been kicked away to its father, the devil, where it ought to
   be--I mean the spirit which despises the poor and the fallen! When I
   have heard people say, "What is the good of looking after such
   riff-raff?" I have been saddened. The Church of God feels that the
   souls of the meanest are precious--that to save the most foul, the most
   ignorant, the most degraded, the most brutalized man or woman that ever
   lives is an objective worthy of the effort of the whole Church--since
   God thought it worthy of the death of Jesus Christ that He might bring
   sinners, dead in sin, to Himself! Brothers and Sisters, we will not
   have grasped the Truth of God unless we feel that our love to men must
   be practical, because God's love to us is so. His love did not pent up
   like the waters in the secret caverns of the earth, but it welled up
   like the waters in the days of Noah, when we read that the fountains of
   the deep were broken up.

   In the gift of the Lord Jesus we behold the reality of Divine love.
   When we see the poor, we must not say "Be you warmed; be you filled; I
   am sorry for you." But we must let our love relieve them from our
   funds! If we see the ignorant, we must not say, "Dear me, the Church is
   neglecting the masses. The Church must wake up." No, but we must bestir
   ourselves and struggle, ourselves, to warn sinners. If there are any
   near you who lie degraded, do not say, "I wish somebody would go after
   them." Go yourself! Our love ought to follow the love of God in one
   point, namely, in always seeking to produce reconciliation! It was to
   this end that God sent His Son. Has anybody offended you? Seek
   reconciliation. "Oh, but I am the offended party." So was God and He
   went straight away and sought reconciliation. Brothers and Sisters, do
   the same! "Oh, but I have been insulted." Just so! So was God--all the
   wrong was towards Him, yet, "He sent His Son to be the propitiation for
   our sins." "Oh, but the party is so unworthy." So are you. But "God
   loved you and sent His Son." Go and write according to that copy.

   I do not mean that this love is to come out of your own heart,
   originally, but I do mean that it is to flow out of your heart because
   God has made it to flow into it. You are one of those basins of the
   fountain--love has poured into you from above--let it run over to those
   who are below. Go forth at once and try and make reconciliation, not
   only between

   yourself and your friend, but between every man and God. Let that be
   your objective! Christ has become man's Reconciliation and we are to
   try and bring this Reconciliation near to every poor sinner that comes
   in our path. We are to tell him that God in Christ is reconciled. We
   are to say to him, "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for
   ours, only, but for the sins of the whole world." Mark that word! It
   tallies with that other, "Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the
   sin of the world." God is now able to deal on Gospel terms with the
   whole race! We need never think that we shall meet with men to whom God
   will not consent to be reconciled. The propitiation is such that
   whoever comes to God shall be received through it. God is always within
   to receive every soul that comes to Him by Jesus Christ. "God so loved
   the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in
   Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." Your work and mine
   is reconciliation and everything that tends that way!

   When we have done all, what then? We shall have nothing to boast of!
   Suppose a man should become so loving that he gave himself wholly up
   for his fellow creatures and actually died for them--would he have
   anything to boast of? Read my text over again. "Beloved, if God so
   loved us, we ought, also, to love one another"--so that if you get to
   the highest point of self-sacrifice, you will never be able to boast,
   for you have only, then, done what it was your duty to have done! Thus
   you see the highest grade of Christianity excludes all idea of
   salvation by works, for when we come up to its utmost pitch, if we give
   our body to be burned for love, yet, still, we have done no more than
   it was our duty to have done, considering the tremendous obligations
   under which the love of God has laid us.

   If you had to manage the waterworks for the distribution of water all
   over this city and there was a certain pipe into which you poured
   water, but none ever came out at the other end, do you know what you
   would do? You would remove it and say, "This does not suit my purpose.
   I need a pipe that will give out as well as receive." That is exactly
   what the Lord desires of us. Do not selfishly say, "I want to sit down
   and enjoy the love of God. I shall never say a word to anybody about
   Christ. I will never give a poor creature so much as a brass farthing,
   but I want to sit down and be solaced with the love of God."

   If you think thus, you are a plugged up pipe! You are of no use--you
   will have to be taken out of the system of the Church--for the system
   of love for the world requires open pipes through which Divine Love may
   freely flow. May the Lord clear you and fill you, so that out of you
   there may continually flow rivers of living water. Amen.

The Holy Spirit's Threefold Conviction of Men

   (No. 1708)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 25, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when He is come, He wiil reprove the world of sin, and of
   righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they believe not on Me;
   of righteousness, because I go to My Father, and you see Me no more; of
   judgment, because the prince of this world is judged." John 16:8-11.

   THE Apostles had a stern task before them. They were to go into all
   nations and proclaim the Gospel to every creature, beginning at
   Jerusalem. Remember, only two or three years before they were simple
   fishermen engaged upon the Galilean Lake--men of little or no
   education, men of no rank or standing. At best they were but Jews and
   that nation was despised everywhere, while these peasants were not even
   men of repute among their own nation! Yet these men were to turn the
   world upside down! They were told by their Lord that they would be
   brought before rulers and kings for His sake and that they would be
   persecuted wherever they went. They were to proclaim the Gospel in the
   teeth of the imperial power of Rome, the ancient wisdom of Greece and
   the fierce cruelties of barbaric lands. And they were to set up the
   kingdom of peace and righteousness.

   At the very time when they were about to receive their commission, they
   were also to lose the bodily Presence of their great Leader. While He
   was with them, they had felt no fear. If they were puzzled at any time
   by the Scribes and Pharisees, they resorted to Jesus, and they were
   rescued from bewilderment. Never man spoke like that Man! Never did
   such wisdom and prudence dwell in any mind as dwelt in the mind of
   Christ! His Presence was their protection, the broad shield behind
   which they securely stood, whatever shafts might be shot at them by
   their adversaries. But now that He was to depart out of the world unto
   the Father, they would be deprived of their fortress and high
   tower--they would be as children bereft of their father, or, at best,
   as soldiers without a general. Here was a sad case. Work given and
   power with-drawn--a battle beginning and the conquering Captain
   leaving.

   How happy it was for these disciples that our blessed Lord could tell
   them that His going away would be for their gain rather than for their
   loss! For when He was gone, the Spirit of God would come to be an
   Advocate for them and with them, and by His power they would be able to
   silence all their enemies and achieve their mission! The Holy Spirit
   was to be their Comforter, that they might not be afraid, and their
   Advocate, that they might not be baffled. When they spoke, there would
   be a power within them suggesting their words, a power with those words
   convincing their hearers, and a power in their hearers causing the word
   spoken to abide in their memories--that power would be Divine, the
   power of the Holy Spirit, who is One God with the Father and the Son.

   It is one thing for men to speak, and quite another thing for God to
   speak through men. The work of proclaiming the Gospel to the world was
   far too great for the 12, but it was by no means too great for the
   Spirit of God! Who can limit His power? Is anything too hard for the
   Lord? The Holy Spirit being their Helper, these feeble men were equal
   to the task which God had committed to their trust. The Presence of the
   Holy Spirit was better for them than the bodily Presence of the Lord
   Jesus. The Lord Jesus could only have been in one place as to His
   corporeal Presence, but the Holy Spirit could be everywhere! The sight
   of Jesus would but appeal to the senses, but the power of the Holy
   Spirit touched the heart and worked spiritual life and saving faith!
   Thus, by His own withdrawal and the sending of the Spirit, our Lord
   furnished His servants for the conflict.

   We will, at this time, observe what the Holy Spirit did as an Advocate.
   The passage cannot be fully understood unless we give it three
   renderings. But I do not pretend that even then, we shall have pressed
   from this choice cluster, all the generous wine of its meaning! To my
   mind, it is a compendium of all the work of the Spirit of God. By our
   three readings we shall see much--first, the Spirit of God goes with
   the preaching of the Gospel to reprove men of sin--and so to embarrass
   them in the presence of the preacher of righteousness. Secondly (and
   this is a much more blessed result), to

   convict men of sin and so to lead them to repentance towards God and
   faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. And, thirdly, the ultimate result of
   the Holy Spirit's work will be to convict men before all intelligent
   beings of having been guilty of the grossest sin--having opposed the
   most perfect righteousness and of having defied the most glorious
   judgment. We shall try to see the meaning of the passage through these
   three windows.

   I. First, we believe that a promise is here made to the servants of
   Christ that when they go forth to preach the Gospel the Holy Spirit
   will be with them TO REPROVE MEN. By this is meant, not so much to save
   them as to silence them. When the minister of Christ stands up to plead
   his Master's cause, another Advocate appears in court, whose pleadings
   would make it hard for men to resist the Truth of God. Observe how this
   reproof was given with regard to sin. On the day of Pentecost the
   disciples spoke with many different tongues, as the Spirit gave them
   utterance. Men from all countries under Heaven heard themselves
   addressed in their native tongues! This was a great marvel and all
   Jerusalem rang with it!

   And when Peter stood up to preach to the assembled multitude and told
   the Jews that they had crucified the Holy One and the Just, the signs
   and wonders worked by the Spirit in the name of Jesus were a witness
   which they could not refute. The very fact that the Spirit of God had
   given to these unlettered men the gift of tongues was evidence that
   Jesus of Nazareth, of whom they spoke, was no impostor! It was laid
   down in the old Jewish Law that if a man prophesied and his prophecies
   did not come to pass, he was to be condemned as a false prophet. But if
   that which he said came to pass, then he was a true Prophet. Now, the
   Lord Jesus Christ had promised the outpouring of the Spirit, which had
   also been foretold in reference to the Messiah by the Prophet Joel.
   When, therefore, that mark of the true Messiah was set upon Jesus of
   Nazareth by the coming of the Holy Spirit and the working of miracles,
   men were reproved for having refused to believe in Jesus.

   The evidence was brought home to them that they had, with wicked hands,
   crucified the Lord of Glory--and so they stood reproved. All the
   subsequent miracles went to prove the same thing, for when the Apostles
   worked miracles, the world was reproved of sin because it believed not
   on Christ. It was not that a few disciples testified to the sin of the
   race, but the Holy Spirit, Himself, made men tremble, as by His deeds
   of power, He bore witness to the Lord Jesus and exhibited the fact that
   in crucifying Jesus, the world had put to death the Incarnate Son of
   God! Do you not see the terrible power with which the first disciples
   were thus armed? It was more to them than the rod in the hand of Moses
   with which he smote Pharaoh with so many plagues. It needed all the
   willfulness of that stiff-necked generation to resist the Holy Spirit
   and refuse to bow before Him whom they had pierced--they were full of
   malice and obstinacy--but in their secret hearts they were sore put to
   it and felt that they were fighting against God.

   Do you not see, too, dear Friends, how the working of the Holy Spirit
   with the Apostles and their immediate followers was a wonderful rebuke
   to the world concerning the matter of righteousness? Jesus was gone and
   His Divine example no longer stood out like clear light reproving their
   darkness--but the Holy Spirit attested that righteousness and compelled
   them to feel that Jesus was the Holy One and that His cause was
   righteous. The teaching of the Apostles, sealed by the Holy Spirit,
   made the world see what righteousness was as they had never seen it
   before! A fresh standard of morals was set up in the world and it has
   never been taken down--it stands in its place to rebuke, if not to
   improve! The world was then sunk in the uttermost depths of vice--even
   its good men were loathsome! But now another kind of righteousness was
   exhibited in the teachings of the Lord Jesus and the Spirit came to set
   the seal of Divine approval to it so that if men continued in sin, it
   might be against light and knowledge, for they now knew what was
   righteousness and could no longer be mistaken upon that point. God was
   with the preachers of a new righteousness and by many different signs
   and wonders He attested the cause of the Gospel.

   Now, Brothers, we also rejoice in this, seeing that the witness of the
   Truth of God is for all time and we know of a surety that the Kingdom
   which our Lord Jesus has set up among men is Divinely sanctioned as the
   Kingdom of Righteousness which, in the end, shall grind to powder the
   powers of evil! We are the covenanted servants of a Lord whose
   righteousness was declared among men by the personal witness of God the
   Holy Spirit. Are you not glad to be enlisted in such a service? Oh,
   world, are you not embarrassed for resisting such a kingdom? These 12
   fishermen could not, of themselves, have exhibited a new standard of
   righteousness among men! They could not, on their own, have set before
   all nations a higher ideal of moral excellence! But when the eternal
   power and majesty of the Godhead vouched for the righteousness of the
   Lord Jesus, the course of the Apostolic Church became like that of the
   sun in the heavens!

   "Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the
   end of the world." None could stand against them, for, as when the
   morning breaks, the darkness flies and the bats and the night birds
   hasten away, so when the messengers of mercy proclaimed the
   Righteousness of God, man's hypocrisy and self-glorying fled away!
   Then, too, they were made to feel that a judgment had come; that
   somehow the life and the death of Jesus of Nazareth had made a crisis
   in the world's history and condemned the way and manner of the ungodly.
   All historians must confess that the turning point of the race is the
   Cross of Christ. From that moment the power of evil received its mortal
   wound! It dies hard, but from that hour it was doomed. At the death of
   our Lord, the heathen oracles were struck dumb. There had been oracles
   all over the world, either the product of evil spirits or of crafty
   priests, but after the Christian era the world ceased to believe in
   these voices and they were no more heard.

   Systems of false worship, so firmly rooted in prejudice and custom that
   it seemed impossible that they should ever be overthrown, were torn up
   by their roots by the breath of the Lord. The Apostles might have said
   to all the systems of falsehood, "as a bowing wall shall you be, and as
   a tottering fence." Men could not help perceiving that the Prince of
   Darkness had been cast down from his undivided power and that he spoke,
   from then on, with bated breath. The Seed of the woman had met the old
   serpent and, in the duel between them, He had gained such a victory
   that the cause of evil was henceforth hopeless. Moreover, the thought
   flashed upon humanity more clearly than ever--there would be a Day of
   Judgment! Men heard and felt the truth of the warning that God would
   judge the world, at the last, by the Man, Christ Jesus!

   The dim forms of Rhadamanthus on a cloudy judgment seat and of the
   assembly before his throne, and of the crowds divided according to
   their lives, now began to assume another and far more definite shape.
   It was written on the heart of mankind that there is a judgment to
   come! Men will rise again! They shall stand before the Judgment Seat of
   Christ to give an account of the things done in the body, whether good
   or evil. The world heard this and the tidings have never been
   forgotten! The Holy Spirit has reproved men by the prospect of
   judgment! The Holy Spirit attested the life of Christ, the teaching of
   the Apostles and all the grand Truths of God that were contained
   therein, by what He did in the way of miracles and by what He did in
   the way of enlightening, impressing and subduing human hearts.
   Henceforth man is accused and rebuked by the great Advocate! And all
   who remain in opposition to the Lord Jesus, remain so in defiance of
   the clearest proofs of His mission. He who rejects human testimony when
   it is true is foolish, but he who despises the witness of the Holy
   Spirit is profane, for he calls the Spirit of Truth a liar! Let him
   beware lest he so sin against the Holy Spirit as to come under the most
   terrible of curses--for it is written of him that speaks against the
   Holy Spirit--"he has no forgiveness."

   Brothers and Sisters, does not that put the Apostles in quite a
   different position from that in which they appeared to be? If we judge
   according to sense and carnal reason, their adventure was Quixotic,
   their success was impossible! Everybody would have said to them, "Go
   back to your nets and to your boats. What can you do against the
   established system of Judaism in your own country? And if that is too
   hard for you, what will you be able to do in other lands? There are
   nations that have been tutored in their own learning for thousands of
   years and have become adept in all the arts and sciences! They have
   brought all the charms of poetry, music and statuary to support their
   idolatrous systems--you are fools to think that you unlearned and
   ignorant men can ever overturn all this!"

   Would not prudence agree with this? Yes, but if God is in these men--if
   He that dwelt in the bush at Horeb and made it burn, though it was not
   consumed--will dwell in them and each one of them shall be gifted with
   a tongue of fire, this is a different business altogether! Surely, He
   that made the world, could make it new! He that said, "Let there be
   light, and there was light," could command light to shine upon the
   moral and spiritual night. Thus much upon the first reading of the
   text. Let us advance to that which will more interest you.

   II. The Holy Spirit was to go with the preaching of the Word of God TO
   CONVINCE MEN of three great prominent Truths of God. This was to be a
   saving Word--they are to be so convinced as to repent of sin, to accept
   of righteousness and yield themselves to the judgment of the Lord. Here
   we see as in a map, the work of the Spirit upon the hearts of those who
   are ordained unto eternal life! Those three effects are all necessary
   and each one is, in the highest degree, important to true conversion.
   First, the Holy Spirit is come to convince men of sin. It is absolutely
   necessary that men should be convinced of sin.

   The fashionable theology of the day is--"Convince men of the goodness
   of God! Show them the universal fatherhood and assure them of unlimited
   mercy. Win them by God's love, but never mention His wrath against sin,
   or the need of an Atonement, or the possibility of there being a place
   of punishment! Do not censure poor creatures for their failings. Do not
   judge and condemn. Do not search the heart or lead men to be
   low-spirited and sorrowful. Comfort and encourage, but never accuse and
   threaten!" Yes, that is the way of man--but the way of the Spirit of
   God is very different! He comes on purpose to convince men of sin, to
   make them feel that they are guilty, greatly guilty--so guilty that
   they are lost, ruined and undone! He comes to remind them not only of
   God's loveliness, but of their own ^loveliness--of their own enmity and
   hatred to this God of Love and, consequently, of their terrible sin in
   thus ill-using One so infinitely kind.

   The Holy Spirit does not come to make sinners comfortable in their
   sins, but to cause them to grieve over their sins! He does not help
   them to forget their sin, or think little of it, but He comes to
   convince them of the horrible enormity of their iniquity! It is no work
   of the Spirit to pipe to men's dancing--He does not bring forth flute,
   harp, dulcimer and all kinds of music to charm the unbelieving into a
   good opinion of themselves--He comes to make sin appear sin and to let
   us see its fearful consequences! He comes to wound so that no human
   balm can heal! He comes to kill so that no earthly power can make us
   live! The flowers bedeck the meadows when the grass is green, but lo, a
   burning wind comes from the desert and the grass withers and the
   flowers fall away. What is it that makes the beauty and excellence of
   human righteousness to wither as the green herb? Isaiah says it is
   "because the Spirit of the Lord blows upon it."

   There is a withering work of the Spirit of God which we must experience
   or we shall never know His quickening and restoring power. This
   withering is a most necessary experience and, just now, needs much to
   be insisted on. Today we have so many built up who were never pulled
   down; so many filled who were never emptied; so many exalted who were
   never humbled that I, the more earnestly, remind you that the Holy
   Spirit must convince us of sin or we cannot be saved! This work is most
   necessary because without it there is no leading men to receive the
   Gospel of the Grace of God. We cannot make headway with certain people
   because they profess faith very readily, but they are not convinced of
   anything. "Oh, yes, we are sinners, no doubt, and Christ died for
   sinners"--that is the free-and-easy way with which they handle heavenly
   mysteries--as if they were the nonsense verses of a boy's exercise, or
   the stories of Mother Goose!

   This is all mockery and we are weary of it. But get near a real sinner
   and you have found a man you can deal with--I mean the man who is a
   sinner and there is no mistake about it--he mourns in his inmost soul
   that he is so. In such a man you find one who will welcome the Gospel,
   welcome Grace and welcome a Savior. To him the news of pardon will be
   as cold water to a thirsty soul--and the Doctrines of Grace will be as
   honey dropping from the comb! "A sinner," says one of our songsters,
   "is a sacred thing"--the Holy Spirit has made Him so. Your sham sinner
   is a horrid creature, but a man truly convinced of sin by the Spirit of
   God is a being to be sought after as a jewel that will adorn the crown
   of the Redeemer!

   Note here, that the Spirit of God comes to convince men of sin because
   they never will be convinced of sin apart from His Divine advocacy. A
   natural conscience touched by the Spirit of God may do a good deal in
   the way of showing a man his faults. It may thus make him uneasy and
   may bring about a reformation of life. But it is only the Spirit of God
   that, to the full extent, convinces a man of sin so as to bring forth
   repentance, self-despair and faith in Jesus. For what is the sin that
   you and I are guilty of? Ah, Brothers and Sisters, it is not easy to
   tell, but this I know, that the extent of sin is never known till the
   Spirit of God reveals the secret chambers of the heart's abominations.
   We do a thousand things that we do not know to be sin till the Spirit
   of God enlightens us and pleads the cause of holiness in us.

   What natural man, for instance, ever laments over evil thoughts or
   desires, or the imaginations which flit across his mind? Yet all these
   are sins and sins which cause a gracious heart the deepest distress! If
   we were never actually to commit evil, yet if we desire to do so, we
   have already sinned! And if we feel pleasure in thinking of evil, we
   have already sinned. This poison is in our nature and shows itself in a
   thousand ways. The fact that we not only sin, but are, by nature,
   sinful, is one which our pride kicks against--and we will not learn it
   till the Spirit of God teaches it to us. Neither does any man know the
   exceeding sinfulness of sin till the Light of God falls upon the black
   mass from the Holy Spirit. Every sin is, as it were, an assault upon
   God's Throne, Glory and life. Sin would dethrone the Most High and
   destroy Him if it could--but men do not see this. They talk of sin most
   lightly and know not that it scatters firebrands and death.

   I tell you, when the Spirit of God makes a man see sin in its naked
   deformity, he is horrified! When I saw, or thought I saw, the
   heinousness of sin, it was intolerable and I had no rest in my spirit.
   Some such sight we must all have, or we shall never look to the Lord
   Jesus to take away our sin. None but those whose wounds smart are
   likely to apply for the heavenly balm. The Holy Spirit dwells upon one
   point in particular--"of sin, because they believe not on Me." None see
   the sin of unbelief except by His light. A man thinks, "Well, if I have
   not believed in Christ, that is a pity, perhaps, but still, I was never
   a thief, or a liar, or a drunk, or unchaste. Unbelief is a matter of
   very little consequence. I can set that right at any time." But the
   Holy Spirit makes a man see that not to believe in Christ is a
   crowning, damning sin, since, "he that believes not has made God a
   liar"--and what can be more atrocious than that?

   He who believes not on Christ has rejected God's mercy and has done
   despite to the grandest display of God's love! He has despised God's
   unspeakable Gift and trampled on the blood of Christ! In this he has
   dishonored God on a very tender point. He has insulted Him concerning
   His only-begotten Son! How I wish that the Spirit of God would come
   upon unbelievers, here, and make them see what they are and where they
   are with regard to the one and only Savior! How shall they escape, who
   neglect so great a salvation? It will not matter how feebly I speak
   this morning if the Spirit of God will only work by the Truth of God on
   you--you will perceive the greatness of your crime and you will never
   rest until you have believed on the Lord Jesus--and found forgiveness
   for your high offense against the bleeding Lamb!

   So far, then, upon the first operation of the Holy Spirit. The next
   work of the Spirit is to convince men of righteousness, that is to say,
   in Gospel terms, to show them that they have no righteousness of their
   own and no means of working righteousness--and that apart from Grace
   they are condemned! Thus He leads them to value the righteousness of
   God which is, upon all them that believe, a righteousness which covers
   sin and renders them acceptable with God. Lend me your ears a moment
   while I call your attention to a great wonder! Among men, if a person
   is convicted of wrong-doing, the next step is judgment. A young man,
   for instance, has been in the service of an employer and he has
   embezzled money--he is convicted of the theft by process of law and
   found guilty. What follows next?

   Why, judgment is pronounced and he must suffer the penalty! But observe
   how our gracious God interpolates another process. Truly, His ways are
   not our ways! "He shall convince of sin." The next step would be
   judgment, but no, the Lord inserts an up to now unknown middle term and
   convinces "of righteousness." Be amazed at this! The Lord takes a man,
   even when he is sinful and conscious of that sin, and makes him
   righteous on the spot by putting away his sin and justifying him by the
   righteousness of faith, a righteousness which comes to him by the
   worthiness of Another who has worked out a righteousness for him! Can
   that be? Brothers and Sisters, this seems to be unthinkable--so
   impossible that it needs the Spirit of God to convince men of it!

   I may now set forth the great plan whereby the Lord Jesus is made of
   God unto us righteousness! I may show how the Son of God became Man
   that He might fully keep the Law of God for us and, having done so, and
   having added His passive obedience to His active service, He presented
   to His Father a complete vindication of His injured Law so that every
   man that believes on Him shall be delivered from condemnation and
   accepted in the Beloved! I might also tell how Christ's righteousness
   is set to our account so that faith is reckoned unto us for
   righteousness, even as was the case with faithful Abraham. Yet all my
   labor will be in vain till the Spirit shall make it plain! Many hear
   the gladsome tidings, but they do not receive the Truth of God, for
   they are not convinced of it. They need to be persuaded of it before
   they will embrace it--and that persuasion is not in my power.

   Did I hear one remark, "I cannot see this way of righteousness"? I
   answer, No, and you never will until the Spirit of God convinces you of
   it! Note well the great point of the Spirit's argument--"Of
   righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more." Our
   Lord was sent into the world to work out a righteousness and here, He
   says, "I go." But He would not go till He had done His work. He says,
   also, "I go to My Father." But He would not go back to His Father till
   He had fulfilled His Covenant engagements. "I go to My Father," that
   is, I go to receive a reward and to sit upon My Father's Throne. But He
   could not have received this Glory if He had not finished His appointed
   work! Behold, then, Christ has finished a righteousness which is freely
   given to all them that believe! And all those who trust in Christ are,
   for His sake, rewarded as righteous before God--and are, in fact,
   righteous, so that Paul says, "Who is he that condemns?"

   His ground for asking that question is the same as that which the
   Spirit uses in my text. Paul says, "It is Christ that died, yes,
   rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
   also makes intercession for us." He

   quotes, as the Holy Spirit does, the resurrection, ascension and
   enthronement of the great Intercessor as the proof positive that there
   is a perfect righteousness for all believing sinners! I know that many
   will say, "This is making people righteous who are not righteous" and,
   therefore, they will raise many objections. Just so! This is the Glory
   of God, that He justifies the ungodly and saves sinners by Christ.
   "Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity."

   "I do not see it," cries one. And our answer is, "We know you do not!
   We are not in the least surprised that you reject our testimony--we
   never expected you to receive it unless the arm of the Lord should be
   revealed and the Holy Spirit should convince you of righteousness." No
   man comes to Christ who is not drawn of the Father and enlightened by
   the Spirit! But if the Spirit convinces you, we shall soon hear you
   sing--

   "Jesus, Your blood and righteousness My beauty are, my glorious dress!
   Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed, With joy shall I lift up my
   head." Dear people of God, pray hard that the Spirit of God may, even
   now, convince unbelievers that the only true righteousness for mortal
   men is that which comes not by the works of the Law, but by the hearing
   of faith!

   But then comes a third point, the Spirit of God is to convince men of
   judgment. To whom is this judgment committed? "The Father has committed
   all judgment unto the Son." The true penitent feels that if he had all
   his sins forgiven him, yet it will not serve his turn so long as he
   lies wallowing in sin. He feels that the great enemy of his soul must
   be dethroned, or else forgiveness, itself, will afford him no rest of
   heart. He must be rescued from the power as well as from the guilt of
   sin, or else he abides in bondage. He must see the power of evil hewn
   in pieces before the Lord, as Samuel hewed Agag of old. Listen, O
   troubled one! You shall be set free, for, "the prince of this world is
   judged." Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil--and on the
   Cross, our Redeemer judged Satan, overcame him and cast him down!

   Satan is now a condemned criminal, a vanquished rebel. His reigning
   power over all Believers is broken. He has great wrath, knowing that
   his time is short, but that wrath is held in check by his Conqueror! In
   His passion, our Lord fought Satan foot to foot and overcame him,
   spoiling principalities and powers and making a show of them openly,
   triumphing over them in it. Do you believe this? May the Spirit of God
   convince you of it! O tried Believer, the Lord Jesus overthrew the
   devil for you! He crushed the powers of darkness for you! Believing in
   Him, you shall find evil dethroned in you and all the forces of sin
   hurled from their high places! You shall overcome through the blood of
   the Lamb! Again, I ask, do you believe this? Christ is made of God unto
   us sanctification--He saves His people from their sins--He makes them
   holy and so breaks in pieces their enemy.

   Though it will cost you many a conflict and the beaded sweat may, in
   the hour of temptation, stand upon your brow as you fear that you will
   fall from holiness, yet the Lord shall bruise Satan under your feet,
   shortly, for He has already bruised him under His own feet on your
   behalf! The Spirit of God is needed to convince our unbelieving hearts
   that it is so. Most men dream that they must overcome sin by their own
   strength. Alas, the strong armed man still keeps the house against our
   feebleness. You have a pretty piece of work before you if, in your own
   strength, you venture on this conflict. I can hear the devil laughing
   at you even now! This leviathan is not to be tamed by you. Job would
   say, "Will you play with him as with a bird?" Do you think the devil is
   as easily managed as a woman carries her pet bird on her finger and
   puts it to her lip to peck a seed?

   Can you draw out leviathan with a hook? Will he speak soft words unto
   you? Will you take him to be a servant forever? Your arrows cannot come
   at him, nor your sword wound him! "Lay your hand upon him, remember the
   battle, do no more." A Divine power is needed and that power is ready
   to display itself if it is humbly sought! Many who are convinced of the
   righteousness of Christ are not yet fully convinced that evil is
   judged, condemned and cast down. They are haunted with the dread that
   they may yet perish by the hand of the enemy. Oh, my Brothers and
   Sisters, see the need of the Holy Spirit to advocate in your heart the
   cause of and Truth of God--and make you believe that the Lord Jesus has
   supreme power over every enemy!

   I sometimes meet with a Christian who tells me the world is all going
   to the bad, the Gospel is being utterly defeated, Christ is routed, the
   devil is waving the black flag and shouting victory. I know how
   terrible is the conflict, but I believe that my Lord Jesus has judged
   the whole kingdom of evil and, in that fact I see Satan fall like
   lightning from Heaven! Our Lord must reign! His enemies must lick the
   dust! We shall judge the fallen angels at the Last Great Day and,
   meanwhile, a believing life is a life of triumph over the arch enemy!
   In the power of the Spirit it shall be proven that truth is

   mightier than error, love is stronger than hate and holiness is higher
   than sin, for the Lord's right hand and His holy arm have gotten Him
   the victory! Behold how the ascended Savior leads captivity captive!
   See how He comes from Edom with dyed garments from Bozrah, for He has
   trodden sin and Hell in the winepress and now He travels in the
   greatness of His strength, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save!

   Let me run again over this ground, that we may not overlook anything.
   Dear Friends, those of us who are saved still need the Holy Spirit with
   us every day to convince us of sin! Good men do, at this hour, most
   complacently, things which, in clearer light, they would never think of
   doing! May the Holy Spirit continually show us layer after layer of
   sin, that we may remove it. May He reveal to us rank after rank of sin,
   that we may conquer all its forces. May He especially make known to us
   the sin of not believing in Christ, for even we have our doubts and
   fears. After a sermon concerning sin, the poor child of God cries out,
   "I dare not believe! I am afraid I shall be lost, after all." This
   unbelief is another sin. Strange way of escaping from sin by plunging
   into it!

   To doubt the Lord is to add sin to sin! No sin is more pernicious than
   the sin of not believing. Whenever our heart distrusts the Lord, we
   grieve His Spirit--therefore we always need the Holy Spirit to convince
   us of this evil and bitter thing--and to lead us to trust after a
   child-like fashion. Any mistrust of God's promise; any fear of failure
   on God's part; any thought of His unfaithfulness is a crime against the
   honor of the Divine majesty! Oh, convincing Spirit, dwell with me from
   day to day convincing me of sin and especially making me to feel that
   the worst of all evils is to question my faithful Friend. So, also, may
   you always have the Spirit of God dwelling with you, convincing you of
   righteousness.

   May those of you who are, indeed, Believers, never question but what
   you are righteous before God. We who believe are made the righteousness
   of God in Christ Jesus! Are we assured of this? If so, do not think and
   talk as if you were still under the curse of the Law, for you are no
   longer in any such condition. "Therefore being justified by faith, we
   have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." "There is,
   therefore, now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." Oh,
   may the Spirit of God convince you of that every day--and convince you
   of it on the ground that Jesus is reigning yonder at the Father's right
   hand!. The interest of each Believer in His Lord is clear and sure. If
   Jesus is there, I am there. If the Father has accepted Him, He has
   accepted me!

   Do you catch the logic of it? You are in Christ, you are one with
   Him--as He is, so are you in Him! Hold fast to the fact that you are
   not condemned. How can you be? You are at the right hand of God in
   Christ. You, condemned? Why, you are "accepted in the Beloved," for
   your Representative is accepted by God and made to sit upon His Throne!
   Jesus is exalted, not for Himself, alone, but for all those who believe
   in Him! May the blessed Spirit fully convince you of this grand Truth
   of God!

   And, next, may He convince you of judgment--namely, that you have been
   judged and your enemy has been judged and condemned. The Day of
   Judgment is not a thing to be dreaded by a Believer. We have stood our
   trial, and have been acquitted. Our Representative has borne the
   penalty of our sin. Our chastisement is passed, for Jesus has borne
   it--He was numbered with transgressors. There is, now, no curse for us!
   There can be none--Heaven, earth, Hell cannot find a curse for those
   whom God has blessed--since the Lord Jesus "was made a curse for us."
   May the Spirit of God come on you afresh, my dearly Beloved, and make
   you confident and joyful in Him who is the Lord our righteousness, by
   whom evil has been judged, once and for all!

   II. Last of all, let us read our text by rendering it, "convict"--"The
   Spirit of God will CONVICT the world of sin, of righteousness, and of
   judgment." There is the world. It stands a prisoner at the bar and the
   charge is that it is and has been full of sin. In courts of law you are
   often surprised with what comes out. You look at the prisoner and he
   seems to be a quiet, respectable person. And you say, "I should not
   think he is guilty." But the advocate who has engaged to plead the
   cause of righteousness stands up and gives an outline of the case--and
   you speedily change your mind, until, as the evidence proceeds, you say
   to yourself, "That is a villain if ever there was one."

   Now hear the Spirit of God! The Spirit came into the world to make all
   men know that Jesus is the Christ. And He attested to that fact by
   miracles that could not be questioned, miracles without number! He has,
   moreover, attested the truth of the Gospel by the conversion of
   myriads, whose happy and holy lives have been a proof that Jesus Christ
   was, indeed, sent forth from God. But what did this wicked world do
   with Christ? They gave Him a felon's death! They nailed Him to a cross!
   By this, the world is condemned! We need no further evidence. The world
   is convicted--self-condemned

   by the slaughter of Him who was Incarnate Goodness and unbounded Love!
   The world is base enough to desire to slay its God even when He comes
   on an errand of love!

   Take the accused away! The world's guilt is proven beyond question. The
   wrath of God abides on it. What follows upon this? The trial is viewed
   from another point. The world has declared that the Gospel is not
   righteous, that the system which our Lord has come to establish is not
   true. Up to this day the world is continually raising objections,
   trying to confuse Believers and, if possible, to defeat our most holy
   cause. But the Spirit of God, by His teaching, proves that the Gospel
   is full of righteousness and, by all His operations through the Word of
   God, He proves that the Gospel is holy, just, good and tends to make
   men pure, godly, peaceable and holy. By sanctifying men through the
   Gospel so that they lead gracious lives, the Holy Spirit proves that
   the Gospel is righteous!

   This process grows more and more complete as time rolls on. Were not
   the world unrighteous, it would, long ago, have yielded to the holy
   message and its holy Messenger. But it will be forced to acknowledge
   the Truth one day. The Holy Spirit makes the world know that Christ is
   righteous by flashing into its face the fact that Christ has gone--gone
   up to Glory, at the right hand of God--and this could not have been had
   He not been the Righteous One. When the world shall see Jesus
   enthroned, at the last, and all mankind shall behold the Son of Man on
   the clouds of Heaven, what conviction will seize on every mind! There
   will be no agnostics, then! Not a skeptic will be found in that day!
   Christ seen at the Father's right hand will end all unbelief!

   And then the Spirit of God shall make men see the judgment. Before the
   day actually comes, they shall perceive that since Christ has judged
   the devil; since Christ has cast him down from his high places and his
   power over the world is already broken, assuredly He will smite all
   that are in the dominion of Satan and will not allow one of them to
   escape. The cause of evil is judged and its case is desperate. Oh, how
   the Spirit of God will convict men at that last day when they hear the
   Judge say, "Come, you blessed of My Father," or, "Depart, you cursed,
   into everlasting fire." Brothers and Sisters, will you be convinced by
   the Holy Spirit, now, or will you wait till then? Shall it be the
   convincement of Grace or the conviction of wrath? The Spirit still
   bears witness with us who preach the Gospel--will you yield to that
   Gospel and believe it, now? Or will you wait until the blaze of the
   last tremendous day? Which shall it be?

   I think I hear you say, "The Gospel is true." Why, then, do you not
   believe it? If you confess "sin," why are you not washed from it? If
   there is "righteousness," why do you not seek it? If there is
   "judgment," why do you not ask to be so cleansed that you need not be
   afraid of it? Oh, Sirs, the most of men act as if they were born fools!
   If they were sick and we had a sure medicine for them, they would rush
   to us for it! If they were poor and we brought them gold, they would
   trample us down in their vehemence to snatch at wealth!

   But when there is Christ to be had, the Divine remedy for sin--Christ
   to be had as a perfect Righteousness, Christ to make them stand
   securely at the last dread day--they turn their backs upon the heavenly
   Gift! Oh, Spirit of God, win these madmen! Bring back these fools and
   make them sane and wise, for Christ Jesus' sake! Amen.

The Best War Cry

   (No. 1709)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 4, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The Lord his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them."
   Numbers 23:21.

   IT was a singular spectacle to see the king of Moab and his lords
   climbing to the tops of the craggy rocks, accompanied by that strange
   being, the Eastern prophet Balaam. They are seeking to look upon Israel
   with the evil eye and flash down curses upon her tents in the plain
   beneath. You see them gazing down from the mountains upon the
   encampment in the wilderness below, even as vultures from aloft spy out
   their prey. They watch with keen and cruel eyes. Cunning and malice are
   in their countenances. How Balak longs to crush the nation which he
   fears! They are secretly endeavoring, by spell and enchantment, to
   bring evil upon the people whom Jehovah has chosen and led into the
   wilderness. You see them offering their seven bullocks and their seven
   rams upon the seven altars which they have set up upon Pisgah's rocks.

   Balaam retires to wait until the impulse shall come upon him and he
   shall be able to prophesy. In all probability Moses knew nothing about
   this at the time and certainly the people below knew nothing of the
   foul conspiracy. There lay the tribes in the valley, unaware that
   mischief was brewing, and quite unable to meet the dark design even if
   they had been aware of it. What a mercy it was for them that they were
   guarded by a Watcher--a Holy One whose eyes can never slumber. How true
   it is--"I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
   hurt it, I will keep it night and day." The Lord's eyes are fixed upon
   Balaam the hireling, and Balak the son of Zippor--in vain do they weave
   the enchantment and work the divination--they shall be utterly ashamed
   and confounded.

   They were baffled in their machinations and utterly defeated in their
   schemes, and that for one single reason--it is written, "JEHOVAH
   SHAMMAH--the Lord Is There. God's Presence in the midst of His people
   is as a wall of fire round about them and a Glory in their midst. The
   Lord is their light and their salvation, whom shall they fear? At this
   present time God has a people, a remnant according to the election of
   Grace, who still dwell like sheep in the midst of wolves. When, as a
   part of the Lord's Church, we look at our surroundings, we see much
   that might cause us alarm, for never, either day or night, is Satan
   quiet. Like a roaring lion, he goes about, seeking whom he may devour!
   He plots in secret his crafty devices--if it were possible he would
   deceive the very elect!

   This Prince of Darkness has on earth many most diligent servants,
   compassing sea and land to make proselytes, laying out all their
   strength and using all their craft and cunning if, by any means, they
   may destroy the Kingdom of God and blot out the Truth of God from under
   Heaven. It is saddest of all to see certain men who know the Truth in
   some degree, as Balaam did, entering into league with the adversary
   against the true Israel. These combine their arts and use all possible
   means that the Gospel of the Grace of God, and the Church that holds
   it, may utterly be destroyed. If the Church is not destroyed, it will
   be no thanks to her enemies, for they would swallow her up quickly!

   When we look upon the signs of the times, our heart grows heavy, for
   iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold, many false spirits have
   gone abroad in the earth and some whom we looked upon as helpers are
   proving themselves to be of another order. What then? Are we dismayed?
   By no means, for that same God who was in the midst of the Church in
   the wilderness is in the Church of these last days! Again shall her
   adversaries be defeated. Still will He defend her, for the Lord has
   built His Church upon a rock and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
   against her. The reason of her safety is this--

   "God in the midst of her does dwell; Nothing shall her remove;

   The Lord to her a Helper shall, And that right early, pro ve."

   Our text declares the grand safeguard of the Church of God, ensuring
   her against every peril known and unknown, earthly or Satanic--"Jehovah
   his God is with him, and the shout of a King is among them." May the
   Holy Spirit help me while I try to speak, first, upon God's Presence
   with His people. Secondly, upon the results of that Presence. And
   thirdly, upon how, by the Grace of God, that Presence may be preserved
   continually among us.

   I. First, let me speak a little upon GOD'S PRESENCE AMONG HIS PEOPLE.
   It is an extraordinary Presence, for God's ordinary and usual Presence
   is everywhere. Where shall we flee from His Presence? He is in the
   highest Heaven and in the lowest Hell! The hand of the Lord is upon the
   high hills and His power is in all deep places. This knowledge is too
   high and wonderful for us! God is everywhere, for in Him we live and
   move and have our being. Still there is a peculiar Presence, for God
   was among His people in the wilderness as He was not among the Moabites
   and the Edomites, their foes. And God is in His Church as He is not in
   the world. It is a peculiar promise of the Covenant that God will dwell
   with His people and walk among them.

   By the gift of the Holy Spirit, the Lord is with us and in us at this
   hour. He says of His Church, "Here will I dwell, for I have desired
   it." This is much more than God's being about us--it includes the favor
   of God towards us, His consideration of us, His working with us. An
   active nearness to bless is the Presence of which we speak. Here we may
   say with great reverence that God is with His people in the entireness
   of His Nature. The Father is with us, for the Father, Himself, loves
   us. Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them that
   fear Him. He is near to us, supplying our needs, guiding our steps,
   helping us in time and tutoring us for eternity. God is where His
   children are, hearing every groan of their sorrow, marking every tear
   of their distress. The Father is in the midst of His family, acting a
   father's part towards them. "Lord, you have been our dwelling place in
   all generations." He is never far from any into whose breasts He has
   put the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father!" Come, you
   children of God, rejoice in this--your heavenly Father has come unto
   you and abides with you!

   We also have the Presence of the Divine Son of God. Said He not to His
   Apostles, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world"?
   Have we not this for our joy whenever we come together, that we meet in
   His name, and that He still says, "Peace be unto you," and manifests
   Himself unto us as He does not unto the world? Many of you know most
   delightfully what it is to have fellowship with God, for "truly our
   fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ"--and this
   fellowship were not ours if we were not made near by His precious
   blood. Very near are we to the heart of Christ--He dwells with us--yes,
   He is one with us!

   Peculiarly this presence relates to the Holy Spirit. It is He who
   represents the Lord Jesus who has gone from us. We have a double
   portion of Christ's Spirit because we see Him, now that He is taken up,
   even as Elisha had a double portion of Elijah's spirit, according to
   the Prophet's saying, "If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall
   be so unto you." That is, a double portion of my spirit shall rest upon
   you. It was expedient that our Lord and Master should go, that the
   Spirit might be given! That Spirit, once poured out at Pentecost, has
   never been withdrawn! He is still in the midst of this dispensation,
   working, guiding, quickening, comforting, exercising all the blessed
   office of the Paraclete and, being for us and in us, God's Advocate,
   pleading for the Truth of God and for us.

   Yes, dear Friends, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are in the
   midst of the true Church of God when that Church is in a right and
   healthy state. And if the Triune God is gone away from the Church, then
   her banners must trail in the dust, for her warriors have lost their
   strength. This is the Glory of the Church of God--to have the Grace of
   the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God the Father and the communion of
   the Holy Spirit to be her never-failing benediction! What a glory to
   have Father, Son and Holy Spirit manifesting the Godhead in the midst
   of our assemblies and blessing each one of us! For God to dwell with
   us--what a condescending Presence this is! And will God, in very truth,
   dwell among men? If the Heaven of heavens cannot contain Him, will He
   abide among His people? He will! He will! Glory be to His name! "Know
   you not that your bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit?" God
   dwells in us! Wonderful word!

   Who can fathom the depth of this Grace? The mystery of the Incarnation
   is equaled by the mystery of the indwelling! That God, the Holy Spirit,
   should dwell in our bodies is as extraordinary as that God, the Son,
   should inhabit that body which was born of the blessed virgin! Strange,
   strange is this, that the Creator should dwell in His creatures, that
   the Infinite should tabernacle in finite beings! Yet so it is, for He
   has said, "Certainly I will be with you." What an awe this imparts to
   every true Church of God! You may go in and out of certain assemblies
   and you may say, "Here we have beauty! Here we have adornment, musical,
   ecclesiastical, architectural, oratorical and the like!"

   But to my mind there is no worship like that which proceeds from a man
   when he feels the Lord is present! What a hush comes over the soul!
   Here is the place for the bated breath, the unsandalled foot and the
   prostrate spirit! Now are we on holy ground. When the Lord descends in
   the majesty of His infinite love to deal with the hearts of men, then
   it is with us as it was in Solomon's temple when the priests could not
   stand to minister by reason of the Glory that filled the place. Man is
   set aside, for God is there! In such a case the most fluent think it
   better to be silent, for there is, at times, more expressiveness in
   absolute silence than in the fittest words. "How dreadful is this
   place! This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of
   Heaven." Why? Because Jacob had said, "Surely the Lord is in this
   place."

   We regard the lowliest assemblies of the most illiterate people with
   solemn reverence if God is there--we regard the largest assemblies of
   the wealthiest and most renowned with utter indifference if God is not
   there. This is the one necessity of the Church--the Lord God must be in
   the midst of her or she is nothing! If God is there, peace will be
   within her walls and prosperity within her palaces--but if the Lord is
   not there, woe unto the men that speak in His name, for they shall cry
   in bitterness, "Who has believed our report?" Woe unto the waiting
   people, for they shall go away empty! Woe unto the sinners in a
   forsaken Zion, for no salvation comes to them! The Presence of God
   makes the Church to be a joyful, happy, solemn place! This brings glory
   to His name and peace to His people. But without it, all faces are
   pale, all hearts are heavy.

   Brothers and Sisters, this Presence of God is clearly discerned by the
   gracious, though others may not know it. Yet I think even the
   ungracious, in a measure, perceive it--coming into the assembly they
   are struck with a secret some-thing--they know not what. And if they do
   not immediately join in the worship of the present God, yet a deep
   impression is made upon them beyond any that could be caused by the
   sound of human speech, or by the grandeur of outward show. They feel
   awed and retire abashed. Certainly the devil knows where God is--none
   better than he. He hates the camp of which Jehovah is the leader
   against it. He doubles his enmity, multiplies his plots and exercises
   all his power. He knows where his kingdom finds its bravest assailants
   and he, therefore, attacks their headquarters, even as Balaam and Balak
   did of old.

   Let us look at Balaam for a moment. May we never run in the way of
   Balaam for a reward, but let us stand in his way for a moment that he
   may be our beacon. This man had sold himself for gold and, though he
   knew God and spoke under Inspiration, yet he knew Him not in his heart,
   but was willing to curse God's people for money. He was thwarted in his
   design because God was there. It is worth our while to see what kind of
   a God Jehovah is in Balaam's estimation. He describes our God in verse
   19--"God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that
   He should repent: has He said, and shall He not do it? Or has He spoken
   and shall He not make it good?" Balaam perceived that the God who was
   in the midst of His people is not a changeable god, not a false god,
   not one who promises and forgets, or promises and eats his words, or
   promises what he cannot and will not perform.

   The God of Israel is faithful and true, immutable, unchanging! Every
   one of His promises shall be fulfilled! None of His Words shall fall to
   the ground. "Has He said, and shall He not do it? Has He spoken and
   shall it not come to pass?" What a joy it is to have such a God as this
   among us--a promise-making and a promise-keeping God--a God at work for
   His people as He has declared He would be! We have a God comforting and
   cheering His people--and fulfilling in their experience that which His
   Word has led them to expect. This God is our God forever and ever! He
   shall be our Guide even unto death! My dear Friends, we sometimes hear
   men talk of the failure of the Church. We are afraid that some churches
   do fail. Wherever failure occurs, the bottom of it is the absence of
   the Lord of Hosts, for He cannot fail.

   I heard one, speaking of the district in which he lives, say, "We are a
   religions people. Almost all the people attend a place of worship,
   but," he added, "I am bound to add that of spiritual life we have few
   traces. One Church has given up its Prayer Meetings; another feels that
   its entertainments are more important than its worship and another is
   notorious for worldliness." This is a testimony as terrible as it is
   common! The worst thing that can be said of any Christian community is
   this--"You have a name to live and are dead." "You are neither cold nor
   hot." Our Lord Jesus says, "I would you were cold or hot. So, then,
   because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue you out
   of My mouth."

   A Church without life and zeal makes Christ sick! He cannot bear it. He
   can put up with downright godlessness sooner than with a profession of
   religion out of which the life and the power are gone, since it has
   cooled down into lukewarmness. This, then, we should pray for
   continually--the Presence of God in the midst of His people--

   "Great Shepherd of Your Israel

   Who did, between the cherubs dwell, And led the tribes, Your chosen
   sheep, Safe through the desert and the deep, Your Church is in the
   desert now! Shine from on high, and guide us through. Turn us to You,
   Your love restore We shall be saved, and sigh no more."

   II. To whet your desire for this, let me pass on to the second head of
   my subject, which is briefly to describe THE RESULTS OF THIS DIVINE
   PRESENCE. Some of these results are mentioned in the context. One of
   the first is leading--"God brought them out of Egypt" (v. 22). The best
   critics give us another rendering--"God is bringing them out of Egypt."
   When God is in the midst of His people, He is leading them, so that we
   may cheerfully sing that song, "He leads me, He leads me," and go on
   with David to say, "He leads me beside the still waters." We need no
   other Leader in the Church when we have God, for His eyes and arms will
   guide His people.

   I am always afraid of having human rules in a Church and equally
   fearful of being governed by human precedents. I am afraid of power
   being vested in one, or two, or 20 men--the power must be in the Lord,
   Himself. That Church which has God in the midst of it, rules itself,
   and goes right without any other guidance but that which comes of the
   Holy Spirit's working. Such a Church keeps together without aiming at
   uniformity and goes on to victory even though it makes no noise. That
   movement is right which is led by God--and that is sure to be all wrong
   which is led in the best possible way if God is absent. Organization is
   all very well, but I sometimes feel inclined to join with Zwingli in
   the battle when he said, "In the name of the Holy Trinity let all
   loose," for when everybody is free, if God is present, everybody is
   bound to do the right thing. When each man moves according to the
   Divine instinct in him, there will be little need of regulations--all
   is order where God rules! Just as the atoms of matter obey the present
   power of God, so do separate Believers obey the one great impelling
   influence.

   Oh, if God is in the Church to lead it, it shall be rightly guided! Do
   not fall in love with this particular system, or that, my Brothers and
   Sisters--do not cry up this scheme of working or that! Get the Spirit
   of God and almost any shape that spiritual life takes will be a form of
   energy suitable for the particular emergency! God never leads His
   people wrongly! It is for them to follow the fiery, cloudy pillar.
   Though it leads them through the sea, they shall traverse it dry-shod!
   Though it leads them through a desert, they shall be fed! Though it
   brings them into a thirsty land, they shall drink to the full of water
   from the Rock! We must have the Lord with us to guide us into our
   promised rest.

   The next blessing is strength. "He has, as it were, the strength of an
   unicorn" (v. 22). It is generally agreed that the creature here meant
   is an extinct species of urns or ox, most nearly represented by the
   buffalo of the present period. This gives us the sentence--"He has, as
   it were, the strength of a buffalo." When God is in a Church, what
   rugged strength, what massive force, what irresistible energy is sure
   to be there! And how untamable is the living force! You cannot yoke
   this buffalo to everybody's plow--it has its own free way of living and
   it acts after its own style. When the Lord is with a Church, her power
   is not in numbers, though very speedily she will increase. Her power is
   not wealth, though God will take care that the money comes when it is
   needed. Her power lies in God--and that power becomes irresistible,
   untamable, unconquerable! Force and energy are with the Lord.

   I fear that what many bodies of Christian people need is this force.
   Examine yonder religious body--it is huge, but it lacks muscle--it is a
   fine-looking organization, but soul, sinew, backbone are lacking. Where
   God is, there is sure to be life-force. When the Spirit of God
   descended upon the first saints, they began to speak with wondrous
   power! And though they were persecuted, they were not subdued. No bit
   could be put into their mouths to hold them in, for they went
   everywhere preaching the Word of God! Of the true Israel it shall be
   said--"His strength is as the strength of the buffalo: it cannot be
   controlled or conquered."

   The next result is safety. "Surely there is no enchantment against
   Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel." The Presence of
   God quietly baffles all the attempts of the Evil One. I have noticed,
   dear Brothers and Sisters, in this Church where we have had God's
   Presence in a great measure, that all around us people have gone off to
   this opinion and to the other fancy, yet, our members, as a rule, have
   stood firm. Persons say to me, "Do you not sometimes answer the
   skepticisms of the day?" I answer, No. They do not come in my way. "Do
   not modern opinions trouble your

   Church?" They have not done so. Why? Because God is there and spiritual
   life, in vigorous exercise, does not fall a victim to disease! A
   gracious atmosphere does not agree with modern doubt.

   When people fall into that evil, they go where the thing is indulged,
   or at least where it is combated--where in some way or other they can
   develop their love of novelty and foster the notion of their own
   wisdom. Infidelity, Socinianism, and modern thought can make no headway
   where the Spirit is at work! Enchantment does not lie against Israel
   and divination does not touch Jacob. If a Church will keep to the Truth
   of God, keep to God, and do its own work, it can live like a lamb in
   the midst of wolves without being torn in pieces. Have God with you and
   not only the evil of doctrinal error but every other error shall be
   kept far from you. But still, there was, when Christ was in the Church,
   a Judas in the midst of it--and even in the Apostles' days there were
   some that went out from them because they were not of them, for if they
   had been of them, doubtless they would have continued with
   them--therefore we may not expect to be without false brethren.

   But the true safety of the Church is not a creed, not an enactment for
   expelling those who violate the creed--only the Presence of God can
   protect His people against the cunning assaults of their foes. Upon
   these words, "there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination
   against Israel," suffer a few sentences. There are still a few foolish
   people in the world who believe in witchcraft and spells, but you,
   Beloved, if you love the Lord, throw such nonsense to the winds! Do you
   not hear people talk about this being lucky and that unlucky? This
   notion is heathenish and unchristian! Never utter such nonsense! But
   even if there were such things as witchcraft and divination, if this
   house were full of devils and the air swarmed with invisible spirits of
   an evil sort, yet if we are the people of God, surely there is no
   enchantment against us. Divination cannot touch a child of God--the
   Evil One is chained!

   Therefore be of good courage--if God is for us, who can be against us?
   Further than that, God gives to His people the next blessing, that is,
   of His so working among them as to make them a wonder and cause
   outsiders to raise enquiries about them. "According to this time it
   shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God worked?" Is not that
   a singular thing? Here is Balaam with his seven altars, seven bullocks
   and seven rams. And here is Balak. And they are all going to compass
   some dreadful evil against Israel! The prophet is a man of great skill
   in the occult arts--but what does God say? In effect, He says--"From
   this hour in which you try to curse them, I will bless them more than
   ever until I will make them say, and their enemies say, "What has God
   worked?"

   Brethren, there is another question, "What has Israel worked?" I am
   glad that Israel's work is not my subject just now, because I should
   make a very wretched sermon out of it! We have better music in the
   words, "What has God worked?" Let me tell not what I have done, but
   what God has done! Not what human nature is, but what God's Nature is
   and what the Grace of God will work in the midst of His people. If God
   is within us, we shall be signs and wonders until those around us shall
   say, "What is this that God is doing?" Yes, in you, poor Jacob,
   wrestling, halting on your thigh, men shall see marvels and cry, "What
   has God worked?" Much more shall it be so with you, my brother, Israel,
   you who have prevailed and won the blessing--you are as a prince with
   God and you shall make men enquire, "What has God worked?"

   When God is with His people, He will give them power of a destructive
   kind. Do not be frightened! Here is the text for it--"Behold, the
   people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young
   lion"--that is, as a lion in the fullness of his vigor--"He shall not
   lie down until he eats of the prey and drinks the blood of the slain."
   God has put into His Church, when He is in it, a most wonderful,
   destructive power against spiritual wickedness! A healthy Church kills
   error, and tears evil in pieces! Not so very long ago our nation
   tolerated slavery in our colonies. Philanthropists endeavored to
   destroy slavery, but when was it utterly abolished? It was when
   Wilberforce roused the Church of God, and when the Church of God
   addressed herself to the conflict--then she tore the evil thing to
   pieces!

   I have been amused with what Wilberforce said the day after they passed
   the Act of Emancipation. He merrily said to a friend when it was all
   done, "Is there not something else we can abolish?" That was said
   playfully, but it shows the spirit of the Church of God! She lives in
   conflict and victory--her mission is to destroy everything that is bad
   in the land! See the fierce devil of intemperance, how it devours men!
   Earnest friends have been laboring against it and they have done
   something for which we are grateful. But if ever intemperance is put
   down, it will be when the entire Church of God shall arouse herself to
   protest against it! When the strong lion rises up, the giant of
   drunkenness shall fall before him. "He shall not lie down until he eats
   of the prey and drinks the blood of the slain."

   I predict for the world the best results from a fully awakened Church!
   If God is in her, there is no evil which she cannot overcome! This
   crowded London of ours sometimes appalls me--the iniquity which reigns
   and rages in the lower districts, the general indifference and the
   growing atheism of the people--these are something terrible, but let
   not the people of God be dismayed. If the Lord is in the midst of us,
   we shall do with this as our forefathers have done with other evils--we
   shall rise up in strength and not lie down till the evil is destroyed!
   For the destructions, mark you, of God's people, are not the
   destructions of men and women--they consist in the overthrow of
   sin--the tearing in pieces of systems of iniquity. This it is which God
   shall help His Church to do, He being in the midst of her.

   Once more--the results of God's Presence are to be seen, not only in
   the context, but in other matters which we have personally experienced
   and hope to experience more fully. Note them. When God is in a Church,
   there is a holy awe upon the hearts of His people. There is also a
   childlike trustfulness, hopefulness and consequent courage and joy.
   When the Lord is in the midst of His people, the ordinances of His
   house are exceedingly sweet. Baptism and the Lord's Supper become
   divinely painted pictures of our burial in Christ and of our life
   through Him. The preaching of the Word drops as dew and distils as the
   rain. The meetings for prayer are fresh and fervent--we desire to stay
   in them hour after hour--we feel it such a happy thing to be there! The
   very house in which we meet grows beautiful to us. We love the place
   where our Lord is accustomed to meet with us.

   Then work for Christ is easy, no, delightful! God's people never need
   urging, they are eager for the fray when the Lord is with them. Then,
   too, suffering for Christ becomes pleasant, yes, any kind of suffering
   is easily borne--

   "I can do all things, or can bear All sufferings, if my Lord is there!
   Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains,

   While His left hand my head sustains."

   Then prayer grows abundant all over the Church, both in private and in
   public. Then life is made vigorous, the feeblest becomes as David, and
   David like the Angel of the Lord. Then love is fervent; unity is
   unbroken; the Truth of God is esteemed and the living of truth in the
   life is sought after by all the people of God! Then effort is
   successful; the Church enlarges the bounds of her tent, for she breaks
   forth on the right hand and on the left. Then her seed inherits the
   Gentiles and the desolate places are inhabited. Then God gives unto her
   the holy energy with which she vanquishes nations. When God is with her
   she becomes like a sheaf of fire in the midst of the stubble and
   consumes her adversaries round about. "Fair as the moon, clear as the
   sun and terrible as an army with banners," is a Church which has God in
   her midst!

   But now notice one thing in my text, and with that I close this
   description. Where God is, we are told, "The shout of a king is among
   them." What is the shout of a king? When great commanders are known to
   have come into a camp, what a thrill of joy it causes among their
   trusty warriors! When the soldiers have been much dejected, it has been
   whispered in their tents--

   "The king has come to marshal us, All in his armor dressed,"

   and from that moment every man is cheered up. At the sight of the king,
   as he comes riding into the camp, the host raises a great shout. What
   does it mean? It is a shout of loyal love--they are glad to welcome
   their leader. So is it with us when we sing--"The King Himself comes
   near"--we are all as glad as glad can be! Those who cannot come out to
   see their prince, because they are lying on their sick beds in
   hospitals, clap their hands, while even the little children in their
   mothers' arms join in the general joy. "The king is come," they say,
   and his presence kindles their enthusiasm till they make the hills ring
   again!

   You know how the stern Ironsides felt when Cromwell came along. Every
   man was a hero when he led the way. They were ready for any adventure,
   no matter how difficult, as long as their great chief was there. That
   enthusiasm which was inspired by Alexander, by Napoleon and by other
   great commanders, is the earthly image of the spiritual fervor felt by
   the Church when the Lord Jesus is in her midst! What next? When the
   king comes and they have received him with enthusiasm, he cries, "Now
   is the hour of battle" and at once a shout goes up from his warriors
   who are eager for the fight. When a clan of Highlanders was led to the
   battle by their chief, he had only to show them the enemy and with one
   tremendous shout they leaped upon them like lions!

   It is so with the people of God. When God is with us, we are strong,
   resolute, determined. The charge of the servants of God is as the rush
   of a hurricane against a bowing wall and a tottering fence. In God is
   our confidence of victory. With

   God present, no man's heart fails him; no doubt enters the host. "Be
   strong, and quit yourselves like men," is the word that is passed
   round, for our King's eyes make us brave and the Presence of His
   Majesty secures our triumph. My Brothers and Sisters, let us cry to
   God, entreating Him to be among us! This it is that you need in your
   Sunday schools, in your mission halls, in your street preaching, in
   your tract distributing--it is this that I need beyond everything when
   I have to speak to you in this vast house.

   If I could hear the sound of my Master's feet behind me, I would speak
   though I were lying upon the borders of the grave! But if God is gone,
   I am bereft of power. What is the use of words without the Spirit? We
   might as well mutter to the whistling winds as preach to men without
   the Lord! O God, if You are with us, then the shout of a King is among
   us, but without You, we pine away!

   III. Thirdly, let us look at a very important point and a very
   practical one, too--What can be done for THE SECURING AND PRESERVING OF
   THE PRESENCE OF GOD WITHIN THE CHURCH? This is a matter that would

   require several sermons to discuss fully, but I notice that there is
   something, even, in the conformation of a Church to secure this. God is
   very tolerant and He bears with many mistakes in His servants and yet
   blesses them. But depend upon it, unless a Church is formed at the very
   outset upon Scriptural principles and in God's own way, sooner or later
   all the mistakes of her constitution will turn out to be sources of
   weakness! Christ loves to dwell in a house which is built according to
   His own plans and not according to the whims and fancies of men.

   The Church ought not to set up as her authority the decrees of men,
   either living or dead--her Ruler is Christ! Associations formed
   otherwise than according to Scripture must fail in the long run. I wish
   Christians would believe this. Chillingworth said, "The Bible and only
   the Bible, is the religion of Protestants." That was not true. Certain
   Protestants have tacked many other things to the Bible--and they are
   suffering as the result of their folly--for they cannot keep their
   Church from becoming Popish. Of course they cannot! They have admitted
   a little leaven of Popery and it will leaven the whole lump. The dry
   rot in one part of the house will spread throughout the whole fabric,
   sooner or later. Let us be careful to build on the foundation of
   Christ--and then let every man take heed how he builds thereon, for
   even if the foundation is good, yet if he builds with hay and stubble,
   the fire will cause him grievous loss.

   But next, God will only dwell with a Church which is full of life. The
   living God will not inhabit a dead church! Hence the necessity of
   having really regenerated people as members of the Church. We cannot
   secure this in every case with all our watching--tares will grow among
   the wheat. But if the admission of unregenerate men is usual and there
   are no restrictions, then the Lord will be grieved and leave us. God
   dwells not in temples made with hands--He has nothing to do with bricks
   and mortar--He dwells in living souls! Remember that text--"God is not
   the God of the dead, but of the living," and it bears this sense among
   others, that He is not the God of a church made up of unconverted
   people. Oh, that we may all live unto God, and may that life be past
   all question.

   That being supposed, we next notice that to have God among us we must
   be full of faith. Unbelief gives forth such a noxious vapor that Jesus,
   Himself, could not stay where it was. His strength was paralyzed--"He
   could not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief." Faith
   creates an atmosphere in which the Spirit of God can work! Meanwhile,
   the Spirit of God, Himself, creates that faith, so that it is all of
   His own working from first to last! Brothers and Sisters, do you
   believe your God? Do you believe up to the hilt? Alas, too many only
   believe a little! But do you believe His every Word? Do you believe His
   grandest promises? Is He a real God to you, making His Words into
   facts, every day of your lives? If so, then the Lord is among us as in
   the Holy Place!

   Faith builds a pavilion in which her King delights to sit enthroned.
   With that, must come prayer. Prayer is the breath of faith. I do not
   believe God will ever be long with a Church that does not pray--and I
   feel certain that when meetings for prayer, when family prayer, when
   private prayer, when any form of prayer comes to be at a discount--the
   Lord will leave the people to learn their weakness! Lack of prayer cuts
   the sinews of the Church for practical working. She is lame, feeble,
   impotent, if prayer is gone. If anything is the matter with the lungs,
   we fear consumption--Prayer Meetings are the lungs of the Church and
   anything the matter there means consumption to the Church, or at best a
   gradual decline, attended with general debility.

   Oh, my Brothers, if we want to have God with us, pass the watchword
   round, "Let us pray!" Let us pray after the fashion of the widow who
   was importunate and would not be repulsed! Remember, it is written,
   "Men ought always to pray and not to faint." Where prayer is fervent,
   God is present. Supposing there is this faith and prayer, we shall also

   need holiness of life. You know what Balaam did when he found he could
   not curse the people? Satanic was his advice. He bade the king of Moab
   seduce the men of Israel by the women of Moab that were fair to look
   upon--these were to fascinate them by their beauty and then to invite
   them to their idolatrous rites--which rites were orgies of lust. He
   hoped that the lewdness of the people would grieve the Lord and cause
   Him to leave them and then Moab could smite them.

   He sadly succeeded. If it had not been for Phinehas, who, in holy
   wrath, drove his javelin right through a man and woman in the very act
   of sin, sparing none in the vehemence of his zeal, Israel had been
   quite undone. So in a Church. The devil will work hard to lead one into
   licentiousness, another into drunkenness, a third into dishonesty and
   others into worldliness. If he can only get the goodly Babylonian
   garment and the wedge of gold buried in an Achan's tent, then Israel
   will be chased before her adversaries! God cannot dwell in an unclean
   Church!

   A holy God abhors the very garments spotted by the flesh. Be you holy
   as Christ is holy! Do not take up with this German silver electrotype
   holiness, which is so much boasted of nowadays. Do not be deluded into
   self-righteousness, but seek after real holiness--and if you find it,
   you will never boast about it--your life will speak, but your lips will
   never dare to say, "See how holy I am." Real holiness dwells with
   humility and makes men aspire after that which yet lies beyond them. Be
   holy, upright, just, straight, true, pure, chaste, devout. God send us
   this behavior and then we shall keep Him among us as long as we live!

   Lastly, when we have reached that, let us have practical consecration.
   God will not dwell in a house which does not belong to Him. No, the
   first thing with any one of us is to answer this question--Do you give
   yourself up to Christ-- body, soul and spirit--to live for Him and to
   die for Him? Will you give Him all that you have of talent and ability,
   and substance, time and life, itself? Where there is a Church made up
   of consecrated people, there God will remain and there He will make a
   Heaven below! And there the shout of a King shall be heard! And there
   His strength shall be revealed! And there His glory shall be seen, even
   as it is beheld on high! The Lord send us this, for Jesus' sake. Amen
   and Amen!

Incense and Light

   (No. 1710)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 11, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he
   dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. And when Aaron lights
   the lamps at twilight, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual
   incense before the Lord throughout your generations." Exodus 30:7,8.

   CERTAIN ceremonies under the Law were only of annual celebration, while
   other matters were of daily observation. And by the daily repetition
   they were intended to be set forth as eminently constant and perpetual.
   These daily ordinances were to be regarded by the children of Israel as
   of standing obligation, abiding types of constant necessity, never to
   be removed so long as the dispensation should last. When the priest
   went into the tabernacle, he could not enter it without being warned of
   sin and of sacrifice, for at the entrance of the holy place stood an
   altar of brass upon which there was offered, every morning, a lamb and
   every evening a lamb.

   This taught that access to God was not possible except by
   expiation--expiation by bloody sacrifice, expiation by the death of a
   substituted victim--expiation which must continue as long as sin
   remained. You could not even enter into the first court without the
   sight of an altar, blood and fire--thus showing us that there is no
   coming to God, even on the ordinary level of Christian experience,
   apart from the Atonement made by our Lord Jesus, who is "the Lamb slain
   from the foundation of the world." You cannot be heard in penitent
   prayer, or receive pardon, or commence the life of faith, or be even a
   babe in Grace unless you know the great Truth of God, that the Lord
   "has made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made
   the righteousness of God in Him." Without the shedding of blood,
   remission of sin and access to God are out of the question! Paul
   ascribes our drawing near unto the Lord to our Savior's perfect
   Sacrifice, for he says, "You who sometimes were far off are made near
   by the blood of Christ."

   Before the innermost sanctuary there hung a substantial veil and the
   entrance into the Holy of Holies was only permitted once in the year.
   If that veil had been lifted up so that we could enter, we would have
   found, at the door, a golden altar, to represent, again, our Lord Jesus
   Christ under another aspect--for on that golden altar there was offered
   a sweet perfume of precious spices, denoting His perpetual intercession
   on the behalf of His people and His enduring merits which are
   continually being presented by Himself before the Throne of the Most
   High. To go within the veil you must pass by the Altar of Incense.
   Learn, therefore, that to the door of the inner chamber of communion
   with God we must approach by the perfect merit of our redeeming Lord!
   We come not in our own merit, but we are "accepted in the Beloved."

   If we have ever been favored with high and holy communion with God,
   such as He reserves for favored saints. If we have been enabled to come
   boldly to the Throne of heavenly Grace and have looked into the
   tempered brightness of that Light of God which shines above the Mercy
   Seat, we have come only by virtue of the infinite merit of our Lord
   Jesus. The lowest form of communion in the outer court must be by the
   sacrifice of Jesus. And the highest form of communion, even that which
   is most intense and most delightful, is still by Christ. The incense
   sets forth His merit and that is not without blood, for once in the
   year the horns of the altar were smeared with the blood which had been
   carried within the veil. There was no coming within the veil without
   passing by the incense altar, even as there is no access to God but by
   the all-powerful mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ! Let us never
   forget this. Simple as the Truth of God is, we are apt to pass it by as
   of no force.

   I am afraid we are apt to put the most important Truths into the
   background because they seem to be so elementary. But we ought to
   remember that they are elementary only because they are essential from
   first to last. Never try to draw near to God in prayer, or praise, or
   meditation, or Scripture reading, or holy service apart from Jesus
   Christ, or your

   attempt will be a failure. Through the wall of fire which surrounds the
   Throne of God, you can only pass by way of the one Door, namely, the
   body and blood of our great Mediator, Sacrifice and Substitute! Is not
   that Door sufficient? Why should we climb up some other way? If I am
   very heavy of heart, do not let me try to raise my spirits and so come
   in the power of human courage--let me but come just as I am, made bold
   through Him whose comforts delight my soul! If I feel that I have been
   sinning, do not let me try to get rid of my sin by some other process
   and then draw near to God. Let me come, sinner as I am, in the name of
   the sinner's Savior, and so draw near to God, having washed my robes
   and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

   Jesus says, "I am the way"--why should we seek another? Have nothing to
   do with an absolute God--only deal with Him through a Mediator--and
   keep to that way, for no man comes unto the Father but by the Lord
   Jesus! Oh, you most experienced and privileged ones, take good note of
   the golden altar! And whenever you approach the Mercy Seat, let the
   cloud of its incense cover you and perfume your prayers! Hard by the
   golden altar, which was nearest to the Holy of Holies, stood the golden
   candlestick with its seven branches--these two instructive types were
   set near each other for a purpose which I would open up today. This
   candlestick was a matter of daily ordinance as much as the bronze Altar
   of Sacrifice, or the golden Altar of Incense--it was for continual use
   and was, therefore, dressed twice each day. We have a continual need of
   the precious Atonement of Christ, of the intercession of Christ and of
   the light of God's Holy Spirit. These are not things for once in a
   year--these are matters for every day and all day--and, therefore, they
   were attended to both at morning and at evening as if to shut in all
   the hours of the day within two golden doors.

   Every morning had its lamb, its burning incense and its lighted lamp.
   And the same pertained to every evening all the year round. Thus all
   days were fringed and bordered with this three-fold type--even as, at
   this time, all our days are sanctified by faith in the effectual
   expiation, joy in the prevailing intercession and delight in the clear
   shining of the Spirit which makes glad all who are in the house! This
   morning I desire to call your attention to the conjunction which was
   established by the Divine Law between the burning of the incense and
   the lighting of the lamps--these two things, being both of daily
   observance--were attended to at the same moment for reasons worthy of
   our study.

   I. And first I call your attention to THE WONDERFUL COOPERATION BETWEEN
   THE INTERCESSION OF CHRIST FOR US AND THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN
   US. See how, on the grandest scale, the incense of intercession and the
   lamp of spiritual illumination are set side by side. He whose merit
   brings us life is in Divine alliance with Him who brings us light!
   Indeed, there is such unity between them that Jesus, Himself, is said
   to be a Light to lighten the Gentiles and the Glory of His people
   Israel. The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ brings with it the communion
   of the Holy Spirit, for the Father has joined them together!

   Note that we have these both revealed in their fullness at the same
   time. When our Lord ascended on high to plead before the Throne of God,
   the Spirit descended to abide in the Church! After the Lord was taken
   up, the disciples received the promise of the Father and were
   illuminated by the Holy Spirit! Jesus, our great High Priest, presented
   the sweet savor of His own Person and work before the eternal Throne of
   God and then came the Spirit of God as tongues of fire lighting up the
   sons of men and making them to be as candles of the Lord! Well said the
   Apostle at Pentecost--"This Jesus has God raised up, whereof we all are
   witnesses. Therefore being exalted by the right hand of God and having
   received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has shed
   forth this, which you now see and hear." I say the two come
   historically together and we must forever connect in our meditations
   the ascended Savior's intercession and the illumination of the saints
   by the descended Spirit.

   Now, as they were connected historically, so are they continually
   connected as a matter of fact. At this day it is as it was at
   Pentecost--our Lord has not ceased to intercede and the Spirit has not
   ceased to illuminate! Herein lies our hope for our own eternal
   salvation, in the ceaseless plea and the quenchless light! For the
   working out of that which God is working in us, both to will and to do
   of His own good pleasure, we have these two guarantees and helps--the
   Savior praying and the Spirit shining! Jesus is pleading and,
   therefore, our faith fails not when Satan sifts us as wheat. The Spirit
   is working and, therefore, the light of our faith is sustained by a
   secret mystic oil which prevents the enemy from putting it out. This is
   also our two-fold confidence when we go forth into the world to preach
   the Gospel! Unto the Lord Jesus, all power is given in Heaven and in
   earth, and He is "able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God
   by Him, seeing He ever lives to make intercession for them."

   The Church of God must succeed in her mission because her errand is the
   object of the continual prayers of her living Lord. But she has her
   second help, namely the Comforter, who abides with us and goes forth
   with the Word that we preach, making it potent for the conversion of
   the sons of men. We have the incense of Christ's merit pleading with
   God and the light of God's Spirit pleading with men--we have Christ as
   an Advocate with God and the Holy Spirit as an Advocate with men! What
   more is needed? What joy and confidence we ought to feel in the work of
   the Lord since Jesus is pleading and the Spirit is striving at the same
   time--the incense rising, filling earth and Heaven with its
   sweetness--and the Spirit brightly shining to the comfort and delight
   of those who go forth into the darkness with the name of Jesus on their
   lips! Joy to those who sit in darkness and in the valley of the shadow
   of death, for even for them is this seven-fold Light shining! And to
   their dank, pestilential abodes there comes the healing breath of sweet
   perfume from the Redeemer's merits.

   Furthermore, this conjunction, as it is a matter of history, and as it
   is continuous, will always be seen by us, personally, when our prayer
   is the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man that avails much. It
   needs the Trinity to make a Christian; it needs the Trinity to make a
   Christian prayer! The Father must hear us, else of what use are our
   cries? But the ordained Mediator must also stand between us and the
   Father, presenting His merit like the smoke of sweet incense, or else
   our prayer can never be accepted of God. And to come down closer to
   ourselves, the Spirit of God must also help our infirmities, for we
   know not what we should pray for as we ought, so that, whenever we
   pray, we must have these two in happy conjunction--intercession and
   enlightenment--incense and light!

   My prayer as my own prayer is a poor, vain, defiled thing unless Jesus
   perfumes it! And it is a poor, dark, blind thing unless the Spirit of
   God has enlightened it! The Holy Spirit teaches us what to pray for and
   how to order our words aright. In His light we see light. We are in the
   dark till He shines like the golden candlestick and enables us to see
   our own need and the fullness of God's Grace. It is His light that
   makes our heart to see the Lord in prayer, so that we seek the Lord by
   the light of His own Spirit. When prayer is the work of the Spirit in
   the heart, we are absolutely certain that it must succeed because the
   Spirit makes intercession in the saints according to the will of God.
   The Holy Spirit is one with the Father and He is most truly God, so
   that whatever He prompts us to pray for is the same thing which the
   Father has already decreed and eternally determined to bestow!

   Our wishes and desires might never succeed with God if they were that
   and no more, for our thoughts are not His thoughts, neither are our
   ways His ways. But the thoughts and purposes of God, when these are
   photographed upon our spirit by the Holy Spirit, are the pictures of
   that which is assuredly to be, the prophecy of the determinate purpose
   and foreknowledge of God! What is written in yon sealed Book, upon
   which no human eye can gaze, is transcribed and written by the Spirit
   of God upon our hearts--and thus we pray for that very thing which God
   designs to give. There is an assured certainty of success to the prayer
   that is made in the power of the Spirit of God! While praying in the
   Holy Spirit we have the petition which we have asked of the Lord.

   But then there is our second comfort, that Jesus stands ready to take
   every prayer of ours, however imperfect in knowledge, however feeble in
   expression, however marred with sorrow--and He presents the purified
   and perfected prayer with His own merit--and it is sure to speed. The
   sins of our holy things are seldom absent and, therefore, the constant
   need is that we have an Advocate. Blessed be God for that inspired
   Word, "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ the righteous." True prayer is the offering to God of the merit
   of the Lord Jesus and, therefore, it must be accepted. What can be
   refused to merit such as His? True prayer is presented always by the
   Lord Jesus and, therefore, again, its certainty of efficacy--how can
   the Father deny anything to the Well-Beloved? It is written in the book
   of the Revelation--"And another angel came and stood at the altar,
   having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that
   he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar
   which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came
   with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the
   angel's hand."

   Can we doubt the success of prayers presented by the Angel of the
   Covenant? Assuredly not! There is such excess of perfection in Christ
   that it covers all our imperfection. There is such delicious sweetness
   in Christ to the Father that it effectually destroys the ill savor of
   anything that comes from us! And by its power, we, ourselves, become
   unto God a sweet savor--and so, also, are our prayers when they are
   presented by Jesus Christ! I like to think of the incense and of the
   lamp and, best of all, of the two together, for these two enable me to
   come boldly to the Throne of the heavenly Grace

   to obtain mercy and find Grace! Acceptance through sweet savor and
   light through Divine teaching are both mine as my soul waits upon God,
   with her expectation turned towards Him. Nor ought I to pass away from
   this first head without noting that in God's drawing near to man there
   is the same conjunction of incense and light.

   If the Glory of God were to come forth from between the cherubim. If it
   should come past the veil to be revealed throughout the world, that
   Glory would pass by these two, the golden Altar of Incense and the
   golden lamp of light! I mean this--God can have no dealing with men at
   all except through the merit of Christ and the light of the Spirit. As
   for the work of our Lord Jesus, you and I believe in the special
   Substitution of Christ for His elect--what we call, "Particular
   Redemption," is held most firmly by us, for we believe that He redeemed
   us from among men and that He laid down His life for the sheep. Yet
   there are many passages of Scripture which speak of the work of Christ
   as having a universal scope. He is, "the propitiation for our sins, and
   not for ours, only, but for the sins of the whole world." We are told
   that, by the Grace of God, "He tasted death for every man."

   Now, the Atonement of Christ is many-sided and may be viewed in very
   different lights. And while I trust we shall never be shaky about the
   question of His literal and effectual Substitution for His own chosen,
   whereby He offered for them a most sure, effectual and perfect
   satisfaction, so that no sin may ever be laid to their charge, yet
   there is, on the other hand, a general and universal view of His
   atoning work. God could not have dealt with the world at all in the way
   of mercy apart from the Sacrifice of Christ. The only thing which could
   have been done with the race of man was to have crushed it out forever
   if Christ had not stood for them as an Interposer. God was, in Christ,
   reconciling the world unto Himself. For the sake of the Man, Christ
   Jesus, God was able to look upon the fallen race in justice and yet
   prepare mercy for the guilty. Men owe their lives to the Sacrifice of
   Christ! Men owe the various alleviations of their sorrows by God's
   gracious tenderness in Providence to the Sacrifice of Christ!

   Above all, that free and honest proclamation of salvation to every man
   that will believe in Christ Jesus is rendered possible by the wondrous,
   perfect, unlimited, illimitable merit which resided in the Person and
   work of such an One as Jesus our Lord! The picture before you is a very
   beautiful one. Here are spices of the most precious kind, made up into
   a compound such as never was compounded for any other purpose. This
   Divinely-appointed mixture of sweet odors is placed in the censer upon
   the golden altar--that is to say, eternal acceptance is found in the
   Person of Christ. The incense is kindled with fire from on high. What
   follows? The spices begin to burn and up ascends a pillar of smoke. See
   how it rises high into the clear air! And as it rises it expands like a
   cloud, covers the sky, is wafted all around and perfumes the whole air
   with its own exceeding fragrance.

   It rises and rises till it enters Heaven--yes, and the Heaven of
   heavens! Its sacred odor is recognized in every golden street! It fills
   every chamber of the glorious "house of God not made with hands!" It
   ascends to the Throne of His excellent Majesty and the Lord is well
   pleased with it--and again is fulfilled the words which are written
   concerning the burnt-offering of Noah--"The Lord smelled a sweet savor;
   and the Lord said in His heart, I will not again smite everything
   living as I have done." Such is the merit of Christ, that through its
   sweet savor God looks down upon the world and treats it with
   long-suffering, tenderness and mercy. Is it not a blessed picture? As a
   just and holy God, He could not deal with a guilty race except through
   a mediatorial Sacrifice which should wrap mankind in its cloud of merit
   and reconcile the world unto Himself!

   And now, you and I may follow in the tracks of God and go out and
   preach the Gospel to every creature without the slightest fear because
   the whole air is perfumed with the incense of a Savior's mediatorial
   work! Although not perceptible by carnal sense, yet the inward spirit
   in the soul of the Believer perceives the grateful odor of the finished
   work of the ever-living Savior sweetening all things, so that now we
   call nothing common or unclean, but are prepared to deliver our message
   to the vilest of the vile! God, in Christ, is kind, even, to the
   unthankful and the evil, and wills that supplications, prayers,
   intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men--and to every
   creature the Gospel should be preached. We shall not, however, proceed
   to any practical purpose unless we remember, next, that when God comes
   to deal with men, it is with the light of the Spirit as well as with
   the merit of Christ.

   The golden candlestick is as necessary as the golden censer--for God's
   work among men is always by His Spirit. He is seeking out His people as
   the woman sought for her lost piece of money and it is significant that
   it is written, "She did light a candle and sweep the house." God, in
   His work of salvation, comes to men with the candle of His Word lighted
   through the Holy Spirit--and through the teaching of His Word from day
   to day, that Spirit shines as from a lantern

   among the sons of men! If you and I would follow in the tracks of God,
   as His dear children, imitating Him, we must take with us the light of
   the Gospel or the Glory of God and, by the power and light of His
   Spirit we must make known to men the unsearchable riches of Christ. To
   us Jehovah is our light and our salvation--and when we go in His name
   we must not go without the Light of God. Thus you see we come to God by
   the incense and the light--and even so does God come down to man to
   bless Him.

   II. Secondly, our text seems to me to teach THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
   PRAYER AND KNOWLEDGE. The

   golden altar represents intercession offered by Christ and, also, the
   prayers of all the saints which are accepted through His intercession.
   And, as the candlestick stood side by side with it, and represented the
   light of the Spirit of Truth, so must true prayer and true knowledge
   never be separated. So I gather, first, that prayer should be attended
   with knowledge. It is evil when men worship, they know not what. God is
   Light and He will not have His people worship Him in the dark. When
   they burn the incense, they must also light the lamp.

   In the Romish Church the mass of the people repeat prayers in an
   unknown tongue, having no idea of what their meaning may be--this is
   both a grievous wrong to the people and a mockery of God! What can be
   the good of such prayers in the sight of Him who seeks those to worship
   Him who worship Him in spirit and in truth? Mere sounds without meaning
   are not prayer! Understanding, desire and heart must go with every
   word, or else the prayers are vain repetitions such as the heathen
   employ. Supplicants must know what they are asking, or they are not
   really asking. And you, dear people of God, please notice that the more
   Divine knowledge you get, all things being equal, the more complete
   will your prayers become.

   "Grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
   Christ"--light the lamp at the same time that you kindle the incense.
   For instance, when you pray, what prayer can there be without knowing
   God, our Father? How can you pray aright to an unknown god? The more
   knowledge of God, the more correct does prayer become! He that comes to
   God must believe that He is and that He is the Rewarder of them that
   diligently seek Him. What prayer can there be apart from the knowledge
   of the Lord Jesus Christ? If we know nothing of Him by whom we pray,
   how full of sins of ignorance will our prayers be! It is well, also, to
   have a deep, sensible knowledge of sin. Penitential prayers are
   impossible without this--and how can prayers be accepted if penitence
   is not mixed with our petitions?

   We need, at the same time, that we have the knowledge of sin to have a
   knowledge of our own weaknesses. The man who is consciously weak, prays
   for strength, but he who dreams that he is strong, will not do so. You
   need to study yourselves before you pray, so as to ask for those things
   in which you are most deficient and for protection against those
   constitutional tendencies or besetting sins to which you are most
   subject. The prayer of ignorance is like an arrow shot by a blind man,
   which is not likely to hit the mark. In proportion as petitions arise
   from a heart fully instructed in its own necessities will they be
   likely to ask for the right blessings--and to be prepared aright before
   the Lord. David wished his prayers to be accepted and, therefore, he
   cried, "Let my prayer be set forth before You as incense."

   A supremely excellent piece of knowledge is to know the promises which
   we are to plead. Here you have the very sinews of prayer. When a man
   knows the promise suitable to his case and lays it before God, saying,
   "Do as You have said," he presents the best form of supplication.
   Remember how Jacob pleaded with the Lord the sacred word of promise,
   saying, "You said, I will surely do you good"? When we have looked at
   all the bearings of the petition so as to make quite certain that it is
   a petition, the fulfillment of which will glorify God--when we see that
   it must be consistent with the Divine will because of the various
   statements which God has made in His Word and because of promises which
   He has given concerning the matter--then, with the lamp shining clearly
   upon us, we shall kindle the incense the more discreetly and boldly,
   and both our prayers and our meditations will be the more accepted of
   the Lord!

   Do try, especially, dear Brothers and Sisters, you that pray in public,
   to light the lamps when you kindle the incense! It will be for the good
   of us all if petitions are thoughtful, suitable, Scriptural and withal
   fresh and hearty. Let us never degenerate into repeating the same
   expressions till they grow to be cant. Let us never drop into the use
   of hackneyed prayers for everything in general and for nothing in
   particular! But as instructed men, having thought of what we are going
   to say; having adapted our prayer to our circumstances and needs, let
   us order our case before the Lord and fill our mouth with arguments!
   Burn the incense of prayer in the light of the Spirit of Revelation,
   praying in the Holy Spirit!

   But now turn the thought round the other way--knowledge should always
   be accompanied by prayer. Whenever we are taught of God, His teaching
   almost always comes in connection with prayer--but lest we should
   solely try to learn

   and forget to pray--let me remind you of a few particulars. Dear
   Brothers and Sisters, as a Christian you are a disciple, or student--be
   also a suppliant. When you are impressed with the greatness, or the
   goodness, or the immutability, or the faithfulness of God, straightway
   turn your impressions into supplications! Pray the great God to be
   gracious to you. Ask the unchangeable God to be the same to you--be the
   faithful God to keep His promises to you! Implore the mighty God to
   uphold you. As you learn more and more of God, place the light near the
   incense by using your knowledge in your pleadings. To employ all your
   knowledge as fuel for prayer will be the best way of utilizing your
   acquirements--it will stamp the Truth of God firmly on your memory and
   it will sanctify your heart.

   When you know more of the Savior, pray your way to Him by it, as ships
   move into port by their sails. If you have seen His Manhood, go and
   plead His sympathy with you in your weakness! If you have thought more
   of His Deity, go and worship Him more reverently and pray that His
   Glory may be seen among the sons of men. Whatever point in the
   unutterable Glory of His perfection breaks most upon your mind, pray
   most that way--opening your window towards the sunrise. So will the
   Lord teach you more and so shall you have profited by that which you
   have learned. If, from day to day, my Brothers and Sisters, you learn
   more of your sinfulness, then you have more errands with which to come
   to the Mercy Seat. And if you make a new discovery by experience of
   your corruption and indwelling sin, fly at once to the Throne of Grace
   with your discovery lest it weigh you down and drive you to
   despondency.

   Make a ladder of your needs with which to climb nearer to Heaven. The
   more your necessities, the more urgent let your importunity be! Cry
   mightily to God because of the greatness of your poverty. I do not
   think there is anything in the Scriptures which we cannot pray over. If
   we learn the devices of the devil, let us pray against them! If we
   learn the depravity of mankind, let us pray God's Holy Spirit to create
   men's hearts anew! Everything from the first of Genesis to the end of
   Revelation, when we truly know it, furnishes us with fresh arguments
   for drawing near to God. Revealed Truths of God are as a Church bell
   summoning us to come into the Presence of the Lord and bow the knee
   before Him.

   As you hear a sermon, turn it into prayer! Even if you find that there
   is nothing in the sermon, it may benefit you if you pray God to feed
   His poor famished people. If you will pray all through his discourse,
   every preacher will minister to your edification directly or
   indirectly. If you are set upon praying by the lighting of the tiniest
   candle that ever glimmered, there will at least be sweetness in the
   incense even if there is no brilliance in the lamp.

   III. I desire, in the third place, to show SOME SPECIAL PRACTICAL
   CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INCENSE

   AND THE LAMP. Let us read the text again--"And Aaron shall burn thereon
   sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn
   incense upon it." So, then, there should be prayer, especially at the
   dressing of the lamps, that is to say, when preparing our minds for
   that ministry by which we enlighten the people among whom we dwell we
   should be specially earnest in prayer. Preparation for preaching and
   teaching is most important! God's work is not to be done carelessly as
   boys shoot arrows at random in their play. We must prepare both by
   reading and pleading--we must, like the Apostles, give ourselves to the
   Word of God and prayer.

   We are told by ancient Rabbis that when the priest who was appointed
   for that office went into the Holy Place, he took with him the golden
   snuffers, the golden snuff dishes and a vessel full of pure olive oil
   and, by the help of these, he attended to the trimming of the golden
   lamp. There were seven lamps on the candelabra--some of these might
   have gone quite out during the night--he would have to take away
   whatever of snuff remained, wipe out the lamp, place a new wick, fill
   it up with fresh oil, and then kindle the flame anew. In another lamp
   it may be the light was still burning but feebly--he might have simply
   to snuff it, take away the "the superfluity of naughtiness" in the
   golden snuff dish and make all things clean and right. Sometimes the
   light might be burning well and nothing was needed but to replenish it
   with oil. Thus all was set in order for another day. The same was done
   in the evening.

   In the process of trimming lamps there is a measure of offense--snuffs
   do not give forth a very dainty perfume--and the smear and smelt of oil
   are not altogether of sweet savor. Therefore, before he trimmed the
   lamps, the priest kindled the incense. No snuff would then be
   offensive, for the overpowering fragrance of the incense killed it all
   and prevented the prevalence of any odor unfit for the House of God.
   When we go into our studies to try and trim our lamps, let us remember
   that our first business is to pray. Alas, we have much of smoking wick
   about us! We have much negligence, much ignorance, many mistakes and
   errors and, thereby, we shall grieve the Lord if Jesus is not called in
   to cover all. When we are preparing, in secret, to serve the Lord in
   public, we shall make poor work of it if we do not, beforehand, draw
   near to God in prayer!

   We need that our garments should be made to smell of myrrh and aloes
   and cassia by being covered with the merit of Jesus, or else we shall
   offend, even while engaged in the holy act of preparing to spread
   abroad the light of Divine Truth! You have to trim your lamps, Brothers
   and Sisters, when you go into the Sunday school--at least, I hope you
   do. I hope you do not run into your class with anything which first
   comes to hand! If you do not snuff your candles and feed your lamps
   with fresh oil, your children will sit in darkness before a lamp which
   does not shine! No, there ought to be careful preparation, according as
   your time and ability will allow and, above all, the pouring in of the
   holy oil of the Holy Spirit by fresh fellowship with Jesus. In that
   process one of the chief elements is prayer.

   Dr. Adam Clarke used to say to young ministers, "Study yourselves dead
   and then pray yourselves alive, again," and that is an excellent rule.
   Work in your study as if it all depended upon you and then go forth and
   speak, trusting in God because all depends upon Him! Remember that the
   chief part of all study of God's Word must be prayer. This is the
   boring rod and the powder by which we burst open the great rocks of the
   Truths of God. "To have prayed well is to have studied well," said
   Martin Luther, and so, most certainly, it is. Therefore let none of us,
   when we dress the lamp, forget the incense.

   What a double privilege comes of this! This priest, you see, had thus
   two things to do for the Lord. If he was called only to light the lamp,
   that would have been one happy, blessed service--but if he must burn
   the incense, too, he has a double portion of honor in thus doubly
   serving the Lord, his God! So when you are preparing to light up the
   people, or preparing to enlighten your children in class, what a happy
   necessity it is which calls upon you, at the same time, to pray! It is
   one of the greatest privileges of preachers and teachers, that they are
   driven to pray more than other people, for they have greater
   necessities--they have necessities that come upon them because of their
   office and these drive them to more frequent supplication--and so their
   labors become a means of Grace to their own souls! Let us thank our
   Lord Jesus that He has made us kings and priests unto our God and that
   He permits us, both to let our lights shine before men and our prayers
   ascend before God.

   One thing more, this burning of the incense was not only at the
   dressing of the lamps, but also at the kindling of the lamps, when they
   began to shine. I want to plead, dear Friends, very heartily with you
   that when it is my privilege to come here this week and at all other
   times to light the lamps, you, who are my beloved helpers, will take
   care to burn the incense at the same time! We need the incense of
   prayer more than ever in these latter days. Did you ever notice in
   Ezekiel 41:22 that an altar of incense is spoken of, but its dimensions
   are twice as great as those of the golden altar in the Tabernacle? It
   was as if, say some, to teach us that in these Gospel times prayer
   would become more abundant and would be offered up more frequently than
   ever.

   The Gentiles have an altar which presents more incense to the Lord than
   that which was served by Aaron! And, inasmuch as it is more purely
   spiritual, it is all the more acceptable with God. The altar mentioned
   by Ezekiel was of wood, as if to show that our worship is to become
   more simple and to be more divested of everything that is pompous and
   showy--indeed, the altar disappears, and we read--"This is the table
   that is before the Lord." You will guess the meaning. Malachi has a
   glorious prophecy. "For from the rising of the sun even unto the going
   down of the same, My name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in
   every place incense shall be offered unto My name, and a pure offering:
   for My name shall be great among the heathen, says the Lord of Hosts."

   Are you not charmed by the Divine prophecy? Will you not, yourselves,
   help to fulfill it? We know that this Altar of Incense meant prayer
   because the Jews, themselves, so interpreted it. In the first chapter
   of Luke we read of Zacharias, that it was his turn, in the order of his
   course, to go into the Holy Place to offer incense, and it says, "And
   the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of
   incense." Just so, the offering of incense clearly means prayer and,
   therefore, I plead with you that while we are lighting the lamps by
   preaching the Gospel, you will burn the incense by being constantly in
   prayer! Brothers and Sisters, pray for us! Paul spoke thus. How much
   more may I plead that you dismiss me or intercede for me!

   Joshua could not prevail except as Moses held up his hands. Our
   lamp-lighting will not succeed unless you burn the incense. Peter's
   sermon at Pentecost did not derive its force from Peter's zeal, or from
   its own eloquence, but from another Source. Of course, all the power
   came from the Spirit of God, but why did the Spirit of God work so
   mightily on that day? Surely it was because the entire Church was
   earnestly praying while Peter was preaching. "They were all with

   one accord in one place"--nobody was away, they were all there and when
   the one man stood up to preach, he might well light 3,000 lamps, for
   all the fervent company of the faithful were causing the incense of
   prayer to ascend to Heaven!

   I need your prayers for tonight's sermon. You will not be here, for
   strangers are invited to occupy your seats and, therefore, I beg you,
   in your houses, to cry unto the Lord for me that the Word may have free
   course and that my hearers may feel its power! It might be the most
   profitable expenditure of time that ever happened to you if you would
   spend the whole evening in prayer. Beseech the Lord to bring the people
   to this house and to bring the right sort of people, rich and poor,
   Believers and infidels, moral people and the depraved! We do not know
   who will come. Some of them do not know whether they will come,
   themselves, or not! But the Lord may influence, in various ways, those
   individuals to come whom He designs to bless. Pray that the fish may
   come in shoals round the boat!

   When the congregation is gathered, pray that the speaker may be guided
   of the Holy Spirit to a right theme. The preacher has no manuscript, so
   that there is room for the Spirit's guidance, and he may be led to say
   what he never thought of saying--the right word may thus be spoken in
   the right way so as to reach the heart! Then pray that there may be
   given the willing ear, the receptive mind, the retentive memory--that
   impressions may be made, tonight, and at all other times, such as even
   Satan cannot remove. And, oh, pray that tonight many who have been
   halting between two opinions may decide for God! Pray that many who
   have not, before, found the Savior's face will be converted! Pray that
   many who have been, up to now, of a sorrowful spirit, will be led into
   the joy of the Lord!

   I shall feel it a joyous work to be the lamplighter, tonight, for my
   Master, if I know that I have you at home pleading earnestly on my
   behalf! Give me this aid this morning, too. Pray God to bless each word
   that has been spoken. Pray that some poor sinner's soul may be perfumed
   by the merits of Jesus and illuminated with the Divine Light! Pray for
   this and it shall be done, for the Lord hears His people! We need, more
   and more, to be a praying Church--and then we shall be a growing
   Church! Up to now we have had a great blessing, but the windows of
   Heaven are wide enough for a greater one to come down through them! The
   more we plead with God and the more we set forth the light of the
   Gospel, the more will God be with us and build up, in this place, a
   temple for His praise! May His love be with you. Amen.

A Sermon to the Lord's Little Children

   (No. 1711)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 18, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you
   for His name's sake." 1 John 2:12.

   "I write to you, little children, because you know the Father." 1 John
   2:13. (Revised Version).

   PROBABLY you ask, "Why does John say, first, 'I write,' and then, in
   verse 14, 'I have written'?" There is a beautiful touch of nature in
   this speedy change of tense. John was an extremely old man and,
   therefore, while he says, "I write," he adds, "I have written," as if
   he felt that it might be the last time that he should take his pen in
   hand. Very soon with him, the present tense would change into the
   past--and he indicates the fact by changing his mode of speech. Perhaps
   he even felt that, possibly, before the letter reached the Brethren to
   whom he addressed it, he would be no more among the sons of men.
   Therefore he says, "I write," indicating that while he was still with
   them, with warm and loving heart he solemnly exhorted them. And then he
   adds, "I have written," as if he had recorded his dying testimony and
   left it as his last legacy of love.

   To us, today, John's words run altogether in the past tense--"I have
   written." But we need not, therefore, forget that they were the
   well-considered words of a venerated father in Christ and that he wrote
   them as one so near to his departure that he regarded himself as
   already on the move and, therefore, scarcely knew which tense to use.
   Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, how soon our, "I speak," will change into,
   "I have spoken!" Let this invest every word with solemnity. Remember,
   also, what order of man John was--that disciple whom Jesus loved, whose
   head had leaned on Jesus' bosom, whose eyes had seen the King in His
   beauty and whose strengthened gaze had looked within the gates of
   pearl! This is he who, at one time, saw the pierced heart of the
   Well-Beloved pouring forth blood and water! And at another beheld the
   Lion of the tribe of Judah prevail to take the book and loose the seven
   seals thereof! It is the Apostle of Love who says to us, "I write to
   you," "I have written to you."

   Let us carefully note what the Spirit says to us by His servant, John.
   Observe that our text is addressed to the "little children." It is
   thought by many wise interpreters that under this term John includes
   the whole Church of God and that afterwards He divides that Church into
   two companies--the fathers and the young men. Those who, under one
   aspect, are all "little children," but are, under another, regarded as
   young men or fathers. There is very much to support this view. In
   several instances in this Epistle, John is evidently addressing all the
   saints when he speaks of them as, "my little children," as, for
   instance, in the 18th verse of the third chapter, and also in the
   closing verse, "Little children, keep yourselves from idols."

   Surely, all the saints are included in these exhortations. There is a
   sense in which every Christian is still a little child, a sense in
   which he ought to be so--always dependent upon the great Father, always
   ready to receive the Word of the Father without question, always
   teachable--always restful in the Father's care and full of love to Him
   who is his All in All. Of necessity we must always be children before
   God, for our finite capacity is so limited that we are mere babes in
   knowledge in the Presence of Infinite Wisdom and as very sucklings in
   understanding, when contrasted with the great Father of Spirits. We
   know enough to make us know that we know very little! The most advanced
   intellects in the Church are but as infants compared with the Ancient
   of Days. We are of yesterday and know nothing--with all our experience,
   with all our study, with all our meditation, with all our illumination
   we remain, "little children," when measured by the boundless knowledge
   of the Lord.

   Yes, I mean the fathers, the men who bring sinners to Jesus, the men
   who teach others and are, themselves, taught of God--even these must,
   each one, cry out with Jeremiah, "Ah, Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak:
   for I am a child." I

   mean the young men who have overcome the Wicked One, whose holy valor
   sets them in the forefront of the battle where they turn to fight the
   armies of the aliens. "They are strong," says John, and yet, in the
   Presence of the mighty God of Jacob, what are our champions and our
   valiant men? Are they not, still, but as, "little children"? It may do
   us all good to join the infant-class this morning, or, at least to sit
   with the boys in the school of grace. Even those who have made the
   greatest advances in Divine Grace may do well to " become as little
   children," that they may more fully enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
   and have closer fellowship with "the Holy Child Jesus." It may even be
   an advance for some who have grown self-willed as they have advanced in
   knowledge, if they will say with David, "Surely I have behaved and
   quieted myself. As a child that is weaned of his mother, my soul is
   even as a weaned child." Happy childhood when it means entire
   submission to the Father and sweet delight in His will!

   Still, I am inclined to think that in this case John really does divide
   the entire Church into three classes--the babes in Grace, or the
   children. Or, as one of the words might properly be translated, the
   boys--those who have not long been born into the family--these are an
   interesting company. Then follow the young men--these are the second
   class--and a valued body of Christians they are, in the fullness of
   their vigor. They are strong in faith, giving glory to God, mighty in
   prayer, vehement in action, bold in testimony! May the Lord muster
   among our hosts a grand army of these vigorous heroes who shall
   earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints! The
   fighting power of the Church militant must come out of them! These are
   they that turn the battle to the gate. Blessed is the man that has his
   quiver full of them!

   Then there is the third class--the fathers, the mature, the
   experienced. These do not quite so much delight in war as the young men
   do, but at home they diligently care for the household of faith,
   watching over the feeble, strengthening and comforting them. These are
   able, by their experience, to answer gainsayers and to guide the
   ignorant to edify the untaught. Their knowledge is deep and they are,
   therefore, able to become teachers of others. They are men of spiritual
   force and have come to the full stature of men in Christ Jesus.
   Therefore they are the solid strength of the Church! If the young men
   are the Church's arm, these are the Church's backbone. We need to have
   many such, though, alas, it is to be feared that our Churches are much
   like the Apostolic ones of which Paul said, "You have not many
   fathers."

   This morning I am going to say nothing at all to the young men, nor to
   the fathers, except so far as they are willing to include themselves
   under the term of, "little children." And, as we have already said,
   there is just reason why they should do so. Little children, it is to
   you I speak this day--I mean you that have newly been converted, whose
   first cries of repentance are still in our ears! You, I mean, whose
   Grace is feeble; who are new to everything in the House of God and, as
   yet, need to be fed with the milk of the simple elementary Truth of
   God. You are the little children, dear to the whole family. You, I
   mean, who are but little in Israel as yet--little in knowledge, little
   in faith, little in strength, little in service, little in patience!
   You cannot, as yet, keep the watch of the House of the Lord, for you,
   yourselves, need to be watched over. You tremble when you try to stand
   and your unaccustomed feet can scarcely bear you along the road without
   a helping hand. You are very apt to tumble down and probably will do so
   many times before you learn to walk with the fathers, or run with the
   young men.

   You little children may, by some, be thought to be a burden, but the
   wise among us count you a blessing--the more of you the merrier in the
   Church of God--for you are the blessed of the Lord and we are glad to
   hear your youthful voices in the streets of the New Jerusalem! To you I
   shall speak this morning, as the Holy Spirit shall enable me. I would
   say these things to you. First, observe your privilege--"I write unto
   you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you." Then, note
   your knowledge--"I have written unto you, little children, because you
   know, or have known, the Father." And thirdly, consider the precepts
   addressed to you. When we get to that point I shall ask you to refer to
   your Bibles that we may run through the whole of this Epistle and see
   what John has to say to little children. May we receive the Word of God
   with meekness, that we may grow thereby.

   I. First, I want the babes in Grace, the weak in faith, the lambs of
   the flock, to notice THEIR PRIVILEGE. "I write unto you, little
   children, because your sins are forgiven you for His name's sake." This
   is a privilege extremely desired by the little children. They have but
   lately felt the burden of guilt--they still smart under the lashes of
   conscience. The Spirit of God has but newly convinced them of sin, of
   righteousness and of judgment. And, therefore, above everything, their
   prayer is, "Father, forgive me." To them the remission of sins stands
   out as the first and most desirable of all bless-ings--and, truly, they
   are right in their estimate, for what possession is there which can be
   called a blessing at all until sin is forgiven?

   It matters not how healthy a man may be--if his conscience is worried
   with his sin--his inmost heart is sick. It is small comfort to him to
   have all the comforts of this life if his heart feels the gnawing of
   the undying worm of conscious guilt. "God be merciful to me, a sinner,"
   comes often from his breast as he beats upon it in the deep humiliation
   of his soul. There can be no joy and rest for him till he hears the
   words, "The Lord has put away your sin; you shall not die." To the
   freshly saved, it is a joy worth worlds to have their sins forgiven! It
   is a bliss akin to the Heaven of angels and this joy belongs by right
   to all the saints, yes, even to the little children in the family of
   God!

   You were only born again last Sunday, but your sins are forgiven you!
   Perhaps it is only this morning that you have sought your Savior's face
   and have come to believe in Him--and, by His Grace, your sins are
   forgiven you! This assurance is as sweet to you as a seraph's song! I
   could not have told you a better piece of news. The pardon of sin is as
   the pearl of great price to you in your present stage of spiritual
   life--you would have sold all that you had in order to procure it--and
   now that you have it, your heart is aglow with gratitude! The wound in
   your conscience, so lately raw and bleeding, makes you set a high price
   upon the healing balm of free and full forgiveness! Far be it from me
   to stay your holy joy, and yet the Lord will show you greater things
   than these!

   At your stage of experience, pardon is the most prominent blessing of
   the Covenant. A newly converted man does not know much about
   sanctification or union to Christ. Perhaps he does not know much about
   election, calling, or sealing. The principal point he dwells upon is
   pardon. It is written in the Creed--"I believe in the forgiveness of
   sins"--and the man who has newly found peace with God by Jesus Christ
   repeats that article of the Creed with solemn emphasis. "/ believe in
   the forgiveness of sins," he says, for he has just realized it, and to
   him it is a gift so great that, like the moon and the stars, it shines
   as a queen among the blessings of Grace! Pardon of sin seems to the
   "little children" to comprehend the whole work of Jesus and the whole
   work of the Holy Spirit, too!

   Vast favors lie beyond, but to him who has newly crossed the Jordan,
   this one valley of Eschol fills all the range of vision and the soul
   hardly dreams of any further benediction! The newly-pardoned does not
   yet see the innumerable other blessings which come in the train of
   forgiveness. He is, for the present, absorbed in the hearing of that
   one sentence, "Go in peace; your sins which are many are all forgiven
   you." Well, beloved child, many more blessings await you! Pardon is but
   an entrance blessing, a welcome at the doorstep--there are rarer joys
   within the house! You have become an heir to a boundless inheritance!
   All things are yours! Heaven, Christ and God are yours! Yet I marvel
   not, that at present all your heart is taken up with a sense of
   pardoned sin! I will not disturb you, but I will rejoice with you. I
   will even sit down and sing with you--let this be our hymn--

   "Now, oh joy my sins are pardoned! Now I can, and do believe! All I
   have, and am, and shall be, To my precious Lord I give."

   Even the full-grown child of God highly values this gift so dear to
   little children and, although he has received many other mercies,
   besides, yet still, it is a chief part of his joy that he has been
   cleansed from sin and clothed with righteousness. Ah, and our elder
   Brothers who are now in the King's country, this is a chief point, even
   with them, that they have washed their robes and made them white in the
   blood of the Lamb! And therefore are they before the Throne of God and
   serve Him day and night in His Temple. Yes, dear little children, you
   have obtained a most precious favor in which you do well to
   rejoice--"your sins are forgiven you for His name's sake." Here let me
   observe that the forgiveness of sins is assuredly the possession of the
   new beginner in the Divine Life. He is as certainly forgiven as he ever
   shall be. The forgiveness of sins is not a matter of degrees or of
   growth. It is done in an instant and done forever, never to be
   reversed!

   The child of God who was born but yesterday is not as completely
   sanctified as he will be. He is not as completely instructed as he will
   be. He is not as completely conformed to the image of Christ as he will
   be. But he is as completely pardoned as the full-grown saint! He that
   just now passed the Gate of Pearl--did you not hear the shout as he
   entered, like a shock of corn fully ripe that comes in his season?--he,
   I say, was not more truly pardoned than you who but an hour ago
   believed in Christ unto the salvation of your soul! The dying thief had
   not many minutes found mercy and yet the Lord Jesus said to him, "Today
   shall you be with Me in Paradise!" It is plain, therefore, that he had
   been perfectly cleansed in a moment!

   To wash in the fountain filled with blood is not a business of weeks
   and months and years, nor is it to be repeated many times and often!
   But he that is washed is, then and there, made whiter than snow, and
   there is, from then on, no

   defilement upon him. "There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them
   that are in Christ Jesus." "I write unto you, little children, because
   your sins are forgiven you"--they are all gone--Divine Grace has most
   effectually removed them from you as far as the east is from the west!
   The Egyptians at the Red Sea were not destroyed by little and by
   little--they were not swallowed up in the flood, a regiment at a time!
   The eager depths which had, by miracle, been divided, for a time,
   leaped together and Pharaoh and his hosts--all of them--were covered,
   to be seen no more forever! Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously! "The depths have covered them; there is not one of them
   left."

   The Israelites had but barely set their foot upon the other side of the
   Red Sea and yet all their enemies were as completely drowned as when
   the people entered into the Promised Land--it is even so with you who
   have believed in Christ but newly--your sins are cast into the depths
   of the sea! Your iniquities are subdued by the Lord Jesus who has come
   to save His people from their sins. Therefore, little children, praise
   your God and sing unto His name with all your might-- "Who forgives all
   our iniquities; who heals all our diseases."

   Note, also, that your sins are forgiven you on the same terms as those
   of the Apostles and the greatest of the saints-- "Your sins are
   forgiven you for His name's sake"--that is, for the sake of Jesus, for
   the sake of His glorious Person, for the sake of His honorable offices,
   for the sake of His shed blood and atoning death, for the sake of His
   glorious Resurrection, for the sake of His perpetual intercession
   before the Throne of God! Your sins are not forgiven you because of
   anything you are or hope to be, nor because of anything that you have
   done or have suffered--you are forgiven for Christ's name's sake--and
   all the saints of God can say the same. This is a sure ground of hope!
   Quicksand there is none, but a solid rock is under our feet.

   Had the pardon been granted for our own work's sake, it might have been
   reversed upon our disobedience. But as sin is pardoned for Christ's
   sake, the pardon is irreversible, since there is no change in Christ!
   Is not this a dainty sweet for the little children? How gladly do I
   come and sit at the children's table when I see such food placed
   thereon! Now notice that this is the reason why John wrote to you,
   little children. People do not generally write letters to little
   children, but John does because of these special little ones it can be
   said, their sins are forgiven them. The moment, then, that a man has
   his sins forgiven, he is old enough to begin to understand that which
   is written--and he should become a Bible reader and a Bible searcher!
   The moment that his sins are forgiven him for Christ's name's sake, he
   becomes capable of exhortation--and it is his business to attend to
   what is written to him.

   If pardoned as criminals, we are enlisted as workers! Why, I think if
   my sins have been forgiven me, my Heaven-born instincts make me ask,
   "Lord, what will you have me to do? Have You done so much for me? Then
   set me about doing something for You! Give me, as a privilege, the
   opportunity of serving You." Therefore, John, knowing that the little
   children would be eager to obey, has written to them, in this Epistle,
   certain commands, of which I will speak to you further on. Only, little
   children, be on the alert to begin, at once, your work of faith and
   labor of love.

   II. Secondly, I have to speak of THE KNOWLEDGE of these little
   children. "I have written unto you, little children, because you have
   known, or know, the Father." The tiniest babe in the family of God
   knows the Father. For, first, as we have seen, his sins are forgiven
   him. By whom is that pardon given? Why, by the Father, and, therefore,
   he that has had his sins forgiven him necessarily knows the Father.
   When the poor prodigal felt the kisses of his father's love and saw the
   best robe adorning his person, then he knew the Father. All the
   philosophers in the world do not know so much of the Father God as a
   forgiven sinner knows!

   I go a little further--if there are any that have never fallen into
   sin, but are like the 99 just persons who need no repentance, or like
   the elder brother who had never, at any time, transgressed his father's
   commandment, I say that these do not know and cannot know the Father as
   the forgiven child does--for the Father's heart comes out most fully
   and expressly when He says, "Bring forth the best robe, and put it on
   him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. For this, My
   son was dead, and is alive again! He was lost and is found." Then, as
   he looks up through his tears and sees the ineffable smile of the
   Father's affection, the forgiven child knows the Father! The very least
   child of Grace, having received the forgiveness of sins, knows the
   Father in this most important sense.

   Moreover, this is a piece of knowledge, dear Friends, which the child
   of God obtains very early in his spiritual life, for whatever a child
   does not know, he knows his father. Think of your dear little one at
   home. He cannot, as yet, read a letter in the book. He knows nothing of
   the things which his elder brother studies, but he knows his father! He
   may not know very much about his father--he certainly could not speak
   to others about his father's business or his father's

   wealth--but he knows him! The child cannot help his father, or
   understand what his father does, but he knows his father and would
   choose him out from among a thousand. See how his eyes twinkle, now
   that Father has come home! See him stretch out his little hands! See
   how eager he is to get into those dear arms! He knows his father and
   never forgets that knowledge.

   Dear child of God, this is a piece of knowledge which you have, also!
   And in this you will yield to none of all the sacred family. Benjamin
   knows his father with an absolute certainty--he is as sure of it as
   Reuben is the firstborn. We go to school and college, but long before
   that we know our father--the fear is lest we overlay that precious
   knowledge with something not worth half as much! Little children, you
   know God, now, in your spiritual childhood. You could not preach about
   Him; you could not write a treatise upon His attributes; you could not
   describe His mighty acts--but you know Him by the instinct of a
   child--and in you is the promise fulfilled, "Israel shall cry unto Me,
   My God, we know You." Little children, the result of your knowing God
   as your Father is that when He is away from you, you are in the habit
   of crying after Him. If you cannot feel your Father's love shed abroad
   in your heart by the Holy Spirit, you are miserable and you hasten to
   your closet and begin to pray, "Come to me, my Father! Manifest
   Yourself to me, for I cannot live without You."

   On the other hand, when you do get to your Father, you show that you
   love Him by the perfect restfulness of your spirit. In God you are at
   home. Once get into your Father's arms and you feel quite safe, quite
   peaceful, quite happy. The Presence of God is the paradise of the
   Believer! God is the ultimatum of our desires--we speak of Him as "our
   exceeding joy." If in my Father's love I share a filial part, I ask no
   more than to know and enjoy it! We say, "Our Father which are in
   Heaven"--we might as truly say, "Our Father, You are our Heaven." Hence
   we seek after Him. "O God, You are my God; early will I seek You."
   Here, then, we have a token that we know the Father, when we weep
   because He is absent, or rejoice because He is present. We know the
   Father, Brothers and Sisters, even we who are but little in Israel, for
   we love Him! Do you not feel that you love God, this morning? You might
   not dare say so in public, and yet you would die for Him. Sooner than
   renounce your God would you not give up all that you possess? It may be
   you will never be tried as the martyrs have been, but if you were, can
   you suppose it possible that you could part with your God? No, your
   inmost heart loves Him! You know it does and, loving Him, you are
   united to Him by bonds which cannot be severed!

   Moreover, we know the Father, for we trust Him. Is it not written,
   "They that know Your name will put their trust in You"? Can you not
   trust God with everything? A child has no cares. His father cares for
   him. A child knows no anxiety. His father bears all the anxiety on his
   behalf. Is it not so with you? Though you are babes in Grace, do you
   not trust?--trust for time, trust for eternity, trust for your bodies
   and trust for your souls? I am sure you do! If you are what you should
   be, you know the Father, for your faith rests upon Him. It is also true
   that you seek to imitate Him. It is wonderful how little children
   imitate their father, perhaps more than grown-up children do, though
   the influence of example is also seen upon them. The very little ones
   will try to do everything exactly like Father. It must be right, it
   must be perfect! If father does it, they make us smile as we see in
   them ourselves in miniature!

   Is not this the very thing which you try to do? Though you were
   converted but a very little while ago, yet you wish to be like Jesus!
   You long to be like the Father. Would you not be perfect if you could?
   If you could, would you not be rid of every sin? If some painful
   surgical operation could take away from you the black drops of
   indwelling sin, would you not cheerfully bare your breast to the
   sharpest knife? I know you would! You would die to be rid of sin, for
   that is the thing you hate. This proves that you know your Father in
   Heaven, for you are trying to be like He is. And do you not glory in
   Him? Little children, when they begin to talk and go to school--how
   proud they are of their father! Their father is the greatest man that
   ever lived--there never was the like of him! You may talk to them of
   great statesmen, or great warriors, or great princes, but these are all
   nobodies--their father fills the whole horizon of their being!

   Well, so it certainly is with us and our Father God--

   "Since no works are like Yours, None so glorious, so Divine. Since
   whatever gods there are, None, O Lord, are like You, Let me bow before
   Your Throne And exalt Your name alone."

   We cannot make enough of our God! We extol Him with all our might. With
   the blessed virgin we sing, "My soul does magnify the Lord." What does,
   "magnify," mean? Why, to make great! We feel as if we would make God's
   name great and would greaten Him in the minds of men and make them
   think what a blessed Father we have! Now, listen! This is the reason
   why John has written to you, little children, because he says, "They
   know enough to understand my letter, for they know the Father." We do
   not think of writing a letter to a little child. "Ah," says John, "but
   the Lord's children know their Father" and he that knows God is capable
   of any kind of knowledge! He who knows God is a fit person to be
   accepted as a disciple of the beloved Apostle. I cannot desire a better
   congregation than a congregation of men and women that know the Father.

   What if they are little children? Well, they can understand anything
   that I, another child, can have to say, for they know the Father and,
   therefore, they have an unction from the Holy One and are able to know
   spiritual things! To know God is the center and the circumference of
   all knowledge! If you know the Father, do you not see the reason why
   John writes to you? Because now that you know Him, you are bound to
   love Him, to trust Him and to serve Him! Having received such knowledge
   as this, you are bound to impart it as far as you can! You are bound to
   live up to it and to show to all around you what a child of God is--and
   how different he is from the children of darkness! Thus, out of your
   privilege and out of your knowledge, there arises an obligation which I
   trust you will not be slow to acknowledge.

   Here is a prayer for you--

   "If I've the honor, Lord, to be One of Your happy family. On me the
   gracious gift bestow To call You "Abba, Father," too. So may my conduct
   ever prove My filial piety and love! While all my brethren clearly
   trace Their Father's likeness in my face." III. Now we come to our
   third division. Will you kindly follow me with your Bibles, especially
   you that are "little children," while I commend to you THE PRECEPTS
   which John has written for your guidance. First, look at 1 John 2. "My
   little children, these things I write unto you, that you sin not." That
   is the first precept--"Little children, sin not." Children ate very apt
   to get into the mud. Most mothers will tell you, I think, that if there
   is a pool of mud anywhere within a mile, her first-born joy and comfort
   will find it out and get into it if he possibly can! And no matter how
   often a child is washed, he seems to always need washing again--if
   there is a method by which he can foul his hands and his face--your
   pretty cherub is most ingenious to find it out!

   I am afraid this is too much the case with the children of God. There
   is so much of carnality about us, so much of the old Adam, that the
   question is not into which sin we fall, but into which sin we do not
   fall! Alas, we are apt to be proud, though we have nothing to be proud
   of! We are prone to despond and doubt our Father, though He never gave
   us any cause to do so! We are inclined to be worldly, though there is
   nothing in the world worth loving! And we have a tendency to grow cold
   and chill towards God, though He is altogether lovely and ought to win
   our warmest affection. We are apt to speak unadvisedly with our lips.
   We are apt to be full of foolish thoughts. We are apt to be
   self-willed. We find an angry temper rising against some Brother of
   ours whom we ought to love--and we have not long got over that before
   we are half-afraid to utter a word of rebuke lest we should incur the
   laughter of the ungodly!

   We glide from one sin to another, even as a waterfall descends from
   rock to rock. As weeds multiply in the soul, so do sins spring up in
   our hearts. We are a mass of faults. Like the pendulum, we swing to the
   right hand and then to the left--we err, first, in one way and then in
   another--we are always inclined to evil! And, therefore, the Apostle
   sweetly puts it, "My little children, I write unto you, that you sin
   not." Avoid every sin--forsake it altogether! Ask for the Grace of God
   to sanctify you wholly--spirit, soul, and body. Though you are only
   newly born, yet, my little children, sin not. You will soon lose your
   comfort if you do. Little children, sin will hurt you, damage you,
   grieve you, and displease your heavenly Father! Sin will raise a cloud,
   behind which His Presence will be hidden from you! It will stop your
   heavenly growth. It will prevent your usefulness.

   My little children, I earnestly entreat you that you sin not! Burnt
   child, dread the fire you have just been plucked out of, do not go back
   to it. Do not play with sparks! Keep clear of every kind of match that
   might create a flame. Seek after

   holiness with all your might. Though born but yesterday, do not sin
   today. God help you to fulfill this holy precept. Further on in this
   second chapter, the Apostle writes to them again, and tells them (v.
   18) that it is the last times and that there are many antichrists
   abroad. You will have to run your eyes right down the chapter till you
   come to verse 24, for that is what he says to little children, because
   there are many antichrists in the world that would seduce them--"Let
   that, therefore, abide in you, which you have heard from the
   beginning."

   Little children are very fickle. The toys which they cry for one day,
   they break the next. Young minds change with the wind. So, little
   children, there are many evil ones who will endeavor to seduce you from
   the Truth of God and, as you have a natural instability of mind as yet,
   for you are only newly converted, it is well to be on your guard
   against those who would mislead you. Till we are rooted and grounded in
   the Truth of God, new things have great charms for us, especially if
   they have about them a great show of holiness and zeal for God. Listen,
   then, dear children but newly born into the Savior's family--"Let that,
   therefore, abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning."

   Alas, even those who are older in Grace than you are have shown a sad
   readiness to be duped by plausible persons who have invented fresh
   notions and methods! I have lived long enough to have seen a
   considerable variety of follies and manias in the religious world. They
   have sprung up, grown great, declined and vanished. One day it has been
   one thing, another, another. I have lived to see those things justly
   ridiculed which, a few years before, were cried up as the wonders of
   the age! I thank God I have not been moved by any of these periodical
   fits of frenzy, but have been content to keep to the one old Truth of
   God which I have gathered from the Scriptures and made my own by
   experience and by the teaching of the Holy Spirit! I have not had to
   tack about, for I have been enabled to steam ahead--and I hope I shall
   do so to the end.

   I have no respect for these upstart inventions. I regard them as so
   many phases of human delusion. One never knows what will come next, but
   of this we are pretty sure, that every now and then a new doctrine is
   brought forth which turns out to be an old heresy with a fresh coat of
   varnish on it! Or else some new method of saving souls is found out and
   the work blazes away like a house on fire till it dies out in smoke.
   Let us not be carried off our feet by every wind of doctrine! We may
   live to see the present craze ended and another or two after it--only
   be it ours to be steadfast, immovable! "Little children, let that,
   therefore, abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning."
   Leave to others the soon exhausted novelties and you keep to the
   eternal unchangeable Truth which is taught you in God's Word and in
   your own soul's experience.

   Little children, here is a third precept for you, and I want you to put
   it into your bosom and carry it home (v. 28). "And now, little
   children, abide in Him." There is a Sabbath portion for you--"Abide in
   Him." Let the Truth of God abide in you and you abide in Christ, who is
   the Truth of God. Little children are very apt to stray. I have known
   them tempted away from home and to play the truant. They have gone into
   the fields after pretty flowers, or down by the brook to fish for
   minnows, and then they have fallen into all sorts of trouble. The best
   place for a child is at home. And for a babe in Grace the best shelter
   is the Savior's bosom. "Little children, abide in Him." If you forget
   everything else I say this morning, lay this up in your hearts, and let
   none tempt you away from simply trusting your Savior, sweetly resting
   in His love and humbly following on to know more and more of Him! "And
   now, little children, abide in Him."

   What next? Read on to chapter 3:7-- "Little children, let no man
   deceive you." Children are very credulous. They will believe any idle
   tale if it is told by a clever and attractive person. Little children,
   believe your Savior, but be not ready to believe anybody else! Believe
   God's Word and stand fast to that. And if sinners entice you, do not
   consent to them. And if antichrist would teach you false doctrine,
   close your ears to it. Be as the sheep of whom Jesus said--"A stranger
   they will not follow, for they know not the voice of strangers."
   Further on, (3:18), we read--"My little children, let us not love in
   word, neither in tongue but in deed and in truth." Little children are
   apt to let their angry passions rise till they have to be told by Dr.
   Watts that their--

   "Little hands were never made To tear each other's eyes."

   And truly we have some Christian children who have been all too quick
   about this tearing of each other's eyes. They have seen a Truth of God
   and some friend they meet with does not see it. Therefore they have
   tried to knock his eyes out to make him see it! That is a faithful
   description of many Christian controversies. It is idle to attempt to
   compel another to think as I think by scolding him and heaping wrath
   upon him. Let us never do that. Let us love! If you cannot expect

   anything else of a child, you do expect love, and love never seems to
   be more suitably enshrined than in the heart and mind of a little
   child. Come, you that are newly brought to Christ, love with all your
   might! If you cannot fight as soldiers, or work as laborers, yet love
   the Brotherhood! Love Christ! Love God! Love the souls of men and by
   love seek to win them to the Savior who has saved you! Love not in word
   only, but in deed and in truth.

   You have the next words in chapter 4, verse 4--"You are of God, little
   children, and have overcome them: because greater is He that is in you,
   than He that is in the world." Little children are frequently timid.
   They are sometimes terrified when left alone. They are generally afraid
   of strangers. Hear, then, you little children, you are very weak and
   feeble, but do not be dismayed because of that, for there is a Power
   dwelling in you which is mightier than the power which dwells in the
   world! Satan dwells in the world and he is mighty, but God dwells in
   you and He is Almighty! Therefore be not afraid--

   "A feeble saint shall win the day, Though death and Hell obstruct the
   way." Hold on to your faith in the eternal Lord who dwells in you, and
   you shall never perish, neither shall any pluck you out of His hand!

   The last precept to little children is at the end of the Epistle.
   Carefully read the last verse--"Little children, keep yourselves from
   idols." Little children are naturally fond of toys and pretty pictures.
   Anything like pomp and show is sure to please children. How fond they
   are of soldiers, banners, processions, bands of music and all that is
   frivolous-- these are their idols. That is the also tendency of many
   grown-up children that I know of. They admire a fine religion,
   tasteful, striking, artistic. "Little children, keep yourselves from
   idols." I would like this text printed over the altars of our
   Ritualistic neighbors. I need scarcely mention others who have no taste
   or care for the beautiful, but their toys are all for noise-making,
   glitter and flash--a sort of Fifth of November all the days of the
   year! Do not become fascinated with their playthings. Be not led away
   from the Church of God by armies or navies.

   Alas, the children must now have their play toys in the Church and
   their toys in the Chapel--and some must have their toys in the streets,
   till one would think, with their trumpets and drums, that they had just
   come home from the fair! "Little children, keep yourselves from idols,"
   I do not think you are likely to fall in love with the idols of the
   heathen and bow down to them--but there are plenty of other gods which
   are the idols of one period and the derision of the next. Keep to
   Christ! Ask not for pomp and show! Ask not for noise and bluster! Ask
   for nothing but that your sins may be forgiven you; that you may know
   the Father; that you may abide in Christ and be full of love to all the
   family of God!

   Little children, may the Lord Jesus Christ be with you and may you grow
   in Grace till you come unto the fullness of the stature of men in Him.
   May His Grace be upon all them that love Him and wait for His
   appearing.

Filling the Empty Vessels

   (No. 1712)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER 17, 1882,

   BY C, H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory
   by Christ Jesus." Philippians 4:19.

   VERY beautiful, to my mind, is the sight of "Paul the aged" confined in
   his prison at Rome, likely, by-and-by, to be put to death, but calm,
   quiet, peaceful and joyful. Just now he is so happy that a gleam of
   sunlight seems to light up his cell and his face shines like that of an
   angel! He is exceedingly delighted because he has been, in his deep
   poverty, kindly remembered by the little Church at Philippi, for they
   have sent him a contribution. See how cheerful the man is--I was about
   to say, how contented, but I drop the word because it falls far short
   of the mark! He is far more happy than Caesar overhead in the palace.
   He is charmed with the love which has sent him this relief. Probably
   the gift does not come to very much, if estimated in Roman coin, but he
   makes a great deal of it and sits down to write a letter of thanks
   abounding in rich expressions like these--"I have all things, and
   abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which
   were sent from you."

   His heart was evidently greatly touched, for he says, "I rejoiced in
   the Lord greatly, that now, at the last, your care of me has flourished
   again." See how little a gift may make a good man glad! Is it not worth
   while to be free with our cups of cold water to the Prophets of the
   Lord? Instead of a little money, the Brothers and Sisters at Philippi
   receive a boundless blessing and are enriched by the fervent prayers of
   the Apostle! Hear how earnestly Paul invokes benedictions on the heads
   of his benefactors! Is it not a blessed state of mind which enables a
   heart so soon to be full to overflowing? Some would grumble over a
   roasted ox, but here is Paul--rejoicing over a dinner of herbs!

   So great was the disinterestedness of Paul, that there was nothing of
   selfishness about his joy. He did not speak in respect of need, for he
   knew how to suffer need without complaint. But he looked upon the
   kindly contribution as a fruit of the Grace of God in the
   Philippians--a generous proof that they were lifted out of heathen
   selfishness into Christian love! There was little enough of kindness in
   the old Roman and Greek world into which Paul went preaching the
   Gospel. Those were times of great hardness of heart, even to cruel
   heartlessness. There was no sort of provision for the poor. If a man
   was poor, why, that was his own problem, and he might starve and die.

   You know how hardened the people had become through the fights in the
   amphitheater, so that the sight of blood produced a fierce delight in
   their brutal bosoms and human suffering was, to them, rather a thing to
   be rejoiced in than to be prevented. There might be, here and there, a
   tender hand that gave coin to the poor, but, for the most part, charity
   was dead. The voluptuaries of that most degenerate age planned no
   hospitals and built no orphanages--they were too intent upon their
   gladiators and their mistresses. Self was lord paramount in Caesar's
   court and all over Roman realms!

   But here are people at Philippi thinking about one who had preached the
   Gospel to them and who is now suffering. They are moved by a new
   principle--love to God in Christ Jesus has created love to the man
   whose words had changed them. They will not abandon him--they will, out
   of their own slender means, cheer his sad condition. There were
   Churches that had no such hearts of mercy, alas, that so early in the
   Gospel-day holy charity should be so rare! There were people whom Paul
   had blessed greatly, who even quarreled about him and denied that he
   was an Apostle of Christ! But not so the beloved Church at Philippi.
   They had, again and again, ministered to his necessities and Paul, now,
   rejoices in them, again, because he delights to see another instance of
   the transforming power of the Grace of God upon character, so that
   those who were once selfish now rejoiced, unprompted and unasked, to
   send their offering to him.

   Was Lydia at the bottom of that subscription? I should not wonder! We
   know that she was open-hearted. Did the jailer add his full share? I
   feel sure of it, for in the prison he courteously entertained the
   Apostle. These were a generous people and Paul is happy in thinking of
   them. I may here dare to say that I, also, have had the same joy over
   many of you when I have seen how freely you have given of your
   substance to the work of the Lord. It would be unfair if I withheld

   commendation for liberality from many now before me. You have rejoiced
   my heart by your gifts to the cause of God. You have given up to the
   measure of your means and some of you beyond what we could have asked
   of you. The Gospel has taught you this. To God be glory that it is so.
   Continue in the same spirit, that none may rob me of this joy.

   The Apostle makes to them an assurance in the following verses that
   they shall be abundantly repaid for all that they have done. He says to
   them, "You have helped me; but my God shall supply you. You have helped
   me in one of my needs--my need of clothing and of food. I have other
   needs in which you could not help me, but my God shall supply all your
   need. You have helped me, some of you, out of your deep poverty, taking
   from your scanty store. But my God shall supply all your need out of
   His riches in Glory. You have sent Epaphroditus unto me with your
   offering. Well and good! He is a most worthy Brother, and a true
   yoke-fellow. And for all that, God shall send a better messenger to
   you, for He shall supply all your needs by Christ Jesus."

   He seems to me to make a parallel of his needs with theirs, and of his
   supplies from them with their supplies from the Lord. He would seem to
   say--Just as God has, through you, filled me up, so shall He, by
   Christ, fill you up. That is a translation of the Greek which most
   nearly touches the meaning--"My God shall fill up all your need
   according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus." Will you allow me to
   make a break, here, for one instant? I read you, just now, the story of
   the Prophet's widow whose children were about to be taken for a debt,
   and how the oil was multiplied in the vessels which she borrowed until
   there was enough to discharge the debt, and sufficient surplus for
   herself and children to live upon.

   Now, kindly take that picture and join it on to this--and we have here,
   first, the empty vessels. Set them out in a row, "all your need."
   Secondly, who will fill them up?--"My God shall fill up all your need."
   Thirdly, after what fashion will He do it?--"According to His riches in
   glory." Fourthly, by what means will He do it?--"By Christ Jesus." Keep
   the widow and the vessels before you and let us see the miracle worked
   over, again, on a grand scale in our own houses and hearts. May the
   Holy Spirit make the sight refreshing to our faith.

   I. So, then, we will begin our discourse this evening by asking you to
   SET OUT THE EMPTY VESSELS. "My God shall supply all your need." Bring
   forth your vessels, even empty vessels! "All your need." I do not
   suppose that you are under any great obligation to go out, tonight, and
   borrow other people's needs, for you have enough of your own at
   home--needs many and varied. Very well, set them out. Hide none of them
   away, but put them down, one after another, in a long row, all of them.
   There are needs for your body, needs for your soul. There are needs for
   yourselves, needs for your families--needs for the present, needs for
   the future--needs for time, needs for eternity. There are needs for
   earth, needs for Heaven. Your needs are as many as your moments--as
   many as the hairs of your head.

   I suppose it would be useless for me to attempt a catalog of
   them--however carefully we made the list, we should have to add a host
   of sundries altogether unmentionable until circumstances suggested
   them. I could hardly tell you all my own needs, but I know that they
   are enormous and increasing with my years. I have needs as a man, as a
   husband, as a father, as a citizen, as a Christian, as a pastor, as an
   author--in fact, every position I take up adds to my needs. If I went
   through my own personal bill of requests, I could fill a document like
   the roll mentioned in the Old Testament, written within and
   without--and hardly then could I enumerate all my own demands upon the
   Bank of Heaven. But if I attempted to take all the thousands that are
   gathered beneath this roof and to let each man state his particular
   needs, where would the computation end? The sands upon the seashore are
   not more innumerable!

   Dear! Dear! We would need a library larger than the Bodleian to hold
   all the books which could be written of all the needs of the needy
   congregation now before me! Well, I am not sorry for it, for here is so
   much the more room for the Lord to work His miracles of bountiful
   Grace! Sometimes, when I have been in need for the work of the
   Orphanage and the College and such things--and these times have
   occurred--I do solemnly assure you that I have felt a wonderful joy in
   my spirit. I have watched the ebb of the funds till nearly everything
   has been gone and then I have joyfully said to myself, "Now for it! The
   vessels are empty! Now I shall see the miracle of filling them." What
   wonders the Lord has worked for me, I cannot, now, tell you in detail,
   but many of you who have been my faithful helpers know how hundreds and
   even thousands of pounds have poured in from our great Lord in the
   moment of necessity. It will always be the same, for the Lord God is
   the same.

   Until the funds run low we cannot expect to see them replenished--when
   they get low, then will God come and deal graciously with us! Money is,
   however, our smallest need--we need Grace, wisdom, light and
   comfort--and these we

   shall have. All our needs are occasions for blessing. The more needs
   you have the more blessing you will get. God has promised to fill up
   all your needs. That is, all your empty vessels will be filled and,
   therefore, the more the merrier! What? The more in need the better?
   Yes, I would have your faith believe that strange statement--your
   poverty shall thus be your riches, your weakness your strength, your
   abasement your exaltation! Your extremity shall be an opportunity that
   God will use to show the riches of His Grace! To your utter exhaustion
   He will draw near with all the fullness of His inexhaustible Grace and
   He will replenish you till your cup runs over!

   He will fill up all your empty vessels. Be not slow to fetch them out
   from holes and corners and place them before the Lord, however many
   they may be. Weep not over the empty jars, but place them out in rows
   in full expectation of their being filled to the brim! These empty
   vessels of yours are, some of them, I have no doubt, very large, and
   they even grow larger. Most of our needs grow upon us. You still pray,
   "Give us this day our daily bread," but the one loaf which was a large
   answer to the prayer when you were single, would not go far at your
   table, now--the loaves vanish like snow in the sun! You needed faith 50
   years ago, but you need more, now, do you not? You have more
   infirmities and, perhaps, more trials than in your younger days. I know
   that, apart from my loving Lord, I am much more needy, now, than I ever
   was before. Whatever a man requires in the things of God, usually the
   older he grows and the more experience he has, the more he needs, and
   the more of it he needs.

   He needs more love than he had when he was younger, more patience, more
   resignation, more humility, more charity, more wisdom, more holiness.
   He desires more faith and a brighter hope. He needs, especially in
   prospect of death, more courage and more bold, simple, child-like
   confidence in his Savior, Why, some of us have needs that could not be
   supplied if we could turn the stars to gold and coin them and pay them
   away--these could not touch the hunger of the heart and soul! The
   world, itself, would be but a mouthful for our spirits' necessity--a
   drop in a bucket. I know some saints that have grown to be so deeply in
   debt to their Lord, to His Church and to the world, that they are
   hopelessly involved in boundless obligation.

   How can we meet the demands upon us? Our responsibilities are
   overwhelming! All that some of us have made by our lifelong trading is
   a bigger stock of needs than we ever had before. The vacuum within our
   spirit expands and enlarges, and we cry out, "More knowledge of the
   Scriptures! More of Christ! More of Grace! More of God! More of the
   Holy Spirit! More power to serve God!" Our oil vessels would, each one,
   hold a sea--and even these are expanding! We need more and more, and
   the mercy is that the text before us keeps pace with the growth--"My
   God shall supply all your need." This includes the big needs as well as
   the little ones! It comprehends all that can be as well as all that is!
   It guarantees us that our growing needs shall all be supplied. Let the
   vessels expand to their utmost, "Yet my God," says Paul, "shall fill up
   all those needs of yours."

   Certain of our needs, again, are of this extraordinary kind, that if
   they were filled up, tonight, they would be empty tomorrow morning!
   Some of our necessities are fresh every morning. The crop is a daily
   one, it springs up every moment. The Grace I had five minutes ago will
   not serve me now. Yesterday I may have possessed great love, great
   faith, great courage, great humility, great joy--but I also need these
   today--and none can give them to me but my Lord. You had great patience
   under your last trial. Yes, but old patience is stale stuff. You must
   grow more of that sweet herb in your garden, for the trial that is now
   coming can only be sweetened by the herb content, newly gathered from
   the garden of your heart and mixed with the bitter water of your
   afflictions.

   Our condition apart from our God may be compared to those fabled
   vessels that we read of in mythology that were so full of holes that,
   though the 50 daughters of Danaus labored hard to fill them up, they
   could never accomplish the task. You and I are such leaky vessels that
   none but God can ever fill us! And when we are filled, none but God can
   keep us full. Yet so the promise stands, "My God shall supply all your
   need"--all the vessels shall be filled and shall be kept full! We have
   certain needs, dear Friends, that are very pressing and, perhaps, most
   clamorous at this moment. Some needs are urgent--they must be supplied,
   and supplied speedily--or we shall perish with hunger, or die of
   sickness, or wither up in despair. Here let me add a caution--I dare
   not tell you that God will supply all the needs of everybody, for this
   promise is to the children of God--and in its most emphatic sense it is
   only to a certain class, even, among them.

   Those persons who profess to be Christians and, when they were
   well-to-do, never helped anybody else--I think the Lord will let them
   pinch a bit, and know what a condition of poverty is like that they may
   become more sympathetic with the poor. I have known good stewards and
   the Lord has sent them more, for they have dealt well with what they
   had.

   They have given away their substance by shovelfuls and the Lord has
   sent it back by cartloads and entrusted them with more! Others who have
   been bad stewards and have not served their Master well, have lost what
   they had, and have come to poverty. Let us hope that their substance
   has gone to somebody that will use it better! But, meanwhile, they have
   to pinch, and deservedly so.

   But, remember, the Apostle is speaking to people of a very different
   character from that. He is speaking to the Phi-lippians and I think
   that there is a point in that pronoun, "My God shall supply all your
   need." You have been generous in helping the Lord's servant and the
   Lord will repay you. Up to the measure of your ability you have served
   His Church and helped to carry on His work in the world and, therefore,
   God will supply all your need. This is not spoken to hoarding Judas,
   but to the generous who had voluntarily yielded of their substance when
   a fit opportunity was given them. Will any of you bring your need to
   God and test Him by the same conduct? Remember that old promise of His,
   "Bring you all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat
   in My house, and prove Me now herewith, says the Lord of Hosts, if I
   will not open you the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a blessing,
   that there shall not be room enough to receive it."

   There is that that scatters and yet increases. Give, and it shall be
   given unto you. Oh yes, our gracious God will fill all the vessels at
   once, if time presses! If your needs urgently require to be filled,
   bring them to Him. I began by saying that few of us had any great call
   to borrow other people's empty pots. Yet there are some of us whose
   main anxiety is about the vessels that we have borrowed. We need more
   oil than others for this very reason, that we care for others. Certain
   of us have been called to a life which intertwists itself with many
   lives. We have been led by Grace and Providence to take upon ourselves
   the needs of thousands. Every genuine warm-hearted Christian does this,
   more or less. We try to make other men's needs our own needs by working
   for the poor, the ignorant, the sick, the helpless. You that care for
   our orphan children may well join with me in prayer that the Lord will
   fill up all those empty vessels which we have borrowed of poor widows.

   Think of my hundreds of borrowed vessels in the Orphanage and of the
   number in the College. Blessed be the Lord my God, He will fill up all
   these! Those whom we try to help in different ways, especially those we
   try to lead to the Savior, are like the woman's borrowed vessels--and
   they are not a few! You have made their spiritual needs your own. You
   have come before God to pray for them as for your own soul and you
   shall be heard. You have talked to your neighbors and laid yourself out
   for their good, as if your own eternal destiny were in their
   stead--rest fully assured that the Lord that filled the borrowed pots
   in Elisha's day will also supply your borrowed needs! "My God will fill
   up all your needs." It is a blessed word! Bring out your vessels and
   see if it is not true!

   I should like to see every Christian here setting out all his vessels
   in rows at once, whatever they may be. Do not put your cares away in
   the back room and say, "I shall draw them out tomorrow and begin
   worrying over them." Instead of that, while the oil is flowing, bring
   them here, before the Lord, that the oil may have free course and find
   suitable storage. Would you limit the miracle? Have you one forgotten
   need? Make haste with it! Still, the oil is multiplying! Come one! Come
   all! Arrange your vessels and the Lord will fill up your needs, by His
   Grace, and fill your mouths with a song!

   II. Secondly, let us enquire, WHO IS TO FILL THESE VESSELS? Paul says,
   "My God will supply all your need." "My God!" Oh, that is grand! It
   were foolish talking if any other name were mentioned! God can supply
   all the needs of His people, for He is All-Sufficient--but nobody else
   can. He can do it without any help, for nothing is too hard for the
   Lord. He is able to number the myriads of His creatures and attend to
   the commissariat of them all, so that not one of them shall lack--"He
   calls them all by their names, by the greatness of His power not one
   fails." "They that wait upon the Lord shall not want any good thing."
   As for you, dear Brothers and Sisters, "trust in the Lord and do good,
   so shall you dwell in the land, and verily you shall be fed." He that
   promises to fill up all your empty vessels is one who can do it--there
   is no limit to the goodness and power of God!

   Then, notice that sweet word which Paul has put before the glorious
   word, "God." He writes--"My God." As Paul looked at the money which the
   Philippians had sent him and, perhaps, at the warm garments that would
   cover him in the cold, damp jail, he cried, "See how my God has
   supplied me!" And then he says, "My God shall supply you." This same
   God, Paul's God--"shall fill up all your need." Wonderfully had God
   protected Paul from the malice of those who sought for his life. Very
   wonderfully had he been carried by Divine power through unparalleled
   labors, so that he had

   been made to triumph in every place in the preaching of the Gospel! And
   thus Paul had learned from day to day to get a firmer grip of his God,
   and say, "My God!" with more and more emphasis.

   Jehovah was not to Paul the unknown god, but, "My God." With God he
   dwelt and in Him he reposed all his cares. This same God is our God!
   Think of that, poor friend, in your hour of need. Think of that, you
   afflicted widow woman--you have Paul's God to go to! Think of that,
   dear child of God in trouble--you have the same God as Paul had and He
   is as much yours as He was Paul's! His arm has not waxed short, neither
   has His heart grown hard towards any of His children! "My God," says
   Paul, "who is also your God, will supply all your need." Who is this
   God that will supply all our needs? Paul's God, remember, was and is
   the God of Providence! And what a wonderful God He is.

   We speak as if we were some very important part of the universe, but
   really, what are we? Our little island can scarcely be found upon the
   globe till you hunt long for it! What a tiny speck this congregation
   must be! But God supplies the needs of all the millions of mankind.
   "Mankind," I said--but I ought to have included all the other
   creatures, too-- the myriads of herring in the sea, the multitudes of
   birds that sometimes darken the sun in their migrations, the countless
   armies of worms and insects, strangely supplied, we know not how! And
   yet, "Your heavenly Father feeds them."

   Is that all the sphere of His Providence? No, far from it! I suppose
   that this round world of ours is but one apple in the orchard of
   creation, one grain of dust in the corner of God's great palace. But
   all yon orbs, with all the living things that may be peopling every
   star, He supplies. And how? "He opens His hand and supplies the need of
   every living thing." See how easy to Him is this universal
   provision--He does but open His hand and it is done! This is the God
   that will supply all your need! He calls the stars by name! He leads
   out Arcturus with his sons. He loosens the bands of Orion. He does
   great things without number--and shall He not feed and clothe you, O
   you of little faith? Yes, be you sure of this, the God of Providence
   shall supply all your needs for this life and its surroundings.

   If that suffice you not, let me remind you that this God is the God of
   Grace, for Paul, above all men, counted Divine Grace to be his
   treasure--his God was the God of Grace. Chiefly He is the God who gave
   His Son to bleed and die for men. Oh, stand at Calvary and see God's
   great Sacrifice--the gift of His only-begotten Son! And when you have
   marked the wounds of the Well-Beloved and seen Jesus die, answer me
   this--"He that spared not His own Son, but freely delivered Him up for
   us all, how shall He not, with Him, also freely give us all things?"
   What will He deny us who has given up the best jewel that He had, the
   glorious One that Heaven could not match? There was never the likes of
   Jesus, and yet He bowed His head to die on our behalf!

   Oh, my dear, dear Friends, if you are anxious, tonight, and vexed with
   many cares, do think of that! It is the God and Father of our Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ who says that He will fill up all your need! Do you
   doubt Him? Can you? Dare you distrust Him? Now, take a flight above
   this present cloud-land and behold the God of Heaven! Think of what God
   is up yonder--

   "Beyond, beyond this lower sky

   Up where eternal ages roll,

   Where solid pleasures never die,

   And fruits immortal feast the soul." Behold the splendor of God! Gold
   in Heaven is of no account--the streets of that city are all of pure
   gold like unto transparent glass! The riches and the merchandise of
   nations are but as rags and rottenness compared with the most common
   utensils of God's great House above! There they possess inexhaustible
   treasures and everything that is precious, for the walls of the New
   Jerusalem are described as made of 12 manner of precious stones, as if
   these stones were so common in Immanuel's land that they built the
   walls with them! The gates are each one a pearl. What pearls are those!
   Is God rich? Inconceivably, incalculably rich, so that He clothes the
   very grass of the field more gloriously than Solomon clothed himself!

   What am I doing to be of a doubtful mind? Is He my Father and will He
   let me suffer need? What? I, starving, and my Father owning Heaven? No,
   no!--

   "He that has made my Heaven secure, Will here, all good provide While
   Christ is rich, can I be poor? What can I need beside?"

   My precious text is one which, years ago, when we built the Orphanage,
   I caused to be cut on one of the pillars of the entrance. You will
   notice it inside the first columns on either side whenever you go
   there. "My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in
   glory by Christ Jesus." This I took for the foundation of the
   Institution and set my seal to it as true. And it has been so! Time
   would fail me if I were to tell how often God has interposed, there,
   for His numerous family--those children that are cast upon the Divine
   Fatherhood. He has honored His own promise and our faith--and I believe
   He always will. There on the forefront of the Orphanage stands also the
   words--"The Lord will provide." You shall see whether it is not so. As
   long as that place stands, my God shall supply our need and it shall be
   a standing encouragement to us all.

   Think of the far more extensive orphanage of our Brother Mueller, of
   Bristol, with those 2,500 children living simply through prayer and
   faith, and yet as abundantly supplied as the Queen in her palace!
   Nothing is needed where God is the Provider. The Lord will supply
   without fail! Let us trust without fear. Go and plead this promise with
   the Lord your God and He will fulfill it to you as well as to the rest
   of His saints.

   III. Now, thirdly, let us enquire IN WHAT STYLE WILL GOD SUPPLY HIS
   PEOPLE'S NEEDS? He will do it in such style as becomes His
   wealth--"according to His riches." There are several ways of doing most
   things. There is more than one way of giving a penny to a beggar. You
   can throw it at him, if you like, or pitch it in the mud as if you
   threw a bone to a dog. Or you may hand it to him in a sort of huff as
   if you said, "Take it, and be off with you." Or you may drag the coin
   out of your pocket as unwillingly as if you were losing your eye-tooth.
   There is yet another way--namely that which makes the copper turn to
   gold--by a way of doing it courteously and with kindness which
   expresses sympathy with the poor creature's need. Always give good
   things in the best way, for your heavenly Father does so.

   Now, how does God supply His children? Stingily, miserably, grudging
   them every penny's worth? Certainly not! I hope that it was never your
   misery to dine with a grudging man who watched every mouthful that went
   down your throat as if there was so much the less for him! Why, when
   one does eat, at whatever table it may be, if it is the most common
   fare, one likes a welcome. It is the welcome which makes the Covenant
   invitation so sweet, when you hear the exhortation, "Eat, O Friends;
   drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved." One enjoys the welcome of a
   heart which pleases all it can--like the Scot woman at a great
   communion meeting when there was nobody to take the people in--"Come
   in," she said. "Come in! I have room for 10 of you in my house, and I
   have room for 10,000 of you in my heart. Come along with you. Nobody so
   welcome as you that have been sitting at my Master's table with me."

   How, then, does God dispense His favors? How does He fill up the
   vessels? The way He does it is not according to our poverty, nor
   according to our merit, "but according to His riches." He gives like a
   king! Brothers and Sisters, I must correct myself--He gives as God and
   as only God can give--according to His own God-like riches. No, that is
   not all. He will do it in a style consistent with His present Glory. It
   is "according to His riches in glory," which means that, as rich as God
   is in glory, so rich is He in giving. He never demeans Himself in the
   mercies that He gives. He gives according to His rank and that is the
   highest conceivable. He gives so as to bring Him new Glory. I never
   heard of one of His children receiving a great blessing from Him and
   then saying that it did not glorify God to bestow it. No, no! The more
   He gives, the more glorious He is in the eyes of men!

   And He delights to give, that His Glory may be seen, and that the
   riches of His manifested Glory may be increased. Withholding would not
   enrich the Lord of Heaven! Rather would it impoverish Him in Glory. But
   giving enriches Him with more revealed Glory and He, therefore,
   delights to scatter His bounty. The fact is, Brethren, God gives
   gloriously! The calculations of God--did you ever think of them? Well,
   let me say that He always calculates so as to leave something to spare,
   by which to illustrate the infinity of His goodness. I know that it is
   so. He does not give us just as much light as our eyes can take in, but
   He floods the world with splendor till we shade our eyes amidst the
   blaze of noon. After this fashion did His only-begotten Son feed the
   thousands when He multiplied bread and fish for them to eat. We read
   that "they did all eat"--no doubt they were hungry enough to do a great
   deal of that sort of labor! So far so good. But it is added, "and were
   filled."

   It takes a good deal to fill men who have come a long way into the
   country and have had nothing to eat for a whole day. But they were
   filled, fainting and famished though they had been. Yes, but do not
   stop there--"And they took up of the fragments 12 baskets full." The
   Lord always has baskets full of leftovers remaining for the waiters. He
   will be sure to fill all your needs till you have no other need
   remaining and have provision on hand for needs not yet arrived. Will
   the

   day ever come when we shall say, "Bring yet another need for God to
   fill," and the answer will be, "I have no more needs"? Then the oil of
   Grace will stop, but not till then! No, according to what I have said,
   it will not stop then, but it will go on flowing and flowing, and
   flowing and flowing, world without end, "according to His riches in
   glory by Christ Jesus." The Lord will give enough, enough for all time,
   enough of all, enough for all, and more than enough!

   There shall be no real need of any Believer but what the Lord will fill
   it full and exceed it. It is a wonderful expression "filled with all
   the fullness of God." It pictures our being in God and God in us. One
   has illustrated it by taking a bottle, holding it in the sea and
   getting it right full--there is the sea in the bottle! Now, throw it
   right into the waves and let it sink--and you have the sea in the
   bottle and the bottle in the sea! So God enters into us and, as we
   cannot hold more, He makes us come into Himself! Into the very fullness
   of Christ are we plunged! What more can the amplest imagination
   conceive, or the hungriest heart desire? Thus God will supply our
   needs. Well may you fill others, who are yourselves so filled by God!
   Well may you serve His cause with boundless generosity when the
   infinite liberality of God is thus ensured to you!

   IV. Lastly, let us notice BY WHAT MEANS THE LORD FILLS OUR NEEDS. It is
   "by Christ Jesus." Does God supply all His people's needs by Christ
   Jesus? Yes, first, by giving them Christ Jesus, for there is everything
   in Christ Jesus. Christ is all! The man who has Christ has all things,
   as says the Apostle, "All things are yours, for you are Christ's, and
   Christ is God's." You will never have a spiritual need which is not
   supplied in Christ. If you need courage, He can create it. If you need
   patience, He can teach it. If you need love, He can inspire it! You
   need washing, and there is the Fountain. You require a garment, and
   there is the robe of Righteousness. You would have great needs if you
   went to Heaven without Christ, but you shall not go there without Him!
   And even there He shall supply you with everything! He it is that
   prepares your mansion, provides your wedding dress, leads you to His
   Throne and bids you sit there with Him forever. God will supply your
   eternal needs by giving you Christ.

   Moreover, all things shall come to you by virtue of Christ's merit. You
   deserve no good thing, but He deserves it and He says, "Set it to My
   poor servant's account." You may use Christ's name at the Bank of
   Heaven freely, for though God might not give His favor to you, He will
   always give it to His dear, dying, risen, pleading Son! When Jesus'
   name is quoted, all things are yielded by the Father. God will give you
   all things by Christ--therefore do not go to anybody else after those
   things. If you have begun in the Spirit, do not attempt to be perfected
   by the flesh. If your only hope is in what Christ has done, stick to
   that and add nothing to it! Be this your motto--

   "None but Jesus! None but Jesus!"

   Jesus is our All-in-All! We are complete in Him! We need no addenda to
   the volume of His love. Christ, and Christ, alone, shall supply all
   your need--all your fresh springs are in Him. "It pleased the Father
   that in Him should all fullness dwell; and of His fullness we have all
   received, and Grace for Grace."

   Now, once more, I would to God that some poor soul here that has no
   faith--that has no good thing about him-- would, nevertheless, look
   over his house and see whether he has not an empty vessel somewhere.
   All that Christ wants of you, poor Sinner, is that you should be empty
   and come and let Him fill you with His Grace! Come along with you, just
   as you are! Bring no good works, no prayers, no anything--but come with
   all your sins, follies and failures which you may look upon as so many
   empty pots! Come to Jesus for everything. "But I have scarcely a sense
   of need," you say. Come to Him for that, too! You must be very needy to
   be in need of that. Come and get it from Him. I tell you, Soul, you do
   not need a half-farthing's worth of your own--for what you think you
   have will only keep you from Jesus!

   Come in all your poverty--a beggar, a king of beggars! Come and be made
   rich by Jesus! You that have not a rag to cover your sin with--you that
   are only fit to be put into the devil's dust bin and thrown away as
   worthless--come along with you! My Lord Jesus is ready to receive those
   that Satan, himself, flings away! If you are such that you cannot find
   anything in yourself that is desirable and even your old companions,
   who once cheered you on, now think you too mean for them--yet come into
   my Master's company--for, "this Man receives sinners." Come with your
   beggary and bank-ruptcy--you cannot dig, but to beg be not ashamed,
   for, "My God will supply all your need according to His riches in glory
   by Christ Jesus."

   As for you that have not trusted my Lord and boast that you can do very
   well without Him, I suppose I must leave you to fight your own way. You
   declare that you will carry on your own business and will not be
   dependent upon God,

   nor fall into any fanatical ideas, as you are pleased to call them. But
   we shall see. Already we see that the youths faint and are wearied and
   the young men utterly fall. We see that the young lions lack and suffer
   hunger and, also, that the best-laid plans of wisest men go oft awry.
   And they that have felt assured that they could fight their own
   way--even they have come to terrible failure. We shall see how you
   fare. They that mount up with wings as eagles and are proud and
   vainglorious--even these go down to destruction so that no flesh has
   reason to glory.

   As for me, let me wait upon the Lord God and live by faith in Him. Is
   it not better to drink of life out of the deep, inexhaustible fullness
   of God than to go forever pumping and pumping at your own shallow
   cisterns which hold water? Self-reliance may be well enough, but
   God-reliance eclipses it as the sun outshines the stars! "Oh, rest in
   the Lord, and wait patiently for Him." "Trust in the Lord, and do good;
   so shall you dwell in the land, and verily you shall be fed." "He shall
   cover you with His feathers, and under His wings shall you trust: His
   truth shall be your shield and buckler." There is a God and those who
   love Him and trust Him and serve Him know that He is a good Master. Job
   was slandered by the devil when he came and said, "Does Job serve God
   for nothing?" He insinuated that Job made a good thing out of his
   religion and was moved by selfish motives.

   It was a great lie and yet, in a certain sense, it is true. If anybody
   says the same of you, admit that it is true. Acknowledge that you do
   make a fine thing out of your religion. God will not let you serve Him
   for nothing--you shall never have to ask the question--"What profit is
   there if we serve God?" You shall have His peace, His love, His joy,
   His supplies according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus! You
   shall know that in keeping His Commandments there is great reward!
   Believer, you shall have everything through Christ and nothing without
   Him! He that trusts not the Savior and prays not to Him, shall be like
   Gideon's fleece--when all around it was wet the fleece was dry! But the
   man who trusts God and blesses His name shall be like Gideon's
   fleece--when all around was dry it was full of moisture!

   God will not hear a man's prayers except through Christ Jesus! But if
   that name is mentioned, the gates of Heaven fly open! God withholds no
   real good from the man of God who is in Christ. But our plea must be
   Jesus, first, and Jesus last, and Jesus in between! We must present the
   bleeding Lamb before God each morning and each night. I pray you seek
   no mercy of God apart from Christ, but lay hold upon God in Christ--and
   you shall have enough for all your need! May God the Holy Spirit cause
   you to abide in Christ Jesus for His name's sake. Amen.

Other Sheep and One Flock

   (No. 1713)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 25, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And other sheep I ha ve which are not of this fold; them also I must
   bring, and they shall hear My voice and they shall be one fold and one
   shepherd (or more correctly one flock; one shepherd)." John 10:16.

   THIS verse is guarded before and behind by two notable statements.
   Before it we hear the Master say, "I lay down My life for the sheep,"
   and immediately after it we meet with another grand sentence, "I lay
   down My life, that I might take it again." The first statement, "I lay
   down My life for the sheep" is the sheet anchor of our confidence when
   storms assail the vessel of the Church. The Lord Jesus has, by His
   death, proved His love to His people and His determination to save them
   is made clear by His laying down His life for them. Therefore doubt and
   fear should be banished and the very name of despair should be unknown
   among the Israel of God! Now are we sure of the love of the Son of God
   to His chosen flock, for we have an Infallible proof of it in the
   laying down of His life for them.

   Now, also, are we absolutely certain that Christ's purpose is
   perpetual--it cannot alter. The Lord Jesus has committed Himself to
   that purpose beyond recall, for the price is paid and the deed is done
   by which the purpose is to be effected. Beyond this we are hereby
   assured beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Divine purpose will be
   carried out, for it cannot be that Christ should die in vain. We think
   it a kind of blasphemy to suppose that His blood should be spilt for
   nothing. Whatever was proposed to be accomplished by the laying down of
   the life of the Son of God, we feel absolutely certain that it will be
   fully performed in the teeth of all adversaries, for we are not, now,
   speaking of man's design, but of the purpose of God to which He devoted
   the heart's blood of His only-begotten Son!

   We both patiently hope and quietly wait to see the salvation of God and
   the performance of all His designs of love, for that death upon the
   Cross is a cause which will surely produce its effect. Christ did not
   die at a gamble. The supposition of a Savior disappointed in the
   results of His blood-shedding is not to be tolerated for a moment! In
   darkest times that glorious Cross flames with light! No evil event can
   prevent its efficacy. Still in that sign we conquer! If Jesus has laid
   down His life for the sheep, then all is well. Rest assured of the
   Father's love to those sheep! Rest assured of the immutability of the
   Divine purpose concerning them and rest assured of its ultimate
   achievement! It must not, shall not be that God's own Son shall lay
   down His life in vain! Though Heaven and earth should pass away, the
   precious heart's blood of the Son of God shall accomplish the end for
   which it was so freely poured forth. Jesus says, "I lay down My life
   for the sheep," therefore the sheep must live who have been redeemed at
   such a price as this and the Shepherd in them shall see of the travail
   of His soul and shall be satisfied!

   So far we are cheered by the vanguard which marches in advance of our
   text. But as if the poor, timid people of God would, nevertheless, at
   times fancy that the purpose of Christ would not be achieved, behold,
   in the rear another sentence, "I lay down My life that I might take it
   again." He that died and so redeemed His people by price, lives that He
   may, Himself, personally see that they are also redeemed by power! If a
   man dies to achieve a purpose, you feel sure that his very soul must
   have been in it. But if that man should rise again from the dead and
   still pursue his purpose, you would see how resolutely he was set on
   his design. If he rose with greater power, clothed with higher rank and
   elevated to a more eminent position--and if he still pursued his great
   objective, you would, then, be more than certain of his never-ending
   determination to perform his design.

   In the risen life of Jesus, assurance is made doubly sure--now are we
   sure that His design must be carried out, nothing can hinder it! We
   dare not dream that the Son of God can be disappointed of the objective
   for which He died and for which He lives again! If Jesus died for a
   purpose, He will accomplish it. If Jesus rose for a purpose, He will
   accomplish it. If Jesus lives forever for a purpose, He will accomplish
   it. To me this conclusion seems to be past question--and if it is
   so--it puts the destiny of the sheep beyond all hazard. Did not Paul
   argue much in the same way when he said, "For if,

   when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His
   Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life"?

   If any of you have been cast down by reason of present difficulties,
   let these two grand texts sound their silver trumpets in your ears! If
   you have been looking forth from the windows and the outlook has seemed
   to be exceedingly dark, take courage, I pray you, from what your Lord
   has done! His death and Resurrection are prophetic of good things to
   come! You dare not think that Christ will miss the objective of His
   death--you dare not think that He will miss the purpose of His
   glory-life! Why, then, are you cast down? His will shall be done on
   earth as it is in Heaven, as surely as He came from Heaven to earth and
   has returned from earth to Heaven! His purpose shall be carried out as
   surely as He died and lives again!

   Is not this the secret reason why, when the Lord appeared to His
   sorrowing servant John, He said to him, "I am He that lives and was
   dead and am alive forevermore, amen, and have the keys of death and of
   Hell"? Is not the dying and then living Shepherd the safety and the
   glory of the flock? Well, then, comfort one another with these words of
   your Lord, "I lay down My life for the sheep." "I lay down My life,
   that I might take it again."

   I. There are four things in the text, itself, which deserve your
   attention, for they are full of consolation to minds troubled by the
   evil of those perilous times. The first is this--OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
   HAD A PEOPLE UNDER THE WORST CIRCUMSTANCES. When He speaks of "other
   sheep," it is implied that He had certain sheep at the time. And when
   He says, "other sheep have I which are not of this fold," it is
   manifest that even then, the Good Shepherd had a fold! The times were
   grievously dark and evil, but a few true hearts clustered about the
   Savior and, by His Divine power, were protected as in a "fold."

   It has been supposed that our Lord, here, alludes to the Jews as, "this
   fold," but the Jews, as such, were never Christ's fold. He could not
   have meant to call the Jews around Him, His fold, for a little farther
   on He exclaims, "You believe not because you are not of My sheep, as I
   said unto you." His fold was that little handful of disciples whom, by
   His personal ministry, He had gathered, and who stood folded, as it
   were, about their Good Shepherd. They might be sneered at as a little
   company, but He says to His enemies who are standing outside the fold
   foaming with wrath, "Other sheep I have that are not of this little
   fold: these you cannot see, but I have them, none the less, for that
   these, I must, in due time, lead, and then there shall be one flock and
   one Shepherd." See, then, that the Lord Jesus had a people in the worst
   times!

   Doubtless these days are exceedingly dangerous and I have certain
   Brethren round me who never allow me to forget it, for they play well
   in the minor key and dwell most judiciously upon the necessary topic of
   the general declension of the Church and the growing depravity of the
   world! I would not stop them from their faithful warnings, although I
   can assure them that, with slight variations, I have heard the same
   tune for years! Many a time have they afflicted me, from my youth up,
   and it has been good for me. I remember hearing some 30 years ago that
   we lived in awful times and, as nearly as I can recollect, the times
   have been awful ever since and I suppose they always will be! The
   watchmen of the night see everything except the coming of the morning.
   Our pilots perceive dangers ahead and steer with caution. Perhaps this
   is as it should be. At any rate, it is better than sleeping in a fool's
   paradise!

   Be this as it may, it is clear that the days of our Lord Jesus Christ
   were emphatically terrible times. No age can be worse than that age
   which literally crucified the Son of God, crying, "Away with Him! Away
   with Him!" Whether the present days are better than those, I will not
   determine, but they cannot be worse. The day of our Lord's first advent
   was the culmination and the crisis of the world's career of sin--and
   yet the Good Shepherd had a fold among men in the midnight of history!
   There was a sad lack of vital godliness in those days. A few godly ones
   watched for the coming of the Messiah, but they were very few, such as
   good old Simeon and Anna. A small remnant sighed and cried for the
   abounding sin of the nation, but the salt was almost gone. Israel was
   becoming like Sodom and Gomorrah!

   The choice band of mourners in Zion had not quite died out, but their
   number was so few that a child might write the number down. Speaking
   generally, when the Savior came to His own, His own received Him not.
   The mass of professing people in that day was rotten throughout! The
   life of God was gone--it could not dwell with the Pharisees nor the
   Sadducees, nor any of the sects of the times, for they were altogether
   gone out of the way. The Lord looked and there was no man to help or to
   uphold His righteous cause--those who professed to be its champions had
   altogether become un-

   profitable. As for the religious teachers, their mouth had become an
   open sepulcher and the poison of asps was under their tongues. And yet
   the Lord had a people in Judea even then!

   On earth there was still a fold for sheep whom He had chosen who knew
   the Shepherd's voice and gathered to His call and followed Him
   faithfully. But it was a time when will-worship abounded. Men had given
   up worshipping God according to the Scriptures. They worshipped
   according to their own fancies. Then you might hear a trumpet at every
   corner of the street, for Pharisees were distributing their alms! You
   could see fathers and mothers neglected, families broken up because the
   scribes had taught the people that if they said, "Corban," they were
   free from all obligation to help father or mother. They taught for
   doctrines, the commandments of men--the Commandments of God were laid
   aside. To wear broad-bordered garments and phylacteries was exalted
   into a matter of first importance, while to lie and cheat were mere
   trifles. To eat with unwashed hands was thought to be a crime, but to
   devour widow's houses was a thing which, to the most self-righteous
   Pharisee, caused no qualm of conscience. The land was filled with
   will-worship and that is one great and growing hindrance nowadays! But
   for all that, Christ had a fold of His own and there were those who
   knew His voice--and these, following at His heels--were enabled to go
   in and out and find pasture.

   It was a day when there was the most fierce opposition to the real
   Truths of God. Our Lord Jesus could hardly open His mouth but they took
   up stones to stone Him! It was said that He had a devil and was mad;
   that He was a "gluttonous Man and a winebibber, the friend of publicans
   and sinners." The rage of men against Christ was, then, boiling at its
   greatest heat, till at last they took Him and nailed Him to the Cross
   because they could not endure that He should live among them. And yet
   He had His own in those dreadful times! Even then He had His chosen
   company for whom He laid down His life, of whom He said to the Father,
   "Yours they were and You gave them to Me; and they have kept Your
   Word." To those He spoke, saying, "You are they that have continued
   with Me in My temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as My
   Father has appointed unto Me."

   Why, Beloved, I gather that though, at this time, there is a sad
   decline in vital godliness, and though will-worship sweeps over the
   land with its tumultuous waves; and though opposition to the pure Truth
   of Christ is more fierce than ever; nevertheless, even at this present
   time, there is a remnant according to the election of Grace! Even today
   the answer of God to the complaining Prophet is, "Yet have I left Me
   seven thousand in Israel, all the knees of which have not bowed unto
   Baal." Why, my Brothers and Sisters, in confidence you possess your
   souls!

   Now, it is to be noticed that this little company of Christ's people He
   calls a "fold." Afterwards they were to be a "flock," but while His
   bodily Presence was with them, they were pre-eminently a "fold." They
   were few in number, all of one race, mostly in one place and so compact
   that they could fitly be said to be a fold. One glance of the
   Shepherd's bodily eyes saw them all. Happily, also, they were so
   thoroughly distinct from the rest of the world that they were eminently
   and evidently folded. Our Lord said of them, "You are not of the world,
   even as I am not of the world." He had shut them in to Himself and shut
   the world out. Within this blessed seclusion they were perfectly safe,
   so that their Lord said to the Father, "While I was with them in the
   world, I kept them in Your name: those that You gave Me, I have kept
   and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture
   might be fulfilled."

   Whatever their mistakes and faults, and they were many, yet they did
   not conform themselves to the generation among which they dwelt--they
   were kept apart as in a fold while Jesus was with them. In that fold
   they were protected from all ill weathers, from the wolf and the thief.
   The Lord's Presence with them was like a wall of fire round about
   them--they had only to run to Him and He answered all their adversaries
   and defended them from reproach. Like another David, the Lord Jesus
   guarded His flock from all the ravenous lions that sought to devour
   them. True, even in that little fold there were goats, for He, Himself,
   said, "I have chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil." Even then,
   they were not absolutely pure, but they were wonderfully so--and they
   were marvelously separated from the world, preserved from false
   doctrine and kept from dividing and scattering.

   Within that fold they were being strengthened for the future following
   of their great Shepherd. They were learning a thousand things which
   would be useful to them when, afterwards, He sent them forth as lambs
   among wolves, so that they would be "wise as serpents and harmless as
   doves" because of what they had learned of their Lord. Thus you see
   that in the worst times the Lord had a Church! I might almost say the
   best Church! May I not call it so? For that Apostolic Church, upon
   which the Holy Spirit descended, was not a whit behind the Church of
   any era that succeeded it! It was the

   choice flock of all the flocks of the ages, even that feeble company of
   which Jesus said, "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good
   pleasure to give you the kingdom."

   Yet you see one thing is not able here, that when Jesus had thus shut
   them all in, He would not allow them to become exclusive and glide into
   a state of selfish satisfaction. No, He opens wide the door of the
   sheepfold and cries to them, "Other sheep I have." Thus He checks a
   tendency so common in the Church to be forgetful of those outside the
   fold and to make one's own personal salvation the sum and substance of
   religion! I do not think it wrong to sing--

   "We are a garden walled around,

   Chosen and made peculiar ground.

   A little spot, enclosed by Grace

   Out of the world's wide wilderness." On the contrary, I judge that the
   verse is true and sweet, and ought to be sung. But then there are other
   truths besides this one. To us, also, the Shepherd opens the door of
   the enclosed garden and says, "The wilderness and the solitary place
   shall be glad for them, and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the
   rose." The fold is our abode, but it is not our sole sphere of action,
   for we are to go forth from it into all the world seeking our Brothers
   and Sisters!

   Seeing that our Lord has other sheep which are not of this fold, and
   these are to be found by Him through His faithful people, let us awaken
   ourselves to the holy enterprise--

   "O, come, let us go and find them!

   In the paths of death they roam.

   At the close of the day

   It will be sweet to say,

   'I have brought some lost one home.'" Beloved, I shall leave this point
   when I have said to you--never despair! The Lord of Hosts is with His
   people! They may be few and poor, but they are Christ's and that makes
   them precious. A common sheepfold is not a thing of glory and
   beauty--four rough walls compose it and it is but a hovel for
   sheep--even so, the Church may appear mean and base in men's eyes, but
   then it is the sheepfold of our Shepherd-King and the sheep belong to
   the Lord God Almighty! There is a glory about this which angels do not
   fail to see! Here is human weakness and also Divine power!

   We do not, I fear, estimate the strength of the Church aright. I read
   of three Brothers who had to carry on a college when funds were running
   short. One of them complained that they had no helpers and could not
   hope to succeed. But another, who had more faith, said to his Brother,
   "Do you ask what we can do? Do you say that we are so few? I do not see
   that we are few, for we are a thousand at the least." "A thousand of
   us," said the other, "how is that?" "Why," replied the first, "I am a
   cipher, you are a cipher and our Brother is a cipher--so we have three
   nothings to begin with. Then I am sure the Lord Jesus is ONE--put Him
   down before the three ciphers and we have a thousand, directly." Was
   not this bravely spoken? What power we have when we do but set the
   great ONE in the front!

   You are nothing, Brother. You are nothing, Sister. I am nothing--we are
   all nothing when we are put together without our Lord! But, oh, if He
   stands in front of us, then we are thousands! And again, it is true on
   earth as in Heaven-- the chariots of the Lord are 20,000, even
   thousands of messengers--the Lord is among them as in the Holy Place.
   Why, my Friends, be not cast down at any time, but say to
   yourselves--We are not even, now, come to so dark a night as once fell
   on this world. We are not, at this painful moment, in such a desperate
   condition as the Church of Christ was in His own day!

   And if the Lord is spiritually in the midst of us, we need not fear
   though the earth is removed and the mountains are carried into the
   midst of the sea, for there is a city which abides forever, and there
   is a river, the streams of which shall, forever, make her glad! God is
   in the midst of her and she shall not be moved! God shall help her and
   that right early. Why, my fellow Believers, be strong and of good
   courage!

   II. But now, secondly, it is clear, for the text teaches it in so many
   words, that OUR LORD HAS OTHER SHEEP NOT YET KNOWN TO US. He says,
   "Other sheep I have." I want you to notice that strong expression,
   "Other sheep I have"--not, "I shall have," but, "I have other sheep."
   Many of these sheep were not even in the thoughts of the Apostles. I do
   not think it had crossed the mind of Peter, James, or John that their
   Lord had any sheep in this poor savage island, then scarcely regarded
   as being within the borders of the earth. I do not suppose the
   Apostles, at that time, even dreamed that their Lord Jesus had sheep in
   Rome.

   No, their most liberal notion was that the Hebrew nation might be
   converted and the scattered of the seed of Abraham gathered together in
   one. Our Shepherd-King has greater thoughts than the most large-hearted
   of His servants. He delights to enlarge the area of our love. "Other
   sheep have I." You do not know them, but the Shepherd does. Unknown to
   ministers, unknown to the warmest-hearted Christians, there are many in
   the world whom Jesus claims for His own through the Covenant of Grace.
   Who are these? Well, these "other sheep" were, first, His chosen, for
   He has a people whom He has chosen out of the world and ordained unto
   eternal life. "You have not chosen Me," He said, "but I have chosen
   you"--there is a people upon whom His sovereignty has fixed its loving
   choice from before the foundation of the world! And of these elect
   ones, He says, "I have them."

   His election of them is the basis of His property in them. These are,
   also, those whom His Father gave Him, of whom He says in another place,
   "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me." And again, "Of those
   whom You have given Me I have lost none." His Father's eternal donation
   of them seals His title to them! These are the people for whom He
   peculiarly and especially laid down His life that they might be the
   redeemed of the Lord. "Christ loved His Church and gave Himself for
   it." These are they that are redeemed from among men, of whom we read,
   "You are not your own, you are bought with a price."

   The Lord Jesus laid down His life for His sheep--He tells us so,
   Himself, and none can question His own statement. These are those of
   whom Jesus says, "I have them." For these He entered into suretyship
   engagements, even as Jacob undertook the flock of Laban and watched day
   and night that he should not lose them. And if one had been lost, he
   would have had to make it good. These sheep represent a people for whom
   Christ has entered into suretyship engagements with His Father that He
   will deliver each one of them safely at the last day of account, not
   one of them being absent when the sheep shall pass, again, under the
   hand of Him that counts them as they will at the last great day. "Other
   sheep I have," says Christ. How wonderful that He should say, "I have
   them," though as yet they were far off by wicked works. What was their
   state? They were a people without shepherd, without fold, without
   pasture, lost on the mountains, wandering in the woods, lying down to
   die, ready to be devoured by the wolf--yet Jesus says, "Other sheep I
   have, which are not of this fold."

   They were sheep that had wandered exceedingly far, even into the most
   shameful iniquity--and yet He says, "I have them." Bad as this world
   is, today, it must have been far worse in the cruel Roman age as to
   open vices and unmentionable abominations. And yet these wanderers were
   the sheep of Christ and, in due time, they were delivered from their
   sins and fetched away from all the superstition, idolatry and
   filthiness into which they had wandered! They were Christ's even while
   they were afar off--He had chosen them, the Father had given them to
   Him, He had bought them--and He determined to have them. No, He says,
   "I have them"--and He calls them His own even while they are
   transgressing and running headlong to destruction!

   It seems to me that these were as well known to Christ as those that
   were in His fold. I think I see Him, the Divine Man, standing there
   confronting His adversaries. And when He has cast His glance upon His
   foes, I see His eyes going to and fro throughout the whole earth to
   gaze upon a sight far more pleasant to Him. While He speaks, His eyes
   flash with joyous fire as they light upon thousands out of every
   kindred and people and tongue! And as He quotes, to Himself, the words
   of the 22nd Psalm--"All the ends of the world shall remember and turn
   unto the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
   You. For the kingdom is the Lord's and He is the Governor among the
   nations. A seed shall serve Him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for
   a generation"--He spies out the myriads that are His and He rejoices
   before His scornful foes as He sees His growing kingdom which they are
   powerless to overthrow!

   Proud, self-righteous men may blindly refuse the leadership of the
   Lord's anointed Shepherd, but He shall not be without a flock to be His
   honor and reward! Did not the Lord, at that time, rejoice in His inmost
   heart and soliloquize within Himself thus--"Though Israel is not
   gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and My God
   shall be My strength"? This led Him to say, "Other sheep I have." In
   this there is great comfort for God's people who love the souls of
   their fellow men. The Lord has a people in London and He knows them. "I
   have much people in this city," was said to the Apostle when, as yet,
   nobody was converted there! "I have them," says Christ though as yet
   they had not sought Him.

   Our Lord Jesus has an elect redeemed people all over the world at this
   time, though as yet they are not called by Grace. I know not where they
   are, nor where they are not--but for certain He has them somewhere
   since it still stands

   true--"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold." This is a part
   of our authority for going out to find the lost sheep, for we, Brothers
   and Sisters, have a right to go anywhere to enquire about our Master's
   sheep. I have no business to go hunting after other people's sheep. But
   if they are my Master's sheep, who shall stop me over hill or dale
   enquiring, "Have you seen my Master's sheep?" If any say, "You intrude
   in this land," let the answer be, "We are after our Master's sheep
   which have strayed here! Excuse our pushing further than politeness
   might allow, but we are in haste to find a lost sheep."

   This is your excuse for going into a house where you are not wanted, to
   try and leave your tracts and speak a word for Christ! Say, "I think my
   Master has one of His sheep here and I have come after it." You have
   received a search-warrant from the King of Kings and, therefore, you
   have a right to enter and search after your Lord's stolen property! If
   men belonged to the devil, we would not rob the enemy, himself, but
   they do not belong to him! He neither made them nor bought them and,
   therefore, we seize them in the King's name whenever we can lay hands
   on them. I doubt not but what there are some here, this morning, who
   neither know nor love the Savior as yet, who, nevertheless, belong to
   the Redeemer--and He will yet bring them to Himself and to His flock.
   Therefore it is that we preach with confidence!

   I do not come into this pulpit hoping that, perhaps, somebody will, of
   His own free will, return to Christ--that may be so or not--but my hope
   lies in another quarter. I hope that my Master will lay hold of some of
   them and say, "You are Mine and you shall be Mine. I claim you for
   Myself." My hope arises from the freeness of Grace--not from the
   freedom of the will! A poor haul of fish will any Gospel fisherman make
   if he takes none but those who are eager to leap into the net! Oh, for
   an hour of Jesus among this crowd! Oh, for five minutes of the great
   Shepherd's handiwork! When the good Shepherd overtakes His lost sheep,
   He has not much to say to it.

   According to the parable, He says nothing. But He lays hold of it, lays
   it on His shoulders and carries it home--and that is what I want the
   Lord to do, this morning, with some of you whose will is all the other
   way, whose wishes and desires are all contrary to Him. I want Him to
   come with sacred violence and mighty love to restore you to your Father
   and your God! Not that you will be saved against your will, but your
   consent will be sweetly gained. Oh, that the Lord Jesus would take you
   in hand and never let you go again! May He sweetly say to you, "Yes, I
   have loved you with an everlasting love, therefore with lovingkindness
   have I drawn you."

   III. Our third head contains in it much delight. Our LORD MUST BRING OR
   LEAD THOSE OTHER SHEEP.

   "Them also I must bring"--read it, and it will be more accurate--"them
   also I must lead." Christ must be at the head of these other sheep and
   they must follow His lead--"them also I must lead, and they shall hear
   My voice," Those who belong to Christ, secretly, must be openly led to
   follow Him. First, it is Christ that has to do it, even as He has done
   it up to now. The text says, "Them also I must bring," and this
   language implies that those who have already come, He has brought. All
   that were in the fold, Christ had brought there--and all that are to be
   in the fold--He must lead there.

   All of us who are saved have been saved by the mighty power of God in
   Christ Jesus. Is it not so? Is there anyone among us that came to Jesus
   without Jesus first coming to Him? Surely, no! Without exception, we
   all admit that it was His love that sought us out and brought us to be
   the sheep of His pasture. Now, as the Lord Jesus has done this for us,
   He must do it for others, for they will never come unless He fetches
   them. Here comes in that emphatic, imperious, "must." The proverb is
   that, "must," is for the king--and the king may say, "must," to all of
   us. But did you ever hear of a "must" that bound the king, himself, and
   constrained him?

   Kings generally do not care to have it said to them, you "must," but
   there is a King, the likes of which King there never was nor shall be
   for glory and for dominion--and yet He is bound by a "must"--the Prince
   Immanuel says, "Them also I must bring." Whenever Jesus says, "must,"
   something comes of it! Who can resist the Omnipotent "must"? Clear out,
   devils! Clear out, wicked men! Flee, darkness! Die, O death! If Jesus
   says, "must," we know what is going to happen--difficulties vanish,
   impossibilities are achieved! Glory, glory, the Lord shall get the
   victory! Jesus says of His chosen, His redeemed, His espoused, His
   covenanted ones, "Them also I must bring" and, therefore, it must be
   done!

   Furthermore, He tells us how He must do it. He says, "They shall hear
   My voice." So that our Lord is going to save people, still, by the
   Gospel! I do not look for any other means of converting men beyond the
   simple preaching of the Gospel and the opening of men's ears to hear
   it--"They shall hear My voice." The old methods are to be followed to
   the end of the chapter. Our standing orders are--"Go you into all the
   world and preach the Gospel to every creature." We are not commissioned
   to do anything else but continue to preach the Gospel, the same Gospel
   which saved us and which was

   delivered to us at the beginning! We know of no alterations,
   enlargements, or amendments to the Gospel! We obey and follow one
   Voice, not many voices. One Gospel of salvation is to be proclaimed
   everywhere! And no other work is in our commission.

   Then it is added, "They shall hear My voice." It is promised that they
   shall first lend an attentive ear and then that they shall yield a
   willing heart to the voice of Divine love and follow Jesus where He
   leads! "What then?" Asks one. "Suppose I speak in Christ's name and
   they will not hear?" "Do not suppose what cannot be! The Scripture says
   of the chosen sheep--"they shall hear My voice." The rest remain in
   their blindness, but the redeemed will hear and see! Do not again say,
   "Suppose they will not!" You must not suppose anything that is contrary
   to what Jesus promises when He says, "They shall hear My voice." The
   graceless may stop up their ears if they will--and perish with Christ's
   voice as a witness against them--but His own redeemed shall hear the
   heavenly voice and obey it! There is no resisting this Divine
   necessity! Jesus says--"I must bring them, and they shall hear My
   voice."

   It was with this that Paul turned to the Gentiles and said to the Jews,
   "Be it known, therefore, unto you, that the salvation of God is sent
   unto the Gentiles and that they will hear it." He had no fear about the
   reception the Word of God would meet with--neither ought we to
   entertain any, since Christ has a people who must be led--and shall
   hear the voice of the Bishop and Shepherd of souls! We have heard it
   said that, "If Christ must have His people, what is the good of
   preaching?" What would be the good of preaching if it were otherwise?
   Why, dear Sir, this fact is one great reason why we preach! That which
   you suppose to be a motive for inaction is the strongest motive for
   energetic action! Because the Lord has a people that must be saved, we
   feel an imperious necessity laid upon us to join with Him in bringing
   this people to Himself. They must come and we must fetch them!
   Christian Brothers, do you not feel that you must help in compelling
   them to come to the wedding feast? Is it not laid upon you that you
   must go after lost souls, that you must speak to them, seeing that you
   must have a hand in bringing these blood-bought ones to Christ by His
   Holy Spirit?

   And again, are there not some in this place who feel a necessity laid
   upon them, also, that they must come? Do I not hear some of you saying,
   "I have stood out a long while, but I must come. I have resisted Divine
   Grace long enough. And now Christ has laid His hands on me--I must
   come"? How I wish that a heavenly, "must," a blessed necessity of
   Omnipotent decree may overshadow you and bear you as a sheep to the
   fold! Oh that you may now yield yourselves unto God because the love of
   Christ constrains you! Submit yourselves unto God! Acknowledge the
   supreme authority of His Grace which shall lead every thought into
   captivity, that from this day on Christ may reign in your hearts and
   put every enemy under His feet!

   He says, "Him that comes to Me I will in nowise cast out." "I will
   trust Him," says one. "I feel I must." Just so and that trust is a mark
   of your election of God, for, "He that believes in Him has everlasting
   life." "Whom He did predestinate, them He also called." If He is
   calling you, it is because He did predestinate you--and you may rest
   quite sure of it--and yield to Him with holy joy and delight! As for
   me, I feel so happy in preaching the Gospel because I am not fishing
   with a, "chance," or a, "perhaps," that some may come. The Lord knows
   them that are His and they will come! Every congregation is, in this
   sense, a picked assembly.

   I felt, this morning, when I came here, that there were so many Friends
   out in the country for the holidays that we should very likely have a
   thin house. I rejoice that I was altogether wrong in my reckoning, but
   even then I thought, God has a people that He will bring whom He means
   to bless. Here they are! And now, while standing here, I know that
   God's Word "shall not return to Him void, but it shall accomplish that
   which He pleases, and shall prosper in the thing to which He has sent
   it."

   IV. But now, lastly, OUR LORD GUARANTEES THE UNITY OF HIS CHURCH. "Them
   also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice and there shall be one
   fold and one shepherd." We hear a great deal about the unity of the
   Church and notions upon this subject are rather wild. We are to have
   the Roman and the Greek and the Anglican Church all joined together in
   one--if they were so, the result would not be worth two-pence--and much
   evil would come of it! God has, I doubt not, a chosen people among all
   these three great corporations, but the union of such questionable
   organizations would be a dire omen of mischief to the world!

   The dark ages and a worse Popedom than ever would soon be upon us! The
   more those three quarrel with each other, the better for truth and
   righteousness! I should like to see the Anglican Church standing at
   drawn daggers with the Ro-man--and coming into a more and more open
   opposition to its superstitions. I would to God that the national
   Church

   would, in all things, be delivered from the Pope of Rome and his
   Anti-Christian enormities! Truly, this has been carried out as a matter
   of fact--there never was but one Shepherd of the sheep yet--even Christ
   Jesus! And there never was but one flock of God yet, and there never
   will be! There is one spiritual Church of God--there never were two!
   All the visible Churches, up and down the world contain within
   themselves parts of the one Church of Jesus Christ, but there were
   never two bodies of Christ and there cannot be!

   There is one Church and there is one Head of the Church! The motto of
   Christianity is--one flock and one Shepherd. As a matter of experience
   this is carried out in Believers. I do not care who the man is, if he
   is a truly spiritually-minded man, he is one with all other
   spiritually-minded men. Those people in any visible Church who have no
   Grace are usually the greatest sticklers for every point of difference
   and every particle of rite and form. Nominal professors are soon at
   war. Quickened Believers follow after peace! Of course, when a man has
   nothing else but the outside, he fights for it tooth and nail. But a
   man who loves the Lord and lives near Him, perceives the inner life in
   others and has fellowship with them! That inner life is one in all the
   quickened family and compels them to be one in heart.

   Set two Brothers at prayer, the one a Calvinist and the other an
   Arminian, and they pray alike! Get a real work of the Spirit in a
   district and see how Baptists and Paedo-Baptists pull together! Tell of
   your inward experience and speak of the Spirit's work in the soul, and
   see how we are all moved thereby! Here is a Brother, a member of the
   Society of Friends, and he likes silent worship. And here is another
   who enjoys hearty singing! But when they get near to God, they do not
   quarrel over this, but agree to differ--the one says, "The Lord be with
   you in your holy silence"--and the other prays that the Lord may accept
   his brother's Psalm. All who are one with Christ have a certain family
   feeling, a higher form of clannishness and they cannot shake it off.

   I have found myself reading a gracious book which has drawn me near to
   God. And though I have known that it was written by a man with whose
   opinions I had little agreement, I have not, therefore, refused to be
   edified by him in points which are unquestionably revealed. No, but I
   have blessed the Lord that, within all his blunders, he knew so much of
   the precious, vital Truth of God and lived so near his Lord! What
   Protestant can refuse to love the holy Bernard? Was there ever a more
   consecrated servant of God or a dearer lover of Christ than he? Yet he
   was most sorrowfully in bondage to the superstitions of his age and of
   the Roman Church! Are you not all one with him who sang--

   "Jesus, the very thought of Thee With sweetness fills my breast But
   sweeter, far, Your face to see, And in Your Presence rest"?

   The external Church is necessary, but it is not the one and indivisible
   Church of Christ. Jesus, as the Life, binds His Church together, and
   that Life flows through all the regenerate, even as the blood flows
   through all the veins of the body. Drop the external and look by faith
   into the spiritual realm, and you will see one flock and one Shepherd.
   The practical lesson is, let us belong to that one flock! How are they
   known? Answer--they are a hearing flock--they hear the Lord and follow
   His lead. Be you one of those who listen to Christ's voice--and to none
   besides. Keep to the one Shepherd! How do you know Him? It is Jesus--in
   His feet and hands are nail-prints--and His side bears the scar. He it
   is who leads the one only flock!

   Follow Jesus and you are right. Follow Him everywhere and you are
   happy. The best way to promote the unity of the Church is for all the
   sheep to follow the Shepherd. If they all follow the Shepherd, they
   will all keep together. Let us go forth and try and do that--and let us
   long for that happy day when all disputed points shall be settled by
   all obeying the Lord. Compromises would only mean an agreement to
   disobey the Lord! Let no man yield a principle under pretense of
   charity--it is not charity to call any Truth of God a lie! We must
   follow Jesus fully and we shall come together. First pure, then
   peaceable, is the rule.

   Oh, when shall the triple banner again float over all--"One Lord, one
   Faith, one Baptism!"? Oh God, the Holy Spirit, forgive us our errors
   and bring us to Your Truth! Oh God, the Son, forgive us our need of
   holiness and renew us in Your own image! Oh God the Father, forgive us
   our lack of love and melt us into one family! To the one God be glory
   in the one Church forever and ever! Amen.

                             Earnest Expostulation

   A Sermon

   (No. 1714)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, April 1st, 1883, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and
   longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
   repentance?"--Romans 2:4.

   The apostle is intensely personal in his address. This verse is not
   spoken to us all in the mass, but to some one in particular. The
   apostle fixes his eyes upon a single person, and speaks to him as
   "Thee" and "Thou." "Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and
   forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God
   leadeth thee to repentance?" It should ever be the intent of the
   preacher to convey his message to each hearer in his own separate
   individuality. It is always a very happy sign when a man begins to
   think of himself as an individual, and when the expostulations and
   invitations of the gospel are seen by him to be directed to himself
   personally. I will give nothing for that indirect, essay-like preaching
   which is as the sheet lightning of summer, dazzling for the moment, and
   flaming over a broad expanse, but altogether harmless, since no bolt is
   launched from it, and its ineffectual fires leave no trace behind. I
   will give nothing for that kind of hearing which consists in the word
   being heard by everybody in general, and by no one in particular. It is
   when the preacher can "Thee" and "Thou" his hearers that he is likely
   to do them good. When each man is made to say, "This is for me," then
   the power of God is present in the word. One personal, intentional
   touch of the hem of Christ's garment conveys more blessing than all the
   pressure of the crowd that thronged about the Master. The laying of his
   healing hand upon the individual who was suffering had more virtue in
   it than all those heavenly addresses which fell from his lips upon
   minds that did not receive the truth for themselves. I do pray that we
   may come to personal dealings with the Lord each one for himself, and
   that the Spirit of God may convince each man and each woman, according
   as the case may stand before the living God. O my hearer, thou art now
   to be lovingly spoken with: I speak not to You as unto many, but unto
   thee, as one by thyself.

   Observe that the apostle singled out an individual who had condemned
   others for transgressions, in which he himself indulged. This man owned
   so much spiritual light that he knew right from wrong, and he
   diligently used his knowledge to judge others, condemning them for
   their transgressions. As for himself, he preferred the shade, where no
   fierce light might beat on his own conscience and disturb his unholy
   peace. His judgment was spared the pain of dealing with his home
   offenses by being set to work upon the faults of others. He had a
   candle, but he did not place it on the table to light his own room; he
   held it out at the front door to inspect therewith his neighbours who
   passed by. Ho! my good friend, my sermon is for thee. Paul looks this
   man in the face and says, "Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man,
   whoever thou art, that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another thou
   condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things:" and
   then he pointedly says to him: "Thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest
   them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape
   the judgment of God?" Well did the apostle aim that piercing arrow; it
   hits the center of the target and strikes a folly common to mankind.
   The poet of the night-watches wrote,--

   All men think all men mortal but themselves.

   As truly might I say, "All men think all men guilty but themselves."
   The punishment which is due to sin the guilty reckon to be surely
   impending upon others, but they scarce believe that it can ever fall
   upon themselves. A personal doom for themselves is an idea which they
   will not harbour: if the dread thought should light upon them they
   shake it off as men shake snow-flakes from their cloaks. The thought of
   personal guilt, judgment, and condemnation is inconvenient; it breeds
   too much trouble within, and so they refuse it lodging. Vain men go
   maundering on their way, whispering of peace and safety; doting as if
   God had passed an act of amnesty and oblivion for them, and had made
   for them an exception to all the rules of justice, and all the manner
   of his courts. Do men indeed believe that they alone shall go
   unpunished? No man will subscribe to that notion when it is written
   down in black and white, and yet the mass of men live as if this were
   true; I mean the mass of men who have sufficient light to condemn sin
   in others. They start back from the fact of their own personal
   guiltiness and condemnation, and go on in their ungodliness as if there
   were no great white throne for them, no last assize, no judge, no word
   of condemnation, and no hell of wrath. Alas, poor madmen, thus to
   dream! O Spirit of Truth save them from this fatal infatuation.

   Sin is always on the downward grade, so that when a man proceeds a
   certain length he inevitably goes beyond it. The person addressed by
   the apostle first thought to escape judgment, and then he came to think
   lightly of the goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering of God. He
   thinks he shall escape in the future, and because of that he despises
   the present goodness and longsuffering of the Most High. Of course he
   does. If he does not believe in the terrors of the world to come for
   himself, he naturally reckons it to be a small thing to have been
   spared their immediate experience. Barren tree as he is, he does not
   believe that he will ever be cut down, and therefore he feels no
   gratitude to the dresser of the vineyard for pleading, "Let it alone
   yet another year, till I dig about it, and dung it." I wish, as God
   shall help me, to drive hard at the consciences of men upon this
   matter. I would be to you, my careless friend, what Jonah was to
   Nineveh: I would warn you, and bestir you to repentance. Oh that the
   Holy Ghost would make this sermon effectual for the arousing of every
   unsaved soul that shall hear or read it!

   I. First, let me speak this morning to thee, O unregenerate, impenitent
   man, concerning THE GOODNESS OF GOD WHICH THOU HAST EXPERIENCED. Thou
   hast known the goodness, and forbearance, and longsuffering of God.
   According to the text, "riches" of these have been spent upon
   unconverted, ungodly men, and upon thee as one of them. Let me speak
   with thee first, O man, and remind thee how favoured thou hast been of
   God by being made a partaker of "the riches of his goodness." In many
   cases this is true of temporal things. Men may be without the fear of
   God, and yet, for all that, God may be pleased to prosper their
   endeavours in business. They succeed almost beyond their expectation--I
   mean some of them; probably the description applies to thee. They rise
   from the lowest position, and accumulate about them the comforts and
   luxuries of life. Though they have no religion, they have wit, and
   prudence, and thrift, and so they compete with others, and God permits
   them to be winners in the race for wealth. Moreover, he allows them to
   enjoy good health, vigour of mind, and strength of constitution: they
   are happy in the wife of their youth, and their children are about
   them. Theirs is an envied lot. Death seems for awhile forbidden to
   knock at their door, even though he has been ravaging the
   neighbourhood; even sickness does not molest their household. They are
   not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued like other men.
   Abraham had to prepare a Machpelah, and David mourned over his sons;
   but these have had to make scant provision for family sepulchre; a
   hedge has in very deed been set about them and all that they have. I
   know that it is thus with many who do not love God, and have never
   yielded to the entreaties of his grace. They love not the hand which
   enriches them, they praise not the Lord who daily loadeth them with
   benefits. How is it that men can receive such kindness, and yield no
   return? O sirs, you are to-day blessed with all that need requires; but
   I pray you remember that you might have been in the depths of poverty.
   An illness would have lost you your situation; or a slight turn in
   trade would have left you bankrupt. You are well to-day; but you might
   have been tossing to and fro upon a bed of sickness; you might have
   been in the hospital, about to lose a limb. Shall not God be praised
   for health and freedom from pain? You might have been shut up in yonder
   asylum, in the agonies of madness. A thousand ills have been kept from
   you; you have been exceedingly favoured by the goodness of the Most
   High. Is it not so? And truly it is a wonderful thing that God should
   give his bread to those that lift up their heel against him, that he
   should cause his light to shine upon those who never perceive his
   goodness therein, that he should multiply his mercies upon ungodly men
   who only multiply their rebellions against him, and turn the gifts of
   his love into instruments of transgression.

   Furthermore, this goodness of God had not only come to you in a
   temporal form, O impenitent man, but it has also visited you in a
   spiritual manner. Myriads of our fellow men have never had an
   opportunity of knowing Christ. The missionary's foot has never trodden
   the cities wherein they dwell, and so they die in the dark. Multitudes
   are going downward, downward; but they do not know the upward road;
   their minds have never been enlightened by the teachings of God's word,
   and hence they sin with less grievousness of fault. You are placed in
   the very focus of Christian light, and yet you follow evil! Will you
   not think of this? Time was when a man would have to work for years to
   earn enough money to buy a Bible. There were times when he could not
   have earned one even with that toil; now the word of God lies upon your
   table, you have a copy of it in almost every room of your house; is not
   this a boon from God? This is the land of the open Bible, and the land
   of the preached word of God; in this you prove the riches of God's
   goodness. Do you despise this wealth of mercy? Possibly you have
   enjoyed the further privilege of sitting under a ministry which has
   been particularly plain and earnest; you have not had sermons preached
   before you, they have been preached at you: the minister has seized
   upon you and tugged at your conscience, as though he would force you to
   the Saviour. With cries and entreaties you have been invited to your
   heavenly Father, and yet you have not come. Is this a small thing?

   What is more, you have been favoured with a tender conscience. When you
   do wrong you know it, and smart for it. What mean those wakeful nights
   after you have yielded to a temptation? What means that miserable
   feeling of shame? that fever of unrest? You find it hard to stifle the
   inward monitor, and difficult to resist the Spirit of God. Your road to
   perdition is made peculiarly hard; do you mean to follow it at all
   costs, and go over hedge and ditch to hell?

   You have not only been aroused by conscience, but the good Spirit has
   striven with you, and have been almost persuaded to be a Christian.
   Such has been the blessed work of the Spirit upon your heart that you
   have at times been melted down, and ready to be moulded by grace. A
   strange softness has come over you, and if you had not gathered up all
   your evil strength, and if the devil had not helped you to resist, you
   had by this time dropped into the Saviour's arms. Oh, the riches of the
   goodness of God to have thus wooed you, and pressed his love upon you!
   You have scarcely had a stripe, or a frown, or an ill word from God;
   his ways have been all kindness, and gentleness, and longsuffering from
   the first day of your memory even until now. "Despisest thou the riches
   of his goodness?" O man, answer this, I implore thee.

   The apostle then dwells upon the riches of "forbearance." Forbearance
   comes in when men having offended, God withholds the punishment that is
   due to them; when men, having been invited to mercy, have refused it,
   and yet God continues to stretch out his hands, and invite them to come
   to him. Patient endurance of offenses and insults has been manifested
   by God to many of you, who now hear these words of warning. The Lord
   knows to whom I speak and may he make you, also, know that I am
   speaking to you, even to you. Some men have gone back to the very sin
   of which for awhile they repented; they have suffered for their folly,
   but have turned again to it with suicidal determination. They are
   desperately set on their own ruin and nothing can save them. The burnt
   child has run to the fire again; the singed moth has plunged again into
   the flame of the candle; who can pity such self-inflicted miseries?
   They are given over to perdition, for they will not be warned. They
   have returned to the haunt of vice, though they seemed to have been
   snatched from the deep ditch of its filthiness. They have wantonly and
   wilfully returned to their cups, though the poison of former draughts
   is yet burning in their veins. Yet, despite this folly, God shows
   forbearance towards them. They have grievously provoked him when they
   have done despite to his word, and have even turned to laughter the
   solemnities of his worship, against their own consciences, and to their
   own confusion: yet when his hand has been lifted up he has withdrawn it
   in mercy. See how God has always tempered his providence with kindness
   to them. He laid them low so that they were sore sick, but at the voice
   of their moaning he restored them. They trembled on the brink of death,
   yet he permitted them to recover strength; and now, despite their vows
   of amendment, here they are, callous and careless, unmindful of the
   mercy which gave them a reprieve.

   Did you ever think what is included in the riches of forbearance. There
   are quick tempered individuals who only need to be a little provoked,
   and hard words and blows come quick and furious: but, oh, the
   forbearance of God when he is provoked to his face by ungodly men! By
   men, I mean, who hear his word, and yet refuse it! They slight his
   love, and yet he perseveres in it. Justice lays its hand on the sword,
   but mercy holds it back in its scabbard. Well might each spared one
   say,--

   "O unexhausted Grace

   O Love unspeakable!

   I am not gone to my own place;

   I am not yet in hell!

   Earth doth not open yet,

   My soul to swallow up:

   And, hanging o'er the burning pit,

   I still am forced to hope."

   Our apostle adds to goodness and forbearance the riches of
   "longsuffering." We draw a distinction between forbearance and
   longsuffering. Forbearance has to do with the magnitude of sin;
   longsuffering with the multiplicity of it: forbearance has to do with
   present provocation; longsuffering relates to that provocation
   repeated, and continued for a length of time. Oh, how long doth God
   suffer the ill manners of men! Forty years long was he grieved with
   that generation whose carcasses fell in the wilderness. Has it come to
   forty years yet with you, dear hearer? Possibly it may have passed even
   that time, and a half-century of provocation may have gone into
   eternity to bear witness against you. What if I should even have to say
   that sixty and seventy years have continued to heap up the loads of
   their transgressions, until the Lord saith, "I am pressed down under
   your sins; as a cart that is full of sheaves I am pressed down under
   you." Yet for all that, here you are on praying ground and pleading
   terms with God; here you are where yet the Saviour reigns upon the
   throne of grace; here you are where mercy is to be had for the asking,
   where free grace and dying love ring out their charming bells of
   invitation to joy and peace! Oh, the riches of his goodness, and
   forbearance, and longsuffering. Three-fold is the claim: will you not
   regard it? Can you continue to despise it?

   I should like to set all this in a striking light if I could, and
   therefore I would remind you of who and what that God is who has
   exhibited this goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering to men.
   Remember how great he is. When men insult a great prince the offence is
   thought to be highly heinous. If anyone should openly insult our own
   beloved Queen, and continue to do so, all the nation would be clamorous
   to have the impertinence ended speedily. We cannot bear that a beloved
   ruler should be publicly insulted. And what think you of the sin which
   provokes God? which to his face defies him? and in his very courts
   resists him? Shall this always be forborne with? Is there not a limit
   to longsuffering? Goodness also adds another item to the provocation;
   for we naturally say, "Why should one so good be treated so cruelly?"
   If God were a tyrant, if he were unrighteous or unkind, it were not so
   much amiss that men stood out against him; but when his very name is
   love, and when he manifests the bowels of a Father towards his
   wandering children it is shameful that he should be so wantonly
   provoked. Those words of Jesus were extremely touching when he pointed
   to his miracles, and asked, "For which of these things do you stone
   me?" When I think of God I may well say--for which of his deeds do you
   provoke him? Every morning he draws the curtain and glads the earth
   with light, and gives you eyes to see it; he sends his rain upon the
   ground to bring forth bread for man, and he gives you life to eat
   thereof--is this a ground for revolting from him? Every single minute
   of our life is cheered with the tender kindness of God, and every spot
   is gladdened with his love. I wonder that the Lord does not sweep away
   the moral nuisance of a guilty race from off the face of earth. Man's
   sin must have been terribly offensive to God from day to day, and yet
   still he shows kindness, love, forbearance. This adds an excessive
   venom to man's disobedience. How can he grieve such goodness? How can
   divine goodness fail to resent such base ingratitude?

   Think also of God's knowledge; for he knows all the transgressions of
   men. "What the eye does not see the heart does not rue," is a truthful
   proverb; but every transgression is committed in the very presence of
   God, so that penitent David cried, "Against thee, thee only have I
   sinned, and done this evil in thy sight." Transgression is committed in
   the sight of God, from whose eyes nothing is hidden. Remember also,
   that the Lord never can forget; before his eyes all things stand out in
   clear light, not only the things of to-day, but all the transgressions
   of a life. Yet for all this he doth forbear. With evil reeking before
   his face, he is slow to anger, and waiteth that he may be gracious.

   All this while, remember, the Lord is great in power. Some are patient
   because they are powerless: they bear and forbear because they cannot
   well help themselves; but it is not so with God. Had he but willed it,
   you had been swept into hell; only a word from him and the impenitent
   had fallen in the wilderness, and their spirits would have passed into
   the realms of endless woe. In a moment the Lord could have eased him of
   his adversary; he could have stopped that flippant tongue, and closed
   that lustful eye in an instant. That wicked heart would have failed to
   beat if God had withdrawn his power, and that rebellious breath would
   have ceased also. Had it not been for longsuffering you unbelievers
   would long since have known what it is to fall into the hands of an
   angry God. Will you continue to grieve the God who so patiently bears
   with you?

   Be it never forgotten that sin is to God much more intolerable than it
   is to us. He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. Things which we
   call little sins are great and grievous evils to him: they do, as it
   were, touch the apple of his eye. "Oh, do not," he says, "do not this
   abominable thing that I hate!" His Spirit is grieved and vexed with
   every idle word and every sensual thought; and hence it is a wonder of
   wonders that a God so sensitive of sin, a God so able to avenge himself
   of his adversaries, a God who knows the abundance of human evil, and
   marks it all, should nevertheless exhibit riches of goodness and
   forbearance and longsuffering; yet this is what you, my ungodly hearer,
   have been experiencing many a long year. Here let us pause; and oh that
   each one who is still unsaved would sing most sincerely the words of
   Watts:--

   "Lord, we have long abused thy love,

   Too long indulged our sin,

   Our aching hearts e'en bleed to see

   What rebels we have been.

   "No more, ye lusts, shall ye command,

   No more will we obey;

   Stretch out, O God, thy conqu'ring hand,

   And drive thy foes away."

   II. Come with me, friend, and let me speak to thee of THE SIN OF WHICH
   THOU ART SUSPECTED. Hear me, unconverted sinner: the sin of which thou
   art suspected is this,--"Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and
   forbearance and longsuffering?" The Lord's goodness ought to be admired
   and to be adored, and dost thou despise it? His goodness ought to be
   wondered at and told as a marvel in the ears of others, and dost thou
   despise it? That I may rake thy conscience a little, lend me thine ear.

   Some despise God's goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, because
   they never even gave a thought to it. God has given you life to keep
   you in being, and he has indulged you with his kindness, but it has not
   yet occurred to you that this patience is at all remarkable or worthy
   of the smallest thanks. You have been a drunkard, have you? a swearer?
   a Sabbath-breaker? a lover of sinful pleasure? Perhaps not quite so;
   but still you have forgotten God altogether, and yet he has abounded in
   goodness to you: is not this a great wrong? The Lord saith, Hear, O
   heavens, and give ear, O earth: I have nourished and brought up
   children, and they have rebelled against me. The ox knoweth his owner,
   and the ass his master's crib: but these my creatures do not know, my
   favoured ones do not consider. Why, you have no such forbearance with
   others as God has had with you. You would not keep a dog if it never
   followed at your heel, but snarled at you: you would not even keep a
   potter's vessel if it held no water, and was of no service to you; you
   would break it in pieces, and throw it on the dunghill. As for
   yourself, you are fearfully and wonderfully made, both as to your body
   and as to your soul, and yet you have been of no service to your Maker,
   nor even thought of being of service to him. Still, he has spared you
   all these years, and it has never occurred to you that there has been
   any wonderful forbearance in it. Assuredly, O man, thou despisest the
   longsuffering of thy God.

   Others have, perhaps, thought of it, but have never seriously meditated
   thereon. When we offend a man, if we are right-minded, we not only note
   the fact with regret, but we sit down and weigh the matter, and seek to
   rectify it; for we would not be unjust to any person, and if we felt
   that we had been acting unfairly it would press upon our minds until we
   could make amends. But are there not some of you who have never given
   half an hour's consideration to your relation to your God? He has
   spared you all this while, and yet it has never occurred to you to
   enter into your chamber and sit down and consider your conduct towards
   him. It would seem to be too much trouble even to think of your
   Creator. His longsuffering leads you to repentance, but you have not
   repented; in fact, you have not thought it worth your while to consider
   the question at all: you have thought it far more important to enquire,
   "What shall I eat and what shall I drink?" Bread and broadcloth have
   shut out the thought of God. Ah me, you will stand at his judgment bar
   before long--and then? Perhaps ere this week is finished you may have
   to answer, not to me, but unto him that sits upon the throne; therefore
   I do implore you now, for the first time give this matter thought.
   Despise no longer the goodness and longsuffering of God.

   This longsuffering is despised, further, by those who have imagined
   that God does not take any great account of what they do. So long as
   they do not go into gross and open sin, and offend the laws of their
   country, they do not believe that it is of any consequence whether they
   love God or not, whether they do righteousness or not, whether they are
   sober and temperate, or drunken and wanton; whether they are clean in
   heart by God's Spirit, or defiled in soul and life. Thou thinkest that
   God is altogether such an one as thyself, and that he will wink at thy
   transgression and cover up thy sin; but thou shalt not find it so. That
   base thought proves that thou despisest his longsuffering.

   Some even get to think that the warnings of love are so much wind, and
   that the threatenings of God will never be fulfilled. They have gone on
   for many years without being punished, and instead of drawing the
   conclusion that the longer the blow is in falling the heavier it will
   be when it does come, they imagine that because it is long delayed the
   judgment will never come at all; and so they sport and trifle between
   the jaws of death and hell. They hear warnings as if they were all
   moonshine, and fancy that this holy Book, with its threatenings, is but
   a bugbear to keep fools quiet. If thou thinkest so, sir, then indeed
   thou hast despised the goodness and forbearance and longsuffering of
   God. Do you imagine that this forbearance will last for ever? Do you
   dream that at least it will continue with you for many years? I know
   your secret thoughts: you see other men die suddenly, but your secret
   thought is that you will have long space ad ample time: you hear of one
   struck down with paralysis, and another carried off by apoplexy, but
   you flatter yourselves that you will have plenty of leisure to think
   about these things. Oh, how can you be so secure? How can you thus
   tempt the Lord? False prophets in these evil days play into men's hands
   and hold out the hope that you may go into the next world wrong, and
   yet be set right in the end. This is a vile flattery of your wicked
   hearts; but yet remember that even according to their maundering
   centuries may elapse before this fancied restoration may occur. A
   sensible man would not like to run the risk of even a year of agony.
   Half-an-hour of acute pain is dreaded by most people. Can it be that
   the very men who start back from the dentist's door, afraid of the
   pinch which extricates an aching tooth, will run the risk of years of
   misery? Take the future of the impenitent even on this footing, it is a
   thing to be dreaded, and by every means avoided. I say, these
   flattering prophets themselves, if rightly understood, give you little
   enough of hope; but what will come to you if the old doctrine proves to
   be true and you go away into everlasting fire in hell, as the Scripture
   puts it? Will you live an hour in jeopardy of such a doom? Will you so
   despise the longsuffering and forbearance of the Lord?

   I will not enlarge and use many words, for I am myself weary of words:
   I want to persuade you even with tears. My whole soul would attract you
   to your God, your Father. I would come to close quarters with you, and
   say,--Do you not think that, even though you fall into no doctrinal
   error, and indulge no hazy hope as to either restitution or
   annihilation, yet still it is a dreadful despising of God's mercy when
   you keep on playing with God, and saying to his grace, "Go thy way for
   this time; when I have a more convenient season I will send for thee"?
   The more gentle God is the more you procrastinate, and the more in
   tenderness he speaks of pardon the more you transgress. Is this
   generous? Is it right? Is it wise? Can it be a fit and proper thing to
   do? Oh, my dear hearer, why will you act thus shamefully? Some of you
   delight to come and hear me preach, and drink in all I have to say, and
   you will even commend me for being earnest with your souls; and yet,
   after all, you will not decide for God, for Christ, for heaven. You are
   between good and evil, neither cold nor hot. I would ye were either
   cold or hot; I could even wish that ye either thought this word of mine
   to be false, or else that, believing it to be true, you at once acted
   upon it. How can you incur the double guilt of offending God and of
   knowing that it is an evil thing to do so? You reject Christ, and yet
   admit that he ought to be received by you! You speak well of a gospel
   which you will not accept for yourselves! You believe great things of a
   Saviour whom you will not have to be your Saviour! Jesus himself says,
   "If I tell you the truth, why do you not believe me?"

   "Despisest thou the longsuffering of God?" Dare you do it? I tremble as
   I think of a man despising God's goodness. Is not this practical
   blasphemy? Darest thou do it? Oh, if thou hast done it hitherto, do it
   no more. Ere yon sun goes down again, say within thy heart, "I will be
   a despiser of God's goodness no longer; I will arise and go unto my
   Father, and I will say unto him,--Father, I have sinned. I will not
   rest until in the precious blood he has washed my sins away."

   III. In closing this sermon I desire to remind thee, O ungodly man, of
   THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH THOU ART FORGETFUL. Read my text,--"Despisest
   thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not
   knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?" Now there
   are many here who know as a matter of doctrine that the goodness of God
   leads them to repentance, and yet they do not know it as a practical
   truth affecting their lives: indeed, they so act that it is not true to
   them at all. Yet, if they do not know this they are wilfully ignorant;
   not willing to retain in their minds a fact so disagreeable to them.
   None are so blind as those who will not see: but he who does not see,
   and yet hath eyes, has a criminality about his blindness which is not
   found in that of those who have no sight. Dear hearer, whether you know
   this truth or not, I would remind you that God's patience with you is
   meant to lead you to repentance. "How?" say you. Why, first by giving
   you an opportunity to repent. These years, which are now coming to a
   considerable number with you, have been given you in order that you
   might turn to God. By the time you were twenty-one you had sinned quite
   enough; perhaps you had even then begun to mislead other youths, and to
   instruct in evil those under your influence. Why did not God take you
   away at once? It might have been for the benefit of the world if he had
   done so; but yet you were spared till you were thirty. Did not each
   year of your lengthened life prove that the Lord was saying "I will
   spare him, for perhaps he will yet amend and think upon his God. I will
   give him more light, and increase his comforts; I will give him better
   teaching, better preaching; peradventure he will repent." Yet you have
   not done so. Have you lived to be forty, and are you where you were
   when you were twenty? Are you still out of Christ? Then you are worse
   than you were; for you have sinned more deeply and you have provoked
   the Lord more terribly. You have now had space enough. What more do you
   need? When the child has offended, you say, "Child, unless you beg
   pardon at once, I must punish you": would you give a boy so many
   minutes to repent in as God has given you years? I think not. If a
   servant is continually robbing you; if he is careless, slothful,
   disobedient, you say to him, "I have passed over your faults several
   times, but one of these days I shall discharge you. I cannot always put
   up with this slovenliness, this blundering, this idleness: one of these
   times you will have to go." Have you not so spoken to your female
   servant, and thought it kind on your part to give her another chance?
   The lord has said the same to you; yet here you are, a living but
   impenitent man; spared, but spared only to multiply your
   transgressions. This know, that his forbearance gives you an
   opportunity to repent; do not turn it into an occasion for hardening
   your heart.

   But next, the Lord in this is pleased to give a suggestion to you to
   repent. It seems to me that every morning when a man wakes up still
   impenitent, and finds himself out of hell, the sunlight seems to say,
   "I shine on thee yet another day, as that in this day thou mayest
   repent." When your bed receives you at night I think it seems to say,
   "I will give you another night's rest, that you may live to turn from
   your sins and trust in Jesus." Every mouthful of bread that comes to
   the table says, "I have to support your body that still you may have
   space for repentance." Every time you open the Bible the pages say, "We
   speak with you that you may repent." Every time you hear a sermon, if
   it be such a sermon as God would have us preach, it pleads with you to
   turn unto the Lord and live. Surely the time past of your life may
   suffice you to have wrought the will of the Gentiles. "The times of
   your ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth men everywhere to
   repent." Do not life and death, and heaven and hell, call upon you so
   to do? Thus you have in God's goodness space for repentance, and a
   suggestion to repent.

   But something more is here; for I want you to notice that the text does
   not say, "The goodness of God calleth thee to repentance," but "leadeth
   thee." This is a much stronger word. God calls to repentance by the
   gospel; God leads to repentance by his goodness. It is as though he
   plucked at your sleeve and said, "Come this way." His goodness lays its
   gentle hand on you, drawing you with cords of love and bands of a man.
   God's forbearance cries, "Why wilt thou hate me? What wrong have I done
   thee? I have spared thee; I have spared thy wife and children to thee;
   I have raised thee up from the bed of sickness; I have loaded thy
   board; I have filled thy wardrobe; I have done thee a thousand good
   turns; wherefore dost thou disobey me? Turn unto thy God and Father,
   and live in Christ Jesus."

   If, on the other hand, you have not received rich temporal favours, yet
   the Lord still leads you to repentance by a rougher hand; as when the
   prodigal fain would have filled his belly with husks, but could not,
   and the pangs of hunger came upon him; those pains were a powerful
   message from the Father to lead him to the home where there was bread
   enough and to spare. "The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance."
   Oh, that thou wouldest yield to its sweet leading, and follow as a
   child follows the guidance of a nurse. Let thy crosses lead thee to the
   cross; let thy joys lead thee to find joy in Christ.

   Do you not think that all this should encourage you to repent, since
   God himself leads you that way? If God leads you to repentance he does
   not mean to cast you away. If he bids you repent, then he is willing to
   accept your repentance, and to be reconciled to you. If he bids you
   change your mind, it is because his own mind is love. Repentance
   implies a radical change in your view of things, and in your estimate
   of matters; it is a change in your purposes, a change in your thoughts
   and in your conduct. If the Lord leads you that way he will help you in
   it. follow his gracious leading till his divine Spirit shall lead you
   with still greater power and still greater efficacy, till at last you
   find that he has wrought in you both repentance and faith, and you are
   saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation. If "the goodness of
   God leadeth thee to repentance," then be sure of this, that the
   goodness of God will receive thee when thou dost repent, and thou shalt
   live in his sight as his well-beloved and forgiven child.

   I close now, but I am sorry so to do, for I have not pleaded one-half
   as I could have wished. Yet what more can I say? I will put it to
   yourselves. If you were in God's stead, could you bear to be treated as
   you have treated him? If you were all goodness and tenderness, and had
   borne with a creature now for thirty or forty years, how would you bear
   to see that creature still stand out, and even draw an inference from
   your gentleness to encourage him in his rebellion? Would you not say,
   "Well, if my longsuffering makes him think little of sin, I will change
   my hand. If tenderness cannot win him, I must leave him; if even my
   love does not affect him, I will let him along. He is given unto his
   evil ways--I will cease from him, and see what his end will be"? O
   Lord, say not so, say not so unto anyone in this house, but of thy
   great mercy make this day to be as the beginning of life to many. Oh
   that hearts may be touched with pity for their slighted Saviour, that
   they may seek his face! Here is the way of salvation: "Believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." You know how the Master
   bade us put it. "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to
   every creature: he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved."
   First, we are to preach faith, whereby we lay hold on Christ; then
   baptism, whereby we confess that faith, and own that we are dead and
   buried with Christ that we may live with him in newness of life. Those
   are the two points he bids us set before you, and I do set them before
   you. Weary, but not quite wearied out, O impenitent man, I plead with
   thee! Though thou hast so often been pleaded with in vain, once more I
   speak with thee in Christ's stead, and say--Repent of thy sin, look to
   thy Saviour, and confess thy faith in his own appointed way. I verily
   believe that if I had been pleading with some of you to save the life
   of a dog I should have prevailed with you a great while ago. And will
   you not care about the saving of your own souls? Oh, strange
   infatuation--that men will not consent to be themselves saved; but
   foolishly, madly, hold out against the mercy of God which leads them to
   repentance. God bless you, beloved, and may none of you despise his
   goodness, and forbearance, and longsuffering.

A Description of Young Men in Christ

   (No. 1715)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 8, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the Wicked
   One... I have written unto you, youngmen, because you are strong, and
   the Word of God abides in you, and you ha ve overcome the Wicked One."
   1 John 2:13,14.

   WHEN I preached a short time ago upon John's message to the "little
   children," [Sermon #1711--A Sermon to the Lord's Little Children] I
   explained why it was that he first said, "I write," and then, "I have
   written." He is writing--his whole heart is in it and he cannot help
   saying that he is earnestly writing to those whom he loves so well. But
   he has scarcely penned the line before he feels that he must alter that
   present tense and set it in the past, under the form of, "I have
   written." He knows that he must soon be gone from them and be numbered
   with those who were, but are not, among living men. These words, then,
   are the language of a father in Israel still among his children; they
   are also the words of one who has passed from earth and entered into
   Glory.

   If what I shall have to say at this time, fairly flowing from the text,
   shall come to you as Christ's words from His favored disciple, John,
   you will attach the more importance to it and it will do your hearts
   the more good. Lifting his head from that dear bosom which gave him
   unexampled rest, he whispers, "I write unto you young men." Looking
   down from that favored place which he now occupies so near to the
   Throne of the Lamb, he looks over the battlements of Heaven upon us and
   cries, "I have written unto you, young men." In the Christian Church
   there is an order of Christians who have grown so much that they can no
   longer be called, "babes in Grace," but yet they are not so far matured
   that they can exactly be called, "fathers." These, who form the middle
   class of the spiritual-minded, are styled "young men."

   Understand that the Apostle is not writing, here, to any according to
   their bodily age--he is using human age as a metaphor and figure for
   representing growth in the spiritual life. Age, according to the flesh,
   often differs much from the condition of the spirit--many old men are
   still no more than "babes." Some children in years are, even now,
   "young men" in Grace, while not a few young men are "fathers " in the
   Church while young in years. God has endowed certain of His servants
   with great Grace and made them mature in their youth--such were Joseph,
   Samuel, David, Josiah and Timothy. It is not age according to the
   family register that we are now to speak about, but age according to
   the Lamb's Book of Life.

   Grace is a matter of growth and, therefore, we have among us babes,
   young men and fathers, whose position is not reckoned according to this
   fleeting, dying life, but according to that eternal life which has been
   worked in them by the Spirit of God. It is a great mercy when young
   men, in the natural sense, are also young men in the spiritual
   sense--and I am glad that it is largely so in this Church! The fathers
   among us need not be ashamed of their spiritual seed. In speaking to
   young men in Christ, I am speaking to a numerous body of Christians
   among ourselves who make up a very efficient part of the army of Christ
   in this region. I would ask them not to be either so modest or so proud
   as to decline to be thus classed.

   You are no longer weaklings--do not, therefore, count yourselves mere
   babes lest you plead exemption from hard service! You are hardly yet
   mature enough to rank with the fathers--do not forget the duties of
   your real place under cover of aspiring to another. It is honor enough
   to be in Christ and certainly it is no small thing to be, in spiritual
   things, a man in the prime of life! These young men are not babes--they
   have been in Christ too long for that--they are no longer novices to
   whom the Lord's house is strange. They have been born unto God
   probably, now, for years. The things which they hoped for at first they
   have, to a large extent, realized. They know now what once they could
   not understand. They are not now confined to a milk diet--they can eat
   meat and digest it well.

   They have discernment, having had their senses exercised by reason of
   use, so that they are not so liable to be misled as they were in their
   infancy. And while they have been longer in the Way, so also have they
   now grown stronger in the Way. It is not a weak and timorous faith
   which they now possess--they believe firmly and stoutly and are able to
   do battle for the "faith once delivered to the saints"--for they are
   strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. They are wiser, now,
   than they used to be. When they were children, they knew enough to save
   them, for they knew the Father and that was blessed knowledge! But now
   they know far more of the Word of God which abides in them through
   their earnest, prayerful, believing reception of it.

   Now they have a clearer idea of the breadth and length, and depth and
   height of the work of redemption, for they have been taught of God.
   They even venture to enjoy the deep things of God--and the Covenant is
   by no means an unknown thing among them. They have been under the
   blessed teaching of the Spirit of God and from Him they have received
   an unction, so that they know all things. In knowledge they are no more
   children, but men in Christ Jesus. Thus they are distinguished from the
   first class which comprehends the babes in Christ. They are not yet
   fathers because they are not yet so established, confirmed and settled
   as the fathers are, who know what they believe, and know it with a
   certainty of full assurance which nothing can shake.

   They have not yet had the experience of fathers and, consequently, have
   not all their prudence and foresight--they are richer in zeal than in
   judgment. They have not yet acquired the nursing faculty so precious in
   the Church as the product of growth, experience, maturity and
   affection. They are going on to that and in a short time they will have
   reached it, but as yet they have other work to do more suitable to
   their vigor. Do not suppose that when we say they are not to be called
   "fathers," that they are not, therefore, very valuable to the
   community, for in some senses they are quite equal to the fathers--and
   in one or two respects they may even be superior to them. The fathers
   are for contemplation--they study deep and see far--and so they "have
   known Him that is from the beginning." But a measure of their energy
   for action may have gone through stress of years.

   These young men are born to fight! They are the militia of the Church,
   they have to contend for her faith and to extend the Redeemer's
   Kingdom. They should do so, for they are strong. This is their lot and
   the Lord helps them to fulfill their calling. These must, for years to
   come, be our active spirits--they are our strength and our hope. The
   fathers must soon go off the stage--their maturity in Grace shows that
   they are ready for Glory--and it is not God's way to keep His shocks of
   corn in the field when they are fully ripe for the granary! Perfect men
   shall be gathered up with the perfect and shall enter into their proper
   sphere. The fathers, therefore, must soon be gone. And when they are
   gone, to whom are we to look for a succession but to these young men?
   We hope to have them for many years with us, valiant for the Truth of
   God, steadfast in the faith, ripening in spirit and growingly made meet
   to take their seats among the glorified saints above.

   Judge for yourselves, dear Brothers and Sisters, whether you are fairly
   to be ranked among the young men. Have no regard to the matter of sex,
   for there is neither male nor female in Christ Jesus! Judge whether you
   are fit to be ranked among those whose full-grown and vigorous life
   entitles them to stand among the effectives of the Church, the vigorous
   manhood of the seed of Israel. To such I speak. May God the Holy spirit
   bless the word!

   I. The first thing that John notes about these young men is THEIR
   POSSESSION OF STRENGTH--"I have written unto you young men, because you
   are strong." These Christians of the middle class are emphatically
   strong. This does not imply that any measure of spiritual strength was
   in them by nature, for the Apostle Paul clearly puts it otherwise
   concerning our natural state saying, "When we were yet without
   strength, Christ died for the ungodly." So that by nature we are
   without strength to do anything that is good and right.

   We are strong as a wild bull, to dash headlong into everything that is
   evil--strong as a lion to fight against all that is good and
   Godlike--but for all spiritual and holy things we are utterly infirm
   and incapable. Yes, we are as dead men until God the Holy Spirit deals
   with us! Neither does the Apostle, here, at all allude to the strength
   of the body in young men, for in a spiritual sense this is rather their
   weakness than their strength! The man who is strong in the flesh is too
   often, for that very reason, strongly tempted to sins of the flesh and,
   therefore the Apostle bids his young friend, "flee youthful lusts."
   Whenever you read the life of Samson you may thank God you had not
   Samson's muscles and sinews, or else it is more than probable that you
   would have had Samson's passions--and they might have mastered you as
   they mastered him.

   The time of life in which a young man is found is full of perils and so
   is the spiritual condition of which it is the type. The young man might
   almost wish that it were with him as with the older man in whom the
   forces of the flesh have declined, for though age brings with it many
   infirmities, it also has its gain in the abatement of the passions. So
   you see the young man cannot reckon upon vigor of the flesh as
   contributing towards real "strength"--he has, rather, to ask for more
   strength from on high lest the animal vigor that is within him should
   drag down his spirit. He is glad to be in robust health that he may
   bear much toil in the Lord's cause, but he is not proud of it, for he
   remembers that the Lord delights not in the strength of the horse, and
   takes not pleasure in the legs of a man.

   These young men in Grace are strong, first of all, in faith, according
   to that exhortation, "Be strong! Fear not!" They have known the Lord,
   now, for some time, and they have enjoyed that perfect peace which
   comes of forgiven sin. They have marked the work of the Spirit within
   themselves and they know that it is no delusion, but a Divine change--
   and now they not only believe in Christ, but they know that they
   believe in Him! They know whom they have believed and they are
   persuaded that He is able to keep that which they have committed to
   Him. That faith which was once a healing touch has now become a
   satisfying embrace! That enjoyment which was once a sip has now become
   a draught, quenching all thirst! Yes, and that which was once a draught
   has become an immersion into the river of God which is full of Living
   Water--they have plunged into the River of Life and find waters to swim
   in!

   Oh what a mercy it is to be strong in this fashion! Let him that is
   strong take heed that he glory only in the Lord who is his
   righteousness and strength--but in Him and His strength, he may,
   indeed, make his boast and defy the armies of the aliens! What says
   Paul--"I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me." My
   Brothers and Sisters, take good heed that you never lose this strength!
   Pray God that you may never sin so as to lose it; may never backslide
   so as to lose it; may never grieve the Spirit so as to lose it--for I
   reckon that to be endowed with power from on High and to be strong in
   faith, giving glory to God, is the truest glory and majesty of our
   manhood--and it were sad to lose it, or even to deface it. Oh that all
   Christians were so much advanced as to enter the enlisted battalion of
   the Lord's young men!

   This strength makes a man strong to endure. He is a sufferer, but mark
   how patient he is! He is a loser in business and he has a hard task to
   earn his daily bread, but he never complains! He has learned, in every
   state, to be content. He is persecuted, but he is not distressed. Men
   revile him, but he is not moved from the even tenor of his way. He
   grows careless, alike, of flattery and calumny. So long as he can
   please God, he cares not to displease men. He dwells on high and lives
   above the smoke of human opinion. He bears and forbears. He bows his
   neck to the yoke and his shoulders to the bur-den--and has fellowship
   with Christ in his sufferings! Blessed is that man who is so strong
   that he never complains of his trials, never whimpers and frets because
   he is made to share in the humiliations and griefs of his Covenant
   Head!

   He expected to bear his cross when he became a follower of the
   Crucified and he is not now made weary and faint when it presses upon
   him. It is a fair sight to see young Isaac bearing the wood for the
   sacrifice! Young Joseph bearing the fetters in prison with holy joy!
   Young Samson carrying away the gates of Gaza, bars and all, and young
   David praising God with his harp though Saul is feeling for his
   javelin! Such are the exploits of the young men who count it all joy
   when they fall into manifold trials for Christ's sake! O young man, be
   strong, strong as an iron column which bears the full stress of the
   building and is not moved!

   This strength shows itself, next, in laboring for Christ. The young man
   in Christ is a great worker. He has so much strength that he cannot sit
   still! He would be ashamed to leave the burden and heat of the day to
   be borne by others. He is up and at it according to his calling and
   ability. He has asked his Lord, as a favor, to give him something to
   do. His prayer has been, "Show me what You would have me to do," and
   having received an answer, he is found in the vineyard trenching the
   soil, removing the weeds, pruning the vines and attending to such
   labors as the seasons demand. His Master has said to him, "Feed My
   sheep," and, "Feed My lambs." And, therefore, you shall see him through
   the livelong day and far into the night watching over the flock which
   is committed to him.

   In all this toil he greatly rejoices, for he is strong. He can run and
   not be weary. He can walk and not faint. "By my God have I leaped over
   a wall," he says. Nothing is hard for him. Or, if it is, he remembers
   that the diamond cuts the diamond and so he sets a harder thing against
   a hard thing--and by a firm and stern resolution he overcomes. That
   which ought to be done, he declares shall be done in the power of God,
   and lo, it is accomplished! Blessed is the Church that has her quiver
   full of these! She shall speak with her adversaries in the gate. These
   are the men that work our reformations! These are the men who conduct
   our missions! These are the men who launch out into the deep for
   Christ! They make the

   vanguard of the host of God and largely compose the main body of her
   forces. I trust this Church has many such. May they yet be multiplied
   and increased among us, that we may never lack for choice soldiers of
   the Cross, able to lead on the hosts of God!

   So, also, are these young men strong to resist attack. They are
   assaulted, but they carry with them the shield of faith with which they
   quench the fiery darts of the enemy. Wherever they go, if they meet
   with other tempted ones, they spring to the front to espouse their
   cause. They are ready in the day of battle to meet attacks upon the
   faith with the sword of the Spirit--they will yield no point of faith,
   but defend the Truth at all hazards. Clad in the panoply of Truth, they
   meet no deadly wound for, by Grace, they are so preserved that the
   Wicked One touches them not. They resist temptation and are unharmed in
   the midst of peril. Do you need an example? Look at Joseph! Where
   10,000 would have fallen, he stands in snow-white purity. Joseph, as
   contrasted with David, is an instance of how a young man may bring
   greater glory to God than an older man when assailed by a similar
   temptation.

   Joseph is but young and the temptation forces itself upon him while he
   is in the path of duty. He is alone with his temptress and no one need
   know of the sin if it is committed. On the other hand, if he refuses,
   shame and possibly death may await him through the calumny of his
   offended mistress! Yet he bravely resists the assault and overcomes the
   Wicked One. He is a bright contrast to the older man, a father in
   Israel, who went out of his way to compass an evil deed and committed
   crime in order to fulfill his foul desire. From this case we learn that
   neither years, nor knowledge, nor experience can preserve any one of us
   from sin--old and young must be kept by the power of God--or they will
   be overthrown by the Tempter.

   Furthermore, these young men are not only strong for resistance, but
   they are strong for attack. They carry the war into the enemy's
   territory! If there is anything to be done, they are like Jonathan and
   his armor-bearer, eager for the fray! These are very zealous for the
   Lord of Hosts and are prompt to undertake toil and travail for Jesus'
   sake. These smite down error and set up the Truth of God! These believe
   great things, attempt great things and expect great things and the Lord
   is with them. The archers have sorely grieved them, shot at them and
   hated them--but their bows abide in strength, for the arms of their
   hands are made strong by the mighty God of Jacob! One of them shall
   chase a thousand, and two put 10,000 to flight!

   So have I shown you what these young men are--they are strong--strong
   to believe, strong to suffer, strong to do, strong to resist, strong to
   attack! May companies of these go in and out among us to fight the
   Lord's battles, for to this end has the Lord girded them with strength.

   II. Secondly, let us notice that he implies THEIR NEED OF STRENGTH, for
   he says, "You are strong, and you have overcome the Wicked One."
   Between the lines of the text I read the fact that young men who are
   strong must expect to be attacked. This also follows from a rule of
   Divine economy. Whenever God lays up stores, it is because there will
   be need of them. When Egypt's granaries were full with the supply of
   seven years of plenty, one might have been sure that seven years of
   famine were about to come. Whenever a man is strong, it is because he
   has stern work to do for, as the Israelite of old never had an ounce of
   manna left over till the morning except that which bred worms and
   stank, so there never will be a Christian that has a penny's worth of
   Grace left over from his daily requirements.

   If you are weak, you shall have no trial happen to you but such as is
   common to men. But if you are strong, rest assured that trials, many
   and heavy, are awaiting you! Every sinew in the arm of faith will have
   to be tested. Every single weapon given out of the armory of God will
   be called for in the conflict. Christian soldiering is no piece of
   military pastime--it is no proud parade--it means hard fighting from
   the day of enlistment to the day of reward. The strong young man may
   rest assured that he has no force to spend in display, no energy which
   he may use in boasting and vainglory. There is a heavy burden for the
   strong shoulder and a fierce fight for the trained hands!

   Why does Satan attack this class of men most? I reckon, first, because
   Satan is not always sure that the babes in Grace are in Grace and,
   therefore, he does not always attack beginners. But when they are
   sufficiently developed to make him see who and what they are, then his
   wrath is awakened. Those who have clean escaped from him, he will weary
   and worry to the utmost of his power. A friend writes to me to enquire
   whether Satan knows our thoughts. Of course he does not as God does!
   Satan pretty shrewdly guesses at them from our actions and our
   words--and perhaps even from manifestations upon our countenances--but
   it is the Lord, alone, who knows the thoughts of men immediately and by
   themselves.

   Satan is an old hand at studying human nature--he has been near 6,000
   years watching and tempting men and women and, therefore, he is full of
   cunning. But he is not Omniscient and, therefore, it may be that he
   thinks such and such a person is so little in Grace that perhaps he is
   not in Grace at all! And so he lets him alone--but as soon as ever it
   is certain that the man is of the royal seed--then the devil is at him!
   I do not know whether our Lord was ever tempted at Nazareth, while He
   was yet in His obscurity, but the moment He was baptized and the Spirit
   of God came upon Him, He was taken into the wilderness to be tempted of
   the devil. If you become an avowed servant of God, do not think the
   conflict is over--it is then that the battle begins!

   Straight from the waters of Baptism, it may be, you will have to go
   into such a wilderness and such a conflict as you never knew before!
   Satan knows that young men in Grace can do his kingdom great harm and,
   therefore, he would gladly slay them early in the day, as Pharaoh
   wished to kill all the male children in Israel. My Brothers and
   Sisters, you are strong to overthrow his kingdom and, therefore, you
   need not marvel that he desires to overthrow you! I think it is right
   that young men should endure hardness, or else they might become proud.
   It is hard to hide pride from men. Full of strength, full of courage,
   full of patience, full of zeal, such men are ready enough to believe
   the Wicked One when he whispers that they are perfect--and, therefore,
   trial is sent to keep them out of that grievous snare of the Evil One.

   The devil is used by God as a householder might employ a dirty, smutty
   servant to clean his pots and kettles. The devil tempts the saint and
   thus the saint sees his inward depravity and is no longer able to
   boast. The devil thinks he is going to destroy the man of God, but God
   is making the temptation work for the Believer's eternal good! Far
   better to have Beelzebub, the god of flies, pestering you, than to
   become fly-blown with notions of your own excellence. Besides, not only
   might this young man be a prey to pride, but he certainly would not
   bring the glory to God, untried, that he brings to Him when he
   overcomes temptation.

   Read the story of Job up to the time when he is tempted. You say, "We
   have no story to read." Just so, there was nothing worthy of record,
   only that his flocks and herds continued to multiply, that another
   child was born and so forth. There is no history to a nation when
   everything goes well! And it is so with a Believer. But when trial
   comes and the man plays the man, and is valiant for God against the
   arch-enemy, I hear a voice from Heaven. saying, "Write." Now you shall
   have history--history that will glorify God! It is but right that those
   who are young men and women in Christ should endure conflicts that they
   may bring honor to their Father, their Redeemer and the Holy Spirit who
   dwells in them!

   Besides, it prepares them for future usefulness, and here I venture to
   intrude the testimony of my own experience. I often wondered, when I
   first came to Christ, why I had such a hard time of it when I was
   coming to the Lord, and why I was so long and so wearied in finding a
   Savior. After that, I wondered why I experienced so many spiritual
   conflicts while others were in peace. Ah, Brothers and Sisters, I did
   not know that I was destined to preach to this great congregation! I
   did not understand, in those days, that I should have to minister to
   hundreds, and even thousands of distressed spirits, storm-tossed and
   ready to perish! But it is so, now, with me that when the afflicted
   mention their experience I can, as a rule, reply, "I have been
   there"--and so I can help them, as one who has felt the same.

   It is necessary, therefore, that the young men should bear the yoke in
   their youth and that while they are strong they should gain experience,
   not so much for themselves, as for others, that in later days when they
   come to be fathers they may be able to help the little ones of the
   family. Take your tribulation kindly, Brother. Yes, take it
   gratefully--thank your King that He puts you in commission where the
   thick of the battle centers around you. You will never be a warrior if
   you never enter the dust clouds where garments are rolled in blood. You
   will never become a veteran if you do not fight through the long
   campaign.

   So be it unto you--may your Captain save you from the canker of
   inglorious ease. You must fight in order that you may acquire the
   character which inspires others with confidence in you--and thus fits
   you to lead your comrades to the fray. Oh, that we may have, here, an
   abundance of the young men of the heavenly family who will defend the
   Church against worldliness and error, defend the weaker ones from the
   wolves that prowl around and guard the feeble against the many
   deceivers that waylay the Church of God! As you love the Lord, I charge
   you, grow in Grace and be strong, for we have need of you just now.

   Oh, my Brothers, take hold on sword and buckler; watch and stand fast!
   May the Lord teach your hands to war and your fingers to fight. In
   these evil days may you be as a phalanx to protect our Israel! The
   Canaanites, the Hivites and the

   Jebusites are upon us just now! War is at all our borders--now,
   therefore, let each valiant man stand about the King's chariot, each
   man with his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

   III. Thirdly, the text reminds us of THEIR PROOF OF STRENGTH--they have
   overcome the Wicked One. Then they must be strong, for a man who can
   overcome the Wicked One is not only a mean man of war--write him down
   among the first three! Wicked ones abound, but there is one crafty
   being who deserves the name of the Wicked One--he is the arch-leader of
   rebellion, the first of sinners, the chief of sinners, the tempter of
   sinners! He is the Wicked One who heads assaults against the pilgrims
   to Zion. If any man has ever stood foot to foot with him, he will never
   forget it--it is a fight that once fought will leave its scars, even
   though the victory is won!

   In what sense have these young men overcome the Wicked One? Well,
   first, in the fact that they have broken right away from his power.
   They were once his slaves--they are not so now. They once slept beneath
   his roof in perfect peace, but conscience raised an uproar and the
   Spirit of God troubled them--and they then escaped his power. Once
   Satan never troubled them at all. Why should he? They were good
   friends! Now he tempts them, worries them and assaults them because
   they have left his service, engaged themselves to a new Master and
   become the enemies of him who was once their god. I speak to many who
   gladly acknowledge that not a bit of them now belongs to the devil!
   From the crown of their head to the soles of their feet Christ has
   bought them--body, soul and spirit--with His precious blood!

   And they have assented to the purchase and feel that they are not their
   own, and certainly not the devil's, for they are bought with a price
   and belong to Him who purchased them. The strong man armed has been
   turned out by a stronger than he--Jesus has carried the fortress of the
   heart by storm and driven out the foe! Satan is not inside our heart,
   now that he entered Judas--and he cannot enter into us, for our soul is
   filled by Another who is well able to hold His own! The Wicked One has
   been expelled by the Holy One who now lives and reigns within our
   nature as Lord of All. Moreover, these young men have overcome the
   Wicked One, not only by breaking away from his power and from driving
   him entirely out of possession so that he is no longer master, but they
   have overcome him in the very fact of their opposition to him.

   When a man resists Satan, he is victorious over Satan in that very
   resistance! Satan's empire consists in the yielding of our will to his
   will, but when our will revolts against him, then already we have, in a
   measure, overcome him. Albeit that sometimes we are much better at
   willing than we are at doing, as the Apostle Paul was for he said, "To
   will is present with me; hut how to perform that which is good I find
   not." Yet, still, the hearty will to be clean from sin is a victory
   over sin and, as that will grows stronger and more determined to resist
   the temptations of the Evil One--in that device we have overcome sin
   and Satan! What a blessed thing this is for us to remember, that Satan
   has no weapons of defense, and so, when we resist him, he must flee! A
   Christian man has both defensive and offensive weapons! He has a shield
   as well as a sword--but Satan has fiery darts and nothing else! I never
   read of Satan having any shield whatever--so that when we resist him,
   he is bound to run away. He has no defense for himself and the fact of
   our resistance is, in itself, a victory!

   But, oh, Brothers and Sisters, besides that, some of us who are young
   men in Christ have won many a victory over Satan! Have we not been
   tempted, fearfully tempted? But the mighty Grace of God has come to the
   rescue and we have not yielded! Cannot you look back, not within
   Pharisaic boasting, but with gracious exultation, over many an evil
   habit which once had the mastery over you, but which is master of you
   no longer? It was a hard conflict. How you bit your lip, sometimes, and
   feared that you must yield! In certain moments your steps had almost
   gone; your feet had well-nigh slipped, but here you are, conqueror!
   Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus
   Christ! Hear what the Spirit says to you when John writes to you
   because you have overcome the Wicked One! He says, "Love not the world,
   neither the things that are in the world."

   Once more, in Christ Jesus we have entirely overcome the Wicked One,
   already, for the enemy we have to battle with is a vanquished foe--our
   Lord and Master met him and destroyed him! He is now destitute of his
   boasted battle-ax, that terrible weapon which has made the bravest men
   to quail when they have seen it in his hand. "What weapon is that?" you
   ask. That weapon is death! Our Lord overthrew him that has the power of
   death, that is, the devil, and, therefore, Satan has not the power of
   death any longer. The keys of death and of Hell are at the belt of
   Christ! Ah, Satan, we who believe in Jesus shall defeat you, for our
   Lord defeated you! That bruise upon your head cannot be hidden! Your
   crown is dashed in pieces! The Lord has sorely wounded you, O Dragon,
   and your deadly wound can never be healed!

   We have at you with dauntless courage, for we believe the promise of
   our Lord, that He will shortly bruise you under our feet. As certainly
   as you were bruised under the feet of our crucified Lord, so shall you
   be bruised under the feet of all His seed--to your utter overthrow and
   contempt! Let us take courage, Brothers and Sisters, and abide
   steadfast in the faith, for we have in our Lord Jesus overcome the
   Wicked One. We are more than conquerors through Him that has loved us!

   IV. Now I close with my fourth point, which is--THEIR SOURCE OF
   STRENGTH. You have seen their strength and their need of it--and their
   proof of it--now for the fountain of it. "The Word of God abides in
   you." I labor under the opinion that there never was a time in which
   the people of God had greater need to understand this passage than now.
   We have entered upon that part of the pilgrim path which is described
   by Bunyan as the Enchanted Ground--the Church and the world appear to
   be alike bewitched with folly! Half the people of God hardly know their
   head from their heels at this time. They are gaping after wonders,
   running after a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal and waiting for
   yet more astounding inventions. Everything seems to be in a whirligig!
   A tornado has set in and the storm is everywhere!

   Christians used to believe in Christ as their Leader and the Bible as
   their rule. But some of them are pleased with lords and rules such as
   He never knew! Believe me, there will soon come new Messiahs. Men are
   already pretending to work miracles! We shall soon have false Christs
   and, "Lo! Here!" And "Lo! There," will be heard on all sides! Anchors
   are up, winds are out and the whole fleet is getting into confusion!
   Men in whose sanity and stability I once believed, are being carried
   away with one fancy or another, and I am driven to cry, "What next? And
   what next?" We are only at the beginning of an era of mingled unbelief
   and fanaticism!

   Now we shall know who are God's elect and who are not, for there are
   spirits abroad at this hour that would, if it were possible, deceive
   even the very elect! And those who are not deceived are, nevertheless,
   sorely put to it. Here is the patience of the saints. Let him look to
   himself who is not rooted and grounded in Christ, for the hurricane is
   coming! The signs of the times indicate a carnival of delusions! Men
   have ceased to be guided by the Word of God and claim to be,
   themselves, prophets. Now we shall see what we shall see! Blessed is
   the sheep that knows his Shepherd and will not listen to the voice of
   strangers. But here is the way to be kept steadfast--"The Word of God
   abides in you." "The Word of God"--that is to say we are to believe in
   the doctrines of God's Word--and these will make us strong.

   What vigor they infuse into a man! Get the Word of God well into you
   and you will overcome the Wicked One! When the devil tempted Luther,
   the Reformer's grand grip of justification by faith made him readily
   victorious. Keep a fast hold of the Doctrines of Grace and Satan will
   soon give up attacking you, for they are like plate armor, through
   which no dart can ever force its way. The promises of God's Word,
   too--what power they give a man! To get hold of a, "shall," and,
   "will," in the time of trouble is a heavenly safeguard! "My God will
   hear me." "I will not fail you nor forsake you." These are Divine
   holdfasts! Oh, how strong a man is for overcoming the Wicked One when
   he has such a promise at hand!

   Do not trust yourself in the morning, in the street, till you have laid
   a promise under your tongue. I see people put respirators on in foggy
   weather--they do not make them look very lovely--but I dare say they
   are useful! I recommend the best respirator for the pestilential
   atmosphere of this present evil world when I bid you fit a promise to
   your lips! Did not the Lord rout the Tempter in the wilderness with
   that promise, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
   that proceeds out of the mouth of God shall man live"? Get the promises
   of God to lodge within you and you will be strong! Then mind the
   precepts, for a precept is often a sharp weapon against Satan. Remember
   how the Lord Jesus Christ struck Satan a killing blow by quoting a
   precept--"It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him
   only shall you serve." If the precept had not been handy, with what
   would the adversary have been rebuked?

   Nor is a threat at all a weak weapon. The most terrible threats of
   God's Word against sin are the best helps for Christians when they are
   tempted to sin--"How can I do this great wickedness and sin against
   God? How should I escape if I turned away from Him that speaks from
   Heaven?" Tell Satan the threats and make him tremble! Every Word of God
   is life to holiness and death to sin. Use the Word as your sword and
   shield--there is none like it! Now notice that John not only mentions
   "the Word of God," but the Word of God "in you." The inspired Word must
   be received into a willing mind. How? The Book which lies there is to
   be pleaded here, in the inmost heart, by the work of the Holy Spirit
   upon the mind. All of this letter has to be translated into spirit and
   life. "The Word of God abides in you"--that is, first to know it--next
   to remember it and treasure it up in your heart. Following upon this,
   we must understand it, learn the

   analogy of faith by comparing spiritual things with spiritual till we
   have learned the system of Divine Truth and more able to set it forth
   and plead for it.

   It is, next, to have the word in your affections--to love it so that it
   is as honey or the droppings of the honeycomb to you. When this is the
   case, you must and shall overcome the Wicked One! A man instructed in
   the Scriptures is like an armed knight, who, when he goes among the
   throng, inflicts many a wound, but suffers none, for he is locked up in
   steel. Yes, but that is not all! It is not the Word of God in you,
   alone, it is, "the Word of God abides in you." It is always there, it
   cannot be removed from you! If a man gets the Bible right into him, he
   is all right, then, because he is full, and there is no room for evil!
   When you have filled a measure full of wheat, you have effectually shut
   the chaff out. Men go after novel and false doctrines because they do
   not really know the Truth of God; for if the Truth had gotten into them
   and filled them, they would not have room for these daydreams!

   A man who truly knows the Doctrines of Grace is never removed from
   them. I have heard our opponents rave at what they call the obstinacy
   of our Brothers and Sisters. Once get the Truth of God really into you,
   it will enter into the texture of your being and nothing will get it
   out of you! It will also be your strength, by setting you watching
   against every evil thing. You will be on your guard if the Word of God
   abides in you, for it is written, "When you go it will keep you." The
   Word of God will be to you a bulwark and a high tower, a castle of
   defense against the foe! Oh, see to it that the Word of God is in you,
   in your very soul, permeating your thoughts and so operating upon your
   outward life, that all may know you to be a true Bible-Christian, for
   they perceive it in your words and deeds! This is the sort of army that
   we need in the Church of God--men that are strong by feeding on God's
   Word! Aspire to it, my Brothers and Sisters, and when you have reached
   it, then aspire unto the third degree that you may become fathers in
   Israel!

   Up to this measure, at any rate, let us endeavor to advance, and
   advance at once. Are there any here who are not young men in Christ
   Jesus because they are not in Christ Jesus at all? I cannot speak with
   you this morning, for my time is gone, but I am distressed for you. To
   be out of Christ is such an awful thing that a man had better to be out
   of existence! Without God, without Christ--then you are without joy in
   life or hope in death! Not even a babe in the Divine family! Then know
   this, that God shall judge those that are outside and when He comes,
   how swift and overwhelming will that judgment be! Inasmuch as you would
   not have Christ in this day, Christ will not have you in that day! Stay
   not out of Christ any longer! Seek His face and live, for, "He that
   believes in Him has everlasting life." May you be enabled to believe in
   Him at this moment, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

The Bridegroom's Parting Words

   (No. 1716)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 15, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You that dwells in the gardens, the companions hearken to your voice:
   cause Me to hear it." Song of Solomon 8:13.

   THE Song is almost ended--the bride and Bridegroom have come to their
   last stanzas--and they are about to part for a while. They utter their
   adieus and the Bridegroom says to His beloved, "You that dwells in the
   gardens, the companions hearken to your voice: cause Me to hear it." In
   other words, when I am far away from you, fill this garden with My name
   and let your heart commune with Me. She promptly replies, and it is her
   last word till He comes, "Make haste, my Beloved, and be You like a roe
   or a young hart upon the mountains of spices." These farewell words of
   the Well-Beloved are very precious to His chosen bride. Last words are
   always noticed--the last words of those who loved us dearly are much
   valued--the last words of one who loved us to the death are worthy of a
   deathless memory.

   The last words of the Lord in this canticle remind me of the commission
   which the Master gave to His disciples right before He was taken up,
   when He said to them, "Go you into all the world and preach the Gospel
   to every creature." Then, scattering benedictions with both His hands,
   He ascended into Glory and, "a cloud received Him out of their sight."
   As the sermon progresses you will see why I say this and you will
   detect a striking likeness between the commission connected with the
   Ascension and the present adieu, in which the spiritual Solomon says to
   His espoused Solyma, "You that dwells in the gardens, the companions
   hearken to your voice: cause Me to hear it."

   I. We will get to our text at once, without further preface, and we
   notice in it, first of all, AN APPOINTED RESIDENCE. The Bridegroom,
   speaking of His bride, says, "You that dwells in the gardens." The
   Hebrew is in the feminine and, therefore, we are bound to regard it as
   the word of the Bridegroom to His bride. It is the mystical word of the
   Church's Lord to His elect one! He calls her "Inhabitress of the
   gardens"--that is the word. So then, dear Friends, we who make up the
   Church of God are here addressed, this morning, under that term, "You
   that inhabits the gardens."

   This title is given to Believers here on earth, first, by way of
   distinction--distinction from the Lord, Himself. He whom we love dwells
   in the ivory palaces in which they make Him glad. He is gone up to His
   Father's Throne and has left these gardens down below. He came down
   awhile that He might look upon His garden, that He might see how the
   vines flourished and gather lilies. But He has now returned to His
   Father and our Father. He watered the soil of His garden with His
   bloody sweat in Gethsemane and made it to bear fruit unto life by being
   Himself laid to sleep in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea--but all this
   lowly work is now over.

   He does not dwell in the gardens as to His corporeal Presence. His
   dwelling place is on the Throne of God. Jesus has not taken us up with
   Him--He will come another time to do that--but now He leaves us among
   the seeds and flowers and growing plants to do the King's work until He
   comes. He was a visitor here and the visit cost Him dearly. But He has
   gone back unto the place from where He came, having finished the work
   which His Father gave Him. Our lifework is not finished and, therefore,
   we must tarry a while below and be known as inhabitants of the gardens.
   It is expedient that we should be here, even as it is expedient that He
   should not be here.

   God's Glory is to come of our sojourn here, otherwise He would have
   taken us away long ago. He said to His Father, "I pray not that You
   should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from
   the Evil One." He Himself is an inhabitant of the palaces, for there He
   best accomplishes the eternal purposes of love. But His Church is the
   inhabitress of the gardens, for there she best fulfils the decrees of
   the Most High. Here she must abide, awhile, until all the will of the
   Lord shall be accomplished in her and by her--and then she, also, shall
   be taken up and shall dwell with her Lord above. The title is given by
   way of distinction and marks the difference between her condition and
   that of her Lord.

   Next, it is given by way of enjoyment. She dwells in the gardens, which
   are places of delight. Once you and I pined in the wilderness and
   sighed after God from a barren land. We trusted in man, made flesh our
   arm and then we were like the heath in the desert which sees not when
   good comes. All around us was the wilderness of this world, a howling
   wilderness of danger, need and disorder! We said of the world at its
   very best, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." Do you remember how you
   roamed, seeking rest and finding none? Your way was the path of
   darkness which leads to death! Then you were poor and needy--and sought
   water and there was none--and your tongue cleaved unto the roof of your
   mouth for thirst.

   Then came the Lord that bought you and He sought you until He brought
   you into the gardens of His love where He satisfied you with the river
   of the Water of Life, and filled you with the fruits of His Spirit! And
   now you dwell in a goodly land--"The fountain of Jacob shall be upon a
   land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew." Your
   portion is with the Lord's saints, yes, with Himself! And what can be a
   better portion? Is it not as the gardens of the Lord? You dwell where
   the great Husbandman spends His care upon you and takes a pleasure in
   you. You dwell where the infinite skill and tenderness and wisdom of
   God manifest themselves in the training of the plants which His own
   right hand has planted. You dwell in the Church of God which is laid
   out, in due order, and hedged about and guarded by heavenly power! And
   you are, therefore, most fitly said to dwell in the gardens.

   Be thankful! It is a place of enjoyment for you! Awake and sing, for
   the lines have fallen unto you in pleasant places. Just as Adam was put
   into the Garden of Eden for his own happiness, so are you put into the
   garden of the Church for your comfort. It is not a perfect paradise of
   bliss, but it has many points of likeness to Paradise--for God Himself
   walks there, the river of God waters it, and the Tree of Life is there
   unguarded by the flaming sword! Is it not written, "I the Lord do keep
   it: I will water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I will keep it
   night and day"? See, Beloved, although you are distinguished from your
   Lord by being here while He is there, yet you are made partakers of His
   joy and are not as those who are banished into a salt land to die in
   desolation! The Lord's joy is in His people and you are made to have a
   joy in them, also--the excellent of the earth, in who is all your
   delight, are made to be the comrades of your sojourning!

   The title is also used by way of employment as well as enjoyment. Adam
   was not put in the garden that he might simply walk through its
   borders, admire its flowers and taste its fruits. He was placed there
   to keep it and to dress it. There was sufficient work to be done to
   prevent his stagnating from lack of occupation. He had not to toil
   sufficiently to make him wipe the sweat from his brow, for that came of
   the curse--"In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread"--but still,
   he was not permitted to be idle, for that might have been a worse
   curse. Even for a perfect man, unbroken leisure would not be a
   blessing. It is essential, even, to an unfallen creature that he should
   have work to do--fit work and honorable-- seeing it is done by a
   creature for the great Benefactor who had created him.

   If we had not our daily tasks to fulfill, rest would corrode into rust
   and recreation would soon gender corruption. You and I are set in the
   garden of the Church because there is work for us to do which will be
   beneficial to others and to ourselves. Some have to take the broad axe
   and hew down mighty trees of error. Others of a feebler sort can, with
   a child's hand, train the tendril of a climbing plant, or drop into its
   place a tiny seed. One may plant and another may water--one may sow and
   another gather fruit. One may cut up weeds and another prune vines. God
   has work in His Church for us all to do and He has left us here that we
   may do it! Our Lord Jesus would not keep a single saint out of Heaven
   if there were not a necessity for his being here in the lowlands, to
   trim these gardens of herbs and watch these beds of spices. Would He
   deny His well-beloved the palm branch and the crown if it were not
   better for us to be holding the pruning-hook and the spade?

   A schoolbook with which to teach the little children may be, for a
   while, more to our true advantage than a golden harp. To turn over the
   pages of Scripture with which to instruct the people of God may be more
   profitable to us than to hear the song of seraphim. I say, the Master's
   love to His own which prompted Him to pray, "I will that they, also,
   whom You have given Me be with Me where I am, that they may behold My
   Glory," would long ago have drawn all the blood-bought up to Himself,
   had it not been the fact that it is, in infinite wisdom, seen to be
   better that they should abide in the flesh. You are the lights of the
   world, you are the salt of the earth! Shall the light and the salt be
   at once withdrawn? You are to be as a dew from the Lord in this dry and
   thirsty land! Would you be at once exhaled?

   Brothers, have you found out what you have to do in these gardens?
   Sisters, have you found out the plants for which you are to care? If
   not, awaken yourselves and let not a moment pass till you have
   discovered your duty and your place!

   Speak unto Him who is the Lord of all true servants and say to Him,
   "Show me what You would have me do. Point out, I pray You, the place in
   which I may serve You." Would you have it said of you that you were a
   wicked and slothful servant? Shall it be told that you dwelt in the
   gardens and allowed the grass to grow up to your ankles, and suffered
   the thorns and the thistles to multiply until your land became as the
   sluggard's vineyard, pointed at as a disgrace and a warning to all that
   passed by? "O you that dwells in the gardens!" The title sets forth
   constant and engrossing employment.

   Dear Friends, it means, also, eminence. I know many Christian people
   who do not feel that they dwell in the gardens. They reside in a
   certain town or village where the Gospel may be preached, but not in
   demonstration of the Spirit and in power. A little Gospel is made to go
   a long way with some preachers. In some ministries there is no life or
   power, no unction or savor. The people who meet under such preaching
   are cold of heart and dull in spirit. The Prayer Meetings are
   forgotten; communion of saints has well-near died out and there is a
   general deadness as to Christian effort. Believe me, it is a dreadful
   thing when Christian people have almost to dread their Sabbath days!
   And I have known this to be the case. When you are called to hard toil
   through the six days of the week you need a good spiritual meal on the
   Sabbath, and if you get it, you find a blessed compensation and
   refreshment. Is it not a heavenly joy to sit still on the one day of
   rest and to be fed with the finest of the wheat?

   I have known men made capable of bearing great trials--personal,
   relative, pecuniary and the like--because they have looked backward
   upon one Sabbatic feast and then forward to another! They have said in
   their hour of trouble-- "Patience, my heart! The Lord's Day is coming,
   when I shall drink and forget my misery. I shall go and sit with God's
   people and I shall have fellowship with the Father and with the Son.
   And my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness till I praise
   the Lord with joyful lips." But what a sorry case to dread Sunday and
   to mutter, "I shall get nothing next Sunday any more than I did last
   Sunday except some dry, philosophical essay, or a heap of the childish
   toys and fireworks of oratory--or the same dull mumbling of a
   mechanical orthodoxy." Oh, Brothers and Sisters, my text is scarcely
   meant for those who dwell in such deserts, but it speaks with emphasis
   to those who dwell where sweet spiritual fruits are plentiful, where
   odors and perfumes load the air, where the land flows with milk and
   honey!

   If any of you happen to dwell where Christ is set forth evidently
   crucified among you and where your hearts leap for very joy because the
   King, Himself, comes near to feast His saints and make them glad in His
   Presence, then it is to you that my text has a voice and a call--"You
   that dwells in the gardens, in the choicest places of all Immanuel's
   land, let Me hear your voice." Yet one more word. The title here
   employed is not only for eminence but for permanence. "O you that
   dwells in the gardens." If you are only permitted to enjoy sound Gospel
   teaching, now and then, and then are forced to cry, "It may be another
   12 months before I shall be again fed on royal dainties," then you are
   in a trying case and you need to cry to God for help! But blessed are
   those who dwell in the good land and daily fill their homers with
   heavenly manna. "Blessed are they that dwell in Your house: they will
   be still praising You."

   No spot on earth is so dear to the Christian as that whereon he meets
   His Lord. I can understand why the Jew asked of a certain town that was
   recommended to him as good for business, "Is there a synagogue there?"
   Being a devout man, and finding that there was no synagogue, he said he
   would rather remain where trade was dull, but where he could go with
   his brethren to worship. Is it not so with us? How my heart has longed
   for these blessed assemblies! Give me a crust and a full Gospel rather
   than all riches and a barren ministry! The profitable hearing of the
   Word of God is the greatest enjoyment upon earth to godly men! It would
   be banishment to go where every week's business turned into a mint of
   money if one were also compelled to be a member of an unhappy,
   quarrelsome, or inactive Church!

   Our greatest joy is in you, O Jerusalem! Let our tongue cleave to the
   roof of our mouth if we prefer you not above our greatest joy!--

   "How charming is the place Where my Redeemer God

   Unveils the beauties of His face, And sheds His love abroad! Not the
   fair palaces,

   To which the great resort,

   Are once to be compared with this,

   Where Jesus holds His court."

   Beloved, if you dwell in the gardens you have a double privilege, not
   only of being found in a fat and fertile place, but in living there
   continually! You might well forego a thousand comforts for the sake of
   this one delight, for under the Gospel your soul is made to drink of
   wines on the lees well refined. This, then, is my first head--appointed
   residence--"You that dwells in the gardens." Is not this a choice abode
   for the Lord's beloved? I leave you to judge how far this describes
   yourselves. If it is your case, then listen to what the Bridegroom has
   to say to you.

   II. Secondly, let us note the RECORDED CONVERSATION--"You that dwells
   in the gardens, the companions hearken to your voice." She was in the
   gardens, but she was not quiet there and why should she be? God gives
   us tongues on purpose that they should be used. As He made birds to
   sing, stars to shine and rivers to flow, so has He made men and women
   to converse with one another to His Glory. Our tongue is the glory of
   our frame and there would be no glory in its being forever dumb. The
   monks of La Trappe, who maintain perpetual silence, do no more than the
   rocks among which they labor! When God makes bells, He means to ring
   them! It may be thought to be a desirable thing that some should speak
   less, but it is still more desirable that they should speak better.
   When the tongue indites a good matter, it is no fault if it is nimble
   as the pen of a ready writer. It is not the quantity, it is the quality
   of what we say that ought to be considered.

   Now, observe that evidently the spouse held frequent conversations with
   her companions--"The companions hearken to your voice." She frequently
   conversed with them. I hope it is so among those of you who dwell in
   this part of Christ's garden. It should be so--"Then they that feared
   the Lord spoke often one to another"--they had not, now and then, a
   crack; now and then the passing of the time of day, but they held
   frequent fellowship! Heaven will consist largely in the communion of
   saints, and if we would enjoy Heaven, below, we must carry out the
   words of the creed in our practice--"I believe in the communion of
   saints." Let us show that we believe in it! Some persons sit still in
   their pews till the time to go--and then walk down the aisle in
   majestic isolation, as if they were animated statues! Do children thus
   come in and out of their father's house with never a word for their
   brothers and sisters? I know professors who float through life like
   icebergs from whom it is safest to keep clear--surely these partake not
   of the spirit of Christ! It is well when such icebergs are drawn into
   the Gulf Stream of Divine Love and melt away into Christ and His
   people!

   There should be among those who are children of the common Father a
   mutual love! And they should show this by frequent commerce in their
   precious things, making a sacred barter with one another. I like to
   hear them making sacred exchanges--one mentioning his trials--another
   quoting his deliverances! One telling how God has answered prayer and
   another recording how the Word of God has come to him with power. Such
   conversation ought to be as usual as the talk of children of one
   family.

   And next, it should be willing and influential, for if you notice, it
   is put here--"You that dwells in the gardens, the companions hearken to
   your voice." They do not merely hear it, and say to themselves, "I wish
   she would be quiet," but they listen--they lend an ear, they listen
   gladly! I know some Christians whose lips feed many. I could mention
   Brothers and Sisters who drop pearls from their lips whenever they
   speak. We still have among us Chrysostoms, or men of golden mouths--you
   cannot be with them for half an hour without being enriched! Their
   anointing is manifest, for it spreads to all around them. When the
   Spirit of God makes our communications sweet, then the more of them the
   better! I like to get, sometimes, under the shadow of God's best
   people, the fathers in Israel, and to hear what they have to say to the
   honor of the name of the Lord. We who are young men feel gladdened by
   the testimonies of the ancients! And as for the babes in Grace, they
   look up to the gray-beards and gather strength from their words of
   experience and Grace.

   If there are any here whose language is such that others delight to
   listen to it, it is to such that my text is especially addressed--and
   when I come to open up the later part of it, I want you that have the
   honeyed tongues--I want you who are listened to with pleasure, to
   notice how the Beloved says to you--"The companions hearken to your
   voice: cause Me to hear it." Give your Lord a share of your sweet
   utterances! Let your Savior's ears be charmed as well as your
   companions ears! Come, speak to Him as well as to your Brothers and
   Sisters, and if there is music in your voice, let that music be for the
   Well-Beloved as well as for your fellow servants!

   This is the very heart of the matter! I cannot help alluding to it even
   before we have fairly reached that part of the text. The conversation
   of the bride in the gardens was constant and it was greatly esteemed by
   those who enjoyed it. I gather from the text, rather by implication,
   than otherwise, that the conversation was commendable, for the
   Bridegroom does not say to the spouse, "You that dwells in the gardens,
   your companions hear too much of your voice." No! He evi-

   dently mentions the fact with approval because He draws an argument
   from it why He should also hear that same voice! Brothers and Sisters,
   I leave it to yourselves to judge whether your communications with one
   another are always such as they should be. Are they always worthy of
   you?

   What communications have you had this morning? Can I make a guess?
   "Nice and fresh this morning." "Quite a change in the weather." Is not
   this the style? How often we instruct each other about what we already
   know! When it rains so as to soak our garments, we gravely tell each
   other that it is very wet! Yes, and if the sun shines, we are all eager
   to communicate the wonderful information that it is warm! Dear me, what
   instructors of our generation we are! Could we not contrive to change
   the subject? Is it because we have nothing to say of love, Grace and
   the Truth of God that we meet and part without learning or teaching
   anything? Perhaps so. I wish we had a little more small change of
   heavenly conversation--we have our crowns and sovereigns for the
   pulpit--we need silver and pence for common talk, all stamped with the
   image and superscription of the King of Heaven!

   O Holy Spirit, enrich us after this sort! May our communications be
   such that if Jesus were near, we might not be ashamed for Him to hear
   our voices! Brothers and Sisters, make your conversation such that it
   may be commended by Christ Himself! These conversations were, no doubt,
   very beneficial. As iron sharpens iron, so does a man's countenance his
   friend. Oh, what a comfort it is to drop in upon a cheerful person when
   you, yourself, are heavy! What a ballast it puts into your ship, when
   you are a little too merry, to meet with one in sore travail who bids
   you share his burden and emulate his faith. We are all the better,
   believe me, when our Lord can praise us because our companions listen
   to our voices! In fact, our communications with one another ought to be
   preparatory to still higher communications! The conversation of saints
   on earth should be a rehearsal of their everlasting communion in
   Heaven. We should begin, here, to be to one another what we hope to be
   to one another world without end.

   And is it not pleasant to rise from communion with your Brothers and
   Sisters into communion with the Bride-groom?--to have such talk with
   one another that, at last, we perceive that truly our fellowship is
   with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ? We thought that we only
   communed with our Brothers and Sisters, but we see that the Lord,
   Himself, is here! Do not our hearts burn within us? We two are talking
   of Him and now we see that He, Himself, is here, opening to us the
   Scriptures, and opening our hearts to receive those Scriptures in the
   power of them! Beloved, let us try, if we cannot make it so, that as we
   dwell together as Church members and work together in one common
   vineyard, we may be always making our fellowship with each other a
   grand staircase of fellowship with the King, Himself! Let us so talk
   that we may expect to meet Jesus while we are talking!

   How sweet to hear and see the Master in the servant, the Bridegroom in
   the Bridegroom's friend, the Head in the members, the Shepherd in the
   sheep, the Christ in every Christian! Thus may we rise upon the wings
   of hallowed communion with holy ones to yet more hallowed communion
   with the Holy One of Israel! Thus have we meditated upon two things--we
   have noted the appointed residence and the recorded conversation. We
   know what we are talking about!

   III. Now comes the pith of the text--INVITED FELLOWSHIP--"The
   companions hear your voice: cause Me to hear it." It is beautiful to
   hear the Beloved say in effect, "I am going away from you and you shall
   see Me no more; but I shall see you: do not forget Me. Though you will
   not hear My voice with your bodily ears, I shall hear your voices:
   therefore speak to Me. Unseen I shall feed among the lilies;
   unperceived I shall walk the garden in the cool of the day: when you
   are talking to others do not forget Me. Sometimes turns aside and when
   you have shut the door, and no eye can see, nor ear can hear, then let
   Me hear your voice: it has music in it to My heart, for I died to give
   you life. Let Me hear the voice of your prayers and praise and love."

   Now, I note concerning this invitation, first of all, that it is very
   loving and condescending to us that the Lord should wish to hear our
   voice! I do not wonder that some of you love to hear my voice, because
   the Holy Spirit has blessed it to your conversion--but what good has
   Jesus ever derived from any of us? Is it not marvelous that He, the
   infinitely blessed, should want to hear our voices when all that He has
   heard from us has been begging, sighing and a few poor broken hymns?
   You do not want to hear a beggar's voice, do you? I expect if the man
   you have helped a score of times should be, tomorrow morning, at your
   door, you would say, "Dear, dear; there is that man again." Might not
   the Well-Beloved say the same of you? "There she is again: come on the
   same errand. Come to confess some new faults, or to ask fresh favors."

   But instead of being tired of us, our Lord says, "Let Me hear your
   voice." O loving Bridegroom! Must He not love us very truly to ask us
   to speak with Him? Look, He asks as though He begged it of us as a
   favor, "Let Me hear your voice. Your companions listen--let Me take a
   share in their communion--they find your voice pleasant, let it be a
   pleasure, also, to Me. Come, do not deny Me, your heart's best Beloved!
   Do not be silent unto Me! Come, speak to Me with your own sweet mouth."
   It is condescending and gracious and yet how natural it is! How like
   Christ! Love always seeks the company of that which it loves! What
   would a husband say if his wife were seen to be chatty and cheerful to
   everybody else, but never spoke to him? I cannot suppose such a case!
   It would make too sorrowful a household. I should pity the poor,
   broken-hearted man who should be forced to say, "My Beloved, others
   hear your voice and admire it; will you not speak to me, your husband?"

   Believer, will you let the Lord Jesus, as it were, with tears in His
   eyes, say to you, "You talk to everybody but to Me! You lay yourself
   out to please everybody but Me! You are a charming companion to
   everybody but to Me"? Oh, our Beloved, how ill have we treated You! How
   much have we slighted You! In looking back, I fear there are many of us
   who must feel as if this gentle Word of the Lord had also a sharp side
   to it. I remember my faults this day. The text goes like a dagger to my
   soul, for I have spoken all day long to others and have had scarcely a
   word for Him whom my soul loves! Let us mend our conversation and from
   now on show our Lord a truer love. We may truly add that this
   invitation to fellowship is a blessed and profitable request. We shall
   find it so if we carry it out, especially those of us who are called by
   God to use our voices for Him among the crowds of our companions.

   1 address some Brothers and Sisters, here, who are preachers and
   teachers. What a relief it is, when you have been letting the
   companions hear your voice, to stop a bit and let Jesus hear it! What a
   rest to leave the congregation for the closet, to get away from where
   they criticize you to One who delights in you! What a relief, I say!
   And what a help to our hearts! Jesus gives us sweet returns if we
   commune with Him--and such as speakers greatly need. The Apostles said
   that they would give themselves to the Word of God and to prayer. Yes,
   we must put those two things together. We shall never totally handle
   the Word of God without prayer. When we pray, we are taught how to
   speak the Word of God to others.

   Salvation and supplication are a blessed pair. Put the two together so
   that, when you speak to others about salvation, you do it after having
   baptized your own soul into supplication! "The companions hear your
   voice: cause Me to hear it. Before you speak with them, speak to Me.
   While you are still speaking with them, speak with Me. And when your
   speaking to men is done, return unto your rest and again speak with
   Me." This invitation is a many-sided one, for when the Bridegroom says,
   "Cause Me to hear it," He means that she should speak to Him in all
   sorts of ways. Frequently we should be heard in praise. If you have
   been praising the Lord in the audience of others, turn aside and praise
   Him to His face! Sing your song to your Beloved, Himself! Get into a
   quiet place and sing where only He can hear. I wish we had more of that
   kind of music which does not care for any other audience than God.

   Oh, my God, my heart shall find You and every string shall have its
   attribute to sing while my whole being shall extol You, my Lord! The
   blessed Virgin had none with her but Elizabeth when she sang, "My soul
   does magnify the Lord, and my spirit does rejoice in God, my Savior."
   Oh, let the Lord hear your voice! Get up early to be alone with Him. So
   let it be with all your complaints and petitions--let them be for Jesus
   only. Too often we fill our follow creature's ears with the sad tale of
   all our cares. Why not tell the Lord about it and have done with it? We
   would employ our time far more profitably if, instead of murmuring in
   the tent, we enquired in the Temple. Speak with Jesus Christ, dear
   Friends, in little broken sentences, by way of frequent pleas!

   The best of Christian fellowship may be carried on in single syllables!
   When in the middle of business you can whisper, "My Lord and my God!"
   You can dart a glance upward, heave a sigh, or let fall a tear--and so
   will Jesus hear your voice! When nobody observes the motion of your
   lips, you may be saying, "My Beloved, be near me now!" This is the kind
   of fellowship which your Savior asks of you! He says, "The companions
   hear your voice: cause Me to hear it. Be sure that when you speak with
   others, you also speak with Me." This is such a blessed invitation that
   I think, dear Friends, we ought to avail ourselves of it at once! Come,
   what do you say? The best Beloved asks us to speak with Him--what shall
   we say? Think for an instant! What shall I say? Perhaps I have the
   advantage because I have my words ready! Here they are--"Make haste, my
   Beloved, and be You like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of
   spices."

   "Why," you say, "that is what the Church said in the last verse of the
   Song!" Exactly so, and that is what we may wisely say at this moment.
   We cannot improve upon it! "Come quickly; even so, come quickly, Lord
   Jesus." Often and often, then, when you are about your business, say,
   "Come, Lord Jesus! Come quickly! "It is a sweet frame of mind to be in
   to be willing to invite Christ to come--and whenever you cannot do so,
   let it be a warning to you that you are in dangerous waters! I can
   imagine a man in business calling himself a Christian about to engage
   in a doubtful transaction-- how is he to discern the danger? Let him
   ask the Lord Jesus Christ to come while he is doing it! "Oh dear, no,"
   cries one, "I had rather He should not come until that matter is
   finished and forgotten!"

   Then be you sure that you are moving in the wrong direction! Suppose
   you think of going to a certain place of amusement about which you have
   a question? It is easy to decide it thus--When you take your seat, your
   first thing should be to bow your head and ask for a blessing. And then
   say, "Lord, here I sit waiting for Your appearing." "Oh," you say, "I
   should not want the Lord to come there." Of course you would not! Then
   do not go where you could not wish your Lord to find you! My text may
   thus be a monitor to you, to keep you from the paths of the Destroyer.
   Jesus says, "Let Me hear your voice," and let your voice utter these
   desires--"Even so, come quickly; come, Lord Jesus!" Alas, time reproves
   me! I must hurry on.

   IV. I have a fourth head which shall be very briefly handled. I find
   according to the Hebrew that the text has in it a REQUESTED TESTIMONY.
   According to learned interpreters, the Hebrew runs thus, "cause to hear
   Me." Now, that may mean what I have said, "Cause Me to hear," but it
   may also mean, "Cause them to hear Me." Now listen, you that are in
   Christ's garden--make those who dwell in that garden with you to hear
   from you much about HIM! In the Church everyone has a right to talk
   about the Head of the Church. Some of our Brothers and Sisters in this
   Tabernacle kindly undertake to speak to individuals about their souls
   and, now and then, they receive very sharp rebuffs. "What right has he
   to put such a question? How dare he intrude with personal remarks?
   What? Is the man poaching?"

   No, these are the Lord's preserves, and the Lord's gamekeepers have a
   right to do as they are bid by Him. They are not poaching in this
   place, for they are on the Master's own land! Anywhere inside these
   four walls you may speak to anybody about Christ and no man may forbid
   you! Speak lovingly and tenderly and prudently, but certainly the law
   of the house is that here we may speak about the Lord of the House!
   There are some other things you may not talk about, but about the Lord
   Jesus you may speak as much as you will. In the garden, at any rate, if
   not in the wilderness, let the Rose of Sharon be sweetly spoken of! Let
   His name be as an ointment poured forth in all the Church of God.

   Again, you, according to the text, are one that can make people hear,
   so that, "the companions hearken to your voice." Then make them hear of
   Jesus! You have the gift of speech--use it for Christ Crucified! I
   always feel regret when a powerful speaker espouses any other cause but
   that of my Lord. Time was when I used to wish that Milton had been a
   preacher and, instead of writing a poem, had proclaimed the Gospel to
   the multitude. I know better, now, for I perceive that God does not use
   learning and eloquence so much as knowledge of Christ and plain speech.
   But still, I am jealous of any man who can speak well, that he should
   not give my Lord the use of his tongue. Well-trained tongues are rare
   things, and they should be all consecrated to Christ's Glory! If you
   can speak to the companions--make them hear about Christ! If you can
   speak well, make them hear attractive words about Christ!

   If you do not speak about Christ to strangers, do speak to your
   companions. They will listen to you! Therefore let them listen to the
   Word of the Lord. I have heard of men who called themselves Christians,
   yet who never spoke to their children about their souls; never spoke to
   their servants nor to their work people about Jesus and His love! This
   is to murder souls! If tongues can bless and do not, then they, in
   effect, curse men by their silence! If you have a voice, make the name
   of Jesus to be sounded out all around you. Many are the voices that
   strike upon the ear--the world is full of noise even to distraction,
   yet the name which is above all other names is scarcely heard! I pray
   you, my Brethren, you that are like silver bells, ring out that name
   over hill and dale! As with a clarion, trumpet forth the saving name of
   Jesus till the deaf hear the sound!

   Whatever is left out of your testimony, be sure that Christ Crucified
   is first and last in it. Love Christ and live Christ! Think of Christ
   and speak of Christ! When people go away from hearing you preach, may
   they have to say, "He kept to his subject--he knew nothing but Jesus."
   It is ill when a man has to say of preachers, "They have taken away my
   Lord and I know not where they have laid Him!" Yet in certain sermons
   you meet with a little about everything except the one thing. They
   offer us what we do not need and the need of the soul is not supplied.
   Oh, my Brothers, cause Christ to be

   heard! Hammer on that anvil always! If you make no music but that of
   the harmonious blacksmith, it will suffice. Ring it out with sturdy
   blows--"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus Crucified!" Hammer away at that!

   "Now you are on the right string, man," said the Duke of Argyle, when
   the preacher came to speak upon the Lord Jesus. It needed no duke to
   certify that! Harp on that string! Make Jesus to be as commonly known
   as now He is commonly unknown! So may God bless you as long as you
   dwell in these gardens, till the day breaks and the shadows flee away.
   Amen.

The Marvelous Magnet

   (No. 1717)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON,

   "I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me. This
   He said, signifying what death He should die." John 12:32,33.

   On an evening when the regular hearers left their seats to be occupied
   by strangers.

   JESUS is the spokesman here. He tells of His own death by crucifixion
   and of the result which will follow. It appears, then, that our Lord's
   power to draw all men to Himself lies mainly in His death. By being
   lifted up from the earth upon the Cross, He was made to die and He also
   was made to draw all men unto Himself. There is an attractive power
   about our Lord's Person, about His life and about His teaching. But,
   still, the main attractive force lies in His death upon the Cross! Most
   certainly this is rare and strange, for when a great religious leader
   dies, a large measure of his personal power is gone. The charm of the
   man's manner, the impressiveness of his personal conviction, the lofty
   tone of his daily enthusiasm--these are immense helps to a cause while
   they are with us! But to lose them is a fearful drawback such as makes
   it perilous for a religious leader to die.

   Men may remember a leader's life for a time after his death--they will
   do so most emphatically if he has been eminently good. We say of the
   righteous--"Even in their ashes live their habitual fires." From many a
   tomb there rises a silent voice more eloquent than the choicest
   speech--"He being dead yet speaks." But there is a measure and boundary
   to the influence of a mere memory. How often is it the case that, after
   a little while, the leader having gone, the feebler folk gradually drop
   away; the hypocritical openly desert; the lukewarm wander and so the
   cause dies out. The man's successors desert his principles, or maintain
   them with but little life and energy and, therefore, what was once a
   hopeful effort expires like a dying taper. For a man's work to prosper
   it is not desirable that he should die.

   Is it not strange that what is so often fatal to the influence of other
   men is a gain to our Lord Jesus Christ? For it is by His death that He
   possesses His most powerful influence over the sons of men! Because
   Jesus died, He is, this day, the mightiest ruler of human minds, the
   great center to which all hearts are being drawn! Remember, too, that
   our Lord Jesus Christ died by a most shameful death. We have come to
   use the cross as an ornament and, by some, it is regarded as an object
   of reverence. But the cross, to speak very plainly, was to the ancients
   what the gallows are to us--an odious instrument of death for
   felons--exactly that and no more!

   The death on a cross was one never allotted to a Roman citizen except
   for certain heinous crimes. It was regarded as the death penalty of a
   slave. It was not only painful, it was disgraceful and ignominious. And
   to say that a man was crucified was, in our Lord's time, exactly
   tantamount to saying in our speech today that he was hanged. It means
   just that-- and you must accept the death of the cross with all the
   shame that can be connected with the gallows and the tree of death, or
   else you will not understand what it meant to Jesus and His disciples.

   Now, surely, if a man is hanged, there is an end to his influence among
   men. When I was looking through all the Bible commentaries in the
   English language, I found one with a title page attributing it to Dr.
   Coke. But on further examination I perceived that it was the commentary
   of Dr. Dodd, who was executed for forgery! After He had been hanged, of
   course the publishers could not sell a commentary under his name and so
   they engaged another learned doctor to take it under his wing. The man
   was hanged and, therefore, people would not read his book--and you are
   not at all surprised that it should be so.

   But here is an amazing thing. The Lord Jesus has lost no influence by
   having been hanged upon the Cross! No, rather it is because of His
   shameful death that He is able to draw all men unto Himself! His Glory
   rises from His humiliation! His adorable conquest from His ignominious
   death! When He "became obedient unto death, even the death of the
   Cross," shame cast no shame upon His cause, but gilded it with Glory!
   Christ's death of weakness threw no weakness into

   Christianity! Say rather that it is the right arm of her power! By the
   sign of suffering unto death, the Church has conquered and will conquer
   still! By a love which is strong as death, she has always been
   victorious and must, forever, remain so. When she has not been ashamed
   to put the Cross in the forefront, she has never had to be ashamed, for
   God has been with her and Jesus has drawn all men to Himself.

   The Crucified Christ has irresistible attractions--when He stoops into
   the utmost suffering and scorn, even the brutal must relent--a living
   Savior men may love, but a crucified Savior they must love! If they
   perceive that He loved them and gave Himself for them, their hearts are
   stolen away--the city of Mansoul is captured before the siege begins
   when the Prince Emanuel uncovers the beauties of His dying love before
   the eyes of the rebellious ones! Let us never be ashamed, dear Friends,
   to preach Christ Crucified--the Son of God lifted up to die among the
   condemned! Let those of us who teach in the Sunday school, or preach at
   the street corner, or in any other manner try to set forth the Gospel,
   always keep a dying Christ to the front!

   Christ without the Cross is no Christ at all. Never forget this! He is
   the eternal God, but bind with that Truth of God the fact that He was
   nailed to a Roman cross. It is on the tree He triumphed over Satan and
   it is by the Cross that He must triumph over the world. "I, if I am
   lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me. This He said,
   signifying what death He should die." The great Truth of the text I
   have stated to you--let me enlarge thereon.

   I. I shall try to speak, first, upon the ATTRACTIVE FORCE WHICH LIES IN
   A CRUCIFIED SAVIOR. You will observe that it is briefly summed up in
   these words--Himself to Himself. "I will draw all men unto Me." It is
   not written that Christ will draw all men to the visible Church, for
   the universal profession of our holy faith is slow enough in coming.
   Certainly the Lord Jesus Christ will not lend Himself out to draw men
   to your sect or to mine. He will draw always towards truth and
   righteousness, but not to dead forms or meaningless distinctions--nor
   to the memories of former wrongs or party victories.

   If the Lord should draw men to the Cathedral or the Tabernacle, the
   Abbey or the Chapel, it would be of little service to them, unless, in
   each case they found Him! The main thing that is needed is that they be
   drawn to Him and none can draw them to Him but Him. Himself drawing
   them to Himself--this is the soul of the text. I dare say that you have
   heard the oft-recounted story of the missionaries among the
   Greenlanders. Our Moravian Brethren, full of fire and zeal and
   self-denial, went right away among the ignorant folk of Greenland, as
   those people then were, longing to convert them. Using large prudence,
   they thought, "These people are so benighted that it cannot be of any
   use to preach Jesus Christ to them at first. They do not even know that
   there is a God, so let us begin by teaching them the nature of the
   Deity, showing them right and wrong, proving to them the need of
   atonement for sin and setting before them the rewards of the righteous
   and the penalties of the wicked."

   This was judged to be most fit preparatory work. Watch for the result!
   They went on for years, but had no converts. What was there in all that
   fine preparatory teaching that could convert anybody? Jesus was being
   locked out of the Greenlanders' hearts by those who wanted Him to
   enter! But one day one of the missionaries happened to read to a poor
   Greenlander the story of Jesus bleeding on the Cross and how God had
   sent His Son to die, "that whoever believes in Him should not perish,
   but have everlasting life." And the Greenlander said, "Would you read
   me that again? What wonderful words! Did the Son of God die for us poor
   Greenlanders that we may live?" The missionary answered that it was
   even so and, clapping his hands, the simple native cried, "Why did you
   not tell us that before?"

   Ah, just so! Why not tell them this at once and leave it to clear its
   own path? That is the point to begin with! Let us start with the Lamb
   of God which takes away the sin of the world. "God so loved the world
   that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should
   not perish, but have everlasting life." To my mind that is the point to
   begin with and the point to go on with--yes, that is the Truth of God
   to conclude with, if there can ever be any conclusion to the grand old
   story of the Incarnate God who loved His enemies and gave Himself to
   die in their place, that they might live through Him! The Gospel is
   Jesus drawing sinners to Himself that they might live through Him!

   Dear Hearers, do you know what this means? I know that many of you do
   and you are happy, for in this knowledge there is life. Would to God
   that all knew this power of love in Christ--knew it so as to be drawn
   by almighty love to return that love with all their heart, soul and
   strength! The best thing that can happen to any of us is to feel Christ
   drawing him to Christ and to find himself sweetly yielding to the
   gentle drawing of the Savior's love! The text says that Jesus Christ
   will draw all men unto Himself. Now, all men who hear of Jesus Christ
   at all are drawn, but they do not all yield.

   Some of them pull back and the most awful thing that ever happens to a
   man is when he pulls back till Jesus lets him go! What a fall is that,
   when the drawing power is taken away, and the man fails backward into a
   destruction which he, himself has chosen, having refused eternal life
   and resisted the Savior's power!

   Unhappy is the wretch who strives against his own salvation! Every man
   that hears the Gospel feels some measure of its drawing power. I appeal
   to any one of you who has been accustomed to hear it. Does not Jesus
   sometimes tug hard at your conscience and, though you have pulled back,
   yet has He not drawn and drawn again? I remember how He drew me as a
   child and, though I drew back from Him, yet He never let me go till He
   drew me over the border line. Some of you must well remember how you
   were drawn by a mother's gentle words--by a teacher's earnest
   pleadings--by a father's admonitions--by a sister's tears--by a
   pastor's entreaties.

   Permit your memories to aid me. Bring up before your mind's eye the
   many dear ones who have broken their hearts to win you for Jesus. Yes,
   you have been drawn! I suppose that all of you have felt a measure of
   that drawing. Why, it is not merely those that hear the Gospel, but
   whole nations have been drawn, in other respects, by the all-pervading
   influence of Jesus and His love! At this instant the influence of
   Christianity is being felt in every corner of the earth to an extent
   which it is not easy to exaggerate. If I had an orator's power, I would
   picture my Savior casting golden chains of love over all nations,
   wherever the missionary goes preaching His name! The Lord is taming the
   nations as a man, by degrees, subdues wild beasts!

   Jesus is gradually drawing the heathen to Himself. He has had a long
   tug at India. That dead weight still lies in the furrow. But it must
   come! It must yield! All those that watch it know that if there is any
   cause that makes progress in India, it is the cause of Christ. The East
   appears never to move, but if there is any move, it is Christward.
   Jesus is drawing China slowly. Japan is being drawn as in a net. Where
   the testimony of Christ has been borne, the idols begin to shake and
   their priests confess that a change is coming! Every century sees a
   marked advance in the world's condition and we shall progress at a
   quicker rate, yet, when the Church wakes up to a sense of her
   responsibility and the Holy Spirit is poured out upon the Church to
   turn us all into missionaries, causing us all, in some way or other, to
   preach the Gospel of

   Christ!

   Jesus is drawing, drawing, drawing! When God meant to scatter the
   individuals of our race, they would not be scat-tered--they built a
   tower to be the center of union! And only by their tongues being so
   changed that they could not understand one another could their resolve
   to remain in one company be defeated. But now, behold, the whole earth
   has the race of men to cover it--the sons of Adam dwell in every region
   and it is the Father's will to gather together in one the redeemed of
   the Lord. Therefore He has set in their midst the great Shiloh, of whom
   it was prophesied of old, "To Him shall the gathering of the people
   be."

   The roaming races do not answer to the Father's call. They do not want
   to come to the elder Brother's rule, but they will have to come, for He
   must reign! Gentile and Jew, African and European--they shall all meet
   at the Cross, the common center of our entire manhood--for Christ is
   lifted up and He is drawing all men to Him. But all men are not saved.
   No, for when drawn they do not come. Yet Christ Crucified is drawing
   some men of all kinds and sorts to eternal life. When Jesus died on the
   Cross it was not for my lord and lady only--nor was it only for the
   working man--it was for all sorts of people--

   "While Grace is offered to the prince, The poor may take their share.
   No mortal has a just pretense To perish in despair."

   He that is best taught and instructed has often been drawn to Jesus by
   the Lord's overpowering charms. Some of the most learned of men have
   been delighted to come to Christ. But the most illiterate and rude have
   equally been drawn by Jesus and it has been their joy to come. I love
   to hear of the Gospel being preached to the poorest of the poor--and so
   preached that it reaches those who never were reached by it before.
   Godspeed every effort by which Jesus is set before the fallen and
   degraded--so long as it is the Gospel and not mere rant, we wish
   Godspeed to the most irregular of wit-nesses--our fears begin only when
   Jesus is no longer in the front!

   We greatly need to have the Gospel preached in the West of London and
   so preached that our great ones may receive it and find life through
   Jesus Christ. May such a movement soon take place! How I should like to
   hear of a converted duke telling out the Gospel, or a reclaimed Knight
   of the Garter proclaiming mercy for the chief of sinners! Why not?

   And, blessed be God, the Savior, lifted up, draws all sorts of men to
   Himself--some of every kind--not the Jew alone, as at the first, but
   the Gentile too!--

   "None are excluded but those Who do themselves exclude. Welcome the
   learned and polite, The ignorant and rude."

   There is no exclusion of any class or creature from the mercy of God in
   Christ Jesus. "I, if I am lifted up, will draw all men unto Me"--and
   the history of the Church proves how true this is--the muster roll of
   the converted includes princes and paupers, peers and pot men

   But what is this force that attracts men to the crucified Savior? They
   come--there is no doubt about it. Look, Sirs--there is nothing in the
   world that men will hear so gladly as the Gospel. How many years have I
   stood in this place to preach to a congregation precisely similar to
   the present! The crowds have been here as regularly as the hours,
   Sunday after Sunday, morning and evening, year after year! Suppose that
   I had been appointed to preach upon a scientific subject? Could I have
   gained or held such audiences? I should have been spun out a long while
   ago if I had been bound to draw upon myself for my matter. If I had
   preached any other than the doctrine of Christ Crucified, I should,
   years ago, have scattered my audience to the winds of Heaven.

   But the old theme is always new, always fresh, always attractive.
   Preach Jesus Christ! That is the recipe for catching men's ears and
   laying hold upon men's hearts. The name of Jesus is to man's heart the
   most mighty of charms--man's ears wait for it as the morning hour waits
   for the sun, or as the parched earth waits for the shower! Ring out the
   name of Jesus--it is the sweetest carol ever sung. Ring it out without
   fear or stint, for it is always welcome as the flowers in May! Men will
   never tire of it till the flowers are satiated with sunlight and the
   grass grows weary of the dew! The music of that blessed silver bell
   rings out over hill and dale as sweetly as when, on the first Christmas
   night, the angels sang, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
   peace, good will toward men."

   There is about Calvary and its infinite stoop of Divine Love a power
   that never dies out and never will while the world stands. What is it?
   From where does this universal attractiveness come? Well, first, it is
   the force of love, for Jesus Christ is Incarnate Love. In Him you see
   One who divested Himself of all His Glory that He might save the
   guilty--who came down upon earth, not seeking wealth and fame, but
   simply seeking to do good by saving men--who, having laid aside His
   honor and His Glory, at last laid aside His life! And all for love--for
   love which met a sad return--for love which has, however, saved its
   objectives with a great salvation!

   One of the school men says that whenever we know that another person
   loves us, we cannot help giving back a measure of love in return, and I
   believe that the statement is true. Certainly, such love as the love of
   Christ, when it is told out simply, and men can understand it, is
   certain to excite an interest, to win a degree of attention and so to
   lead up to better things. Full often this love proves its power over
   observers by transforming them from enemies into friends and, though
   they at first despised the Redeemer, His love compels them, at length,
   to believe and to adore! If I were asked the secret of the attracting
   power of the Crucified Savior, I would answer that it is invincible
   love.

   The only crime that ever could be laid to Jesus' charge was that of
   which the poet sings--"found guilty of excessive love"--loving beyond
   all reason and beyond all boundaries--loving as none ever loved before!
   So that if all the rivers of human love ran together, they could not
   fill such another ocean of love as was in the heart of Jesus the
   Savior! This it is--this unique, unrivaled love--which draws men to
   Jesus! The pierced heart of Christ is a loadstone to draw all other
   hearts. No doubt there is also this about the Crucified Savior--that He
   draws men by the wonderful rest which His death provides for men.

   The most earnest Christian man must, sometimes, have his doubts as to
   whether all is right with him. The more sincere a man is, the more does
   he tremble lest he should deceive himself. You, good Brother, have your
   personal anxieties; certainly I have mine. But when I turn my eyes to
   Jesus upon the Cross and view the crown of thorns, the sacred head, the
   eyes that were red with weeping, the hands nailed fast to the wood and
   the feet dripping with gore--and when I remember that this shameful
   death was endured for love of me--I am so quiet and so happy in my
   spirit that I cannot tell how peacefully my life-floods flow! God must
   forgive my grievous fault, for my Redeemer has so grievously answered
   for it!

   When I see Jesus die, I perceive that from now on Divine justice is on
   the sinner's side. How can the Lord God punish the same offense
   twice--first the Substitute--and then the men for whom that Substitute
   has bled? Christ has bled as

   Substitute for every man that believes in Him--therefore is every
   Believer safe! Oh, Brothers and Sisters, when you are troubled, rest
   with us by looking to Calvary! And if the first glance does not quiet
   you, look, and look, and look again--for every grief will die where
   Jesus died. Not to Bethlehem, where the stars of Christmas burn, do we
   look for our greatest comfort, but to that place where the sun was
   darkened at midday and the face of Eternal Love was veiled! Because the
   Lord of Life and Glory was dying in siremis, suffering the most deadly
   pain for our sakes, therefore His wounds distilled the richest balm
   that ever healed a sinner's wounds!

   Men know this. Reading their Bibles, they soon find it out. There is no
   comfort for them against the anger of God and against their guilty
   consciences, until they see Christ in their place, suffering for them.
   The conscience sees with unspeakable delight the Victim provided! She
   gladly lays her hand on Jesus' head and sees her sin transferred to
   Him, punished in Him--and thus it finds rest--the rest of God. In the
   expiatory death of Jesus, the Law is vindicated and God is "just, and
   yet the Justifier of him that believes." Dear Friends, believe me,
   Jesus bestows the peerless pearl of perfect rest on every heart that
   comes to Him! He fills the soul so that it has no more longings.

   You know the horseshoe magnet and you have seen how rapidly it picks up
   pieces of iron. Have you ever put a piece of iron right across the two
   ends of the magnet? You will then have noticed that it ceases to
   attract anything else. The magnetic circuit is completed and the magnet
   rests perfectly quiet, refusing to go beyond its own circle of pure
   content. When my soul is filled with Jesus, He completes the circuit of
   my soul's passions and longings! He is all my salvation and all my
   desire! Have you found it so? Has not your soul come to an absolutely
   perfect rest when it has gotten to Christ? When He, Himself, has drawn
   you to Himself, have you not entered into rest? Because men perceive
   that such a rest is to be had, therefore they come to Christ. He
   Himself uses this as an argument why they should come! Remember His
   cheering words, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden,
   and I will give you rest." This is part of the attractive force which
   dwells in the Crucified Savior.

   Then I am sure that there is a great attraction about Christ when we
   see the change which He works in men. Have you known a drunk become a
   Christian, or a thief become upright? Have you seen a harlot made
   chaste? Have you marked any of the modern miracles which are always
   going on around us in the form of conversions? If you have taken
   pleasure in these signs and wonders, I know that you have said, "Lord,
   I, too, will come to You to be converted." The sight of His power to
   elevate and sanctify has attracted you to Jesus and you have fallen at
   His feet. There is no true, deep, tender, living conversion except
   through the Cross and, therefore, those that are taught of God do love
   to come to Christ, that sin may be conquered in them, that the heart of
   stone may be taken away, that the heart of flesh may be given and that
   they may walk the happy way of holiness according to the example of
   their adorable Master.

   I could continue thus to show what this attractive force is, but, lest
   I should weary you, I will only say that it lies much in His
   sufferings, themselves. Is it not a strange thing that suffering
   attracts? Yes, more--lowly Suffering con-quers--she sits as a queen
   upon her throne and reigns by the royalty of her resignation! The ship
   of the Church has plowed its way through seas of blood. With the
   blood-red Cross at the masthead, she has pushed on, even in the night,
   throwing the crimson spray about her. She has never paused because of
   persecution, affliction, or death--these are the rough winds which fill
   her sails. No progress is surer than that which comes of holy
   suffering. The enemies of the Church have taken her disciples and
   burned them, but their deaths yielded a sweet savor of life.

   It is questionable if a man's influence can be better promoted than by
   sending him aloft in a chariot of fire. What made us a Protestant
   nation for so many years? I do not say that we are Protestant now--but
   what made us enthusiastically Anti-papist for so many years? The stakes
   of Smithfield did it! Men and women stood and saw the martyrs
   burned--and as they saw them die, they said, "These men are right, and
   the cause for which they burn is true"--and into the very heart of
   England martyrdom cast up a way for the Lord Jesus and He entered then
   and there into Old England's secret soul!

   What the martyrs did, in their measure, by their bitter death-pangs, is
   being done on a Divine scale by the sufferings of the Chief of all
   martyrs and Head of all witnesses! By the agonies of Jesus, men's
   affections are moved and their hearts enthralled. Are any of you
   unconverted and do you wish to be converted? I cannot suggest a better
   exercise than to read over the story of the death of Christ, as it is
   told by the four Evangelists. When you have read it once, read it
   again! And as you read it say, "Lord, I must have a sadly hard heart,
   or else this would move me to tears. I pray You, change my

   heart."

   Then read the story again, for surely, at last it will touch you. God
   the Holy Spirit blessing you, it will move you and you will be among
   the "all men" that shall be drawn to Jesus by His own personal force!
   So much, then, about what this force is.

   II. Very briefly, my second head is to be--HOW IS THIS FORCE EXERCISED?
   This force is exercised through the Holy Spirit. It is the Spirit of
   God who puts power into the Truth of God about Christ! And then men
   feel that Truth and come to Christ and live. But our blessed Lord and
   Master uses instruments. The force of Christ's love is sometimes shown
   to men by those who already love Him. One Christian makes many. One
   Believer leads others to faith. To come back to my metaphor of a
   magnet--you have sometimes seen a battery attached to a coil and then,
   if you take a nail and put it on the coil, the nail has become a strong
   magnet. You notice that the nail turns into a magnet, for you take
   another nail and you put it on the end of it and it holds the second
   nail fast.

   Now number two is turned into a magnet. Try it. Put a third nail upon
   it. See, it is held fast! Number three has become a magnet. Try the
   next nail--it holds on to it like grim death--and now number four has
   become a magnet! Bring another nail within the influence. Number five
   has become a magnet. And so it continues. On and on and on the
   magnetism goes, from one nail to another. But now, just go to your
   battery, detach one of your wires--and the nails drop off, directly,
   for the coil has ceased to be a magnet and the nails have ceased to be
   magnets, too! All the magnetism comes from the first place from which
   it started--and when it ceases at the fountainhead, there is an end of
   it altogether.

   Indeed, Jesus Christ is the great attractive magnet and all must begin
   and end with Him! When Jesus lays hold upon us, we get hold of a
   brother and before long he turns into a magnet, also. Thus from one to
   another, the mystic influence proceeds--but the whole of the force
   abides in Jesus. More and more the Kingdom grows, "ever mighty to
   prevail," but all the growing and the prevailing come out of Him! So it
   is that Jesus works--first by Himself--and then by all who are in Him.
   May the Lord make us all magnets for Himself. Jesus says, "I, if I am
   lifted up, will draw all men unto Me," but He leaves room in His figure
   for the co-working of all grateful hearts.

   Jesus draws men gradually. Some are brought to Christ in a moment, but
   many are drawn by slow degrees. The sun, in some parts of the world,
   rises above the horizon in a single instant. But in our own country, at
   this season of the year, it is beautiful to watch the dawn, from the
   first gray light to the actual break of day. Is it dark, or is it
   light? Well, it is not quite dark--it is visible darkness! By-and-by
   there is light. No sun is up as yet, but yet the light increases till
   the East begins to glow and the West reflects the radiance! Then,
   by-and-by, up rises the great king of day. So does the Lord bring many
   to Himself by gentle degrees. They cannot tell when they were
   converted, but they are converted, for they have come to Christ!

   Rest assured that He will not send you back. Do not say, "I am not
   converted, for I do not know the moment of the great Change." I knew an
   old lady, once, who did not know her birthday--but I never told her
   that she was not born because of that, for there she was! And if you do
   not know when you were made a Christian, yet, if you are a Christian,
   it little matters how or when. If you are really born of God, the date
   of your new birth is interesting to curiosity but not important to
   piety. Salvation is often accomplished by a lengthened process. I have
   heard that when they wanted to bridge a great chasm they shot an arrow
   or a bullet, which drew with it a tiny thread, across the river. That
   was all the communication from bank to bank and the rolling torrent was
   far below.

   Despise not the day of small things! The insignificant beginning was
   prophetic of grand results. By means of that little thread, they drew
   across a piece of twine and, when they had safely grasped it on the
   other side, they bound a small rope to the end of the twine--and then
   they drew the rope across! And then to that rope they tied a cable and
   they drew the cable across--and now, over that chasm, there strides an
   iron bridge--along which the steam horse rattles with his mighty load!
   So does Jesus unite us to Himself! He may employ, at first, an
   insignificant thread of thought. Then a sense of pleasant interest.
   Then some deeper feeling. Then a crushing emotion; then a faint faith;
   then stronger faith; then stronger yet, until, at last, we come to be
   firmly bound to Christ! Oh, be thankful if you have only a thread of
   communication between you and Jesus, for it will lead to more!
   Something more hopeful will be drawn across the gulf before long!

   Christ's attractions are often very gradually revealed and their
   victorious energy is not felt all at once. Moreover, the cords of our
   Lord's drawings are very secret. You see the swallows twittering round
   our roofs, hawking in the air, shooting up into the clouds, or flashing
   by our ears. It is summer and they are paying us their annual visit.
   They will be with us for a time, but all of a sudden we will see them
   getting together about the gable of an old house, holding agitated con-

   gregations and evidently discussing matters of importance. The Lord of
   birds is gently drawing every swallow in England down towards the
   African coast--and they will all go, without exception--as the secret
   summons reaches the flying host! They know but little of the way, but
   their flight is not, therefore, delayed or its course left to
   uncertainty! Over thousands of miles of sea and land they pursue their
   course until they come to their resting place.

   And then, next spring, the same power that drew them southward will
   draw them all northward again! And here they will come and we shall
   hear their joyous twitter and say to ourselves, "Summer is coming, for
   here are the swallows, again." By a secret power of that order does
   Jesus draw home the strangers and the foreigners whom His Grace has
   cho-sen--they say to one another, "Come, and let us go up to the House
   of the Lord. Let us seek the face of the Savior." The mystic
   attractions of the power of Christ are secretly drawing many who knew
   Him not and now they ask their way to Zion with their faces
   Christ-ward!

   Look how the sun draws along the planets. He hastens on in his mighty
   career in space--I know not where, but drawing with him all the worlds
   which compose the solar system--all these silently attend his majestic
   marches. Such is Christ, the great central Sun--all His people follow,
   for He draws. Stand by the seashore and notice what the moon can do.
   You do not even see her, for it is high noon--but here comes a wave,
   and then another, and then another, and the tide rises a little higher
   today than it did yesterday. What is it that causes this pulse of life,
   these heart-throbs of the deep? The moon's attractive power is drawing
   up the waters from the sea! Even so our glorious Christ, in ways
   unknown to us, draws the hearts of men by His mighty Spirit wherever He
   pleases, "I, if I am lifted up, will draw all men unto Me."

   Fail not to observe how gently He does it! The classic heathen adored a
   goddess whom they represented as riding in a chariot drawn by doves.
   Surely the most tender mode of impulse--power without force, motion
   born of emotion! Certain of us were wafted to Jesus by some such
   zephyr. We could not but yield--the softness and tenderness of every
   touch of Jesus affected us infinitely more than force could possibly
   have done! Hearts are tender things and are not to be forced open with
   crowbars--the doors of the heart open gently to Him that holds the
   key--and who is that but He who made the heart and bought it with His
   precious blood? The gentleness is equal to the power when Jesus draws
   men to Himself!

   But, oh, how effectually! I thought, as I mused upon my text, that I
   saw a great whirlpool like the maelstrom in the north of Norway. I
   thought I saw an enormous whirlpool so huge that all the souls of men,
   like ships of many different forms, were being drawn towards it. With
   strained sight I gazed upon this monstrous death! Woe to those who are
   sucked in by that dreadful whirlpool, for there is no escape! The abyss
   has no bottom, destruction is sure to all who are caught in the
   tremendous down-rush! Even ships far out at sea on other tacks, though
   they escape this maelstrom, are hindered in their course by it! This
   one monstrous devourer labors to absorb all and leaves no bay, nor
   harbor, nor foreign main unaffected by its perpetual draught.

   As I was thinking of this giant evil and wondering how I could navigate
   my own boat so as to avoid this mouth of Hell, I saw a hand that had
   the mark of a nail upon its palm, and lo, it held a mighty magnet which
   attracted every vessel with a force greater than any born of sea or
   storm! This magnet attracted many ships so that they flew to it at once
   and were gently drawn towards their desired haven in the very teeth of
   the maelstrom! I saw other vessels in which the mariners hoisted sail
   to try to escape the influence of this magnet--and even put out their
   oars to strive to get away--and some of them did so escape. Alas, they
   floated farther and farther into the maelstrom's destructive power, to
   be sucked down to their perdition. These were so besotted that they
   labored against mercy and resolved to be destroyed--we are glad that
   all are not left to act so madly.

   You must have seen an instance of drawing very often down in the river.
   A grand vessel is bound for the Indies, but how can it be taken down to
   the Nore? It is difficult to move the heavy craft. There it must lie.
   But here comes a steam-tug. The large vessel hands a rope on board the
   tug and now the steam is up. Tug, tug, tug--the paddle-wheels revolve
   and the big ship begins to follow the lead! It is no longer motionless;
   it will soon be walking the waters as a thing of life! A pleasant
   sight--the tug draws it gently out to sea and then leaves it to pursue
   its distant voyage. Just so may Jesus draw you away from sinful
   pleasures and from self-righteousness.

   III. I shall conclude by drawing one or two lessons. Then I have done.
   WHAT DOES ALL THIS IMPLY? "I, if I am lifted up, will draw all men unto
   Me." Well, it means this, first--that men, by nature, are a long way
   off from Christ. You were not born converted. Of that I am sure! Nor
   were you born a Christian and, though they took you to the font and
   said that they made you a "member of Christ, a child of God, and an
   inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven," there was not

   a word of truth in it, for you were such a child of God that you loved
   sin--and such a member of Christ that you knew nothing of Him--and such
   an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven that, unless God saves you, you
   will never get there!

   I may say of Christians who are made in that way, "Eyes have they, but
   they see not. Mouths have they, but they speak not, neither speak they
   through their throats." And I fear that I must add, "They that make
   them are like unto them: so is everyone that trusts in them." It is a
   poor Christianity that is created by such monstrous folly! "You must be
   born again," and you must be born again of the Spirit of God, or you
   cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven! Man is a long way off from Christ
   and Christ must draw Him. Friend, ask Him to draw you.

   I gather another lesson--that men will not come to Christ unless He
   draws them. Sometimes, when I am trying to prepare a sermon to preach,
   I say to myself, "Why must I take all this trouble?" If men were in
   their senses they would run to Christ without calling! Why must we put
   this business so temptingly? Why must we plead? Why must we be so
   earnest? Because men do not want to come, not even to their own Savior!
   They do not wish to have their sins forgiven! They do not wish to be
   renewed in heart. And they never will come--no, not one mother's son of
   them--unless He that sent Christ to them shall draw them to Christ. A
   work of Grace in the heart is absolutely necessary before the Sacrifice
   of the Lord Jesus will be accepted by any one of us. Jesus said, "You
   will not come to Me that you might have life." What our Lord said is
   true to this hour--man has not improved an atom!

   But, then, learn another lesson. If there is any man here that Christ
   is drawing, he need not ask, "May I come?" Of course you may, if you
   feel drawn to come! Are you coming? Come, and welcome! Christ never yet
   turned away a soul that came to Him--not one! "Him that comes to Me, I
   will in no wise cast out." If He is drawing you, run, for you have
   Scriptural warrant for so doing! "Draw us: we will run after You." If
   tonight you feel any kind of tugging at your heartstrings, do not
   hesitate a moment! Come along with you! When God draws, then is your
   time to move. What do the sailors say? "There's a breeze, Jack. Yes,
   yes, boys. Up with the anchor! Now for every stitch of canvas. We can
   make headway now."

   Do you feel any kind of breeze? Is the breath of the Holy Spirit moving
   upon you in any degree? Do you feel inclined to say, "I will go to
   Jesus"? Then, fly away with you, like a full-sailed ship before a fair
   wind! And by God's help may you soon make the port of Everlasting
   Salvation! Let us finish up by saying that if Christ has said thus He
   will draw, then He will draw tonight! The attractions of the Lord Jesus
   are continual--He draws, and He will always draw. He is drawing now! Do
   not pull back, lest His drawing should cease--and you should
   perish--but rather let your heart sing--

   "He drew me, and I followed on, Charmed to confess the force Divine.'"
   Oh Spirit of God, draw men to Jesus! This is the way of
   salvation--trust Christ and you are saved! Rely wholly upon what Christ
   is and what He has done--and you are saved! In that very act there is a
   change effected within you which will show itself forever in your
   character, for he that believes in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is
   born again!

   The faith which looks to Jesus and the life which lives upon Jesus come
   together. I cannot tell you which is first--the new birth, or faith.
   Can you tell me which spoke of a wheel moves first? No. And these are
   spokes of one and the same wheel. "He that believes in Him has
   everlasting life." Oh, believe Him! Trust Him! Lay hold upon Him!
   Accept Him and go your way--and the mountains and the hills shall break
   forth before you into singing--and all the trees of the field shall
   clap their hands. Amen! So let it be!

Certain Singular Subjects

   (No. 1718)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And I gave unto Isaac, Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau Mount
   Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt."
   Joshua 24:4.

   THIS passage, though audibly uttered by the mouth of Joshua, is to be
   regarded as the immediate voice of God. Joshua said unto all the
   people, "Thus says Jehovah, God of Israel." Jehovah reminded the
   tribes, their elders and judges, of all that He had done and of all
   that He had been to them--and from this He challenged their allegiance,
   requiring that they should henceforth be loyal unto their great
   Benefactor. Addressing them, Himself, His argument became all the more
   impressive. I reverence all Scripture more than tongue can tell, but
   yet I venerate most of all those portions of the Word which are God's
   own voice--the thoughts of Deity interpreted into human speech by
   Deity, itself! The passage now before us, though it reads like a piece
   of ordinary history such as might have been composed by a common
   scribe, has about it a vastness of meaning such as can only be found in
   the language of the infinite God.

   When God inspires David, or Isaiah or Paul, He teaches us most
   graciously, but when He condescends to speak, Himself, how shall we
   sufficiently reverence the Words? We have here, not so much a letter
   dictated by God, as the actual autograph of the great Father! My text
   is written with the finger of God. A glory blazes along the lines--the
   letters are all illuminated--the words glow like the sapphire work of
   Heaven's pavement. Our text has a world of meaning in it. It may, as we
   notice its plain words and prosaic statements, seem to be a mere common
   box, but it is, in very deed, an ark of precious perfumed wood,
   overlaid with pure gold, and filled with gems and jewels rich and rare!

   May the Holy Spirit give us eyes with which to perceive the treasures
   which lie before us in these words--"I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau:
   and I gave unto Esau Mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his
   children went down into Egypt."

   I. The first thing that I discern here is HISTORY AND THE HAND OF GOD
   IN IT. See, "I gave," and then, again, "I gave." It is not merely that
   Esau and Jacob were born of Isaac and Rebekah, but the Lord says, "I
   gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau." How plainly does this declare that the
   hand of God is in human history! At first sight, history seems a great
   tangle, a snarl, a confusion--but on looking at it more closely, we
   perceive that it is only in appearance a maze-- but in fact a marvelous
   piece of arrangement, exhibiting perfect precision and never-failing
   accuracy! Our carnal reason sees the wrong side of the carpet and it
   appears to be without design or order--but there is another side to
   history--and looked at from that standpoint it reveals a wonderful
   pattern of beauty displaying unparalleled wisdom and goodness!

   Histories of nations are, from the human side, little more than a
   narration of the crimes of kings and the follies of their people. And
   yet, viewed from another quarter, they are the record of the dealings
   of God with men--the story of love's labor to reclaim the lost! Look at
   Calvary's sacrifice as it rises above all other events--even as, this
   morning, I saw the hills and the tops of tall trees standing out above
   the morning mist. What a sight it is! The Cross towering over the ages
   looking down on their sins and sorrows! Calvary--what is it? What but
   the climax of human iniquity, where man became not so much a regicide,
   though he slew his King, as a Decide for, to the utmost of his power,
   he slew his God!

   On the Cross, human enmity of God reached its most dread extremity!
   With wicked hands men crucified and slew the Son of God! Yet it is
   equally true that on Calvary we see more of the goodness, Grace, mercy,
   justice and long-suffering of God than anywhere else. The Cross is, at
   once, our crime and our salvation--an exhibition of man's foulest sin
   and of God's richest Grace! Calvary is of all spots, the blackest and
   the brightest--the place where Hell displayed its most deadly power and
   yet the very gate of Heaven! Thus is all human history, according to
   its measure and proportion, a bitter sweet. Where man's mischief and
   misery abound, there do God's goodness and Grace much more abound.

   We see the hand of God in history very strikingly in the raising up of
   remarkable men at certain special periods. It is true, as the Lord
   says, "I gave unto Isaac, Jacob and Esau." Children are the gift of
   God. This is true not only of Isaac

   but of all mortal men. God gave to a worthy couple, George Washington;
   to another pair, John Howard; and to a third, George Whitefield. Each
   of these, in his own special way, was a Divine gift to men. Children
   are born with differing talents and varied capacities, but all about
   them which will make them blessings is the gift of God. I shall not
   tarry to mention great men whose names mark epochs in history from
   which men date an increase of light and happiness--but let no man think
   of these friends and leaders of mankind without admitting the hand of
   God in their birth, training, disposition and ability.

   The greatest blessing which God ever gave to man was the Man, Christ
   Jesus, and, under Him, the next best blessings are men. You remember
   the passage, "When He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive,
   and gave gifts unto men. And He gave some Apostles," and so forth.
   Ascension gifts are sure to be worthy of the occasion and, therefore,
   eminently precious--and these are all men! Within a man--poor, lowly,
   humble and even sinful, though that, man may be in himself--there may
   lie concealed an almost infinite blessing from the Most High! Even as
   within an acorn sleeps a forest, or within a flint lies light for a
   nation's watch-fires. When the Negro slave had borne long years of
   bondage and hope of deliverance seemed far away, it was God that gave
   an Abraham Lincoln who led the nation onward till "Emancipation" flamed
   upon its banners

   Long before, when England, free in every corner of it, yet held slaves
   in its colonies, it was God that gave Wilber-force and raised him up to
   plead in Parliament the rights of men, till the command went forth--

   "Thus says Britannia, empress of the sea, Your chains are broken;
   Africa, be free!" In all such acts of righteousness, the coming forth
   of the man of the hour must be attributed to God's own hands. The men,
   themselves, may not know why they have come to power--of them it might
   often be said as the Lord said of Cyrus--"I girded you, though you have
   not known Me." The mighty ones that contend for wrong, bind the chains
   and forge the fetters of the oppressed, do not know the champions who
   are predestined to overturn them, but God knows, and that is enough!
   Tyrants have always just cause to be afraid, for every birth may
   produce a deliverer. Somewhere in a hovel there may sleep, in a rude
   cradle, the boy who shall shake the throne of evil!

   As yet it has always happened in due season that Pharaoh has been
   confronted by Moses and the princes of Midian by Gideon. For every
   Sisera there is a Jael and for every Goliath a David. The upas tree may
   increase its deadly shadow, but an axe is sharpening for the felling of
   it! Evil is a gourd and though a man is but a worm, yet he shall
   destroy that gourd. God is still working in the fashioning--oh, with
   what mystery--of His own instruments! In His book are written the
   members of men who are yet to be, who are now being fashioned in secret
   by the hand of God! These shall, by-and-by, appear, and shall lead on
   the race to a further unloosing of its bonds. I rejoice in the
   possibilities which lie in birth!

   As to the One great Seed of the woman we look for our greatest
   deliverance, so do we, in a lower sense, look to her seed for the
   overthrow of many of the doings of the serpent race. That curse which
   made her, in sorrow, bring forth children, contains enclosed within
   itself, like a bud in its sheath, the promise of untold benediction!
   Often at a birth might an age rejoice and sing, "Unto us a child is
   born: unto us a son is given." Let parents think of this and dedicate
   their offspring with many a prayer to the Lord whose gift they are. Let
   old men think of this and cry to God to raise up true men to fill the
   places which they, themselves, can no longer occupy. Lo! Children are a
   heritage of the Lord!

   When our sons are a seed that the Lord has blest, blessed is the man
   that has his quiver full of them. Let us bless and praise the Lord, as
   we look back in history upon God's manifest interference with the
   course of events by the singular births of men whom He has used to
   effect His own Divine purposes! Nobody denies that the hand of God is
   in the coming of men for the hour when the hour calls for the men. So,
   also, is the hand of God distinctly to be seen in all great events. If
   Esau captures Mount Seir, then the setting up of the Edomite dominion,
   bad as it may have been, is, from another point of view, a matter in
   which God's purpose and design are to be noted, for He says--"I gave
   Esau mount Seir."

   Brothers and Sisters, I believe--and I hope the Truth of God is not too
   strong for you--that not a tiny bird pecks up a worm from the ground
   without your Father. A plant does not sprout in the corner behind the
   wall and shoot up its flower, seed, ripen and decay apart from the Lord
   of Hosts! Much less does an empire rise, flourish, or decline without
   Divine co-operation! When the sere leaf falls from the sycamore in the
   autumn time, a Providence guides the leaf to its place upon the sod.
   And when the worm uplifts itself to draw that leaf into the tunnel
   which it has made, the hand of the Lord directs the burial! In
   everything that happens, be it small or great, the Lord is present and
   His will is done!

   It is so in all the plotting and maneuvering of kings and princes and
   senates; in the stirs of public opinion; in the marching of armies and
   in all that transpires among mortal men. Though the iniquity of man is
   abundantly seen, yet the overruling power of God is never absent. The
   world is not left to itself, given over to the lord of misrule! In all
   events the hand of God may be perceived by all who care to perceive it.
   I reckon war to be a huge crime on man's side, but, when battalions
   have marched against battalions, the destiny of empires and possibly of
   the whole race of man, has turned upon the health of a commander, the
   clearness of his eyes, or the quickness of his messenger--yes, the
   turning aside of a bullet, or the fall of a horse, or the breaking of
   an axle has become the pivot of history, the turning point of ages--and
   there at the center the Lord has been surely ready!

   Essential points have been secured beyond all question. Perhaps it is
   more nearly right to say that every turn of history has been essential
   and that the whole of it has been in the hands of the Highest. It is
   singular how God is seen, both in dangers and preservations, in
   connection with crises of history. Wellington at Waterloo sat on his
   horse, Copenhagen, all day long. A friend of mine, well known to most
   of you, said to him, "I suppose your horse must have been very weary."
   "No," said the duke, "He was so fresh that when I got off from him, he
   threw his heels into the air and almost struck my temple. I was not in
   greater danger all through the battle than at that moment." God had
   preserved the hero all that day and we little know what had been the
   result if a chance slug or ball had carried him off!

   And yet you see when the red mouth of war was growing silent, the Iron
   Duke was still in jeopardy! Had he been suddenly cut off, our island
   might have become an insignificant province of a vast Napoleonic
   empire! But he was immortal till his work was done. Above the awful din
   of war, I hear the voice of God, and even out of such an evil which
   makes earth, for a while like Hell, the good Lord of All produces good!
   Masters of armies reckon their hosts, but the Lord of Hosts they
   forget. They plan and scheme, these masters of men to whom their people
   are as so much food for powder-- but a higher plan overrides their
   planning! There is a King of kings, and Lord of lords, and He is no
   silent spectator of what is done, but stretches out His hand to deliver
   the nations from the power of evil, so that, still, by His great power,
   the world moves onward to something better.

   We think of this poor world with great sadness when we see all the
   crime and sin which defile it, and yet we join with Galileo in saying,
   "It does move though!" Truth makes progress! The right is winning! If
   we do not see an improvement today, or tomorrow, yet take any 20 years
   and you will see that the world is moving--moving on to that grand day
   when the song shall ascend, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah: for the Lord God
   Omnipotent reigns!" As the Lord's hand was in Esau's possession of
   Mount Seir, so is it in the settlement of every tribe and people. And
   it is to be seen by all observant eyes in all the great epochs of the
   history of man. Yet please notice that whenever we say this--and I say
   it pretty plainly--we never excuse the sin and folly of man!

   We speak of predestination and foreknowledge because we find these
   Truths of God in Scripture and they seem, to us, to be facts in the
   very nature of things. God knows all that happens, otherwise He were
   not God, but a poor, blind deity. And if He knows that a certain fact
   will happen, then it is a fixed and settled thing, depend on that!
   Nothing happens other than God foreknew would happen and, therefore, it
   is fixed! If I laid aside predestination, yet foreknowledge would be
   quite enough for me. Something or other is certain to happen and God
   knows what that something or other is--and, therefore, it is fixed not
   by blind fate, but still fixed. Yet this fixedness is perfectly
   consistent with the free agency and responsibility of man! Man thinks,
   resolves and acts as freely, and as much on his own accord, as if there
   were no foreknowledge and no God! In the book of the unrevealed,
   everything is written--but the mystic roll is laid up in the archives
   of Heaven and no man knows what is written in it.

   Down below everything happens according to that book--not a stroke of
   it is in error, not a mistake is found in a single word--the event
   happens as it was foreknown. But, still, if there were no such book,
   man would not be more absolutely free than he is now. I can join
   heartily with the advocate of free agency when he talks of man's
   voluntariness in his acts of sin, his willful choice of evil, his
   rejection of Christ and of His Grace. No man can too thoroughly believe
   in the willful guilt of the wicked--at any rate, I will go all lengths
   in such a belief. I couple with what is called Calvinistic Doctrine,
   the other doctrine of free agency and responsibility, which seems to me
   to be equally true. And if this is judged to be an inconsistency, the
   remark does not stagger me, for I see no inconsistency and do not
   believe that any exists!

   My God is not a mere Omnipotent Being who can rule dead materialism and
   compel insensible atoms to do His will, but He can rule free agents,
   leaving them absolutely free and yet effecting all His purposes with
   them! God's eternal pur-

   poses are accomplished and yet men remain responsible free agents both
   in their beginning and in their ending. Do you say that you do not
   understand how this can be? Neither do I, but I believe it! There are
   10,000 other things in Nature and history which are too high for me to
   understand their "how" and "why"--and yet I see them--can I not, also,
   be sure of some matters which I do not see? It is not for me to profess
   to comprehend the nature or the ways of the Infinite! If we could
   comprehend the Lord, He would not be the infinite God! It is because He
   is beyond me--infinitely beyond such a poor creature as I am--that I,
   all the more, reverently adore Him!

   His Nature and His nets are, alike, veiled in mystery, but alike to be
   held in reverence. Have you never heard of the insect philosophers?
   They were midgets so small that a man needed a microscope to see
   them--but they were very great philosophers for all that--and they set
   about to describe an elephant. One of them hung upon the gigantic
   creature's ear, surveyed a small portion of its area and his theory was
   that an elephant was a living wall, almost perpendicular! Another stood
   upright somewhere on the creature's back and he concluded that the
   creature was a vast plain! A third, who was perched upon a hair of the
   animal, propounded the idea that it was a tall shaft. These
   midget-philosophers had not eyes large enough to take in a whole
   elephant and so each one judged from the tiny morsel of hide which came
   under his own narrow range of observation.

   Yet these ephemera were nearer the mark with the elephant than our wise
   men are with the universe, concerning which their first principles,
   theories and hypotheses have usually been a museum of follies! Yet if
   philosophers understood the universe, that understanding would not
   bring their carnal minds within measurable distance of the infinite
   God. None but the Spirit of God can reveal God to any man--and the man,
   himself, must receive a new and spiritual life before he can know what
   the Spirit teaches. Who, then, among the worldly-wise may dream of
   understanding God, when even the spiritual rather embrace Him by love
   than grasp Him by understanding? Let us, therefore, believe what we
   find to be in God's Word and what we are taught by His Spirit, though
   it should be far above our heads! Let us not delay to believe until we
   can reconcile.

   Do you not know that in theology--all the false parts of theology on
   which the sects stand and fight each other-- consists of suspension
   bridges made of cobwebs which are intended to bridge the distance
   between two awful Truths of God which look as if they were divided from
   each other? The great rocky Truths are, in effect, accepted by both
   parties, but the battle waxes hot concerning these cobweb-bridges which
   were never worth a tithe of the ingenuity which has been wasted upon
   them. I hold it true that God is in history and in everything! And I
   read the newspaper that I may see how my heavenly Father governs the
   world! And this I believe though I most clearly see that men sin
   willfully, wickedly, vol-untarily--and that they are guilty free agents
   in all their wrong-doing. These thoughts come to me when I remember the
   character of Esau, and yet read the Lord's words, "I gave unto Esau
   mount Seir to possess it."

   To us, dear Friends, the hand of God is very visible in our own case.
   Look at the hand of God that gave to you and to me such parents as we
   have--I mean those of us who have the great delight of having descended
   from Christian men and women. Had we anything to do with that? And yet
   the greatest part of a man's future depends upon the parents of whom he
   is born. No person can deny that our parentage is beyond our own power
   and yet, to a large extent, it colors the whole future of life. Is not
   the hand of God in it? Why shall one be born of a long succession of
   drunks and of thieves, and have within himself an insatiable passion
   born with him to imitate them--while another inherits a sound
   constitution from his parents and, though he has no tendency to the
   Grace of God, yet he has a tendency to morality and naturally develops
   self-restraint and gentle manners? Do we not see the hand of God in the
   parents that He gave us?

   I cannot be so blind as to deny my own obligations! I shall forever
   bless God that I was given to a godly couple whose delight it was to
   lead me in the ways of God. And do we not see the hand of God, again,
   in our children? Many of us do. Oh, how some of us bless and praise God
   that ever such sons fell to our lot! We never think of them without
   delight, for they are living in the service of the Lord Jesus, spending
   and being spent in the Divine Master's service. Look at your children
   as the gifts of God and if they are not yet all that you could desire,
   yet still believe that God has given them to you, even as He says, "I
   gave Isaac, Jacob and Esau." You, dear Friends in Christ, united in
   holy wedlock, may look upon your children as not unclean, but holy, in
   the sense intended by the Apostle when he speaks of the unbelieving
   wife as sanctified by the believing husband and adds, "else were your
   children unclean, but now are they holy."

   They are not to be viewed as the unhappy fruit of an unhallowed union,
   but as gifts of God, to be brought up for Him and trained in His fear.
   They come not as the result of uncleanness, but as gifts from the Lord,
   to whom marriage is

   an honorable estate. It were a sad thing if the sight of my child made
   me blush for shame. But it is a joy to look upon him as, like Samuel,
   asked of God and given of God. Bring these gifts of God to God and say,
   "Here, Lord, are the children which You have given me. Save them by
   Your Grace, since in love You have given them to me. These dear ones
   are favors from Yourself, blessings upon which I set great store. O
   Lord, let Your name be named on them and let Your Grace be glorified in
   them."

   Observe, further, that the Lord's hand is in all the prosperity which
   He gives to any. He says, "I gave unto Esau Mount Seir, to possess it."
   It is by God's allotment that temporal things fall as they do--even the
   ungodly have their portion in this life by Divine grant. It were "vain
   to rise up early, and to sit up late, and to eat the bread of
   carefulness," if the Lord did not build the house and prosper the
   labor! It is He that gives you power to get wealth. Our daily bread
   comes from the granary of Providence. The store most ample, or the
   measure most scant must, alike, be traced to the one all-bountiful
   hand. And, once more, God's hand is to be seen in the place in which we
   live. If Esau lives in mount Seir, it is because God appoints him to be
   there--and if Israel goes down to Egypt, it is for the same reason. If
   you and I move from one place to another, it is sweet to see the cloud
   moving before us and to know that the Lord directs our ways. "The steps
   of a good man are ordered of the Lord."

   But I need not instance cases. The hand of the Lord has been with some
   of us, for good, from our cradle even until now! And we believe that He
   who has led us so far will still lead us until we arrive at the House
   not made with hands, eternal in the heavens!

   II. Secondly, we have another lesson to learn from our text, and that
   is upon, "I gave unto Isaac, Jacob and Esau," twin children born of
   godly parents. In that birth there was joy, but sorrow came by it as
   well as joy. What joy there was in Isaac's house that day, for we read
   that it had been a matter of prayer in the family! See Genesis 25:21.
   It had been a grief to Isaac that, married at 40 years of age, he had
   lived 20 years in married life without a child, although he had the
   promise of a seed. Later on it happened that Esau and Jacob were born.
   There was joy! Yes, double joy, because two sons to build up their
   father's house. Ah, had they known it, there was grave cause for
   mingled emotion in that double birth!

   We read that 40 years after Esau married, he took unto himself two
   Canaanite wives, "which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to
   Rebekah." Yes, we may fondly promise ourselves that children born of
   godly parents will be an unalloyed comfort to them and yet it may not
   be so. Children are certain cares and doubtful comforts. They may bring
   to their parents such sorrow that they may be inclined to think the
   barren happier than the fruitful. Hence it is well for us to leave our
   hopes of posterity with God--and if we reckon that in a childless house
   we have missed a great joy, we ought, also, to reckon that we have
   missed a mint of trouble by the same fact!

   Your children are not born in Grace, but they are the children of
   nature--and that being the case, you may have to see in one of
   them--God grant it may be in no more--an Esau, yes, a profane person
   who will sell his birthright and become an enemy of the people of God!
   Esau was born of admirable parents, and so an Esau may be found to your
   boundless grief in your own family. It has been so, before, with
   others, and it may be so with you. The lion's whelp has been found in
   the sheep's fold; the vulture has been hatched in the dove's nest.
   There was great hope, certainly, of both boys born in Isaac's house,
   for we look that godly parents should train up their children in the
   way that they should go, so that when they are old they may not depart
   from it--therefore both Esau and Jacob were most hopefully started.

   But Esau was not trainable. He was a wild man, went his own way and
   became a follower of rough sports, "a cunning hunter, a man of the
   field." And soon he became profane, as often happens to those whose
   chief pursuits are sporting. Ah, me! Ah, me! How often the brightest
   hopes have been blasted and those who appeared to be floating on the
   current which flows towards Heaven have been drifted back and lost on
   the forlorn shores of unbelief! It is a great advantage to you, my dear
   young Friend, to have been born into a Christian family, but I charge
   you, do not trust in it as though it were, in itself, a guarantee of
   salvation! Isaac, the beloved of God, has Esau for a son.

   Mind that! David had to sorrow over Absalom, and Hezekiah over
   Manasseh. You may be the Esau of your family. Is it so? May God grant
   that such a dreadful portion may not be chosen by you! Remember that
   your brother who has lived with you, slept with you and grown with you,
   side by side, may be gracious and you may remain ungodly. Is it so now?
   Oh, that the Holy Spirit may come and work upon you till you and your
   brother are one in Christ, like James and John, Peter and Andrew!
   Father, do you find a division in your house? Then pray to God, even as
   Abraham prayed for Ishmael,

   "Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!" Pray for your wayward boy!
   And, oh, you that are in the family and have, through Divine mercy,
   become a Jacob and not an Esau, ascribe it all to Sovereign Grace and
   give God the praise!

   But forget not your brother! While he lives, have hope for him and see
   what you can do that he, also, may rejoice in the Lord. But, ah, if we
   could read the future when we look at our little children, we should
   rejoice with trembling! And as we cannot read the future, it is fit
   that we should pray with earnestness. We have prayer often at dying
   beds--why have we not more prayer in the chamber of birth? Surely, when
   an immortal spirit starts upon its endless career, it is well for us to
   cry to God and ask others to join with us in the loving, earnest prayer
   that the Holy Spirit may cause the newly-born to be born again as soon
   as they are able to know Jesus and believe in Him! There stands the
   fact--in birth there is joy tempered with godly fear, hope mingled with
   sacred anxiety and high advantage which may yet most sadly end in
   deepened responsibility and increased sin!

   III. Thirdly, and very briefly, we have next to view WORLDLINGS AND
   THEIR POSSESSIONS. "I gave unto Esau Mount Seir, to possess it." That
   is to say, Esau, as compared with Jacob, appeared to have the best of
   it, for he had "Mount Seir, to possess it," but poor Jacob had not a
   foot of land that he could call his own except the family sepulcher at
   Machipelah, in which, afterwards, he slept the sleep of the righteous.
   Why does God so often give possessions to ungodly men? Why do they
   flourish? Why do they have their portion in this life?

   Is it not, first, because God thinks little of these things and
   therefore gives them to those of whom He thinks little? "Why," said
   Luther, in his day, "the whole Turkish empire is but a basket of husks
   that God gives to the hogs and, therefore, He hands it over to the
   unbelievers." So often wealth and riches are but so much wash which the
   great Husbandman gives to the swine on His estate. Something infinitely
   better is reserved for the Lord's own family! The rich blessing of true
   Grace He reserves for His children and heirs. It shows how little God
   thinks of kingdoms, empires and great riches, for He leaves these, full
   often, to the worst of men!

   How few saints have ever worn crown or coronet! A holy man once said
   that the kings who have gone to Heaven might almost be counted on your
   fingers. See what small account the Lord makes of the world's best
   store! Do you wish that ungodly men should have less? For my part, I am
   reconciled to their present prosperity, for it is all they will ever
   have. Poor souls, let them have as much of it as they may, here, for
   they will have nothing hereafter. Besides, they have no God--and having
   no God, it would take a great many fortunes to make a godless man's
   portion worth a straw! If the graceless could gain all worlds, what use
   would they be to them when they come to die? Their own souls lost and
   no comfort in Christ, and no joy in the Spirit--what have they gained,
   after all? Let the worldlings have the husks.

   Let none of us ever cry, "I gladly would fill my belly with the husks
   that the swine eat." Let those have the treasures of this present evil
   world who have nothing else! Never quarrel with the Lord for saying, "I
   gave unto Esau Mount Seir, to possess it." Besides, these comforts may
   lead them to reflect upon God's bounty to them and, at any rate, they
   ought to move them to repentance. It is my earnest hope that many an
   ungodly man, whom God has highly favored in the things of this life,
   may be influenced by the Spirit of God to say, "Why should I continue
   to rebel against God who has been so kind to me? He has prospered me
   and taken care of me. Why should I not turn to Him, and become His
   servant?" At any rate, gratitude for mercies received should produce
   repentance for sins committed.

   But worldly goods have no necessary connection with ungodliness. There
   is no infection in harvest stores, nor iniquity in the wealth which
   comes of commerce. In themselves, gold and silver are harmless metals.
   There have been men who have enjoyed the abundance of this world, and
   yet have inherited the world to come. Not many great men after the
   flesh are chosen, but there is a great difference between, "not many,"
   and, "not any." Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus and the women who
   ministered unto Christ of their substance had a fair measure of the
   comforts of this life--and used them for their Lord. It was not
   Solomon's wealth that brought him down so low--his unrestrained
   passions were his ruin, else might he have held all his treasures and
   held his God, too.

   Pray, therefore, that the rich may be brought to Christ! Why should not
   that fish be taken which has the silver shekel in its mouth? Why may
   not Matthew, the publican, be called from the receipt of custom? Is
   there not yet another Zac-chaeus to be renewed by Grace? May not their
   indebtedness to God be used as a plea with the wealthy to give
   themselves to Him who has already given them so much? It was no fault
   in Jonah that he felt pleasure under the shade of his gourd-- the fault
   lay in making a god of that gourd! There is no evil in having goods,
   but there is great evil in making those goods

   our chief good. Yet, Brothers and Sisters, so it is that the men of
   this world usually have the most of it. I do not say the best of it.

   It is and always will be a mystery, as long as the world stands, that
   the wicked often flourish and the righteous suffer. Read the Book of
   Job. Read the 37th Psalm; read the 73rd Psalm and see how holy men and
   wise men have been perplexed and troubled by the method of the Divine
   Providence. To see wickedness on a throne and righteousness in a
   dungeon, pride enshrined in honor and holiness rolled in the kennel is
   a serious trial of our confidence in God--and yet there are weighty
   reasons why it should be so for a while. Not without wisdom does the
   Lord say, "I gave to Esau Mount Seir, to possess it."

   IV. Now comes the fourth point and a great mystery, too. Here are THE
   CHOSEN OF GOD AND THEIR TRIALS. "I gave unto Esau Mount Seir, to
   possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt." That is
   their portion. They must go down into Egypt because of famine. And they
   must suffer there under a tyrant's iron rod, so that they may become
   familiar with the drudgery of slaves. They must be strangers in a
   strange land and be sorely bruised beneath the foot of the oppressor.
   The escutcheon of their nation was to be "a smoking furnace and a
   burning lamp." Moses saw Israel as well as God when he beheld a bush
   burning with fire but not consumed. Is not this a strange thing?

   To him whom God loves best He allots the hardest conditions. Esau's
   sons are dukes, but Jacob's seed are drudges! Esau reigns, but Israel
   serves! Esau set his nest on high, but Israel crouched by the reeds of
   the river. The worldling would read the Scripture as if it said, "As
   many as I love, I caress and pamper"--but the Lord speaks not so--His
   Words are, "As many as I love I rebuke and chasten." "Whom the Lord
   loves He chastens and scourges"--those are very hard words--"scourges
   every son whom He receives." To carnal reason this seems straining!
   Faith, alone, can explain it.

   Israel and his children went down into Egypt, first, for their
   preservation. So God brings His people into trial often to preserve
   them from the world and its evil influences; from themselves and their
   natural pride; from Satan and his puffing up. By sorrow and adversity
   the children of God are driven to their knees, brought near to their
   great Father and kept in fellowship with Him. Sanctified afflictions
   are spiritual promotions. The salt and bitterness of sorrow often
   preserve men from the gall and bitterness of sin.

   They went down into Egypt, next, for their improvement, for the family
   of Jacob was in a mournful condition and by no means fit to be used of
   the Lord. The story of Jacob's family is a strangely sad one, perhaps
   Scripture does not contain more mournful pages. The evil influence of
   polygamy is clearly seen, blended within the errors of Laban's house
   and envenomed by the foul example of the Canaanites among whom they
   sojourned. It was time that they should shift their quarters--they were
   neither getting good nor doing good. It looked as if the Patriarch
   would beget an ignorant, quarrelsome, vicious race--and so they were
   sent down into Egypt that trouble might teach them better manners. God
   often thrusts His people into adversity that He may improve them,
   awaken them, instruct them and ennoble them.

   See to it, Brothers and Sisters, that the Lord's design be fulfilled in
   you to the fullest. May the anvil and the file, the crucible and the
   flame work in you a clearance of dross and rust, and make you pure and
   bright. They also went down into Egypt for their education. The chosen
   seed needed teaching! They were getting to be rustic, not to say
   barbarous, in their manners--acquirements and knowledge were scant
   among them. They must go down into the seat of ancient learning to
   acquire arts and sciences and civilization. In Egypt, a race, which,
   otherwise had been a mob must be consolidated into a nation! A band of
   willful men must be trained to discipline and obedience. The Lord said,
   "Out of Egypt have I called My son," because Egypt was his school of
   learning, his drill ground of discipline. We are ignorant, rebellious
   and willful till the Lord trains us. "Before I was afflicted I went
   astray; but now have I kept Your Word."

   The Lord teaches us on the blackboard of adversity and we are often
   rapped over the knuckles by the stern Master! It is wonderful what we
   learn when we are taken among the thorns! I hardly think that I have
   learned anything except in affliction! At least I know this--I owe more
   to the hammer, the anvil, the file and the furnace than I do to all the
   green meadows and flowing brooks and singing birds that I have ever
   seen or heard! I fear that I have learned little beyond that which has
   been whipped into me! And though I am not fonder of the rod than you
   are, I confess that such sweet fruit grows on the bitter branch of
   trial that I would fear to be long without it. I would rather weep
   within the Lord's chosen than laugh within the reprobate! By unhallowed
   mirth fools grow more foolish, but by sanctified trials wise men become
   yet wiser. For future usefulness it is well that we have present sorrow
   and, like Jacob, go down into Egypt.

   And they went down to Egypt, again, that God might display His great
   power in them. I would not care to be Esau on Mount Seir when once I
   see Pharaoh's hosts drowned and Israel marching through the depths of
   the sea!--and when I hear the song of the Israelite maidens and the
   shouts of the men, "Sing you to Jehovah, for He has triumphed
   gloriously; the horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea." It is
   worth while to go down into Egypt to come out of it with a high hand
   and an outstretched arm! Oh, the glory of the Lord in His redeemed! Oh,
   the lofty destiny of the tried people of God! Oh, the sublimity of
   their lives, even now! There is God in them! There is God about them.
   He heads the van and brings up the rear! They are as signs and wonders
   in their generations. He has blessed them--yes, and they shall be
   blessed.

   It matters little that Esau has Mount Seir for a possession--Israel has
   her God! No foot of land, perhaps, you call your own. You do not know
   where your next suit of clothes will come from and God has kept you on
   short commons and multiplied your straits and needs. Never mind--yours
   is the lot of the chosen--for "Jacob and his children went down into
   Egypt." That is where the story ends, according to my text, but you
   know the story does not end there at all, for out of Jacob and his
   children came the Son, the Scepter and the Throne! The Godhead took up
   the seed of Israel and now, today, He that sprang of Jacob's loins,
   according to the flesh, sits on the highest Throne of God and reigns
   supreme! The Shiloh has come and it matters nothing what Egypt brought
   of sorrow unto Jacob's seed, seeing that out of them, at the last, came
   the King and Savior of men!

   If Jesus is ours, the rest is a small affair. Give me Christ and I ask
   for nothing else! Having faith in Jesus, I can leave all things with
   the great Disposer of events. Christ and a crust--the promise and a
   parish coat! Grace and an almshouse! Cannot a saint be more than
   content with these? So have I set before you the varying lots of God's
   own people and of the wicked. I hope that you are ready to say that you
   would rather suffer affliction with the people of God than enjoy the
   pleasures of sin for a season. God help you to make that wise choice
   and to make it at once! May His Spirit lead you to take the Lord Jesus
   to be your All in All! Amen.

The Tent Dissolved and the Mansion Entered

   (No. 1719)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 6, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands,
   eternal in the heavens." 2 Corinthians 5:1.

   PAUL ranks among the bravest of the brave. We note, also, with
   admiration, how the hero of so many dangers and conflicts, who could
   glow and burn with fervor, was yet among the calmest and quietest of
   spirits. He had learned to live beyond those present circumstances
   which worry and disturb. He had stolen a march upon the shadows of time
   and entered into possession of the realities of eternity! He looked not
   on the things which are seen, but he set his whole regard on the things
   which are not seen--and by this means he entered into a deep and joyful
   peace which made him strong, resolute, steadfast, immovable. I would to
   God that we had all acquired Paul's art of being "always
   confident"--his habit of having the inward man renewed day by day!

   The most of us are far too like the insect of the summer hour which
   sports away its life of moments among the flowers and lo, all is over!
   Are we not too apt to live in the immediate present which is revealed
   by the senses? The ox projects no thought upward or beyond--to stand in
   the cool brook or lie down in the fat pasture is its all in all--even
   thus is it with the mass of men, their souls are tethered to their
   bodies, imprisoned within the circumstances of the day! If we could be
   completely delivered from the thralldom of things seen and felt, and
   could feel the full influence of the invisible and the eternal, how
   much of Heaven we might enjoy before the celestial shores are reached!

   Paul's life was rough and stormy, yet who might not desire it? Had
   there been no life to come, he would have been, of all men, the most
   miserable, for he was one of the poorest, most persecuted, most
   despised, most slandered, most wearied and most suffering of mortals!
   And yet, if I had to put my finger upon happy lives, I should not
   hesitate to select among the foremost, the life of the Apostle Paul,
   for whom to live was Christ! It is also to be especially noted, as to
   his happiness, that he had a reason for it. My text begins with the
   word, "For." Paul is always argumentative--the leaning of his mind is
   in that direction. Therefore, if he is cast down, he has a reason for
   it and if he is calm, he can show just cause for his peace.

   Some religionists are deliriously happy, but they cannot tell you why.
   They can sing and shout, and dance, but they can give no reason for
   their excitement. They see an enthusiastic crowd and they catch the
   infection--their religion is purely emotional! I am not going to
   condemn it, yet I will show you a more excellent way. The joy which is
   not created by substantial causes is mere froth and foam and soon
   vanishes away. Unless you can tell why you are happy, you will not long
   be happy. If you have no principle at the back of your passion, your
   passion will burn down to a black ash and you will look in vain for a
   living spark. Some professors have not enough emotion--their hearts are
   too small. Though I cannot say that their heads are too large, there
   are others whose hearts are their main force, who are soon on fire,
   blazing away like shavings and brushwood when first the flame lights
   upon them. But their brains are an uncertain quantity, never sufficient
   to manage the furnace of their emotions.

   It was not so with Paul--he was a well-balanced man. If able to defy
   the present and rejoice in prospect of the future, he had a solid
   reason for doing so. I like a man who is fervent and enthusiastic and
   yet in his fervor is as reasonable as if he were some cool logician.
   Let the heart be like a fiery, high-mettled steed, but take care that
   it is curbed and managed by discretion. An instructed Christian man is
   rational even in his ecstasies--ready to give a reason for the hope
   that is in him--and that hope seems to rise above all reason. He is
   glad, most glad of the glad, but he knows the why of his gladness. And
   so he can bear the cruel tests to which the world exposes spiritual
   joy. The true Believer's peace can answer the quibbles of time or
   devils. It can justify itself in its opposition to all appearances.
   This is a house built upon a foundation,

   a tree which has a firmly settled root, a star fixed in its sphere--and
   thus it is infinitely superior to the house upon the sand, the tree
   plucked up, the fleeting vapor of mere emotion.

   May God, the Holy Spirit instruct us so that we may know the Truth of
   God out of which solid happiness is sure to grow! I see in the text
   before us, first of all, a catastrophe which Paul saw to be very
   possible--"If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved."
   Secondly, the provision which he surely knew to be made should that
   catastrophe occur--"We have a building of God, a house not made with
   hands, eternal in the heavens." And thirdly, I shall dwell for a minute
   or two upon the value of this knowledge to Paul and to the rest of us
   in our present trying condition.

   I. First, then, consider THE CATASTROPHE WHICH PAUL SAW TO BE VERY
   POSSIBLE--"If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved." He
   did not fear that he, himself, would be dissolved! He had not the
   slightest fear about that. The catastrophe which he looked forward to
   is known among us by the name of "death," but he calls it the
   dissolving of the earthly house of his tabernacle--the taking down of
   his tent-house body. He does not say, "If I were to be destroyed," or,
   "If I were to be annihilated." He knows no supposition of that
   character. He feels assured that he, himself, is perfectly safe.

   There is latent within the text an element of deep quiet as to his real
   self. "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building of God." The "we" is all unharmed and
   unmoved. If our house were dissolved we should not be undone. If we
   were to lose this earthly tent we have "a building of God, eternal in
   the heavens." The real man, the essential self, is out of harm's way
   and all that he talks about is the falling to pieces of a certain
   tabernacle, or tent, in which, for the present, he is lodging! Many
   people are in a great fright about the future, yet here is Paul viewing
   the worst thing that could happen to him with such complacency that he
   likens it to nothing worse than the pulling down of a tent in which he
   were making ready to reside in for a little season. He was afraid of
   nothing beyond that-- and if that happened he had expectations which
   reconciled him to the event--and even helped him to anticipate it with

   joy!

   Paul was not absolutely sure that his body would be dissolved. He hoped
   that he might be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord--and then
   he would be changed and be forever with the Lord, without passing
   through death. Still, he was willing to leave this in the Lord's hands.
   And when he saw it to be possible that he should be numbered among the
   blessed dead who die in the Lord, he did not shrink from the prospect,
   but bravely found a metaphor which set forth the little fear which he
   entertained concerning it. The Apostle perceived that the body in which
   he lived was frail in itself. Paul was accustomed to make tents. I do
   not suppose he ever manufactured any very large or sumptuous
   ones--probably he did not have enough capital for that--but he was a
   tent worker and mender.

   The use of tents was common enough among the Roman people in Paul's
   day. The gentry delighted in bright pavilions which they could set up
   at pleasure--and the common folk found pleasure in spending a part of
   their time under canvas. While he was sitting writing this letter, it
   is most likely that Paul had a tent or two to repair lying near, and
   this suggested to him the language of the verse before us. When a tent
   is newly placed, it is but a frail structure, very far removed from the
   permanence of a house--in that respect it is exactly like this feeble
   corporeal frame of ours which is crushed before the moth! Paul felt
   that his body would not need any great force to overthrow it--it was
   like the tent which the Midianite saw in his dream--it only needed to
   be struck by a barley cake, and lo, it was down!

   A house of solid masonry may need a crowbar and a pick to remove its
   stones from their places, but feebler tools will soon overturn a tent
   and make a ruin of it. The body is liable to dissolution from causes so
   minute as to be imperceptible--a breath of foul air, an atom of
   poisonous matter, a trifle, a mere nothing may end this mortal life! I
   hope that you and I duly remember the frailty of our bodies. We are not
   so foolish as to think that because we are in robust health, today, we
   must necessarily live to old age! We have lately had among ourselves
   abundant evidence that those who appear to be the healthiest are often
   the first to be taken away--while feeble persons linger on among us,
   whose lives are a continued wonder and a perpetual struggle! When we
   think of the brittle ware of which our bodies are made, it is not
   strange that they should soon be broken.

   Is it not a wonderful thing that we continue to live? Much more
   wonderful than that we should die? Dr. Watts has wisely said--

   "Our life contains a thousand springs, And dies if one is gone.

   Strange that a harp of thousand strings Should keep in tune so long!"

   Some small affair interferes with a minute valve or organ of secretion,
   mischief is engendered by it, the whole current of life is hindered
   and, by-and-by, death ensues. It is a very delicate process by which
   dust remains animated! A thousand things can stop the process and then
   our body is dissolved! Paul, therefore, because he saw his body to be
   frail as a bubble, looked forward to the time when the earthly house of
   his soul would be dissolved. When he was writing this Epistle, he had
   many signs about him that his body would be dissolved. His many labors
   were telling upon him. He was worn down with fatigue. He was spent in
   his Master's service.

   He was so full of the heavenly fire that he could never rest! After he
   had evangelized one city, he was forced to hasten to another. If he
   were driven out of one village, he hurried to the next, for he was
   eager to deliver the message of salvation. He wore himself out with
   labor and he felt, therefore, that the day would come when his body
   would give way under the intense excitement of his life-agony. In
   addition to this, he endured cold and hunger, nakedness and sickness
   brought upon him by his missionary sacrifices. He had a hard time of it
   as to physical endurance and I should think there was scarcely a limb
   of the man that did not suffer in consequence of the imprisonments,
   scourging, stoning and other hardships which he had suffered. He felt
   that one of these days, in all probability, the house of his tent would
   come down through the violence of his persecutors.

   Once he most touchingly spoke of himself as, "such an one as Paul the
   Aged"--and aged men cannot get away from the consciousness that their
   body is failing. Certain crumbling portions warn the old man that the
   house is dilapidated; the thatch which has grown thin or blanched tells
   its tale. There are signs about the aged which warn them that their
   earthly house was not built to stand forever--it is a tabernacle or
   tent set up for a temporary purposes--and it shows signs of waxing old
   and being ready to pass away. Therefore Paul was led to feel that both
   from the natural frailty of the body and, also, from the injuries which
   it had already sustained, there was before him the evident probability
   that the earthly house of his tabernacle would be dissolved.

   Besides, Paul's frail body had been subject to exceedingly great
   perils. I saw, the other day, an encampment of gypsies out upon the
   common. Many of this wandering race were sitting under a coarse
   covering sustained by sticks. I should exaggerate if I called them
   poles--and I could not help feeling that such an abode was all very
   well on a warm day, but not at all desirable when the east wind was
   blowing, or a shower of sleet was driving along, or a deluge of rain
   descending. The Apostle's body was a tent which was subjected to great
   stress of weather. God had not screened him, though one of the most
   precious men that even lived! He was exposed to more danger than almost
   any other of the Lord's servants.

   Here is his own account of the matter--"Thrice was I beaten with rods;
   once was I stoned; thrice I suffered shipwreck. A night and a day I
   have been in the deep; in journeying often, in perils of waters, in
   perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the
   heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils
   in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in weariness and
   painfulness, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often,
   in cold and nakedness." Well might he reason that before long his poor
   shepherd's shanty would give way under such rude blasts! Besides, Paul
   knew that so many others whom he had known and loved had already died,
   and he gathered from this that he would, himself, die.

   There used to sit in this house a Brother who has often assured me that
   he would not die, and that if any Christian man did die it was because
   he grieved the Lord. I am sorry to say that I have missed that Brother
   for many months. I hope he has not yet disproved his own theory, but I
   am sure that he will do so, sooner or later, unless our Lord should
   hasten His advent. Whenever I meet with an enthusiast who boasts that
   he shall never die, I find it best to let him wait and see. One fine
   old Irish clergyman has frequently sought to instruct me in the art of
   being immortal! And he has been grieved and angry because I never set
   much store by the long life which he offered me. Though an old man, he
   assured me that he would never die--he expected, in a short time, to
   throw out all the infirmities of his years in the form of a rash--and
   then to be as vigorous as ever!

   Alas, the good rector is buried and his crazy brain is at rest. It is
   appointed unto men once to die. I should have thought that since so
   many of the excellent of the earth have fallen asleep, nobody would
   ever have been so mad as to raise a question about its being the common
   lot. Our crowded cemetery supply 10,000 arguments why each one of us
   may expect to die in due time. This earthly house of our tabernacle
   will be dissolved--all things unite to warrant the belief.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, this was all that Paul expected on the sad
   side and, truly, it is not much, is it? Certain Swiss peasants not very
   long ago were feeding their flocks on one of the lofty upland valleys.
   On one side of the pasture stood a number of chalets, or wooden huts,
   in which they were accustomed to live during the summer. They were poor
   shelters which they left as soon as the winter set in. One day they
   heard a strange rumbling up in the lofty Alps and they understood what
   it meant--it meant that a mass of rock or snow or ice had fallen and
   would soon come crushing down in the form of an avalanche. In a brief
   space, their fears were realized, for they saw a tremendous mass come
   rushing from above, bearing destruction in its course. What did it
   destroy? Only the old, crazy chalets--that was all. Every man of the
   shepherds was safe and untouched--the event was, to them, a matter
   which caused a Te Deum to be sung in the village Church below rather
   than a subject for mourning and sorrow. They said, "The avalanche is
   terrible, but it has not slain the aged mother, nor crushed the babe in
   its cradle. It has injured none of us, but only buried a few hovels
   which we can soon rebuild."

   Their case is a picture of ours. The avalanche of death will fall, but
   O you saints, when it comes, this is all it will do for you--your
   earthly house will be dissolved! Will you fret over so small a loss? No
   evil will come near to you! The poor hut of the body will be buried
   beneath the earth, but as for yourself, what will you have to do but to
   sing an everlasting Te Deum unto Him who delivered you from death and
   danger--and raised you to His own right hand? It would not long affect
   a man if his tent should be overthrown--he would shake himself clear of
   it and come forth--it would not otherwise disturb him. So death shall
   not affect us for the worse, but for the better! The dissolution of
   this hampering frame shall give us liberty! Today we are like birds in
   the egg--so long as the shell is whole, we are not free--death breaks
   the

   shell!

   Does the fledgling lament the dissolution of the shell? I never heard
   of a bird in its nest pining over its broken shell! No, its thought
   runs otherwise--to wings and flight and sunny skies! So let it be with
   us. This body will be dissolved. Let it be so--it is good it should be!
   We have been glad of it while we have needed it and we thank God for
   the wondrous skill displayed in it--but when we no longer require it,
   we shall escape from it as from imprisonment and never wish to return
   to its narrow bounds! Death, as it pulls away our sackcloth canopy,
   will reveal to our wondering eyes the palace of the King in which we
   shall dwell forever and, therefore, what cause have we to be alarmed at
   it? I have set out the whole catastrophe before you--and surely no
   Believer trembles in view of it!

   II. So now we pass on to the second head--THE PROVISION OF WHICH THE
   APOSTLE PAUL MOST SURELY KNEW. He knew that if his tent dwelling was
   overthrown, he would not be without a home! He knew that he would not
   have to open his eyes in a naked condition and cry, "Woe's me, where am
   I to fly? I have no dwelling place!" No, he knew that if this
   tent-house were gone, he had "a building of God." Paul was not afraid
   of going to "purgatory"--though of late, some, even among Protestants,
   have, in a modified form, revived that grim lie and have told us that
   even Believers will have much to bear before they will be fit for
   eternal happiness! The Apostle held no such opinion! On the contrary,
   he wrote--"We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building of God."

   He did not expect to be roasted alive for the next thousand years and
   then to leap from "purgatory" to Paradise. But he did expect to go, as
   soon as ever his earthly house was dissolved, into his eternal house
   which is in the heavens! He had not even the thought of lying in a
   state of unconsciousness till the Resurrection. He says, "We know that
   if the earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have [we
   have already] a building of God." He says not, "we shall have it," but,
   "we have it"--"we know that we have it." The picture seems to me to be
   as though one of you should dwell in his garden, in a tent, for a
   while. Somebody inquires what would happen if a gale of wind should
   blow your tent away in the night. "Oh," you say, "I have a house over
   yonder. I would go within doors and live there."

   What a comfort to know that whatever occurs to our temporary gear, we
   have a fixed and settled abode to which we can at once repair! This
   makes us feel independent of all dangers and helps us joyfully to
   welcome the inevitable, come when it may! What did the Apostle mean,
   however? For this text is said to be a very difficult one. He meant,
   first--the moment his soul left its body, it would at once enter into
   that house of which Jesus said, "In My Father's house are many
   mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you." Do you want to
   know about that house? Read the Book of the Revelation and learn of its
   gates of pearl, its streets of gold, its walls of rarest gems! Read of
   the river which winds through it and of the trees which bear their
   fruit every month! If, after that, you desire to know more concerning
   this house, I can but give you the advice which was given by John
   Bunyan in a similar case.

   One asked of Honest John a question which he could not answer, for the
   matter was not opened in God's Word and, therefore, Honest John bade
   his friend live a godly life and go to Heaven and see for himself.
   Believe no dreams, but bide your time, believing in the Lord Jesus, and
   you shall shortly know all about the house not made with hands, eternal
   in the heavens! Paul, however, meant that in the fullness of time he
   would again be clothed with a body. He regarded the waiting time as so
   short that he almost overlooked it, as men forget a moment's pause in a
   grand march. Ultimately, I say, he expected to be housed in a body--the
   tent-house which was blown down and dissolved would be developed into a
   building so rich and rare as to be fitly called, "a building of God, a
   house not made with hands."

   This, also, is our prospect. At this present time, in this mortal body,
   we groan being burdened, for our spirit is liberated from bondage, but
   our body is not yet emancipated, although it has been bought with a
   price. We are "waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our
   body" and so, "the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life
   because of righteousness." Our soul has been regenerated, but the body
   waits for the process, which, in its case, is analogous to
   regeneration, namely, the resurrection from the dead. Disembodied
   saints may have to wait a few thousand years, more or less, dwelling in
   the Father's house above--but there shall come, eventually, the
   sounding of the trumpet and the raising of the dead--and then the
   perfected spirit shall dwell in a body adapted to its glory. The
   certainty of the resurrection raises us above the dread which would
   otherwise surround the dissolution of our body.

   A child sees a man throwing precious metal into a melting pot and he is
   sad because fair silver is being destroyed. But he that knows the
   business of the refiner understands that no loss will come of the
   process--only the dross of that silver will be taken away--and the pure
   molten mass poured out into a comely mold will yet adorn a royal table!
   Well, my Brothers and Sisters, are we assured that to lose this vile
   body is clear gain since it will be fashioned according to the glorious
   Body of the Lord Jesus? Let us pass on to consider how Paul could say
   he knew this. This wonderfully enlightened 19th Century has produced an
   order of wise men who glory in their ignorance! They call themselves
   "Agnostics," or know-nothings! When I was a boy, it would have seemed
   odd to me to meet with a man who gloried in being an ignoramus and yet
   that is the Latin for that Greek word, "Agnostic."

   Is it not singular to hear a man boastfully say, "I am an ignoramus"?
   How different is our Apostle! He says, "We know." Where did this
   confidence come from? How did he know? First, Paul knew that he had a
   Father in Heaven, for he felt the spirit of sonship. He knew, also,
   that his Father had a house and he was certain that if ever he lost the
   tent in which he lived, he would be sure to be welcomed into his own
   Father's house above! How do our children know that if ever they are in
   need of a house they can come home to us? Did they learn that from
   their tutors at school? No, their childhood instincts teach them that
   our house is their home, just as chickens run under the mother hen
   without needing to be trained. Because they are our children, they feel
   that as long as we have a house, they have a house, too. Paul,
   therefore, unhesitatingly said, "We know."

   And Brethren, we know the same through like confidence in our Father's
   love. In the house of the many mansions we feel quite sure of a hearty
   welcome in due time! We cannot be shut out from our Father's home! We
   cannot be houseless wanderers while our royal Father dwells in His
   palace! We are not merely hopeful on this matter, but certain! And,
   therefore we say, "I know." Paul knew, again, that he had an elder
   Brother and that this Brother had gone before to see to the lodging of
   the younger brothers and sisters. Paul remembered that Jesus had said,
   "I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for
   you, I will come again and receive you unto Myself, that where I am you
   may be also." So Paul had no question whatever! If the Lord had gone to
   prepare a place, there would be a place for him, for he never knew his
   Divine Lord to set about anything and fail therein!

   Can we not all trust our Forerunner? Have we any doubts of Him who has
   entered within the veil as our Representative? No! As we are sure that
   Jesus has passed into the heavens on our behalf, so are we sure that
   when this tent-house body is dissolved, there remains a rest and home
   for our souls! Doubtless, Paul also thought of the Holy Spirit, that
   blessed One who deigns to live with us in this frail house of clay
   which is, in many ways, an uncomfortable and unsuitable abode for Him
   by reason of the sin which has defiled it. He condescends to dwell in
   these mortal bodies and, therefore, when we leave our earthly house, He
   will leave it, too! And we are persuaded that a place will be found
   where we may still abide in fellowship. As our bodies have been honored
   to entertain the Holy Spirit, we may be sure that in our hour of need
   He will find an abode for us. He has been our guest and, in His time,
   He will be our Host!

   This we know, for we know the love of the Spirit. He who has made our
   body His temple will find a rest for our souls. Thus, from the Father,
   the Son and the Holy Spirit, we gather assurance that we shall not
   wander to and fro unhoused, even though this mortal frame should be
   dissolved! Besides, let me tell you something. Paul knew that when he
   died there was a Paradise prepared, for he had already been there! You
   remember how he locked up that story till he could keep it no longer
   and, then, 15 years after its occurrence, he let out the blessed
   secret? Let me read his words, "I knew a man in Christ above fourteen
   years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the
   body, I cannot tell: God knows). Such an one caught up to the third
   Heaven. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the
   body, I cannot tell: God knows), how that he was caught up into
   Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which is not lawful for a man to
   utter."

   He says he was taken up to the third Heaven! It was, therefore, idle to
   tell Paul that there was no home for him hereafter, for he had seen the
   place! "Well" you say, "I have not seen it." No, but you fully believe
   the witness of Paul, do you not? For my own part, I am sure that Paul
   would not say that which is false and, inasmuch as he went into the
   third Heaven or Paradise, and saw it, I believe that there is such a
   place! Remember that this is the place to which the Lord Jesus admitted
   the dying thief, "Today shall you be with Me in Paradise." This is the
   place where Jesus is and where we shall be with Him forever, when the
   earthly house of this tabernacle shall be dissolved! Yet, again, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, you and I know that when this earthly tabernacle
   is dissolved, there will be a new body for us, because our Lord Jesus
   Christ has risen from the dead. In my mind the ultimate answer to my
   deepest unbelief is the fact of the rising of Jesus from the dead!

   No matter of history is anything like so well attested as the fact that
   our Lord was crucified, dead and buried--and that He did, on the third
   day--rise again from the dead. This I unhesitatingly accept us a fact
   and this becomes my anchorage. Inasmuch as Jesus is the Representative
   of all who are in Him, it is as certain that the Believer will rise
   since Jesus has risen. The Apostle says, "We know," and remembering
   these grand Truths of God, I am sure that his words are not a bit too
   strong! No, if I knew any word in the English language which would
   express more assurance than the words, "to know," I would use it this
   morning for myself! Much more, then, might the Apostle use it for
   himself. This we are also sure of, namely, that if our Lord Jesus is
   alive and in a place of rest, He will never leave His chosen and
   redeemed ones without house or home! Where He has found a Throne, His
   people shall find a dwelling!

   Delightful is our old-fashioned ditty--

   "And when I shall die, Receive me, I'll cry, For Jesus has loved me, I
   cannot tell why. But this I do find, we two are so joined, He won't be
   in Glory and lea ve me behind." There is such an attachment between
   Christ and the Believer--yes, more--such a vital, essential,
   indissoluble, tender marriage union that separation is impossible! As
   no man among us would ever be content to see his wife in prison if he
   could set her free, or to leave her outside in the cold when he could
   bring her to his fireside in comfort, so Christ, to whom our soul is
   espoused in eternal wedlock, will never rest until He has brought every
   one of His own beloved to be with Him where He is--that they may behold
   His Glory--the Glory which the Father has given Him. No Believer in
   Jesus has any doubts about that! I am sure you can all say, as Paul
   did, "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands."

   "Ah," asks one, "but how is a man to know that he has an interest in
   all this? Suppose I know that the children of God are thus favored, how
   am I to know that I am one of them?" I invite you to self-examination
   on this point. Do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ with all your
   heart? Then it is written, "He that believes in Me though he were dead,
   yet shall he live. He that lives and believes in Me shall never die."
   Having believed in Christ, the Apostle knew that he was safe, for the
   promises are to Believers, and if any man is a Believer, every promise
   of the Covenant belongs to him. We obtain further assurance of this by
   our possessing the new life. Dear Friend, have you entered into a new
   world? Do you feel within you a new heart and a right spirit? Have old
   things passed away and have all things become new? Are you a new
   creature in Christ Jesus? Then it is all right with you! That new life
   cannot die, your new-born nature must inherit everlasting bliss. "Fear
   not, little flock; it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the
   kingdom."

   In addition to this, do you commune with God? Do you speak with Christ?
   None perish who commune with the Father and the Son. Jesus cannot say,
   at the last, "I never knew you; depart from Me," for He does know you,
   and you know

   Him. "Oh," you say, "He knows enough of me, for I am always begging."
   Just so, go on with that trade! Be always a spiritual mendicant. The
   Lord of Love will never cast away a pleading suppliant! He who
   frequents the Throne of Grace shall infallibly reach the throne of
   Glory! Beside, does not the Spirit, Himself, also bear witness with our
   spirit that we are the children of God? And if children and heirs, are
   we afraid of being left naked in the world to come? I hope that many of
   us have now reached the full assurance of faith so that we believe and
   are sure. Can you not say, each one for himself-- "I know whom I have
   believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have
   committed to Him

   until that day"?

   These are the ways in which Believers know that they are Believers! And
   then, by the Word of God they know that all things are theirs, so that
   if their earthly house should fail they would be received into
   everlasting habitations.

   III. Lastly, as to THE VALUE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE TO US. To be sure that
   when this body dies, all is well--is

   not that worth knowing? Secularists accuse us of taking men's minds
   away from the practical present that they may dream over a fancied
   future. We answer that the best help to live for the present is to live
   in prospect of the eternal future. Paul's confident belief that if his
   body should be dissolved, he would be no loser, kept him from fainting.
   He knew what the worst would be and he was prepared for it. Great
   storms were out, but the Apostle knew the limit of his possible loss
   and so was ready. All we can lose is the frail tent of this poor body.
   By no possibility can we lose more. When a man knows the limit of his
   risk, it greatly tends to calm his mind. The undiscoverable and the
   unmeasured are the worst ingredients of dread and terror--but when you
   can gauge your fears, you have removed them.

   Our Apostle felt that he had been sent into the world with the great
   design of glorifying God by winning souls and building up saints--and
   he was fully resolved to keep to the ministry which he had received. He
   argues with himself that his most dangerous course would be to faint in
   his life-service, for perseverance in his calling could bring with it
   no greater risk than death--and that he summed up as losing a tent and
   gaining a mansion! The Roman emperor might strike off his head, or a
   mob might stone him to death, or he might be crucified like his
   Master--but he made light of such a fate! It was to him only the coming
   down of the old tent--it did not affect his undying spirit--he smiled
   and sang, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works
   for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."

   The prospect of his heavenly house made his present trials seem very
   light, for he felt like a man who sojourns for a night at a poor inn,
   but puts up with it gladly because he hopes to be home on the morrow.
   If we were trying tent life for a season we should probably cry out, "A
   fearful draft comes in at that corner! How damp it is under foot! How
   cramped one feels!" Yet we should smile over it all and say, "It will
   not be for long. We shall soon be in our house at home." Ah, Brothers
   and Sisters, an hour with our God will make up for all the trials of
   the way! Be of good courage and press on. This changed, for Paul, the
   very idea of death--death was transformed from a demon into an angel!
   It was but the removal of a tottering tent that he might enter into a
   permanent palace!

   Some of God's own children are much troubled through fear of death
   because they do not know what it is. If they were better taught, they
   would soon discover, in their present source of sorrow, a subject for
   song! I would like, here, to say that I have known some of my Master's
   doubting and fearing servants die splendidly! Do you remember how Mr.
   Feeble-Mind, when he crossed the river, went over dry-shod? Poor soul,
   he thought he should surely be drowned, and yet he scarcely wet the
   soles of his feet! I have known men of God go like Jacob all day long,
   weary and faint, feeling banished from their Father's house--and yet
   when they have laid their head down for their final sleep, they have
   had visions of angels and of God! The end of their journey has made
   amends for the rough places of the way.

   It shall be so with you, Brother and Sister Believer. There is usually
   a dark place in every Christian's experience. I have seen some travel
   in sunlight almost the whole of the way and then depart in gloom. And I
   have thought none the worse of them for it. And I have seen others
   struggle forward through a fog for the first part of their pilgrimage
   and then come out into cloudless day. At one period or another beneath
   these lowering skies the shadow falls across our way, but surely,
   "light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
   heart." As I have thought of some of my dear Brothers and Sisters that
   I have seen die very sweetly, and I have remembered that they were, in
   life, lowly and self-distrustful, I have compared them to persons who,
   when they drink their tea, forget to stir the sugar at the bottom of
   the cup. How doubly sweet the drink becomes as they near the
   bottom--they have more sweetness than they can well bear!

   Would it not be wise to stir the tea at once and enjoy the sweetness
   from the brim to the bottom? This is the benefit of faith as to the
   future, for it flavors the present with delight. But what if saints
   should miss immediate comfort for a

   while--how richly will they be compensated! What will it be to open
   your eyes in Heaven! What a joy to fall asleep on the bed of
   languishing and to wake amid the celestial choir of Hallelujahs! "Where
   am I? Ah, my God! My Christ! My Heaven! My all! I am HOME!" Sorrow and
   sighing shall flee away! Does not this view of things give a
   transfiguration to death? O you poor unbelievers, how I pity you, since
   you have no such glorious hopes! O that you would believe in the Lord
   Jesus and enter into eternal life!

   Faith had such an effect upon Paul that it made him always calm and
   brave. Why should he be afraid of a man that could not do him harm?
   Even if his persecutor killed him, he would do him a service! What had
   he to fear? This made Paul wise and prudent. He could use his judgment,
   for he was not fluttered. He was not like some of you that are only a
   little ill and straightway you are filled with fright--and you make
   yourselves worse than you otherwise would be, so that the doctor has to
   contend with a frightened mind as well as a diseased body! He who is
   calm, restful and happy is already on the road to a cure. He is quiet
   because he is in his Father's hands, and whether he lives or dies, all
   is well--and this conviction helps the physician to remove his bodily
   malady. I say again, there is no way to live like learning to die! And
   he who can afford to be careless whether he lives or dies is the man
   who will so live as to die triumphantly. Oh, that all of you felt the
   quiet which comes of trusting in the Lord Jesus!

   How sad to know that you may die at any moment and to be unprepared for
   the change! I do not wonder that you are unhappy! You have good reason
   for being so. Oh that you were wise and would make the future sure by
   faith in the risen Lord! In Martin Luther's time and before his era,
   men who had lived evil lives were often in great fear when they came to
   die--and in their terror they would send to a monastery and procure a
   monk's robe in which to be buried. What a foolish fancy! Yet so it was
   that they hoped to fare better in the day ofjudgment for being wrapped
   in brown cloth and covered with a hood! Be ours a better garment! Here
   is a wish of holy Rutherford--"His believed love shall be my winding
   sheet and all my grave-clothes. I shall roll up my soul and sew it up
   in the web of His sweet and free love."

   Is not that your idea? It is surely mine! If we are laid to sleep in
   such a cloth, there will be no fear of our waking! It will happen to us
   as to the man who was laid in Elisha's grave and at once arose as soon
   as he touched the Prophet's bones. No man can lie dead if wrapped up in
   the love of Christ, for His love is life! He that has touched the love
   of Christ has touched the heart of the life of God and he must live! So
   let us give ourselves up to that Divine love and, trusting in our Lord,
   let us go onward to eternal bliss till the day breaks and the shadows
   flee away! Let us triumph and rejoice that there is prepared for us a
   "building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."

Christ in You

   (No. 1720)

   DELIVERED ON LORDS-DAY MORNING, MAY 13, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Christ in you, the hope of glory." Colossians 1:27.

   THE Gospel is the grand secret--the mystery of mysteries! It was hidden
   from ages and from generations, but is now made manifest to the saints.
   To the mass of mankind it was utterly unknown and the chosen people,
   who saw something of it, only perceived it dimly through the smoke of
   sacrifices and the veil of types. It remained a mystery which wit could
   not guess nor invention unravel--and it would have forever have
   continued a secret had not God, in His infinite mercy, been pleased to
   reveal it by the Holy Spirit. In a still deeper sense it is even yet a
   hidden thing unless the Spirit of God has revealed it to us
   individually, for the revelation of the Gospel in the Word of God does
   not, of itself, instruct men unto eternal life. The light is clear
   enough, but it avails nothing till the eyes are opened. Each separate
   individual must have Christ revealed to him and in him by the work of
   the Holy Spirit, or else he will remain in darkness even in the midst
   of the Gospel day.

   Blessed and happy are they to whom the Lord has laid open the Divine
   secret which Prophets and kings could not discover--which even angels
   desired to look into! Brethren, we live in a time when the Gospel is
   clearly revealed in the Word of God and when that Word has its faithful
   preachers lovingly to press home its teachings. Let us take care that
   we do not despise the mystery which has now become a household word.
   Let not the commonness of the blessing cause us to undervalue it. You
   remember how, in the wilderness, the Israelites fed upon angels' food
   until they had enjoyed it so long, so constantly and so abundantly that
   in their wicked discontent they called it, "light bread"? I fear that
   many in these times are gorged with the Gospel like those who eat too
   much honey. They even venture to call the heavenly Word of God,
   "common-place," and talk us if it were not only, "the old, old story,"
   but a stale story, too.

   Are not many hungering after novelties, longing for things original and
   startling, thirsting after the spiritual dram-drinking of sensational
   preaching, dissatisfied with Christ Crucified, though He is the Bread
   which came down from Heaven? For us, let us keep clear of this folly!
   Let us rest content with the old food, praying from day to day, "Lord,
   evermore give us this bread." May it never happen to us as unto the
   Jews of the Apostolic times who utterly refused the Word of Life, so
   that the Truth of God became to them a stumbling-block and those who
   preached it were compelled to turn to the Gentiles! If we despise the
   heavenly message, we cannot expect to fare better than they did! Let us
   not incur the danger of refusing Him that speaks from Heaven! If there
   is life, rejoice in it! If there is light, walk in it! If there is
   love, rest in it. If the Lord God Almighty has, at last, set open the
   treasures of His Grace and put eternal bliss within your reach, stretch
   out the hand of faith and be enriched! Turn not your backs upon your
   God, your Savior, for in so doing you will turn your backs on eternal
   life and Heaven! God grant that none of you may do this.

   In our text we have, in a few words, that great mystery with which
   Heaven did labor us in travail; that mystery which is to transform this
   poor world into new heavens and a new earth. We have it, I say, all in
   a nutshell in the seven words of our text--the riches of the glory of
   this mystery may, here, be seen set out to open view--"Christ in you,
   the hope of glory." By the assistance of the Divine Spirit, I shall
   speak upon this mystery in three ways--The essence of it is "Christ."
   The sweetness of it is "Christ in you." And the outlook of it is "the
   hope of glory." The words read like a whole body of divinity condensed
   into a line,--"Christ in you, the hope of glory."

   I. The eternal mystery of the Gospel--THE ESSENCE OF IT IS CHRIST. I
   hardly know what is the antecedent to the word, "which," here--whether
   it is, "mystery," or, "riches," or, "glory." And I do not greatly care
   to examine which it may be. Any one of the three words will be suitable
   and all three will fit best of all. If it is "the mystery," Christ is
   that mystery--"Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness:
   God was manifest in the flesh." If it is the word, "glory," beyond all
   question our Lord Jesus wears a "glory as of the Only-Begotten of the
   Father, full of Grace

   and truth." Is He not "the brightness of the Father's glory"? If we
   take the word, "riches," you have often heard of "the unsearchable
   riches of Christ," for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead
   bodily.

   Oh, the riches of the Grace of God which it has pleased the Father to
   impart unto us in Christ Jesus! Christ is the "mystery," the "riches"
   and the "glory." He is all this and, blessed be His name, He is all
   this among us poor Gentiles who at first were like dogs, scarcely
   accounted worthy to eat the crumbs from under the children's table! And
   yet we are now admitted into the children's place and made heirs of
   God, joint-heirs with Christ Jesus! Riches of glory among the Gentiles
   would have sounded like a mockery in the first ages and yet the
   language is most proper at this day, for all things are ours in Christ
   Jesus the Lord!

   The essence of this mystery is Christ, Himself. In these days certain
   would-be wise men are laboriously attempting to constitute a church
   without Christ and to set forth a salvation without a Savior. But their
   Babel building is as a bowing wall and a tottering fence. The center of
   the blessed mystery of the Gospel is Christ, Himself, in His Person.
   What a wonderful conception it was that the infinite God should take
   upon Himself the nature of man! It never would have occurred to men
   that such a condescension would be thought of! Even now that it has
   been done, it is a great mystery of our faith. God and man in one
   Person is the wonder of Heaven, earth and Hell! Well might David
   exclaim, "What is man, that You are mindful of him? And the son of man,
   that You visit him?"

   The first thought of the Incarnation was born in the unsearchably wise
   mind of God. it needed Omnipotent Omniscience to suggest the idea of,
   "Immanuel, God With Us." Think of it! The Infinite an infant; the
   Ancient of days a child; the Ever-Blessed a man of sorrows and
   acquainted with grief! The idea is original, astounding, Divine! Oh,
   that this blending of the two natures should ever have taken place!
   Brothers and Sisters, the heart of the Gospel throbs in the Truth of
   God! The Son of the Highest was born at Bethlehem and at His birth,
   before He had worked a deed of righteousness or shed a drop of blood,
   the angels sang, "Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good
   will toward men," for they knew that the Incarnation had, within
   itself, a wealth of good things for men!

   When the Lord, Himself, took our manhood, it meant inconceivable
   benediction to the human race! "Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son
   is given," and in that Child and Son we find our salvation! God in our
   nature can mean for us nothing but joy. How favored is our race in this
   respect! What other creature did the Lord thus espouse? We know that He
   took not up angels, but He took up the seed of Abraham. He took upon
   Him human nature, and now the next being in the universe to God is man,
   he who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of
   death is the day crowned with glory and honor, and made to have
   dominion over all the works of Jehovah's hands.

   This is, indeed, the Gospel! Do not sinners begin to hope? Is there one
   in your nature who is "Light of lights, very God of very God," and do
   you not perceive that this must mean good for you? Does not the "Word
   made flesh" dwelling among men awaken hope in your bosoms and lead you
   to believe that you may yet be saved? Certainly the fact of there being
   such an union between God and man is the delight of every regenerated
   mind! Our Lord's Person is, at this day, constituted in the same
   manner. He is still God and Man! He can still sympathize with our
   manhood to the fullest, for He is bone of our bone and flesh of our
   flesh! And yet He can help us without limit, seeing He is equal with
   the Father. Though manifestly Divine, yet Jesus is none the less Human!
   Though truly Man, He is none the less Divine--and this is a door of
   hope to us, a fountain of consolation which never ceases to flow!

   When we think of our Lord, we remember with His Person the glorious
   work which He undertook and finished on our behalf. Being found in
   fashion as Man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even
   the death of the Cross. He took upon Himself the form of a Servant and
   was made in the likeness of sinful flesh, because we had failed in our
   service and could not be saved unless Another did suit and service on
   our behalf. The Heir of all things girded Himself to be among as One
   that serves! What service His was! How arduous! How humble! How heavy!
   How all-consuming! His was a life of grief and humiliation, followed by
   a death of agony and scorn. Up to the Cross He carried all our load.
   And on the Cross He bore, that we might bear, His Father's righteous
   wrath!

   Oh, what has Christ not done for us? He cast our sins into the depths
   of the sea. He has taken the cup which we ought to have drunk forever
   and He has drained it dry and left not a dreg behind! He has redeemed
   us from the curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us. And now He has
   finished transgression, made an end of sin, brought in everlasting
   righteousness and gone up to His Father's Throne within the veil,
   bearing His Divine oblation and making everything right and safe for
   us, that, by-and-by, we may follow Him and be with Him where He is! Oh
   yes, Brothers and Sisters,

   Christ's Person and finished work are the pillars of our hope! I cannot
   think of what He is, what He has done, what He is doing and what He
   will yet do, without saying, "He is all my salvation and all my
   desire."

   My Brethren, every one of our Lord's offices is a well-spring of
   comfort. Is He Prophet, Priest and King? Is He Friend? Is He Brother?
   Is He Husband? Is He Head? Every way and everywhere we lean the weight
   of our soul's great business upon Him and He is our All in All!
   Besides, there is this sweet thought, that He is our Representative.
   Know you not that of old He was our Covenant Head and stood for us in
   the great transactions of eternity? Like as the first Adam headed up
   the race and stood for us--alas, I must correct myself--fell for us,
   and we fell in him, so now has the second Adam taken up within Himself
   all His people and stood for them and kept for them the covenant. So
   that now it is ordered in all things and sure, and every blessing of it
   is infallibly secured to all the seed. Believers must and shall possess
   the covenanted inheritance because Jesus represents them and, on their
   behalf, has taken possession of the estate of God!

   Whatever Christ is, His people are in Him. They were crucified in Him;
   they were dead in Him; they were buried in Him; they are risen in Him!
   In Him they live eternally, in Him they sit gloriously at the right
   hand of God, "who has raised us up together, and made us sit together
   in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus." In Him we are "accepted in the
   Beloved," both now and forever! And this, I say, is the essence of the
   whole Gospel. He that preaches Christ preaches the Gospel! He who does
   not preach Christ, preaches not the Gospel. It is no more possible for
   there to be a Gospel without Christ than a day without the sun, or a
   river without water, or a living man without a head, or a quickened
   human body without a soul! No, Christ Himself is the life, soul,
   substance and essence of the mystery of the Gospel of God. Christ,
   Himself, I say again, and no other!

   I have been trying to think what we would do if our Lord were gone.
   Suppose that a man has heard of a great physician who understands his
   complaint? He has traveled a great many miles to see this celebrated
   doctor. But when he gets to the door they tell him that he is out.
   "Well," he says, "then I must wait till he is in." "You need not wait,"
   they reply, "his assistant is at home." The suffering man, who has been
   often disappointed, answers, "I do not care about his assistant. I want
   to see the man, himself--mine is a desperate case, but I have heard
   that this physician has cured the like. I must, therefore, see him. No
   assistants for me." "Well," they say, "he is out, but there are his
   books. You can see his books." "Thank you," he says, "I cannot be
   content with his books. I need the living man and nothing less. It is
   to him that I must speak and from him I will receive instructions."

   "Do you see that cabinet?" "Yes." "It is full of his medicines." The
   sick man answers, "I dare say they are very good, but they are of no
   use to me without the doctor. I want their owner to prescribe for me,
   or I shall die of my disease." "But see," cries one, "here is a person
   who has been cured by him, a man of great experience, who has been
   present at many remarkable operations. Go into the inquiry room with
   him and he will tell you all about the mode of cure." The afflicted man
   answers, "I am much obliged to you, but all your talk only makes me
   long the more to see the doctor. I came to see him, and I am not going
   to be put off with anything else. I must see the man, himself, for
   myself. He has made my disease a specialty. He knows how to handle my
   case and I will stay till I see him."

   Now, dear Friends, if you are seeking Christ, imitate this sick man or
   else you will miss the mark altogether! Never be put off with books, or
   conversations. Be not content with Christian people talking to you, or
   preachers preaching to you, or the Bible being read to you, or prayers
   being offered for you. Anything short of Jesus will leave you short of
   salvation! You have to reach Christ and touch Christ, and nothing short
   of this will serve your turn. Picture the case of the prodigal son when
   he went home. Suppose, when he reached the house, the elder brother had
   come to meet him? I must make a supposition that the elder brother had
   sweetened himself and made himself amiable--and then I hear him say,
   "Come in, Brother. Welcome home!"

   But I see the returning one stand there with tears in his eyes and I
   hear him lament, "I want to see my father. I must tell him that I have
   sinned and done evil in his sight." An old servant whispers, "Master
   John, I am glad to see you back. Be happy, for all the servants are
   rejoiced to hear the sound of your voice. It is true your father will
   not see you, but he has ordered the fatted calf to be killed for you.
   And here is the best robe, and a ring, and shoes for your feet, and we
   are told to put them on you." All this would not content the poor
   penitent! I think I hear him cry--"I do not despise anything my father
   gives me, for I am not worthy to be as his hired servant. But what is
   all this unless I see his face and know that he forgives me? There is
   no taste in the feast, no glitter in the ring, no fitness in the shoes,
   no beauty in the robe unless I can see my father and can be reconciled
   to him."

   Do you not see that in the case of the prodigal son the great matter
   was to get his head into his father's bosom and there to sob out,
   "Father, I have sinned"? The one thing necessary was the kiss of free
   forgiveness, the touch of those dear, warm, loving lips, which said,
   "My dear child, I love you and your faults are blotted out." That was
   the thing that gave his soul rest and perfect peace! And this is the
   mystery we come to preach to you--God Himself drawing near to you in
   Christ Jesus and forgiving you all your trespasses. We are not content
   to preach unless Jesus Himself is the theme. We do not set before you
   something about Christ, nor something that belongs to Christ, nor
   something proclaimed by Christ, nor somebody that has known Christ, nor
   some truth which extols Christ! No, we preach Christ Crucified!

   We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord! And we say to you,
   never be content till you clasp the Savior in your arms as Simeon did
   in the Temple. That venerable saint did not pray to depart in peace
   while he only saw the Child in Mary's bosom! But when he had taken the
   dear One into his own arms, then he said, "Lord, now let Your servant
   depart in peace." A personal grasp of a personal Christ, even though we
   only know Him as an Infant, fills the heart to the fullest, but nothing
   else will do it! I go a little farther. As it must be Christ Himself,
   and none other, it must also be Christ Himself rather than anything
   which Christ gives.

   I was thinking, the other day, how different Christ is from all the
   friends and helpers that we have. They bring us good things, but Jesus
   gives us Himself. He does not merely give us wisdom, righteousness,
   sanctification and redemption, but He Himself is made of God all these
   things to us! Hence we can never do without Him. When very ill, you are
   pleased to see the doctor, but when you are getting well you say to
   yourself, "I shall be glad to see the back of the good man, for that
   will be a sure sign that I am off the sick list." Ah, but when Jesus
   heals a soul, he wants to see Jesus more than ever! Our longing for the
   constant company of our Lord is the sign that we are getting well! He
   who longs for Jesus to abide with Him, forever, is healed of his
   plague! We never outgrow Christ--we only grow to hunger more and more!

   If you eat a meal you lose your appetite, but if you feed upon Christ,
   you hunger and thirst still more after Him. This insatiable desire
   after Him is not a painful hunger, but a heavenly, pleasant hunger
   which grows upon you the more its cravings are gratified. The man who
   has little of Christ can do with little of Christ. But he that gets
   more of Christ pines for a yet fuller supply. Suppose a wise man were
   to instruct you? You would learn all he had to teach and then say, "Let
   him go on and teach somebody else." But when Jesus teaches, we discover
   so much of our own ignorance that we would gladly keep Him as our
   life-tutor! When our Lord taught the two disciples on the road to
   Emmaus, He opened the Scriptures and He opened their minds until their
   hearts burned within them! What next? Shall the Divine teacher pass on?
   No, no! They constrained Him, saying, "Abide with us; it is toward
   evening, and the day is far spent." The more He taught them, the more
   they wished to be taught!

   This is always the way with Christ--He is growingly dear, increasingly
   necessary! Oh my Brothers and Sisters, you cannot do without Him! If
   you have your foot upon the threshold of pure gold and your finger on
   the latch of the gate of pearl, you now need Christ more than ever! I
   feel persuaded that you are of Rutherford's mind, when he cried to have
   his heart enlarged till it was as big as Heaven, that he might hold all
   Christ within it--and then he felt that even then is was too narrow a
   space for the boundless love of Jesus, since the Heaven of heavens
   cannot contain Him! And so he cried out for a heart as large as seven
   heavens, that he might entertain the Well-Beloved. Truly, I am content
   with what God has given me in all points, except that I long for more
   of Christ! I could sit down happy if I knew that my portion in the
   house and in the field would never grow--but I am famished to have more
   of my Lord!

   The more we are filled within of Christ, the more we feel our own
   natural emptiness! The more we know of Him, the more we long to know
   Him! Paul, writing to the Philippians, when he had been a Christian for
   many years, yet says, "That I may know Him." Oh, Paul, do you not know
   Christ yet? "Yes," he says, "and no." For he knew the love of Christ,
   but felt that it surpassed all knowledge. "All the rivers run into the
   sea, yet the sea is not full"--this is not our case in one respect, and
   yet it is in another, for all the streams of Grace and love and
   blessedness flow into our souls and we are full--yet, being full, we
   are longing for more! Not Your gifts, Lord, but Yourself! You, You are
   the desire of our hearts! Christ alone is enough.

   Mark this. Nothing must be placed with Christ as if it were necessary
   to Him. Some hold a candle to the sun by preaching Christ and man's
   philosophy, or their own priestcraft. When the blessed rain comes fresh
   from Heaven, they would gladly perfume it with their own dainty extract
   of fancy. As for God's blessed air, fresh from the eternal hills, they
   dream that it cannot be right unless by scientific experiments they
   load it with their own smoke and clouds! Come, clear

   out, let us see the sun! We do not need your rush lights. Away with
   your gauges and your fineries! Let the clear sunlight enter! Let the
   holy water drop from Heaven! We want not your scented essences. Out of
   the way and let the fresh air blow about us. There is nothing like it
   for the health and strength of the soul! We rejoice in Christ and
   nothing else but Christ! Christ and no priestcraft! Christ and no
   philosophy! Christ and no modern thought! Christ and no human
   perfection! Christ, the whole of Christ, and nothing else but
   Christ--here lies the mystery of the Gospel of the Grace of God!

   Brethren, what else but Christ can satisfy the justice of God? Look
   around you when a sense of sin is on you and the dread tribunal is
   before your eyes--what can you bring, by way of expiation, but Christ?
   What can you bring with Christ? What dare you associate with His blood
   and merits? Oh, my God, nothing will content You but Your Son, Your
   Son, alone! What else can quiet conscience? Some professors have
   consciences as good us new, for they have never been used. But he that
   has once had his conscience thoroughly exercised and pressed upon with
   all the weight of sin till he has felt as if it were better for him not
   to be than to be guilty before God--that man acknowledges that nothing
   but Christ will ever quiet his agonized heart!

   See the bleeding Lamb and you will be pacified! See the exalted Lord
   pleading His righteousness before the Throne of God and conscience is
   even as a weaned child--and all the storm within the spirit is hushed
   into a great calm. What else will do to live with but Christ? I do not
   find, in times of pain and depression of spirit, that I can keep up
   upon anything but my Lord. The mind can feed at other times on pretty
   kickshaws and fine confectionery such as certain divines serve out in
   the form of orations and essays and the like, but when you are sorely
   sick, your soul abhors all manner of earthly meat and nothing will stay
   in the stomach but the Bread of Heaven, even the blessed Christ of God!
   Think also, when you come to die, what else will do but Christ? Oh, I
   have seen men die with Heaven in their eyes, the eternal Godhead
   seeming to transfigure them because they rejoiced in Christ! But a
   deathbed without Christ--it is the darkening twilight of eternal night!
   It is the gloomy cave which forms the entrance of the land of darkness.

   Do not venture on life or death without Jesus, I implore you. "None but
   Christ, none but Christ"--this has been the martyr's cry amidst the
   fire--let it be ours in life and death.

   II. Secondly, we are to consider THE SWEETNESS OF THIS MYSTERY, WHICH
   IS CHRIST IN YOU. This is a

   grand advance. I know that there are a great many fishermen here, this
   morning, and I heartily welcome them. When you are out at sea you like
   to know that there are plenty of fish in the sea all round your boats.
   It is a fine thing to get in among the great shoals of fish. Yes, but
   there is one thing better than that! Fish in the sea are good, but the
   fish in the boat are the fish for you! Once get them in the net, or
   better still, safe into the vessel, and you are glad. Now Christ in
   Heaven--Christ free to poor sinners is precious--but Christ here in the
   heart is most precious of all! Here is the marrow and fatness. Christ
   on board the vessel brings safety and calm. Christ in your house,
   Christ in your heart, Christ in you-- that is the cream of the matter,
   the honey of the honeycomb!

   Gold is valuable, but men think more of a pound in their pockets than
   of huge ingots in the bank vault. A loaf of bread is a fine thing, but
   if we could not eat it, and so get it within us, we might die of
   starvation. A medicine may be a noble cure, but if it is always kept in
   the vial and we never take a draught from it, what good will it do us?
   Christ is best known when He is Christ in you. Let us talk about that a
   little. Christ in you--that is, first, Christ accepted by faith. Is it
   not a wonderful thing that Christ Jesus should ever enter into a man?
   Yes, but I will tell you something more wonderful, and that is, that He
   should enter in by so narrow an opening as our little faith! There is
   the sun--I do not know how many thousands of times the sun is bigger
   than the earth, and yet the sun can come into a little room or a close
   cell--and what is more, the sun can get in through a chink!

   When the shutters have been closed I have known him come in through a
   little round hole in them. So Christ can come in through a little
   faith--a mere chink of confidence. If you are such a poor Believer that
   you can hardly think of assurance or confidence, yet if you trust the
   Lord, as surely us the sun comes in by a narrow crack, so will Christ
   come into your soul by the smallest opening of true faith! How wise it
   will be on your part, when you see your Lord's sunny face shining
   through the lattices, to say, "I am not going to be satisfied with
   these mere glints and gleams, I would rather walk in the light of His
   Countenance. Pull up those blinds! Let the heavenly sun shine in and
   let me rejoice in its glory." Grow in faith and enlarge your receiving
   power till you take in Christ into your inmost soul by the Holy Spirit,
   for it is Christ in you by faith that becomes the hope of glory.

   By Christ in you we mean Christ possessed. You see, nothing is so much
   a man's own as that which is within him. Do you tell me that a certain
   slice of bread is not mine and that I have no right to it? But I have
   eaten it and you may bring a lawsuit against me about that bread if you
   like, but you cannot get it away from me! That question is
   settled--that which I have eaten is mine. In this case, possession is
   not only nine points of the law, but all the points. When a man gets
   Christ into Him, the devil himself cannot win a suit against him to
   recover Christ, for that matter is settled beyond question. Christ in
   you is yours, indeed! Men may question whether an acre of land or a
   house belongs to me, but the meat I ate yesterday is not a case of
   property which Chancery or any other court can alter. So, when the
   Believer has Christ in him, the Law has no more to say! The enclosure
   made by faith carries its own title deeds within it.

   It means, too, Christ experienced in all His power. There may be a
   valuable medicine that works like magic to expel a man's pains and cure
   his diseases, but it is of no efficacy till it is within him! When it
   commences to purify his blood and to strengthen his frame, he is in a
   fair way to know it without depending upon the witness of others. Get
   Christ in you curing your sin, Christ in you filling your soul with
   love to virtue and holiness, bathing your heart in comfort and refining
   it with heavenly inspirations--then will you know the Lord! Christ
   believed in, Christ possessed, Christ experienced, Christ in you--this
   is worth a world! Moreover, Christ in us is Christ reigning. It reminds
   me of Mr. Bunyan's picture of Mansoul, when the Prince Immanuel laid
   siege to it and Diabolus, from within the city, strove to keep Him out.

   It was a hard time for Mansoul, then, but, at last, the battering rams
   had broken down the gates and the silver trumpets sounded and the
   Prince's captains entered! Then the Prince, Himself, did ride down the
   city's streets, while liberated citizens welcomed Him with all their
   hearts, hung out all their streamers and made the Church towers ring
   again! The bells rang out merry peals, for the King, Himself, was come.
   Up to the castle of the heart, He rode in triumph and took His royal
   throne to be henceforth the sole lord and king of the city. Christ in
   you is a right royal word! Christ swaying His scepter from the center
   of your being, over every power and faculty, desire and resolve,
   bringing every thought into captivity to Himself--oh, this is glory
   begun and the sure pledge of Heaven!

   Oh for more of the imperial sovereignty of Jesus! It is our liberty to
   be absolutely under His sway. Yes, and then Christ in you is Christ
   filling you. It is wonderful, when Christ once enters into a soul, how,
   by degrees, He occupies the whole of it. Did you ever hear the legend
   of a man whose garden produced nothing else but weeds, till at last he
   met with a strange foreign flower of singular vitality? The story is
   that he sowed a handful of this seed in his overgrown garden and left
   it to work its own sweet way. He slept and rose and knew not how the
   seed was growing till one day he opened the gate and saw a scene which
   astounded him. He knew that the seed would produce a dainty flower and
   he looked for it. But he had little dreamed that the plant would cover
   the whole garden! So it was--the flower had exterminated every weed,
   till, as he looked from one end to the other--from wall to wall he
   could see nothing but the fair colors of that rare plant and smell
   nothing but its delicious perfume.

   Christ is that plant of renown! If He is sown in the soil of your soul,
   He will gradually eat out the roots of all evil weeds and poisonous
   plants, till over all your nature there shall be Christ in you! God
   grant we may realize the picture in our own hearts, and then we shall
   be in Paradise! It may sound strange to add that Christ in you
   transfigures the man till he becomes like Christ, Himself. You thrust a
   bar of cold, black iron into the fire and keep it there till the fire
   enters into it. Look, the iron is like fire, itself--he that feels it
   will know no difference. The fire has permeated the iron and made it a
   fiery mass. I should like to have seen that bush in Horeb before which
   Moses took off his shoes. When it was all ablaze it seemed no longer a
   bush, but a mass of fire, a furnace of pure flame. The fire had
   transfigured the bush. So it is with us when Christ enters into us--He
   elevates us to a nobler state, even as Paul said--"I live, yet not I,
   but Christ lives in me."

   Jesus sanctifies us wholly--spirit, soul, and body--and takes us to
   dwell with Him in the perfect state above. Christ in you--how can I
   explain it? We are the little graft and He is the strong and living
   stem. We are laid to Him, bound to Him, sealed to Him--and when there
   is nothing between the new shoot and the old tree, at last the sap
   flows into the graft and graft and the tree are one! You know right
   well how Christ enters into us and becomes our life. Christ in you
   means power in you. A strong man armed keeps his house till a stronger
   than he comes--and when the stronger enters, the first tenant is
   ejected by the power of the new comer and kept out by the same means.
   We were without strength till Christ came, but now we war with
   principalities and powers and win the victory. Christ in you! Oh, what
   bliss! What joy! The Bridegroom is with us and we cannot fast! The King
   is with us and we are glad!

   When King Charles went to live at Newmarket, it is said that a most
   poverty-stricken village became a wealthy place. Truly, when Christ
   comes to dwell in our hearts, our spiritual poverty suddenly turns to
   blessed wealth. Christ in you! What a wonder it is that He should deign
   to come under our roof! Lift up your heads, O you gates, and be you
   lifted up, you everlasting doors, that the King of Glory may come in.
   See the honor which His entrance brings with it! He glorifies the place
   where His foot rests even for a moment. If Jesus does but enter into
   your heart, His court comes within Him--honor, glory, immortality,
   Heaven and all other Divine things follow where He leads. "Oh," says
   one, "I wish He would come and dwell in me." Then, be humble, for He
   loves to dwell with him that is humble and of a contrite spirit.

   Next, be clean, for if they must be clean that bear God's vessels, much
   more they that have Christ, Himself, in them. Next, be empty, for
   Christ will not live amid the lumber of self, pride and carnal
   sufficiency. Learn abundantly to rejoice in Christ, for he who welcomes
   Christ will have Him always for a guest. Jesus never tarries where He
   is not desired. If His welcome is worn out, away He goes. Oh, desire
   and delight in Him! Hunger and thirst after Him, for Christ delights to
   dwell with an eager people, a hungry people, a people who value Him and
   cannot be happy without Him. Surely I have said enough to make you feel
   that the sweetness of true godliness lies in having Christ in you.

   III. Thirdly, we are to consider that the OUTLOOK OF ALL THIS IS CHRIST
   IN YOU, THE HOPE OF GLORY. Last Sunday morning, as best I could in my
   feebleness, I spoke to you about the time when this earthly house of
   our tabernacle shall be dissolved, when we shall find that we have a
   building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
   But this morning's text goes a little further--it speaks of glory which
   is a hope for soul as well as body. Why glory! Glory? Surely that
   belongs only to God. To Him alone be glory! Yes, but Christ has said,
   "Father, I will that they, also, whom You have given Me be with Me
   where I am, that they may behold My glory."

   And He also says, "And the glory which You have given Me, I have given
   them." Think of it! Glory for us poor creatures! Glory for you, Sister!
   Glory for me! It seems a strange thing that a sinner should ever have
   anything to do with glory when he deserves nothing but shame. We are
   neither kings nor princes, what have we to do with glory? Yet glory is
   to be our dwelling, glory our light, glory our crown, glory our song!
   The Lord will not be content to give us less than glory. Grace is very
   sweet, but might we not be content to swim forever in a sea of Grace?
   But no, our Lord "will give Grace and glory."--

   "All needful Grace will God bestow, And crown that Grace with glory,
   too." We shall have glorified bodies, glorious companions, a glorious
   reward and glorious rest!

   But how do we know that we shall have glory? Why, first, He that has
   come to live in our hearts and reigns as our bosom's Lord, makes us
   glorious by His coming! His rest is glorious--the place of His feet is
   glorious--He must mean some great thing towards us, or He would never
   dwell in us. I saw a line carriage stopping, the other day, at a very
   humble hovel, and I thought to myself--"that carriage is not stopping
   there to collect rent, or to borrow a broom." Oh, no, that lady,
   yonder, is calling round and visiting the poor, and I doubt not she has
   taken in some nourishment to an invalid. I hope it was so. And I am
   sure my Lord Jesus Christ's carriage never stops at my door to get
   anything out of me! Whenever He comes, He brings countless blessings
   with Him. Such a one as He is, God over all, blessed forever--it cannot
   be that He took our nature, unless with high designs of unsearchable
   love!

   Thus we nourish large expectations upon the food of solid reason. I am
   sure our Lord Jesus would never have done so much if He had not meant
   to manifest the immeasurable breadth and length of a love which is
   beyond imagining. What He has done, already, surprises me even to
   amazement. I think nothing can appear strange or hard to believe, let
   Him do what He may in the future. If the Scriptures tell me my Lord is
   going to fill me with His own glory and to set me at His own right
   hand, I believe it. He who went to the Cross for me will never be
   ashamed of me. He who gave me Himself will give me all Heaven and more!
   He that opened His very heart to find blood and water to wash me
   in--how shall He keep back even His kingdom from me?

   O sweet Lord Jesus, You are, indeed, to us the hope, the pledge, the
   guarantee of glory! Friend, do you not feel that Christ in you is the
   dawn of Heaven? Besides this, Christ is He that has entered into
   covenant with God to bring His people home to glory. He has pledged
   Himself to bring every sheep of His flock safe to His Father's right
   hand and He will keep His engagement, for He never failed one Covenant
   promise yet. Moreover, this we do know, that the Christ who is come to
   live with us will never be separated from us. If He had not meant to
   stay, He would not have entered our heart at

   all. There was nothing to tempt Him to come, and if, in Sovereign
   Grace, He deigned to live in the poor cottage of our nature, then,
   Brothers and Sisters, He knew what He was doing. He had counted the
   cost, He had foreseen all the evil that would be in us and about us,
   and when He came, He come with the intent to stay.

   Someone asked another, the other day, "What persuasion are you of?" And
   the answer was, "I am persuaded that neither life, nor death nor things
   present, nor things to come shall separate us from the love of God
   which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Are not you of that persuasion,
   Brother? If so, you can see how Christ in you is the hope of glory.
   Why, look, Sirs, Christ in you is glory! Did we not show that just now?
   "Lift up your heads, O you gates, and be you lifted up you everlasting
   doors, that the King of Glory may come in!" You have Heaven in having
   Christ, for Christ is the biggest part of Heaven! Is not Christ the
   soul of Heaven, and having Him you have glory? What is more, having
   gotten Christ, Christ's glory and your glory are wrapped up together.

   If Christ were to lose you, it would be a great loss to you, but a
   greater loss to Him. If I can perish with Christ in me, I shall
   certainly be a fearful loser, but so will He, for where is His honor,
   where His glory if a Believer perishes? His glory is gone if one soul
   that trusts in Him is ever cast away. Comfort yourselves with this
   word--Christ in you means you in glory, as surely us God lives! There
   is no question about that! Go your ways and rejoice in Christ Jesus and
   let men see who it is that lives in you! Let Jesus speak through your
   mouth, weep through your eyes and smile through your face! Let Him work
   with your hands and walk within your feet, and be tender with your
   heart. Let Him seek sinners through you! Let Him comfort saints through
   you until the day breaks and the shadows flee away!

Glory!

   (No. 1721)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 20, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Who has called us unto His eternal glory." 1 Peter 5:10.

   A FORTNIGHT ago, when I was only able to creep to the front of this
   platform, I spoke to you concerning the future of our mortal
   bodies--[Sermon #1719--The Tent Dissolved and the Mansion Entered]--"We
   know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we
   have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the
   heavens." On the next Sabbath, [Sermon #1720--Christ in You], we went a
   step further and we did not preach so much about the resurrection of
   the body as upon the hope of Glory for our entire nature, our text
   being, "Christ in you, the hope of glory."

   Thus we have passed through the outer court and have trod the hallowed
   floor of the Holy Place. And now we are the more prepared to enter
   within the veil and to gaze, a while, upon the glory which awaits us.
   We shall say a little-- and oh, how little it will be--upon that glory
   of which we have so sure a prospect, that glory which is prepared for
   us in Christ Jesus and of which He is the hope! I pray that our eyes
   may be strengthened that we may see the heavenly light and that our
   ears may be opened to hear sweet voices from the better land. As for
   me, I cannot say that I will speak of the glory, but I will try to
   stammer about it--for the best language to which a man can reach
   concerning Glory must be a mere stammering.

   Paul did but see a little of it for a short time and he confessed that
   he heard things that it was not lawful for a man to utter. And I doubt
   not that he felt utterly unable to describe what he had seen. Though a
   great master of language, yet for once he was overpowered--the grandeur
   of his theme made him silent! As for us, what can we do, where even
   Paul breaks down? Pray, dear Friends that the Spirit of Glory may rest
   upon you, that He may open your eyes to see as much as can at present
   be seen of the heritage of the saints! We are told that "eye has not
   seen, neither has ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of
   man, the things which God has prepared for them that love Him."

   Yet the eye has seen wonderful things! There are sunrises and sunsets,
   Alpine glories and ocean marvels which, once seen, cling to our
   memories throughout life! Yet, even when Nature is at her best, she
   cannot give us an idea of the supernatural Glory which God has prepared
   for His people! The ear has heard sweet harmonies. Have we not enjoyed
   music which has thrilled us? Have we not listened to speech which has
   seemed to make our hearts dance within us? And yet no melody of harp
   nor charm of oratory can ever raise us to a conception of the glory
   which God has laid up for them that love Him! As for the heart of man,
   what strange things have entered it! Men have exhibited fair fictions,
   woven in the loom of fancy, which have made the eyes sparkle with their
   beauty and brightness--imagination has reveled and rioted in its own
   fantastic creations, roaming among islands of silver and mountains of
   gold, or swimming in seas of wine and rivers of milk--but imagination
   has never been able to open the gate of pearl which shuts in the city
   of our God.

   No, it has not yet entered the heart of man. Yet the text goes on to
   say, "but He has revealed it unto us by His Spirit." So that Heaven is
   not an utterly unknown region, not altogether an inner brightness shut
   in with walls of impenetrable darkness. God has revealed joys which He
   has prepared for His beloved, but mark you, even though they are
   revealed of the Spirit, yet it is no common unveiling and the reason
   that it is made known at all is ascribed to the fact that "the Spirit
   searches all things, yes, the deep things of God." So we see that the
   glory which awaits the saints is ranked among the deep things of God
   and He that would speak, thereof, after the manner of the oracles of
   God must have much heavenly teaching. It is easy to chatter according
   to human fancy, but if we would follow the sure teaching of the Word of
   God, we shall have need to be taught of the holy Spirit, without whose
   anointing the deep things of God must be hidden from us. Pray that we
   may be under that teaching while we dwell upon this theme.

   There are three questions which we will answer this morning. The first
   is, what is the destiny of the saints?-- "Eternal glory," says the
   text. Secondly, in which does this glory consist? I said we would
   answer the questions, but this is not to be answered this side the
   pearl gate. Thirdly, what should be the influence of this prospect upon
   our hearts? What manner of people ought we to be whose destiny is
   eternal glory? How should we live who are to live forever in the glory
   of the Most High?

   I. First, WHAT, THEN, IS THE DESTINY OF THE SAINTS? Our text tells us
   that God has "called us unto His eternal glory." "Glory!" Does not the
   very word astound you? "Glory!" Surely that belongs to God alone! Yet
   the Scripture says, "glory," and glory it must mean, for it never
   exaggerates. Think of glory for us who have deserved eternal shame!
   Glory for us poor creatures who are often ashamed of ourselves! Yes, I
   look at my book, again, and it actually says, "glory"--nothing less
   than glory! Therefore it must be so.

   Now, since this seems so amazing and astonishing a thing, I would so
   speak with you that not a relic of incredulity may remain in your
   hearts concerning it. I would ask you to follow me while we look
   through the Bible, not quoting every passage which speaks of glory, but
   mentioning a few of the leading ones. This glory has been promised.
   What said David? In the 73rd Psalm and 24th verse we meet with these
   remarkable words--"You shall guide me with Your counsel, and afterward
   receive me to glory." In the original Hebrew there is a trace of
   David's recollection of Enoch's being translated and, though the royal
   Psalmist did not expect to be caught away without dying, yet he did
   expect that after he had followed the guidance of the Lord here below,
   the great Father would stoop and raise up His child to be with Himself
   forever.

   He expected to be received into Glory. Even in those dim days, when as
   yet the light of the Gospel was but in its dawn, this Prophet and king
   was able to say, "You shall afterward receive me to glory." Did he not
   mean the same thing when, in the 84th Psalm, verse 11, he said, "The
   Lord will give Grace and glory: no good thing will He withhold from
   them that walk uprightly"? Not only no good thing under the name of
   Grace will God withhold from the upright, but no good thing under the
   head of Glory. No good of Heaven shall be kept from the saints; no
   reserve is even set upon the throne of the great King, for our Lord
   Jesus has graciously promised, "To Him that overcomes will I grant to
   sit with Me on My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with
   My Father on His throne." "No good thing," not even among the
   infinitely good things of Heaven, will God "withhold from them that
   walk uprightly."

   If David had this persuasion, much more may we who walk in the light of
   the Gospel! Since our Lord Jesus has suffered and entered into His
   Glory, and we know that we shall be with Him where He is, we are
   confident that our rest shall be glorious! Brothers and Sisters, it is
   to this glory that we have been called! The people of God, having been
   predestinated, have been called with an effectual calling--called so
   that they have obeyed the call and have run after Him who has drawn
   them! Now, our text says that He has, "called us unto His eternal glory
   by Christ Jesus." We are called to repentance, we are called to faith,
   we are called to holiness, we are called to perseverance--and all this
   that we may afterwards attain unto glory!

   We have another Scripture of like import in 1 Thessalonians 2:12--"Who
   has called you unto His kingdom and glory." We are called unto His
   kingdom according to our Lord's words, "Fear not, little flock; for it
   is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom." We are called
   to be kings, called to wear a crown of life that fades not away, called
   to reign with Christ in His Glory! If the Lord had not meant us to have
   the glory, He would not have called us unto it, for His calling is no
   mockery. He would not, by His Spirit, have fetched us out from the
   world and separated us unto Himself if He had not intended to keep us
   from falling and preserve us eternally. Believer, you are called to
   glory-- do not question the certainty of that to which God has called
   you!

   And we are not only called to it, Brothers and Sisters, but glory is
   especially joined with justification. Let me quote Romans
   8:30--"Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also called: and whom
   He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them He also
   glorified." These various mercies are threaded together like pearls
   upon a string-- there is no breaking the thread, no separating the
   precious things. They are put in their order by God, Himself, and they
   are kept there by His eternal and irreversible decree. If you are
   justified by the righteousness of Christ, you shall be glorified
   through Christ Jesus, for thus has God purposed, and so must it be! Do
   you not remember how salvation, itself, is linked with glory? Paul, in
   2 Timothy 2:10, speaks of "the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
   eternal glory." The

   two things are riveted together and cannot be separated! The saved ones
   must partake of the glory of God, for this are they being prepared
   every day.

   Paul, in the ninth of Romans, where he speaks about the predestinating
   will of God, says in the 23rd verse--"The vessels of mercy, which He
   had afore prepared unto glory." This is the process which commenced in
   regeneration and is going on in us every day in the work of
   sanctification. We cannot be glorified so long as sin remains in us--we
   must first be pardoned, renewed and sanctified--and then we are fitted
   to be glorified. By communion with our Lord Jesus we are made like He,
   as says the Apostle in 2 Corinthians 3:18--"But we all, with open face
   beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
   same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." It
   is very wonderful, how, by the wisdom of God, everything is made to
   work this way.

   Look at the blessed text in 2 Corinthians 4:17, where Paul says, "For
   our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far
   more exceeding and eternal weight of glory," where he represents that
   all that we can suffer, whether of body or of mind, is producing for us
   such a mass of glory that he is quite unable to describe it and he uses
   hyperbolically language in saying, "a far more exceeding and eternal
   weight of glory." Oh, blessed men, whose very losses are their gains,
   whose sorrows produce their joys, whose griefs are big with Heaven!
   Well may we be content to suffer if so it is that all things are
   working together for our good and are helping to pile up the excess of
   our future glory! Thus, then, it seems we are called to glory and we
   are being prepared for it.

   Is it not, also, a sweet thought that our present fellowship with
   Christ is the guarantee of it? In Romans 8:17 it is said, "If so be
   that we suffer with Him that we may be also glorified together." Going
   to prison with Christ will bring us into the palace with Christ!
   Smarting with Christ will bring us into reigning with Christ! Being
   ridiculed, slandered and despised for Christ's sake will bring us to be
   sharers of His honor, glory and immortality! Who would not be with
   Christ in His humiliation if this is the guarantee that we shall be
   with Him in His Glory? Remember those dear words of the Lord Jesus,
   "You are they which have continued with Me in My temptations. And I
   appoint unto you a kingdom, as My Father has appointed unto Me." Let us
   shoulder the Cross, for it leads to the crown. "No Cross, no
   crown"--but he that has shared the battle shall partake in the victory.

   I have not yet done, for there is a text, in Hebrews 2:10, which is
   well worthy of our consideration--we are to be brought to Glory. It is
   said of our Lord that it "became Him, for whom are all things, in
   bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation
   perfect through sufferings." See, Beloved, we are called to Heaven, we
   are being prepared for it and we shall be brought to it. We might
   despair of ever getting into the glory land if we had not One to bring
   us there, for the pilgrim's road is rough and beset with many foes--but
   there is a "Captain of our salvation"--a greater than Bunyan's
   Great-Hearted, who is conducting the pilgrim band through all the
   treacherous ways and He will bring the "many sons"--where?--"unto
   glory!" Nowhere short of that shall be their ultimatum.

   Glory, glory shall surely follow upon Grace--for Christ the Lord, who
   has come into His Glory--has entered into Covenant engagements that He
   will bring all the "many sons" to be with Him. Mark this and then I
   will quote no more Scriptures--this glory will be for our entire
   manhood--for our body as well as for our soul! You know that text in
   the famous Resurrection chapter in 1 Corinthians 15? Paul speaks of the
   body as being "sown in dishonor," but he adds, "it is raised in glory."
   And then, in Philippians 3:21, he says of our Divine Lord at His
   coming, "Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
   unto His glorious body, according to the working whereby He is able
   even to subdue all things unto Himself." What a wonderful change that
   will be for this frail, feeble, suffering body!

   In some respects it is not vile, for it is a wonderful product of
   Divine skill, power and goodness--but inasmuch as it hampers our
   spiritual nature by its appetites and infirmities--it may be called a
   "vile body." It is an unhandy body for a spirit--it fits a soul well
   enough, but a spirit needs something more ethereal, less earth-bound,
   more full of life than this poor flesh and blood and bone can ever be.
   Well, the body is to be changed. What alteration will it undergo? It
   will be rendered perfect. The body of a child will be fully developed
   and the dwarf will attain to full stature. The blind shall not be
   sightless in Heaven, neither shall the lame be halt, nor shall the
   palsied tremble. The deaf shall hear and the dumb shall sing God's
   praises. We shall carry none of our deficiencies or infirmities to
   Heaven. As good Mr. Ready-to-Halt did not carry his crutches there,
   neither shall any of us need a staff to lean upon!

   There we shall not know an aching brow, or a weak knee, or a failing
   eye. "The inhabitant shall no more say, I am sick." And it shall be an
   impassive body, a body that will be incapable of any kind of
   suffering--no palpitating heart, no

   sinking spirit, no aching limbs no lethargic soul shall worry us there!
   No, we shall be perfectly delivered from every evil of that kind.
   Moreover, it shall be an immortal body. Our risen bodies shall not be
   capable of decay, much less of death. There are no graves in Heaven!
   Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, for their bodies shall rise
   never to know death and corruption a second time!

   No smell or taint of corruption shall remain upon those whom Jesus
   shall call from the tomb. The risen body shall be greatly increased in
   power--it is "sown in weakness," says the Scripture--but it is "raised
   in power." I suppose there will be a wonderful agility about our
   renovated frame. Probably it will be able to move as swiftly as the
   lightning flash, for so do angels pass from place to place, and we
   shall in this, as in many other things, be as the angels of God.
   Anyway, it will be a "glorious body" and it will be "raised in glory,"
   so that the whole of our manhood shall participate of that wonderful
   depth of bliss which is summed up in the word--"glory." Thus I think I
   have set before you much of what the Word of God says upon this matter.

   II. Secondly, may the Holy Spirit help me while I try very hesitatingly
   and stammeringly to answer the enquiry, WHEREIN DOES THIS DESTINY
   CONSIST? Do you know how much I expect to do? It will be but little.
   You remember what the Lord did for Moses when the man of God prayed--"I
   beseech you show me Your glory!" All that the Lord, Himself, did for
   Moses was to say, "You shall see My back parts; but My face shall not
   be seen." How little, then, can we hope to speak of this glory! Its
   back parts are too bright for us--as for the face of that glory, it
   shall not be seen by any of us here below, though, by-and-by, we shall
   behold it!

   I suppose if one who had been in Heaven could come straight down from
   there and occupy this platform, he would find that his discoveries
   could not be communicated because of the insufficiency of language to
   express such a weight of meaning. The saints' destiny is glory! What is
   glory, Brothers and Sisters? What is it, I mean, among the sons of men?
   It is generally understood to be fame, a great reputation, the sound of
   trumpets, the noise of applause, the sweets of approbation among the
   crowd and in high places. The Queen of Sheba came from afar to see the
   glory of Solomon. What was that glory, Brothers and Sisters? It was the
   glory of a rare wisdom excelling all others! It was the glory of
   immense riches expended upon all manner of magnificence and splendor!

   As for this last glory, the Lord says of it that a lily of the field
   had more of it than Solomon. At least, "Solomon in all his glory was
   not arrayed like one of these." Yet that is what men mean by
   glory--rank, position, power, conquest-- things that make the ears of
   men to tingle when they hear of them--things extraordinary and rare.
   All this is but a dim shadow of what God means by glory, yet out of the
   shadow we may obtain a little inkling of what the substance must be.
   God's people shall be wise and even famous, for they shall "shine as
   the stars forever and ever." God's people shall be rich--the very
   streets of their abode are paved with gold exceedingly rich and rare.
   God's people shall be singularly honored--there shall be an unrivalled
   glory about them, for they shall be known as a peculiar people, a royal
   priesthood, a race of beings lifted up to reveal their Maker's
   Character beyond all the rest of His works.

   I reckon that glory to a saint means, first of all, purified character.
   The brightest glory that really can come to anyone is the glory of
   character. Thus God's glory among men is His goodness, His mercy, His
   justice, His truth. But shall such poor creatures as we are ever have
   perfect characters? Yes, we shall one day be perfectly holy! God's Holy
   Spirit, when He has finished His work, will leave in us no trace of
   sin! No temptation shall be able to touch us! There will be in us no
   relics of our past and fallen state. Oh, will not that be blessed? I
   was going to say it is all the glory I need--the glory of being perfect
   in character, never sinning, never judging unjustly, never thinking a
   vain thought, never wandering away from the perfect Law of God, never
   vexed with sin which has so long been my worst enemy!

   One day we shall be glorious because the devil, himself, will not be
   able to detect a fault in us--and those eyes of God which burn like
   fire and read the inmost secrets of the soul will not be able to detect
   anything blameworthy in us! Such shall be the character of the saints
   that they shall be meet to fellowship with Christ Himself! They will be
   fit company for that thrice Holy Being before whom angels veil their
   faces. This is glory!

   Next, I understand by, "glory," our perfected manhood. When God made
   Adam, he was a far superior being to any of us. Man's place in creation
   was very remarkable. The Psalmist says, "For You have made him a little
   lower than the angels and have crowned him with glory and honor. You
   made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put
   all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of
   the field; the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever
   passes through the paths of the seas." No king among men in these days
   could rival Adam in the Gar-

   den of Eden--he was, indeed, monarch of all that he surveyed, and from
   the lordly lion down to the tiniest insect of all, living creatures
   paid him willing homage. Can we ever rise to this last honor?

   Brothers and Sisters, listen--"It does not yet appear what we shall be,
   but we know that when Christ shall appear we shall be like He, for we
   shall see Him as He is." Is there any limit to the growth of the mind
   of a man? Can we tell what he may reach? We read of Solomon that God
   gave him largeness of heart as the sand of the sea! God will give to
   His people glory that will include in it more largeness of heart than
   Solomon ever knew! Then shall we know even as we are known by God. Now
   we see, but it is, "through a glass darkly." But then we shall see
   "face to face." You have met with men of great intellect and you have
   looked up to them, but assuredly, the smallest babe in Christ, when he
   shall reach Heaven, shall have a greater intellect than the most
   profound philosopher who has ever astounded mankind by his discoveries!

   We shall not always be as we are today, contracted and hampered because
   of our little knowledge, our slender faculties and our dull
   perceptions. Our ignorance and prejudice shall vanish. What a man will
   become we can scarcely tell when he is remade in the image of God, and
   made like unto our Divine Lord who is, "the firstborn among many
   brethren." Here we are but in the embryo stage--our minds are but the
   seeds, or the bulbs out of which shall come the flower and glory of a
   nobler manhood! Your body is to be developed into something infinitely
   brighter and better than the bodies of men here below. And as for the
   soul, we cannot guess to what an elevation it shall be raised in Christ
   Jesus. There is room for the largest expectation, here, as we
   conjecture what will be the full accomplishment of the vast intent of
   eternal love--an intent which has involved the sacrifice of the
   Only-Begotten Son of God! That can be no mean design which has been
   carried on at the expense of the best that Heaven, itself, possessed!

   Further, by "glory" and, "coming to glory," I think we must understand
   complete victory. Dwelling in the age of the Romans, men said to
   themselves, as they read the Scriptures, "What does the Apostle mean by
   'glory'?" And they could scarcely help connecting it with conquest and
   the return of the warrior in triumph. Men called it, "glory," in those
   days when valiant warriors returned from fields of blood with captives
   and spoil. Then did the heroes ride through the streets of Rome,
   enjoying a triumph voted them by the senate. Then, for a while, the men
   of war were covered with glory and all the city was glorious because of
   them.

   As Christians, we hate the word, "glory," when it is linked with
   wholesale murder and symbolized in garments rolled in blood. But yet
   there is a kind of fighting to which you and I are called, for we are
   soldiers of the Cross and if we fight valiantly under our great
   Captain, and rout every sin, and are found faithful even unto
   death--then we shall enter glory and receive the honor which belongs to
   men who have fought a good fight, and have kept the faith. It will be
   no small glory to obtain the crown of life which fades not away. Is not
   this a full glory if we only place these three things together, a
   purified character, a perfected nature and a complete victory?

   An invaluable ingredient in true glory is the Divine approval. "Glory"
   among men means approbation--it is a man's glory when he is honored by
   his Queen and she hangs a medal on his breast--or when his name is
   mentioned in the high court of Parliament and he is ennobled for what
   he has done. If men speak of our actions with approval, it is called
   fame and glory. Oh, but one drop of the approbation of God has more
   glory in it than a sea full of human praise! And the Lord will reward
   His own with this holy favor. He will say, "Well done, good and
   faithful servant," and Christ, before the universe, will say, "Come,
   you blessed of My Father." Oh, what glory that will be! They were
   despised and rejected of men; they "wandered about in sheepskins and
   goatskins; destitute, afflicted, tormented"--but now God approves them
   and they take seats among the peers of Heaven, made noble by the
   approbation of the Judge of All!

   This is glory with an emphasis, substantial glory! One approving glance
   from the eyes of Jesus; one accepting word from the mouth of the Father
   will be glory enough for any one of us--and this we shall have if we
   follow the Lamb wherever He goes! But this is not all--children of God
   will have the glory of reflecting the glory of God. When any of God's
   unfallen creatures shall wish to see the greatness of God's goodness,
   mercy and love, they that dwell in Heaven will point out a glorified
   saint. Whenever any spirit from a far off regions desires to know what
   is meant by faithfulness and Grace, some angel will reply, "Go and talk
   with those who have been redeemed from among men."

   I believe that you and I will spend much of eternity in making known to
   principalities and powers the unsearchable riches of the Grace of God.
   We shall be mirrors reflecting God and in us shall His Glory be
   revealed. There may be myriads of races of pure and holy beings of whom
   we have never heard of as yet, and these may come to the New Jerusalem
   as

   to the great metropolis of Jehovah's universe--and when they come,
   there they will gaze upon the saints as the highest instances of Divine
   Grace, wisdom, power and love. It will be their highest pleasure to
   hear how eternal mercy dealt with us unworthy ones. How we shall
   delight to rehearse to them the fact of the Father's eternal purpose,
   the story of the Incarnate God--the God that loved and died and the
   love of the blessed Spirit who sought us in the days of our sin, and
   brought us to the foot of the Cross, renewing us in the spirit of our
   minds and making us to be sons of God!

   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, this shall be our glory, that God shall shine
   through us to the astonishment of all! Yet I think glory includes
   somewhat more than this. In certain cases, a man's glory lies in his
   relationships. If any of the royal family should come to your houses,
   you would receive them with respect. Yes, and even as they went along
   the street they would be spied out, and passers-by would say, "That is
   the prince!" And they would honor the son of our good Queen. But royal
   descent is a poor business compared with being allied to the King of
   kings! Many angels are exceedingly bright, but they are only servants
   to wait upon the sons. I believe that there will be a kind of awe upon
   the angels at the sight of men--when they see us in our glory, they
   will rejoice to know our near relation to their Lord--and to fulfill
   their own destiny as ministering spirits appointed to minister to the
   heirs of salvation.

   No pride will be possible to the perfected, but we shall then realize
   the exalted position to which, by our new birth, and the Divine
   adoption we have been raised. "Behold what manner of love the Father
   has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God." Sons of
   God! Sons of the Lord God Almighty! Oh what glory this will be! Then
   there will be connected with this the fact that we shall be connected
   with Jesus in everything. For do not you see, Brothers and Sisters, it
   was because of our fall that Christ came here to save men? When He
   worked out a perfect righteousness, it was all for us. When He died, it
   was all for us. And when He rose again, it was all for us!

   And what is more, we lived in Christ, we died in Him, we were buried in
   Him and rose in Him--and we shall ascend into Heaven to reign with Him!
   All our glory is by Christ Jesus and in all the glory of Christ Jesus
   we have a share. We are members of His body. We are one with Him. I say
   the creatures that God has made, when they shall come to worship in the
   New Jerusalem, will stand and gaze at glorified men and with bated
   breath will say one, to another "These are the beings whose nature the
   Son of God assumed! These are the chosen creatures whom the Prince of
   Heaven bought with His own blood." They will stand astonished at the
   Divine Glory which will be manifested in beings emancipated from sin
   and Hell and made heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus Christ!

   Will not even angels be surprised and awed as they look on the Church
   and say to one another, "This is the bride, the Lamb's wife!" They will
   marvel how the Lord of Glory should come to this poor earth to seek a
   spouse and that He should enter into eternal union with such a people!
   Glory, glory dwells in Immanuel's land! Now we are getting near to the
   center of it. I feel inclined, like Moses, to take off my shoes, for
   the place where we stand is holy ground, now that we are getting to see
   poor bushes like ourselves aglow with the indwelling God and changed
   from glory unto glory! And yet this is not all, for there in Heaven we
   shall dwell in the immediate Presence of God. We shall dwell with Him
   in nearest and dearest fellowship! All the felicity of the Most High
   will be our felicity. The blessedness of the Triune Jehovah shall be
   our blessedness forever and ever.

   Did you notice that our text says, "He has called us unto His glory"?
   This outshines everything--the glory which the saints will have is the
   same glory which God possesses and such as He, alone, can bestow!
   Listen to this text--"Whom He justified them He also glorified." He
   glorifies them! I know what it is to glorify God, and so do you, but
   when we poor creatures glorify God it is in a poor way, for we cannot
   add anything to Him. But what must it be for God, Himself, to glorify a
   man! The glory which you are to have forever, my dear believing
   Brothers and Sisters, is a glory which God Himself will put upon you!

   Peter, as a Hebrew, perhaps uses a Hebraism when he says, "His glory."
   It may be that he means the best of glory that can be, even as the Jews
   were apt to say--"The trees of God"--when they meant the greatest
   trees, or, "the mountains of God," when they intended the highest
   mountains. So, by the glory of God, Peter may mean the richest, fullest
   glory that can be. In the original, the word, "glory," has about it the
   idea of, "weight," at which the Apostle Paul hints when he speaks of a
   "weight of glory." This is the only glory that has weight in it, all
   else is light as a feather. Take all the glories of this world and they
   are outweighed by the small dust of the balance. Place them here in the
   hollow of my hand, all of them--a child may blow them away as
   thistledown!

   God's glory has weight! It is solid, true, real--and he that gets it
   possesses no mere name, or dream, or tinsel--he has that which will
   abide the rust of ages and the fire of judgment. The glory of God! How
   shall I describe it? I must set before you a strange Scriptural
   picture. Mordecai must be made glorious for his fidelity to his king
   and singular is the honor which his monarch ordains for him. This was
   the royal order. "Let the royal apparel be brought which the king uses
   to wear, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the crown royal
   which is set upon his head: and let this apparel and horse be delivered
   to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may
   array the man with whom the king delights to honor, and bring him on
   horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him,
   'Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.'"

   Can you not imagine the surprise of the Jew when robe and ring were put
   upon him, and when he found himself placed upon the king's horse? This
   may serve as a figure of that which will happen to us--we shall be
   glorified with the Glory of God! The best robe, the best of Heaven's
   array shall be appointed unto us and we shall dwell in the house of the
   Lord forever! Highest of all our glory will be the enjoyment of God
   Himself. He will be our exceeding joy--this bliss will swallow up every
   other--the blessedness of God. "The Lord is my portion," says my soul.
   "Whom have I in Heaven but You? And there is none upon earth that I
   desire beside You." Our God shall be our glory! Yet bear with me, I
   have left out a word again--the text has it, "Unto His eternal glory."
   Yes, but that is the gem of the ring. The glory which God has in
   reserve for His chosen will never come to an end--it will stay with us
   and we shall stay with it forever!

   It will always be glory, too. Its brightness will never become dim. We
   shall never be tired of it, or sated with it. After ten thousand
   thousand millions of years in Heaven, our happiness shall be as fresh
   as when it first began! Those are no fading laurels which surround
   immortal brows. Eternal glory knows no diminution. Can you imagine a
   man being born at the same time that Adam was created and living all
   these thousands of years as a king like Solomon, having all he could
   desire? His would seem to be a glorious life. But, if at the end of
   7,000 years that man must necessarily die, what has it profited him?
   His glory is all over, now--its fires have died out in ashes.

   But you and I, when we once enter Glory, shall receive what we can
   neither lose nor leave. Eternity! Eternity! This is the sweetness of
   all our future bliss! Rejoice, you saintly ones! Take your harps down
   from the willows, any of you who are mourning--and if you never sang
   before, yet sing this morning, "God has called us unto His eternal
   glory," and this is to be our portion world without end!

   III. I can only find time for a few words upon the concluding head,
   which is--WHAT INFLUENCE SHOULD ALL THIS HAVE UPON OUR HEARTS? I think,
   first, it ought to excite desire in many here present that they might
   attain unto glory by Christ Jesus. Satan, when he took our blessed Lord
   to the top of an exceedingly high mountain, tempted Him to worship him
   by offering Him the kingdoms of the world and all the glories thereof.
   Satan is very clever and I will, at this time, take a leaf out of his
   book. Will you not fall down and worship the Lord Jesus when He can
   give you the Kingdom of God and all the glory thereof, and all this,
   not in pretense, but in reality?

   If there was any force in the temptation to worship Satan for the sake
   of the glory of this world, how much more reason is there for urging
   you to worship the Son of God that you may obtain His salvation with
   eternal glory! I pray the Holy Spirit to drop a hot desire into many a
   poor sinner's breast, this morning, that he may cry, "If this glory is
   to be had, I will have it, and I will have it in God's way, for I will
   believe in Jesus! I will repent, I will come to God and so obtain His
   promise."

   Secondly, this ought to move us to the feeling of fear. If there is
   such a glory as this, let us tremble lest by any means we should come
   short of it! Oh, my dear Hearers--especially you that are my fellow
   members, brother Church officers and workers associated with me--what a
   dreadful thing it will be if any one of us should come short of this
   glory! Oh, if there were no Hell, it would be Hell enough to miss
   Heaven! What if there were no Pit that is bottomless, nor undying worm,
   nor unquenchable fire? It would be boundless misery to have a shadow of
   a fear of not reaching to God's eternal glory! Let us, therefore, pass
   the time of our sojourning here in fear, and let us watch unto prayer
   and strive to enter in at the strait gate. God grant we may be found of
   Him, at last, to praise and honor!

   If we are right, how this ought to move us to gratitude! Think of
   this--we are to enjoy "His eternal glory!" What a contrast to our
   deserts! Shame and everlasting contempt are our righteous due apart
   from Christ. If we were to receive according to our merits, we should
   be driven from His Presence and from the glory of His power. Verily, He
   has not

   dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our
   iniquities, for, after all our transgressions, He has still reserved us
   for glory, and reserved Glory for us! What love and zeal should burn in
   our bosoms because of this!

   Last of all, it should move us to a dauntless courage. If this glory is
   to be had, do we not feel like the heroes in Bun-yan's picture? Before
   the dreamer there stood a fair palace and he saw persons walking upon
   the top of it, clad in light, and singing. Around the door stood armed
   men to keep back those who would enter. Then a brave man came up to one
   who had a writer's inkhorn by his side and said, "Set down my name."
   And straightway the warrior drew his sword and fought with all his
   might until he had cut his way to the door. And then he entered and
   they within were heard to sing--

   "Come in, come in, Eternal glory you shall win."

   Will you not draw your swords this morning and fight against sin till
   you have overcome it? Do you not desire to win Christ and to be found
   in Him? Oh, let us now begin to feel a passion for eternal glory and
   then, in the strength of the Spirit, and in the name of Jesus, let us
   press forward till we reach it! Even on earth we may taste enough of
   this glory to fill us with delight!

   The glory which I have described to you dawns on earth though it only
   comes to its noontide in Heaven--the glory of sanctified character, the
   glory of victory over sin, the glory of relationship to God, the glory
   of union with Christ-- these are all to be tasted in a measure here
   below. These glories send their beams down even to these valleys and
   lowlands. Oh, to enjoy them, today, and thus to have earnests and
   foretastes of Glory! If we have them, let us go singing on until we
   reach the place where God's eternal glory shall surround us. Amen.

The First Setting Up of the Bronze Serpent

   (No. 1722)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 10, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to
   compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much
   discouraged because of the way. And the people spoke against God, and
   against Moses, 'Why ha ve you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
   wilderness? For there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our
   soul loathes this light bread.' And the Lord sent fiery serpents among
   the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.
   Therefore the people came to Moses and said, 'We have sinned, for we
   have spoken against the Lord, and against you; pray unto the Lord, that
   He take away the serpents from us.' And Moses prayed for the people.
   And the Lord said unto Moses, 'Make you a fiery serpent, and set it
   upon a pole: and it shall come topass, that everyone thatis bitten,
   when he looks upon it, shall live.' And Moses made a serpent of brass,
   and putit upon a pole, and it came topass, that if a serpent had bitten
   any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived." Numbers
   21:4-9.

   I HAVE frequently expounded to you the type of the bronze serpent as
   our Lord interprets it in the third of John. I thought it meet,
   tonight, to take that type in its connection and look at the original
   circumstances which led to the setting of it up--for while the general
   doctrine of looking for salvation to Christ as the bronze serpent is
   always to be preached and is most usefully set forth in the midst of
   the unconverted--yet I take it that its original institution teaches us
   much which ought not to be overlooked. It is very clear that this type
   has its first voice to the people of God, for it was among
   Israel--among the nominal people of God--that this bronze serpent was
   first needed and first set up. And while the instruction which it gives
   is wide as the universe, for whoever looks shall live, nevertheless it
   has an inner circle to which it, first of all, addresses itself--the
   professed members of the Church of God.

   The Book of Numbers might be called, without any impropriety, "Moses'
   Pilgrim's Progress." It contains a full account of the progress of the
   pilgrims through the wilderness until they came to the promised land.
   And, like Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress," it is not only a history of
   any one person or nation, but it is the picture of the life of all
   God's people. Probably no one among us will pass through all the
   troubles of the Israelites, so as to become in one person an epitome of
   all wilderness experience, and yet even this may be, for so it was with
   David, and so it has been with others by whom the Lord would instruct
   His Church. This, however, is exceptional. But, take the whole of us
   together as the Church of God, and you will find that our lives are
   mirrored, pictured and foreseen in the travels of God's chosen people
   from the land of Egypt to Canaan.

   I am afraid that many of us can see ourselves even in the passage
   before us. Yes, not only those of us who are young and raw in spiritual
   things, but certain of us who have been, for many years, following in
   the Divine track, and are hoping, by-and-by, to enjoy our portion in
   the better country. If even Moses and Aaron erred on the road, I fear
   there are very few of us who can read the story without crying, "I
   remember my faults this day!" The passage before us occurred almost at
   the end of Israel's wanderings. They had been, now, for 40 years in the
   wilderness, and they had come within sight of the Promised Land. They
   had only to cross the mountains of Edom and to get through the passes
   of Seir, and they would have been at once in the land which flows with
   milk and honey!

   But the Edomites would not permit them the privilege of passing along
   the highway and so, as Israel must not fight his brother Esau, they
   were called upon to go around his border and to come down to an arm of
   the Red Sea by a long and weary march, when they seemed to be on the
   border of their covenanted inheritance! If this happened at the end of
   their marches, let none of us presume upon our experience and
   knowledge. May the Holy Spirit help us while we learn caution from this
   Inspired history, for these things happened to them for our
   instruction.

   I. I call your attention, first of all, to their DISCOURAGEMENT--"The
   soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way." Assuredly
   there are times when God's servants become discouraged. To their shame,
   let us say it. To our shame let us confess it. It is by faith that we
   live, but as discouragement is the opposite of faith, it does not help
   our

   life. It is generally the fruit of unbelief and so, by discouragement,
   we cease to live a healthy and vigorous life--and we begin to faint.
   Even those of God's children who have had much experience in the Divine
   way, at times, give way to discouragement.

   The reason may be found in various things. Occasionally it springs out
   of disappointment. It was a serious disappointment to the Israelites to
   see the land over there within a day's march, or less, and yet for Edom
   to say, "I will come out against you with the sword. You shall not pass
   through my border." It seemed like having the cup at the lips and being
   denied a drink! It was a grievous trial, after all those years, to have
   come so close, and then to be forced to march back to the Red Sea! How
   tantalizing to see the land, as through a wall of crystal, and yet to
   be unable to put foot upon it! It was a bitter disappointment and there
   may be like trials in store for us.

   Possibly some of my Master's servants have entertained the notion that
   they have made amazing progress in the Divine life and, just then, an
   event has occurred which showed them their weakness--and they have been
   forced to weep in secret places and upbraid themselves, saying, "After
   all this, am I no better than to be cast down about a trifle? Have I
   suffered so much, and yet is my progress so small?"--

   "I thought that in some fa vored hour,

   My Lord would answer my request,

   And, by His love's subduing power

   Would slay my sins and give me rest.

   Instead of this, He made me feel

   The hidden evils of my heart,

   And let the angry powers of Hell

   Assault my soul in every part."

   We ask to have our waters purified and lo, we are stirred till all the
   mud which was quiet in the bottom of our soul is made visible and
   pollution appears everywhere! Yet may not this be the nearest and
   surest way to purity? This making us see the secret depravity of our
   hearts?

   Yet what a disappointment! I thought I was something and now I perceive
   that I am nothing! I had half hoped that I was perfect and now I see my
   secret imperfections and lusts more clearly than ever--

   "The truth is easy to repeat;

   But when my faith is sharply tried

   I find myself a learner yet,

   Unstable, weak, and apt to slide." We thought that we were climbing
   into full assurance, and lo, we descend into the valley of humiliation!
   Yes, we did taste of the honey of bold confidence, and we said, "I know
   whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to keep that
   which I have committed to Him against that day." But now we hardly know
   whether we are the people of God at all! We have, with trembling, to
   repeat our first step and turn our eyes to the bleeding Savior, hoping,
   as poor sinners, to find salvation in Him!

   This need of progress is a dreadful thing, and yet it has happened to
   many till they have dropped all idea of boasting, and have said with
   the Apostle, "Not as though I had already attained." They have felt
   like men beginning a race, although they have been running that race
   for many a patient year! Such disappointment often costs the child of
   God much discouragement because of the way. It was not, however, merely
   disappointment--it was much more. It was the unfriendliness of those
   who ought to have been most brotherly. Surely Edom ought to have
   granted his brother, Israel, the small privilege of passing through the
   country, seeing it was the nearest way to Canaan.

   It would not have cost Esau anything. Israel promised to pay if they
   even drank of the water of his wells. But, no, they must submit to this
   unkindness. I have known people of God much discouraged by the
   unfriendliness of those whom they thought to be their Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ. They went to them for sympathy and they received
   rebuffs! They looked to them for help in the time of depression and it
   was denied them. They said, "Surely, my Brethren will comfort me," but
   they cried in the end, like Job, "Miserable comforters are you all."
   Then have they sighed, "It was not an enemy, then I could have borne
   it; but it was one who was my equal, my acquaintance. We went to the
   house of God in company."

   You know the story of David's desertion by his friends and of our
   Lord's betrayal by Judas. And you are well aware how often heartbreak
   has come to the best of men through the unfriendliness of those whom
   they looked upon as sure to render them kindness. The people were much
   discouraged because of the way, for it was blocked up by an unbrotherly
   brother. May the Lord's people learn great tenderness to one another,
   for sometimes we may say thoughtlessly that

   which will inflict a ragged wound. Let us be loving and tender as a
   nurse with a child, remembering the gentleness of the Father and the
   tenderness of Jesus, and the compassion of the Holy Spirit. Alas, that
   it should be often true that the souls of the people of God may be much
   discouraged because of the absence of Christian love! Resolve that it
   shall not be your

   fault.

   Undoubtedly, however, the soul of the people was much discouraged
   because of the length of the way. The nation had been on the march 40
   years! They had stopped for considerable periods at different
   encampments, but still, they never knew how long they would be in one
   spot. They were like swallows, always on the wing. It is true their
   life was full of mercy, but at the time mentioned in our text they were
   not in the humor to notice mercy--they were more inclined to notice
   discomfort and to complain that the way was so long that they were
   downright weary of it. They had hoped, years before, to have reached
   the goodly land, and now they must change their direction and go all
   round the Edomite country! This was tiresome and tried their patience
   till it quite failed.

   To certain of God's people, old age has brought much of heaviness by
   reason of its infirmities and afflictions. They often sigh, "Why are
   His chariots so long in coming?" They are willing, in the spirit, to
   abide the Master's will, but the flesh is weak and they wonder whether
   the Lord has quite forgotten them. Why has He not taken them Home? Why
   does He keep them lingering in this banishment, so far off from the
   dear Father's house? Do you not hear them mournfully

   sing--

   "O when shall we at once go up, Nor this side Jordan longer stop But
   the good land possess?

   When shall we end our lingering years,

   Our sorrows, sins, and doubts, and fears-- A howling wilderness"?

   Oh, my dear Brothers and Sisters, if your length of years has become a
   burden, God grant that you many not be discouraged! May you be "such an
   one as Paul the Aged," and bear up under all the growing weaknesses of
   your years, bringing forth fruit in your old age. Be not cast down, for
   the Master will come, and will not tarry. He has not forgotten His
   servants! He will give them their penny at sundown. The ripe sheaf
   shall not be left in the field too long. Your Lord will come and
   receive you unto Himself, that where He is you may also be. Quietly
   hope and patiently wait for the salvation of God. And yet, no doubt,
   the length of the way has discouraged full many a true pilgrim.

   Then, there was the fatigue of the way, for journeying through that
   wilderness was by no means an easy business, especially along the shore
   of the gulf. Very rugged to this day is the pathway there. The road is
   full of hills and valleys, and rugged ravines and sharp stones, and
   weary sands. Traveling there is as bad as traveling can be. To some of
   God's own children life is no parade upon a level lawn, but rough
   marching and deep wading. They have to take the bleak side of the hill;
   the wind blows upon them and the sleet is driven in their eyes, and
   their home is but a cold harbor to them. Even their bed seems to have a
   stone for its pillow. We know certain of God's people who, what with
   poverty and ill-health, with ungenerous relations, with persecution,
   with hard labor and with short commons, find, from day to day, that the
   pathway to Heaven lies through briars and thorns, over dark mountains
   and through black forests.

   Do you marvel that their souls are discouraged because of the way? I
   think I hear somebody saying, "Well, now, I don't like all this. I do
   not get discouraged and I do not find the road to be rough." Dear
   Brother, be thankful that you do not, but let me warn you not to judge
   others. If you are like great bullocks, full of strength, do not get to
   pushing with horn and shoulder those who happen to be the weak cattle,
   for the Lord takes note of haughty looks and proud words. When any of
   His saints grow so strong and stomach-full that they despise the tried
   ones, they are likely, themselves, to smart for it. The rule of our God
   and King is this--"He has filled the hungry with good things, but the
   rich He has sent away empty." This I know both by observation and
   experience--that there are many true pilgrims who will enter the King's
   country triumphantly at the last, who, nevertheless, are occasionally
   much discouraged because of the way.

   And yet, Brothers and Sisters, I am not going to make any excuse for
   discouragement in myself, nor would I try to make it for you. You do
   not want to have any excuse made for you, do you? After all, these
   Israelites were a highly favored people. What if they were driven to
   wind around the land of Edom? Yet the Lord went before them and is not
   that man happy who marches where Jehovah leads? Tell us that God has
   chosen the way and we do not want to know more about it. "He led them
   forth by a right way." Depend upon that! There could be no mistake
   where infinite Wisdom led the van.

   Now, Brother, you are discouraged, you say, because of the way, but
   whose way is it? Have you chosen your own way and willfully run against
   your duty and against the Providence of God? Well, then, I say nothing
   about the consequences of such conduct, for they must be terrible! But
   if you have endeavored to follow the Lord fully and if you have tried
   to keep the path of His statutes, then it must be well with you. Why
   are you discouraged? Judge not by the sight of the eyes, nor by the
   hearing of the ears--let Faith sit on the judgment seat and I am sure
   she will give forth this verdict-- "If the Lord wills it, it is well.
   If Jehovah leads the way, the road must be right."

   Besides that, not only did God lead them, but God carried them. He
   says, Himself, that He bore them on eagle's wings, for though the way
   was often rough, yet it is wonderful to remember that their feet did
   not swell, neither did their garments wax old upon them, all those 40
   years! Though it was a wilderness, yet their bread was daily given them
   and though it was a land of drought, yet the smitten Rock with its
   waters followed them, and they knew nothing of drought. How could they
   be better off than to have Heaven for their granary, the rocks for
   their wine cellars, and God, Himself, for their Provider?

   They were gentlemen commoners upon the bounty of Jehovah! They were
   honorable pensioners of the King of kings! What could they desire which
   He had not supplied? What city was lit up at night with a pillar of
   fire, as their great canvas city was enlightened? With what other
   people did God dwell? Where else did He walk in the midst of their
   abodes and manifest Himself as He did to Israel? Instead of being
   discouraged, they had every cause to be doubly grateful and glad. Led
   of God, fed of God, taught of God, guarded of God--what better lot
   could they imagine? Besides, dear Friends, though they were so very
   long in getting to Canaan, yet they would get there if they would only
   believe their God. God would surely bring them in. To every faithful
   one He would say, "You shall stand in your lot in the end of the days."

   Though the unbelievers among them perished and their carcasses fell in
   the wilderness, yet even to such of them as repented, there was this
   sweet thought, that though nothing more than God's work might appear
   unto His servants, yet His glory would be seen by their children--and
   the next generation should surely enter into the land. Come, let us be
   of good comfort, then, for the same reasons! We, also, shall reach our
   Father's house in due time! We shall get home and our homecoming shall
   not be too late for the marriage supper of the Lamb! The Lord knows the
   way of the righteous. He is steering us from day to day by Infallible
   Wisdom and, despite these stormy seas, we shall yet cast anchor in the
   fair havens where our Lord has gone.

   "So shall we be forever with the Lord! Comfort one another with these
   words." The Lord is doing us no hurt. The Lord is denying us no good.
   He is making even evil things to work together for good--for our
   good--and we have no proper ground for discouragement. Apparent ground
   for fear there is in plenty, but real ground there is none--

   "Your harps, you trembling saints, Down from the willows take! Loud to
   the praise of Love Divine-- Bid every string awake."

   II. In the case of the Israelites this discouragement came to a great
   head, for it led to COMPLAINT--and that is our second point. "And the
   people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you brought us up
   out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, neither
   any water; and our soul loathes this light bread." This was a bitter
   and wicked complaint! We are in a sad case, dear Brothers and Sisters,
   when our discouragements reach such a point that we begin to complain
   against God, for the complaints that come at these times are such as
   God is not likely to bear with! When God's people are in real trouble,
   He is long-suffering and tender towards His afflicted--but with the
   obstinate He shows Himself obstinate.

   When the people complained of thirst, the Lord sweetened the waters of
   Marah for them. When they were hungry, He gave them bread from Heaven.
   But when, having nothing justly to complain of, they merely grumbled
   because they were discouraged, He dealt with them severely and sent the
   fiery serpents among them which bit many of them, so that much people
   of Israel died. Beware of a murmuring spirit! God will pity our needs,
   but He will punish our whims. Some of us have need to be cautioned
   against letting the spirit of discouragement hurry us on to quarrelling
   with God and questioning His love. It is evil for a saint to strive
   with His Savior!

   When these people made their first complaint, it was an amazing one! It
   was a complaint about having been brought out of Egypt. "Why have you
   brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?" Well, but first
   of all, they ought not to complain of being brought up out of Egypt,
   for that was a land of bondage where their male children had to perish
   in the river and where they, themselves, longed to die, for life had
   become intolerable! And yet, you see, they are complaining that they
   were brought up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness, as they said. Is
   it not possible that our rebellious

   hearts may even complain of God's mercy? For lack of something to
   murmur about, discouraged ones will pick holes in the goodness of God!
   What a pity that it should be so!

   Brothers and Sisters, if we are Believers in Christ, we have been
   redeemed from bondage! We have been brought into a separated condition
   and made to be the people of God! Shall we ever complain of that?
   Suppose it brings upon us derision, loneliness, unkindness? Suppose it
   entails upon us loss and self-denial? Suppose it involves us in many
   difficulties-- are we going to flinch because of these? God forbid! Did
   we not count the cost when first we started out from Egypt? And having
   counted the cost, will we now draw back from the fight? No, but in the
   name of God we will struggle until we have won the victory! And it
   shall never be a complaint against God that He brought us up out of
   Egypt. He will not let us die in the wilderness. We cannot believe it,
   and we will not let our soul say so!--

   "Determined to save, He watched over my path

   When, Satan's blind slave, I sported with death!

   And can He have taught me to trust in His name, And thus far have
   brought me to put me to shame?" I cannot believe it. Lie down, O dog of
   doubt! Lie down, O cur of unbelief! If you have no better bark than
   this, be quiet! Oh, for God's Grace to stop complaining at once! Our
   God never forgave a soul to let that soul fall from Grace. Christ never
   bought a soul with His blood to make it one of His and then to let it
   slip through His fingers into Hell! The Lord has never led us through
   so many trials and temptations to suffer us, after all, to be
   shipwrecked and cast away! If He had meant to destroy us, He would not
   have showed us such things as these. Let us not become so peevish as to
   talk about dying in the wilderness when, in fact, the Lord is making
   signs and wonders of us by causing us to live in the wilderness!

   Next, look at their complaint of having no food--"There is no bread,
   neither is there any water." It was a great lie! There was bread--they
   had to admit that fact in the next breath--but then they did not call
   the manna, "bread." They called it by an ugly name in the Hebrew. The
   water, too, was not muddy and thick like the water of the Nile--it was
   bright, clear, pure water from the Rock and, therefore, they would not
   call it water. They wanted water with substance in it which would leave
   grit between their teeth--and as the stream which leaped from the
   flinty Rock was pure crystal they would not call it water. Have you not
   known people to whom God has given great mercy, and yet they have
   talked as if they were quite deserted?

   Unbelief is blind just as surely as faith is far seeing. Unbelief
   enjoys nothing, just as faith rejoices in everything. He that believes,
   finds sweetness in the manna--"the taste thereof was as wafers made
   with honey." But he that has no faith finds nothing pleasant even in
   "the corn of Heaven," but says, "there is no bread." Only think of
   anybody saying, "Our soul loathes this light bread"! It was a diet that
   was very easy to digest and kept them in good health--and yet they
   pined for heavy, lumpy food! They began to wish for leeks, garlic and
   onions--something rank and strong--and less refined than "angels'
   food." They sighed for the meat that they ate in Egypt! They hankered
   after a coarse and dangerous diet!

   God knew that it was not proper food for them in the blazing desert and
   He gave them, instead, the best possible nourishment! And now they cry,
   "Oh, there is nothing substantial in it. It does not make you feel as
   if you were full." They found fault with that which they ought to have
   commended. Men really need that which is sufficient, that which will
   sustain the frame, that which will enable them to continue in health
   and strength--but these grumblers remembered the rough stuff they used
   to eat among the brick kilns and they wished to feel full and overblown
   as they had now and then felt in Egypt. Thus they fell to complaining
   against God without excuse! Are there any here in that state? Are you
   so discouraged that you do not want to live by faith any longer--it
   seems too unsubstantial? Are you tired of praying, "Give us day by day
   our daily bread"?

   You would like a nice lump sum in the bank, instead, and plenty of the
   cares and snares of wealth! And is it so that you are no longer content
   with the old Gospel? It is so easy of digestion that you pine for a
   hard morsel--a piece of cast-iron philosophy to lie on your mind for
   years to come. You want a bit of indigestible modern thought that will
   remain within you like the cucumbers of Egypt which were not so soon
   gone as the manna of Heaven! You crave for leeks, garlic and
   onions--something sensational, remarkable, though by no means
   comfortable to the pure taste of those who are born of the Spirit of
   God!

   Is it not strange how men who call themselves Christians run after that
   kind of meat? And of the real good Gospel, which is able to save the
   soul, and to build it up, they begin to say, "It is worn out! We have
   heard this one thing so often. You see it is just the same
   old-fashioned manna! We need more variety. We demand that which is
   novel, which will commend itself to our advanced intellectual condition
   by its metaphysical subtlety." That is the style! I see the spirit
   everywhere, and it comes across us all in some form or
   other--complaining of what God provides in Providence, complaining of
   what God provides in the Bible, complaining of what the Holy Spirit
   provides in His Divine operations! We look out, like the Athenians, for
   some new thing--we do not know what we want.

   When the grumbling humor is on us, we complain of anything and
   everything, as did these Israelites! They complained of God; they
   complained of Moses; they complained of the manna. They would have been
   ready to complain of Aaron, but, fortunately for him, he had been dead
   a month or so, and so they poured the more gall upon Moses! To men in
   this state, nothing is right--nothing can be right, The whole world is
   turned upside down and if it were again turned the other way it would
   be just as wrong--perhaps more wrong than ever! You smile, I see, at
   this. Well, you may smile if you like, Brothers and Sisters, but it is
   a thing to weep over, for I remember a text that says, "The Lord heard
   their murmuring."

   That is the solemn point in the matter. We are pleased that God should
   hear our prayers. It is that which we long for--but is it not terrible
   that God should hear our murmuring? There are two things that God
   always hears. Mark this! The first is the voice of faith and the second
   is the voice of unbelief! For, as much as God loves faith, so as much
   does He loathe unbelief! When we are strong in faith, the Lord can do
   anything with us and for us, and He can make us equal to all
   difficulties, so that we can say with the Apostle, "I can do all things
   through Christ which strengthens me." But when we give way to unbelief,
   Christ Himself can do nothing with us, as it is written--"He could not
   do many mighty works there because of their unbelief."

   Do you not feel sorry, then, that you ever murmured and complained,
   since your God heard it all? What is more, as the Lord usually answers
   the prayers of faith, so He often answers the prayers of incredulity. I
   have heard a Brother cry out because of his small and bearable trouble.
   And I have known the Lord answer his impatience with great trials. If
   children cry for nothing, they ought to have something to cry for! And,
   if we get discouraged when there really is no reason for it, we shall
   probably be answered with astonishing tribulations! If we begin
   complaining when we ought to be singing, it is likely enough that we
   shall have grave cause for crying out, for is it not written concerning
   the Lord, "With the froward You will show Yourself froward"?

   When we walk tenderly, submissively and quietly--and when we say with
   David, "My soul is even as a weaned child," then the Lord walks very
   gently and comfortably toward us and our path is smoothed by His love.
   But the Lord has said, "If you walk contrary to Me, I will walk
   contrary to you." Why, Brothers and Sisters, if we are discouraged in
   any way, let us pray that we may not venture further in that evil way,
   nor begin to rail against the Lord and His Providence! May we go back
   to confidence and joy and faith--and not go on till we fall into the
   ditch of murmuring--and be waiting there for yet worse things.

   III. The Lord, before long, sends upon murmurers, PUNISHMENT. This is
   our third head. We read that as soon as the people found fault with
   Moses, and with God, and with the manna, "the Lord sent fiery serpents
   among the people, and they bit the people, and much people of Israel
   died." Fiery serpents were ready at the Divine call--the Lord never
   lacks means of chastisement. There was no interval between the sin and
   the suffering, for the fault was wanton and inexcusable. Will God send
   fiery serpents among His own people? These were the tribes that ate of
   the manna, and the people that "drank of the Rock that followed them,
   which Rock was Christ." These were the Lord's visible Church in the
   wilderness, and though not all spiritually His children, yet they were
   types of His chosen, representatives of the whole believing family.

   Well, Brothers and Sisters, the Lord, in fatherly anger, may send fiery
   serpents among a doubting and quarrelsome people, and so those who bite
   with fault-finding may find themselves bitten! These fiery serpents
   come in different forms. Sometimes they may be new trials. The
   Israelites, as far as I know, had never seen these seraphs, or burning
   ones, before. They seemed to fly up out of the sand and bite them
   before they were aware of it! And then the venom entered into their
   blood and made it scald them till they seemed to be a mass of fire from
   head to foot, burning with fierce pain and ready to die. It was
   dreadful to be marching through the midst of fiery flying serpents! The
   Lord deliver us from that.

   But He may send to us, if we grow peevish, a fresh and novel
   affliction, a crooked trial which will twist and wriggle about us--a
   sudden grief which will poison the fountain of our life--and this may
   hastily fly at us, as a chastisement for not having believed in God
   under much happier circumstances. In some Christians these fiery
   serpents may be the upris-

   ings of their own corruptions. I have known the corruptions of a child
   of God to be quiet and still for a long period. They have been there,
   but they have been forced to hide away like thieves that dare not come
   out in daylight and, the child of God has, therefore, enjoyed rest.

   But the good man has been discouraged and has fallen to
   complaining--and then these inward corruptions have broken forth upon
   him and compassed him about like bees--innumerable and quick to sting!
   Some of us know what this means. We have been put to a dead stand with
   our lively inbred sins which we thought were dead--suddenly they have
   revived within us and we had to fight against them for dear life! Or,
   it may be that God will let Satan loose upon us if we disbelieve. Truly
   we cannot want any worse fiery serpents than the suggestions and
   insinuations of the devil! Oh, Brothers and Sisters, if you have ever
   met Satan and fought him foot to foot, you know by your scars what a
   terrible adversary he is!

   Why, he will insinuate thoughts into our breasts which never came from
   our own minds and never would have come--blasphemous thoughts of an
   infernal kind--and these he would have us accept as ours! He will throw
   his bombs into our souls and then tell us that these are of our own
   making! He will make us doubt the existence of God, the Inspiration of
   Scripture, the Deity of Christ, the Truth of the Gospel, the fact of
   the Resurrection--in fact, he will make us doubt doctrines for which we
   would lay down our lives! These are his impieties and not our own
   thoughts at all--but, like serpents of fire, their sting is terrible!
   All the while our enemy will beat the great Hell drum concerning our
   past sins and try, if he can, to drown the voice of mercy and of that
   precious blood which "speaks better things than that of Abel." Thus he
   would drive us to despair.

   Ah, these fiery serpents! Brothers and Sisters, it is much better to be
   tried with poverty and pain than to be molested by the infernal
   thoughts that come from Satan! It were better for us to lie down
   crushed like the very dust beneath our feet and every particle a pain,
   than to be filled with the desperate thoughts that Satan is able to
   inject into the mind! Beware, I pray you, of complaining, you that are
   getting to be at all discouraged! Return to your child-like faith.
   "Cast not away your confidence which has great recompense of reward,"
   lest you slide, by your unbelief, down into complaining and then by
   your complaining hatch fiery serpents out of the ground on which you
   tread!

   IV. But now, fourthly, here comes the REMEDY. What is to be done when
   Israel is bitten with fiery serpents? Well, the first thing is
   confession. They went to Moses and cried, "We have sinned." Oh, that is
   a sweet art--that are of confession--it empties the bosom of most
   perilous stuff! Nothing seems to me to be more hideous than to confess
   your sins to a man like yourselves. I should think that to sit down at
   a priest's ear and to pour into it all the filth of your soul, and
   answer every question that he may care to propound to you must be one
   of the most fearful ordeals through which a human mind can pass!

   I know that Satan is very ingenious as to the means by which to deprave
   men and rob them of the last particle of modesty, so as to make them
   capable of every crime! But I should think that the papist "confession"
   is his last and darkest invention for depraving the soul beyond all
   common defilement! It must be the most fearful process of saturating
   with evil through which the mind can pass! But to confess sin into the
   ear of Christ is quite another thing! To get alone with Him and to tell
   Him all our transgressions and temptations--this is as great a blessing
   as the other is a curse. There is no fear that we can pollute Him--and
   every blessing comes of emptying out ourselves before Him who is able
   to take away all sin by reason of His precious blood! Our first
   business is to hasten away to our great High Priest and tell Him that
   we have sinned.

   The second help was that Moses prayed for the people. So our great cure
   against fiery serpents--horrible thoughts and temptations--is
   intercession! "If any man sins, we have an advocate with the Father,
   Jesus Christ the Righteous." If we have grown discouraged, and have
   sinned by unbelieving utterances, let us go with our poor, little,
   trembling faith and ask the blessed go-between, the Divine Interposer,
   to stand before God on our behalf and pray for us that our
   transgressions may be blotted out! Oh, what a sweet thing it is to have
   this Advocate! Come, you that are the Lord's people and yet are
   transgressors, come and rejoice in this--that He makes intercession for
   transgressors and that He is, therefore, able to save unto the
   uttermost!

   But now comes the great remedy. After their confession and the prayer
   of their mediator, the Lord bade Moses make a bronze serpent and lift
   it up, that they might look upon it and live. Beloved, when I first
   came to Christ as a poor sinner and looked to Him, I thought Him the
   most precious object my eyes had ever lit upon! But this night I have
   been looking to Him while I have been preaching to you, in remembrance
   of my own discouragements, my own complaining--and I find my Lord Jesus
   dearer than ever! I have been seriously ill and sadly depressed--I fear
   I have rebelled--and, therefore, I look anew to Him and I tell you that
   He is fairer in my eyes, tonight, than He was at first!

   It is a delightful thing that there should be a Fountain open for
   sinners to wash in, but I will tell you something that is more
   charming, still--there is a Fountain for the house of David and for the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and un-cleanness. That Fountain is not
   for outcasts, only, but for the saints, for the citizens of Jerusalem,
   for the house of David! "If we walk in the light as God is in the
   light, and have fellowship one with another"--do we still sin? Yes,
   that we do, even then, but--"the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,
   cleanses us from all sin." In our lowest condition this is our
   cleansing! In our highest condition this is still our cleansing!

   The first time a poor sinner comes up out of the ditch, with his own
   clothes abhorring him, he is made white through Christ's blood the
   moment he believes in Jesus! And mark this, when he enters Heaven and
   stands before the blaze of the supernal glory, it shall still be said
   of him and of his fellows, "They have washed their robes and made them
   white in the blood of the Lamb." The bronze Serpent healed me when I
   first saw the Lord--and the bronze serpent heals me to-night--and shall
   do so till I die! "Look and live" is for saints as well as for sinners.
   For you, you ungodly ones--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One."

   But equally true is this for you who belong to Jesus but have grieved
   His Holy Spirit. You that have gone aside from your faith and have
   begun disputing with your God and complaining of Providence--there is
   life for you, too, in the Savior lifted up! There are not two ways of
   salvation--one for sinners and another for saints. There are not two
   grounds on which we stand--the ground of the sinner saved and the
   ground of the saint saved. No, the same basis is under each foot--we
   each sing--

   "Rock of ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee!"

   This is the language of the man who has served his God for half a
   century and preached the Gospel like a Luther or a Calvin, just as
   certainly as it must be the language of the trembling sinner, guilty
   and condemned before the living God!

   Do you not see where the bronze serpent fitly comes in according to
   Scripture? At the end of the pilgrimage, just before they are going to
   cross the Jordan, then Israel sees the serpent of brass! Then the
   people sin and then is there revealed to them in all its splendor that
   blessed type of Chris--"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
   wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up: that whoever
   believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life." "Should not
   perish!" As if even a Believer had about him that which would make him
   perish if he did not, still, look to the appointed cure! Jesus is
   lifted up that saints might not perish, but might persevere in Grace
   unto everlasting life!

   How is our spiritual life rendered everlasting but by the continuance
   of that look? We are to still be looking to Jesus as long as we live!
   "Looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith." Always
   looking! Always looking! God keep us looking if we have looked, and
   bring us to look to Jesus if we have never looked--and to His name be
   praise forever and ever, Amen!

"Knock!"

   (No. 1723)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 27, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Knock, and it shall be opened unto you." Matthew 7:12.

   I believe, no doubt, that, taken very strictly, the three exhortations
   of this verse--which, indeed, are but one-- were, first of all,
   intended for God's believing people. It was to His disciples that the
   Lord said, "Cast not your pearls before swine" and, perhaps, certain of
   them who were poor in spirit might turn around and say, "Lord, we have
   few pearls; we are too poor to have the treasures of Your Grace so
   plentifully. You have bidden us not to give that which is holy unto
   dogs; but holiness is rather a thing we seek after than possess."
   "Well," says the Lord, "you have only to ask and have; you have not
   because you ask not; you have only to seek and you will be sure to
   find--for holy things, like rare pearls, are to be discovered if you
   look for them. You have only to knock and spiritual secrets shall open
   to you, even the innermost Truths of God."

   In each exhortation our Lord bids us pray. Beloved, let us abound in
   supplication! Depend upon it, failure in prayer will undermine the
   foundation of our peace and sap the strength of our confidence. But if
   we abound in pleading with God, we shall grow strong in the Lord and we
   shall be happy in His love and we shall become a blessing to those
   around us! Need I commend the Mercy Seat to you who wait before it?
   Surely prayer must have become such a joy to you, such a necessity of
   your being, such an element of your life, that I hardly need press it
   upon you as a duty, or invite you to it as a privilege. Yet I continue
   to do so because the Master does it by a triple exhortation. A
   threefold cord is not easily broken--let not my text be neglected by
   you. Let me urge you to repeated, varied, ever intensifying
   prayer--ask! Seek! Knock!

   Cease not to ask till you receive; cease nor to seek till you find;
   cease not to knock till the door is opened unto you! In these three
   exhortations there would appear to be a gradation--it is the same
   thought put into another shape and made more forcible. Ask--that is, in
   the quiet of your spirit, speak with God concerning your needs and
   humbly beg Him to grant your desires--this is a good and acceptable
   form of prayer. If, however, asking should not appear to succeed, the
   Lord would awaken you to a more concentrated and active longing.
   Therefore let your desires call in the aid of knowledge, thought,
   consideration, meditation, practical action and learn to seek for the
   blessings you desire as men seek for hidden treasures. These good
   things are laid up in store and they are accessible to fervent minds.
   See how you can reach them. Add to asking the study of the promises of
   God, a diligent hearing of His Word, a devout meditation upon the way
   of salvation and all such means of Grace as may bring you the blessing.
   Advance from asking to seeking.

   And if, after all, it should still seem that you have not obtained your
   desire, then knock and so come to closer and more agonizing work--use
   not only your voice, but your whole soul--exercise yourself unto
   godliness to obtain the gift! Use every effort to win that which you
   seek after, for remember that doing is praying; living to God is a high
   form of seeking and the bent of the entire mind is knocking. God often
   gives to His people, when they keep His Commandments, that which He
   denies to them if they walk carelessly. Remember the words of the Lord
   Jesus, how He said, "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you
   shall ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you." Holiness is
   essential to power in prayer--the life must knock while the lips ask
   and the heart seeks.

   I will change my line of exposition and say--ask as a beggar petitions
   for alms. They say that begging is a poor trade, but when you ply it
   well with God, no other trade is so profitable! Men get more by asking
   than by working without prayer. Though I do not recommend not working,
   yet I most highly commend praying! Nothing under Heaven pays like
   prevailing prayer! He that has power in prayer has all things at his
   call. Ask as a poor mendicant who is hungry and pleads for bread. Then
   seek as a merchant who hunts for goodly pearls, looking up and down,
   anxious to give all that he has that he may win a matchless treasure.
   Seek as a servant carefully looking after his master's interests and
   laboring to

   promote them. Seek with all diligence, adding to the earnestness of the
   beggar, the careful watchfulness of the jeweler who is seeking for a
   gem.

   Conclude all by knocking at Mercy's door as a lost traveler, caught out
   on a cold night in a blinding sleet, knocks for shelter that he may not
   perish in the storm. When you have reached the gate of salvation, ask
   to be admitted by the great love of God. Then look well to see the way
   of entering, seeking to enter in--and if the door still seems shut
   against you--knock right heavily and continue knocking till you are
   safely lodged within the home of love! Once again, ask for what you
   need, seek for what you have lost, knock for that from which you are
   excluded. Perhaps this last arrangement best indicates the shades of
   meaning and brings out the distinctions. Ask for everything you need,
   whatever it may be--if it is a right and good thing, it is promised to
   the sincere asker!

   Seek for what you have lost, for what Adam lost you by the Fall; for
   what you have lost, yourself, by your neglect, by your backsliding, by
   your lack of prayer--seek till you find the Grace you need. Then knock.
   If you seem shut out from comfort, from knowledge, from hope, from God,
   from Heaven--then knock, for the Lord will open unto you! Here you need
   the Lord's own interference--you can ask and receive, you can seek and
   find--but you cannot knock and open! The Lord must open the door,
   Himself, or you are shut out forever. God is ready to open the door.
   Remember, there is no cherub with fiery sword to guard this gate, but,
   on the other hand, the Lord Jesus, Himself, opens, and no man shuts.

   But now I must drop this line of things, for my desire is to use the
   text in reference to those who are not yet saved. Last Lord's-Day, when
   we preached upon glory, [Glory! #1721] we had before us the end of the
   pilgrim way. It was a very, very happy time, for in meditation we
   reached the suburbs of the Celestial City and we tasted of eternal
   Glory. This morning I thought we would begin at the beginning and enter
   in at the wicket gate, which stands at the head of the way to Heaven.
   Mr. Bunyan, in his, "Pilgrim's Progress," says, "Now over the gate
   there was written, 'Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.'" His
   ingenious allegory is always as truthfully instructive as it is
   delightfully attractive. I concluded that this should be my text.

   If it is thought worthy to be written over the gate at the entering in
   of the way of life, it must have a great claim upon the attention of
   those who have not yet started for Glory, but are anxious to do so. May
   God the Holy Spirit instruct and quicken them while we hear the Lord
   from within His palace saying, "Knock, and it shall be opened unto
   you."

   I. First, then, dear Friend, whoever you are, if you are desirous of
   entering into eternal life, I would expound to you the inscription over
   the gate, by saying, first, THE DOOR OF MERCY MAY APPEAR TO YOU TO BE
   CLOSED AGAINST YOU. That is implied in the text--"Knock, and it shall
   be opened unto you." If to your consciousness the door stood wide open,
   there would be no need of knocking. But since in your apprehension it
   is closed against you, it is for you to seek admission in the proper
   way by knocking. To a large extent, this apprehension is the result of
   your own fears. You think the gate is closed because you feel it ought
   to be so--you feel that if God dealt with you as you would deal with
   your fellow men--He would be so offended with you as to shut the door
   of His favor once and for all.

   You remember how guilty you have been, how often you have refused the
   Divine call and how you have gone on from evil to evil and, therefore,
   you fear that the Master of the house has already risen up and shut the
   door. You fear lest, like the obstinate ones in Noah's day, you will
   find the door of the ark closed and yourself shut out to perish in the
   general destruction. Sin lies at the door and blocks it. In your
   judgment, your desponding feelings fasten up the gate of Grace. But it
   is not so! The gate is not barred and bolted as you think it to
   be--though it may be spoken of as closed in a certain sense, yet in
   another sense it is never shut! In any case, it opens very freely. Its
   hinges are not rusted, no bolts secure it. The Lord is glad to open the
   gate to every knocking soul!

   It is closed far more in your apprehension than as a matter of fact,
   for the sin which shuts it is removed so far as the believing sinner is
   concerned. Had you but faith enough, you would enter in at this present
   moment, and if you did once enter in, you would never be put out again,
   for it is written, "Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out."
   If you could, with holy courage, take leave and license to come in, you
   would never be blamed for it. Fear and shame stand in the sinners road
   and push him back and, blessed is he whose desperate mind forces him to
   be bold! One thing we should remember when we fear that the door is
   closed against us, namely, that it is not so fast closed as the door of
   our hearts has been.

   You know the famous picture of, "The Light of the World"? It seems to
   me to be one of the finest sermons the eyes have ever looked upon.
   There stands the Ever-Blessed, knocking at the door of the soul, but
   the hinges are rusted, the door, itself, is fast bolted and wild briars
   and all kinds of creeping plants running up the door prove that it has
   been a long time since it was moved. You know what it all means--how
   continuance in sin makes it harder to yield to the knock of Christ and
   how evil habits creeping up, one after another, hold the soul so fast
   that it cannot open to the sacred knocking. Jesus has been knocking at
   some of your hearts ever since you were children--and still He knocks.
   I hear His blessed hand upon the door at this moment! Do you not hear
   it? Will you not open?

   He has knocked a long time and yet He knocks again. I am sure that you
   have not knocked at Mercy's door so long as Incarnate Mercy has waited
   at your door! You know you have not. How, therefore, can you complain
   if there should be an apparent delay in answering your prayers? It is
   but to make you feel a holy shame for having treated your Lord so ill!
   Now you begin to know what it is to be kept waiting--what it is to be a
   weary knocker, what it is to cry, "my head is wet with dew and my locks
   with the drops of the night." This will excite you to repentance for
   your unkind behavior and also move you to love more intensely that
   gentle Lover of your soul who has shown such patience towards you. It
   will be no loss to you that the door was shut for a while, if you do
   but gain a penitent heart and a tender spirit!

   Let me, however, warn you that the door can be closed and kept shut by
   unbelief. He that believes enters into Christ when he believes. He that
   comes in by the door shall be saved and shall go in and out and find
   pasture--so our Lord says in the 10th chapter of John. "He that
   believes in Him has everlasting life," there is no question about that!
   But we read, on the other hand, "So, then, they could not enter in
   because of unbelief." Forty years the tribes were in the wilderness,
   going towards Canaan, yet they never reached the promised land because
   of unbelief! And what if some of you should be 40 years attending this
   means of Grace? Coming and going, coming and going, hearing sermons,
   witnessing ordinances, and joining with God's people in worship--what
   if, after all the 40 years, you should never enter in because of
   unbelief?

   Souls, I tell you, if you lived, each one of you as long as Methuselah,
   you could not enter in unless you believed in Jesus Christ! The moment
   you have trusted Him with your whole heart and soul, you are within the
   blessed portals of the Father's house! But however many years you may
   be asking, seeking and knocking, you will never enter in till faith
   comes, for unbelief keeps the chain on the door and there is no
   entering in while it rules your spirit. Do you, however, complain that
   you should have to knock? It is the rule of the Most High!

   Am I addressing any who have been earnestly praying for several months?
   I can sympathize with you, for that was my case, not only for months,
   but even for years! Through the darkness of my mind and my cruel
   misapprehensions of the Lord, I did not find peace when I first began
   to ask for it, although I also sought with much earnestness, going to
   the House of God every time I could, and reading the Bible, daily, with
   a burning desire to know the right way. I did not enter into peace till
   I had knocked long and heavily. Listen, therefore, to one who knows
   your troubles and hear from me the voice of reason! Ought we to expect
   to enter into the glorious house of mercy without knocking at its door?
   Is it so with our own houses?

   Can every straggler carelessly saunter in? Is it not God's way in the
   world to give great blessings, but always to make men knock for them?
   We need bread out of the earth but the farmer must knock at the door of
   the earth with his plow and with all his instruments of agriculture
   before his God will hand him out a harvest! Is anything gained in this
   world without labor? Is it not an old proverb, "No sweat, no sweet: no
   pains, no gains: no mill, no meal"? And may we not expect, in heavenly
   things, that at least these great mercies should be prayed for with
   fervency before they can be bestowed? It is the usual rule with God to
   make us pray before He gives the blessing. And how could it be
   otherwise? How could a sinner be saved without prayer?

   A prayerless soul must be a Christless soul! The feeling of prayer, the
   habit of prayer, the spirit of prayer, are parts of salvation. Unless
   it can be said of a man, "Behold, he prays," how can there be any sort
   of hope that he knows his God and has found reconciliation? The
   prodigal did not come home dumb, neither did he enter his father's
   house in sullen silence. No, but as soon as he saw his father, he
   cried, "Father, I have sinned against Heaven." There must be speech
   within God, for God gives not a silent salvation! Besides, to make us
   knock at Mercy's gate is a great blessing to ourselves upon the spot.
   It is a going to school for us when we are set to plead with God for a
   while without realized success. It makes a man grow more earnest, for
   his hunger increases while he tarries.

   If he obtained the blessing when first he asked for it, it might seem
   dog cheap. But when he has to plead long, he arrives at a better sense
   of the value of the mercy sought. He also sees more of his own
   unworthiness as he stands outside Mercy's gate, ready to swoon with
   fear--and so he grows more passionately earnest in pleading and,
   whereas he did but ask at first, he now begins to seek, and he adds
   cries and tears and a broken heart to all the other ways of his
   pleading. Thus the man, by being humbled and awakened, is getting good
   by means of his sorrow while he is kept, for a while, outside the gate!

   Beside that, he is increasing his capacity for the future. I believe I
   never could have been able to comfort seekers in their anguish if I had
   not been kept waiting in the cold, myself. I have always felt grateful
   for my early distress because of its later results. Many men, whose
   experiences are recorded in books which are invaluable in the Christian
   library, never could have written those books if they had not,
   themselves, been kept waiting--hungry and thirsty and full of soul
   travail--before the Lord appeared to them. That blessed man, David, who
   always seems to be--

   "Not one, but all mankind's epitome" the history of all men wrapped up
   in one--how he pictures himself as sinking in the miry clay! Lower and
   lower did he go, till he cried out of the depths and then, at last, he
   was taken up out of the horrible pit and his feet were set on a rock
   that he could tell others what the Lord had done for him!

   Your heart needs enlarging, dear Sir. The Lord means to prepare you to
   become a more eminent Christian by expanding your mind. The spade of
   agony is digging trenches to hold the Water of Life. Depend upon it, if
   the ships of prayer do not come home speedily, it is because they are
   more heavily freighted with blessing! When prayer is long in the
   answering, it will be all the sweeter in the receiving, like fruit
   which is well ripened by hanging longer on the tree! If you knock with
   a heavy heart, you shall yet sing with joy of spirit! Therefore, be not
   discouraged because, for a while, you stand before a closed door.

   II. Secondly, A DOOR IMPLIES AN OPENING. What is a door meant for if it
   is always to be kept shut? The wall might as well have remained without
   a break! I have seen certain houses and public buildings with the form
   and appearance of doors where there were none--the sham doorway being
   made for architectural purposes--but nothing is a sham in the House of
   the Lord. His doors are meant to open! They were made on purpose for
   entrance and so the blessed Gospel of God is made on purpose for you to
   enter into life and peace. It would be of no use to knock at a wall,
   but you may wisely knock at a door, for it is arranged for opening.

   You will eventually enter in if you knock on, for the Gospel is good
   news for men--and how could it be good news if it should so happen that
   they might sincerely come to Christ and ask mercy--and be denied it? I
   fear that the Gospel preached by certain divines sounds rather like bad
   news than good news to awakened souls, for it requires so much feeling
   and preparation on the sinner's part that they are not cheered nor led
   to hope! But you can be sure that the Lord is willing to save all those
   who are willing to be saved in His own appointed way. A dear Brother
   beautifully said in prayer on Monday night--"You, O Lord, are perfectly
   satisfied with the Lord Jesus, and if we are satisfied with Him, You
   are satisfied with us."

   That is the Gospel put into a few words! God is satisfied with Christ
   and if you are satisfied with Christ, God is satisfied with you! This
   is a glad tiding to every soul that is willing to accept the Atonement
   made and the righteousness prepared by the Lord Jesus. Dear Friend,
   this Gospel must be meant to be received by sinners, or else it would
   not have been sent. But one says, "I am such a sinner." Just so. You
   are the sort of person for whom the news of mercy is intended! A Gospel
   is not needed by perfect men--sinless men need no pardon. No sacrifice
   is needed if there is no guilt--no atonement is needed where there is
   no transgression. They that are whole need not a physician, but they
   that are sick! This door of hope which God has prepared was meant to be
   an entrance into life and it was meant to open to sinners, for if it
   does not open to sinners, it will never open at all!

   We have all sinned and so we must all be shut out unless it is of free
   Grace for those who are guilty. I am sure this door must open to those
   who have nothing to bring with them. If you have no good works, no
   merits, no good feelings, nothing to recommend you, be not discouraged,
   for it is to such that Jesus Christ is most precious and, therefore,
   most accessible, for He loves to give Himself to those who will prize
   Him most! A man will never have Christ while he has enough of his own;
   but he that is consciously naked, poor and miserable, is the man for
   Christ's money--he it is that has been redeemed by price!

   You may know the redeemed man, for he feels his bondage and
   acknowledges that he must remain therein unless the redemption of
   Christ is applied for his deliverance. Dear Friends, that door of hope
   will be opened to you though you may be ignorant, weak and quite unable
   to fulfill any high conditions! When the text says, "Knock, and it
   shall be opened unto you," it teaches us that the way of winning
   admission to the blessing is simple and suitable to common people. If I
   have to enter in by a door which is well secured, I shall need tools
   and science. I confess I do not understand the arts--you must send for
   a gentleman who understands picklocks, "jimmies," and all sorts of
   burglarious instruments!

   But if I am only told to knock, fool as I am at opening doors, I know
   how to knock! Any uneducated man can knock if that is all required of
   him. Is there a person here who cannot put words together in prayer?
   Never mind, Friend! Knocking can be done by one who is no orator.
   Perhaps another cries, "I am no scholar." Never mind, a man can knock
   though he may be no philosopher. A dumb man can knock! A blind man can
   knock! With a palsied hand, a man may knock. He who knows nothing of
   this Book can still lift a hammer and let it fall. The way to open
   Heaven's gate is wonderfully simplified to those who are lowly enough
   to follow the Holy Spirit's guidance and ask, seek and knock
   believ-ingly!

   God has not provided a salvation which can only be understood by
   learned men. He has not prepared a Gospel which requires half-a-dozen
   folio volumes to describe it. It is intended for the ignorant, the
   short-witted and the dying, as well as for others and, therefore, it
   must be as plain as knocking at a door! This is it--Believe and live!
   Seek unto God with all your heart and soul and strength, through Jesus
   Christ, and the door of His mercy will certainly open to you! The gate
   of Grace is meant to yield admission to unscientific people since it
   shall be opened to those who knock! I am sure this door will open to
   you because it has been opened to so many before you. It has been
   opened to hundreds of us now present. Could not you, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, stand up and tell how the Lord opened the gate of His
   salvation to you?

   That door has opened to many in this house during the last few weeks.
   We have seen persons coming forward to tell how the Lord has been
   pleased to give them an entrance into His mercy, though at one time
   they were afraid that the door was shut and they were ready to despair!
   Well, if the door has been so often opened for others, why should it
   not turn on its hinges for you? Only knock, with faith in God's mercy,
   and before long it shall yield to your importunity! It is for God's
   Glory to open His door of Grace and that is one reason why we are sure
   He will! We cannot expect Him to do that which would be derogatory to
   His own honor, but we do expect Him to do that which will glorify His
   sacred attributes!

   It will greatly honor the mercy, the patience, the love, the Grace, the
   goodness, the favor of God if He will open the door to such an
   undeserving one as you are, so knock! Knock, since God delights to
   give! Knock at the door which, every time it turns on its hinges,
   unveils His greatness! Knock with a holy confidence at this present
   moment for "it shall be opened unto you." It is a door which seems
   closed, but because it is a door, it must be capable of being opened!

   III. Thirdly knock, for A KNOCKER IS PROVIDED. When persons can be
   admitted by knocking, a knocker is usually placed on the door--and if
   not, we often see the words, NO ADMITTANCE. Before bells became so
   common, the habit of knocking at the door was well near universal and
   people were accustomed to like the door to resound with their blows.
   There was a nail head for the knocker to drop upon and people used to
   smite it so heavily that it became remarked that such blows on the head
   were killing and, therefore, arose the mirthful proverb, "as dead as a
   door-nail." It typifies a hearty kind of knocking which I would have
   you imitate by prayer.

   Knock at Heaven's gate as earnestly as people knocked at doors in the
   olden times! Have you not had knocks at your own doors which could be
   heard all through the house? Some of our Friends are vigorous and knock
   as if they meant to come in! It may be that gentle folks give such
   tender taps that they are not heard by the servants, and so they have
   to wait--but these I am speaking of never fall into that error, for
   they so startle everybody that they are glad to let them in, for fear
   they should thunder a second time! In this style let us pray--let us
   plead in a downright fashion and never cease till we gain admission.

   I have said that the Lord has provided a knocker. What is this knocker?
   First of all, it may be found in the promises of God. We are sure to
   speed well when we can plead a promise. It is well to say unto the
   Lord, "Do as You have said." What force abides in an appeal to the
   Word, the Oath and the Covenant of God. If a man presents to another a
   promissory note upon the day on which it is due, he expects to receive
   the amount stated therein. God's promises are bills of exchange and He
   will duly honor them. He was never known to dishonor a bill, yet, and
   He never will do so. If you can only

   quote a promise applicable to your condition--spread it before the Lord
   in faith and say--"Remember this Word unto Your servant upon which you
   have caused me to hope," you will obtain the blessing!

   Pleading the promise gives such a knock at the gate of Heaven that it
   must be opened. The great knocker, however, is the name of the Lord
   Jesus Christ. If a person were to call upon you on the behalf of some
   dearly-beloved son who is far away. If he brought you due credentials
   and a letter, saying, "Father, treat the bearer well for my sake," you
   would be sure to show him kindness! And if the aforesaid person was
   authorized to receive a promised amount in the name of your son, would
   you not hand out the money? Now, when we go to God and plead the name
   of Christ, it means that we plead the authority of Christ, that we ask
   of God as though we were in Christ's place and expect Him to give it to
   us as if He were giving it to Jesus! That is something more than
   pleading for Christ's sake.

   I suppose the Apostles, at first, did plead with God for Christ's sake,
   but Jesus says to them, "Hitherto you have asked nothing in My name."
   It is a higher grade of prayer, and when we get to pleading Christ's
   name with the Father, then do we gloriously prevail. At a Primitive
   Methodist meeting, a person was trying to pray, but did not get on at
   it and, presently a voice was heard from the corner of the room, "Plead
   the blood, Brother! Plead the blood!" I am not very fond of such
   interruptions, yet this was to be commended, for it gave the right note
   and set the pleader in his right place. Plead the precious blood of
   Jesus Christ and you have knocked so that you must be heard!

   "Alas!" says one, "I see the knocker, for I know something of the
   promises and of the Person of our Lord, but how am I to knock?" With
   the hand of faith! Believe that God will keep His promise! Ask Him to
   do so and thus knock. Believe that Jesus is worthy, whose name you are
   pleading, and so knock in confidence that God will honor the name of
   His dear Son. "Alas! My hand is so weak," you say. Then remember that
   the Holy Spirit helps our infirmities. Ask Him to put His hand upon
   your hand and, in that fashion, you will be able to knock with
   prevailing vehemence! I beseech you, knock with all the strength you
   have and knock often. If you are not in Christ, my dear Hearer, do not
   give sleep to your eyes nor slumber to your eyelids till you have found
   Him!

   If you have prayed once, go and pray again! And if you have prayed
   10,000 times, yet still continue in prayer! Knock with all your might,
   with all the vigor of your spirit! Plead as for you life--knock at the
   door as a man would knock who saw a wolf ready to spring upon him!
   Knock as one would knock who found himself ready to die of cold outside
   the door. Throw your whole soul into the work. Say unto the Lord, "I
   beseech You have mercy upon me and have mercy upon me, now. I faint, I
   die, unless You manifest Your love to me and take me into Your house
   and heart, that I may be Yours forever." "Knock, and it shall be opened
   unto you." There is the knocker.

   IV. Next, to you who are knocking at the gate, A PROMISE IS GIVEN. That
   is more than having a door before you, or a knocker to knock with. The
   promise is above the gate in plain words. Read it. You are growing
   faint and weary. Read the promise and grow strong again! "Knock, and it
   shall be opened unto you." Observe how plain and positive it is with
   its glorious, "shall," burning like a lamp in the center of it! In
   letters of love, the inscription shines out amidst all the darkness
   that surrounds you--and these are its words--"It shall be opened unto
   you." If you knock at the door of the kindest of men, you see no such
   promise set before you and yet you knock, and knock confidently! How
   much more boldly should you come to the door of Grace when it is
   expressly declared, "It shall be opened unto you!"

   Remember that this promise was freely given. You never asked the Lord
   for such a word--it was uttered by spontaneous goodness. You did not
   come and plead with Jesus for a promise that you should be heard in
   prayer. Far from it-- you did not even pray! Perhaps you have been
   living in the world 40 years and have never truly prayed at all. But
   the Lord, out of His overflowing heart of generous love has made this
   promise to you, "Knock, and it shall be opened unto you." Why do you
   doubt? Do you think He will not keep His Word? A God who cannot lie,
   who was under no necessity to promise, but freely, out of the greatness
   of His Divine Nature, which is Love, says to a poor sinner, "Knock, and
   it shall be opened unto you." Oh, be sure of this that He means it! And
   till Heaven and earth shall pass away, His Word shall stand, and
   neither you nor any other sinner that knocks at His door shall be
   refused admittance! This inscription has encouraged many to knock--when
   they have been ready to faint and give up all further seeking, they
   have read again the cheering words, "Knock, and it shall be opened unto
   you"--and they have taken heart and made the gate resound again!

   Now, do you think God will tantalize us, that He will make fools of us,
   that He will excite hopes in poor sinners for the mere sake of
   disappointing them? Will He induce you to knock, by His promise, and
   then laugh at you? Did the God

   of Mercy ever say, "I called and you came; I stretched out My hands and
   you drew near to Me, and yet I will mock at your calamity, and laugh
   when your fear comes"? Why, a bad man would scarcely speak so! Such an
   act would be more like Satan than God! Do not tolerate the thought that
   the God of all Grace could treat a seeker thus! If it ever crosses your
   mind, thrust it away and say, "He that taught me to pray has thereby
   bound Himself to answer prayer. He will not invite me to knock in vain!
   Therefore I will knock again, only this time more vigorously than ever,
   relying upon His Word and

   His Truth."

   Oh, that you may never stop your knocking till salvation's door is
   entered by you! The promise of the Lord was given freely and on the
   strength of that promise we knock and, therefore, we are sure that the
   Lord will not deny His trusting servants. The mercy is that this
   promise is meant for all knockers--"Knock, and it shall be opened unto
   you." The Lord has not denied to you, my Hearer, the privilege of
   praying, or declared that He will not answer your requests. You may
   knock and you may expect to see the door open! I know the blessed
   doctrine of Election and I rejoice in it, but that is a secret with
   God, while the rule of our preaching is--"Preach the Gospel to every
   creature." I would, therefore, say to each one here, "Knock, and it
   should be opened unto you!" The Lord knows who will knock, for, "the
   Lord knows them that are His." But knock, my Friend, knock now, and it
   will soon be seen that you are one of God's chosen ones!

   Remember the story of Malachi, the Cornishinuan? When a Methodist
   friend had some money to give him, he smilingly said, "Malachi, I do
   not think I shall give you this money because I do not know whether you
   are predestinated to have it. Will you tell me whether you are
   predestinated to have it or not?" Malachi replied, "You put the money
   in my hand and I will tell you." As soon as Malachi had the sum in
   hand, he knew that he was predestinated to have it--but he could not
   know before he had it in possession. So the secret counsel of the Lord
   is revealed to our faith when it gets Christ in possession and not
   before! Knock at once! If you are predestinated to enter, I know you
   will knock and knock till you are admitted, for so it stands, and no
   exception is made to it--"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you." It
   is a rule with the Lord that to him that knocks, it shall be opened!

   Blessed be God, this text of mine shines out as if printed in stars and
   it continues to shine from the dawn of life to the setting of the sun!
   As long as a man lives, if he knocks at God's door, it shall be opened
   unto him! You may have been long a rebel and you may have heaped up
   your sins till they seem to shut out all hope from you--but still knock
   at Christ, the Door, for an opening will come! But put not off your day
   of knocking because of God's long-suffering mercy, but rather, today,
   knock, knock now, while sitting in the pew, and if you are not answered
   immediately, as I trust you will be, yet go home and there, in secret,
   cry unto the Lord, "I will not let You go unless You bless me! I am
   lost unless You find me! I am lost unless I find my Savior and Lord! I
   am not playing at prayer, now--my very soul means it! I must have
   Christ or else I am lost! I come just as I am. I cast myself upon You
   and trust in Your atoning Sacrifice. Oh manifest Yourself to me as a
   pardoning God!"

   I will be bound for God as a hostage that He will answer you! I sought
   the Lord and He heard me--and since then I have never doubted of any
   living soul but that if he, too, will seek the Lord through Jesus
   Christ, he will certainly be saved. Oh, that you would try it! The Lord
   have you do it by His own blessed Spirit!

   V. So I close with one more point. When the door opens, IT WILL BE A
   GLORIOUS OPENING TO YOU. "Knock, and it shall be opened." What will
   come of it, then? Immediately you who have knocked will enter. If you
   have knocked in sincerity, the moment you see Christ as a Savior, you
   will accept Him as your Savior. Enter into Christ by faith. Behold, He
   sets before you an open door and no man can shut it! Do not hesitate to
   enter in. Up to now you have thought there were many difficulties and
   obstacles in your way, but, indeed, it is not so! Believe and live!

   When, in answer to your knocking, you see the door move, then arise and
   tarry not. Remember that the opening of that door will not only give
   you entrance, but it will ensure you safety. He who once enters into
   Christ is safe forever. Only pass beneath that blood-sprinkled portal;
   only rest in the house of the Well-Beloved and you shall go out no
   more, forever! The life which He bestows is eternal, therefore you
   shall not die. The destroying angel, whenever he may take his flight,
   must pass you by. Only believe and you are saved! Only trust Christ
   with your whole heart, soul and strength and salvation has come unto
   your house--and you have come unto the house of salvation!

   But then there shall come to you more blessings, for yours shall be the
   adoption! Once entered in, you shall abide in the mansion of Grace, no
   more a stranger or a guest, but as a child at home! You shall sit at
   the Father's table and eat

   and drink as a son, an heir, a joint-heir with Christ. Yours shall be
   the liberty, the plenty, the joy of the great house of love. At God's
   right hand there are pleasures forever more--and these shall all be
   your heritage! Yes, and more than that, for when you have once entered
   into the house of love, you shall have access to its inner chambers!
   Even the vestibule of God's house is a place of safety, but afterwards,
   the Master of the house shall take you into many rooms and show you His
   treasures, and open to you His storehouses, so that you shall go from
   Grace to Grace, from knowledge to knowledge, and glory to glory by
   continued progress! All this can only be understood by experience and
   that experience can only be obtained by knocking.

   I need to say this and I have done. Some people think if they have
   begun to pray and are a little in earnest that this is enough. Now,
   praying is not an end--it is only a means! Knocking is not the
   ultimatum--you must enter in. If any of you are seeking, I am glad of
   it. If you are knocking, I am glad of it. But if you say, "I am
   perfectly satisfied to stand outside the door and knock," then I am
   grieved for you. You are foolish to the last degree because you are
   resting in the means as if they were the end! You must enter by the
   Door or else knocking will be labor in vain. Would any of you be
   content to visit a friend and merely to stand for an hour or two
   outside of his door knocking? Did you ever say, "I do not need anything
   more. I shall sit down comfortably on the steps and then get up and
   have another knock or two"?

   Knocking would not give you a dinner, nor do your business for you.
   Knocking is only the way of entrance, but if you stop at knocking it is
   poor work. The most earnest praying is only a way of getting to Christ.
   The Gospel, itself, is, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
   be saved." Come, then, to Christ! If you find the door shut, knock. But
   oh, remember, the door is not really shut--it is only so in your
   apprehension! Heaven's gate stands open night and day! At once believe
   and live! Trust in the merit of Jesus Christ and you are clothed with
   it! Trust in the blood of Christ, and you are washed in it!

   Faith saves in an instant! It touches Jesus and the healing virtue
   pours forth from His garment's hem! Faith steps over the threshold and
   the soul is safe! The Lord grant that you may enter in at once--and
   then it shall be our joy, and the angels' joy, and the great Father's
   joy, forever and ever, to see you rescued from destruction! Amen.

Supposing Him to Have Been in the Company

   (No. 1724)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 3, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Supposing Him to ha ve been in the company." Luke 2:44.

   ALL who were present on the occasion are sure to remember our
   meditation upon, "Supposing Him to Be the Gardener" [Sermon #1699,
   Volume 29.] Although it was only supposition and evidently a mistake,
   yet it yielded us most profitable thought. Here is another supposition,
   again a mistake--a mistake which yielded a good deal of sorrow to those
   who made it--and yet in the hands of God's Spirit, it may bring forth
   profitable instruction to us as we think it over.

   I. We will begin our discourse by saying THAT THIS WAS A MOST NATURAL
   SUPPOSITION. That the Child, Jesus, should have been in the company
   returning to Nazareth was a most likely thing. When the Jews came up
   from their different allotments, once each year to Jerusalem, they
   formed family groups at their first starting and then, as they got a
   little on the road, these groups combined and made larger bands. And as
   the roads approached to Jerusalem, the people gathered into great
   caravans--thus they went up to the House of God in company. It must
   have been a delightful season, especially if they sang those "Psalms of
   degrees" which are supposed to have been written for such pilgrims.
   What with prayer, praise, holy conversation and with the prospect of
   meeting together in Jerusalem, they must have been happy bands of
   pilgrims!

   It was natural enough then, when all was over at Jerusalem, the Child,
   Jesus, should return home. His parents knew that when they were ready
   to return, He would be ready to go with them. But failing to meet with
   them, they figured He would join the company with which He came and so
   go back to Nazareth. His parents did not expect to find Him wandering
   alone--they looked for Him in the company. Jesus was a child who loved
   society. He was not stoical and thus selfishly self-contained--and He
   was not sullen, avoiding society. He did not affect singularity. In the
   highest sense, He was singular, for He was "holy, harmless, undefiled,
   separate from sinners," but throughout His life He never aimed at
   singularity either in dress, food, speech, or behavior.

   He grew up to be a Man among men, mixing with them, even at weddings
   and funerals--no man was more truly human than the Man, Christ Jesus.
   It is to be believed that as a Child He was like other children in all
   things but sin. Even as a Man, He was like other men in all but evil.
   Jesus was not one whose company would be shunned because of His ill
   manners--rather would it be courted because of the sweetness of His
   disposition. He would not make Himself disagreeable and then crown that
   disagreeableness by stealing away from those whom He had vexed. They
   knew the sweetness of their dear Child's Character and the sociableness
   of His disposition and, therefore, they supposed Him to have been in
   the company.

   This supposition would even more readily occur to us, knowing what we
   know about Him, which is more than His parents knew. For we know that
   of old His delights were with the sons of men. We know that He often
   came among men in angel form before His Incarnation and that when He
   came into the world He came seeking men. As a Man, He never seemed
   happier than when He was in the midst of His disciples, or surrounded
   by publicans and sinners, or feeding famishing crowds. He was so great
   a lover of mankind that He loved to be "in the company." Living and
   working in such a city as this, with all its millions, the burden is
   enough to break one's heart as we consider the city's sins, its
   irreligion, its neglect of God. It is sweet to hope that He who loved
   to be "in the company," when He was here, will certainly come and bless
   these throngs of men!

   If ever a physician was needed, it is in this vast hospital. If ever a
   shepherd was needed, it is among these perishing sheep. Jesus has such
   a love to the sons of men and such a wish to gather them to Himself,
   that even now His redeeming work is done! He is still always with us.
   He has been lifted up and now He draws all men to Himself and,
   therefore, we

   expect to find Him in the center of these throngs. Those who go into
   the dense masses of humanity may expect this same Jesus to be with them
   in full power to save. Rescue the perishing and He will be in the
   company! It was a most natural supposition because of the sweetness and
   friendliness of His temper, that His parents would find Jesus in the
   company.

   They never suspected that He would be found in any wrong place. No
   thought ever crossed their minds that He would be found in any haunt of
   vice, or in any assembly of vanity, though such could have been found
   in Jerusalem. We expect to meet our Lord and the throng of perishing
   men and women, seeking and saving them--but we know that we shall not
   find Him among those who find pleasure in noisy laughter and lawless
   mirth. We never look for Jesus in the theater or the drinking
   saloon--it would be profanity to suppose Him there!

   We never look for Him where a question of morals might be raised, for
   He is undefiled. We expect to find Him where His people meet for
   worship. We look for Him where honest men are laboring hard for their
   daily bread, or where they are suffering His Father's will, but we
   never dream of His being found where the world, the flesh and the devil
   hold supreme control. Let His example be followed by us! Let us never
   go where our Master would not have gone. There are some places where we
   cannot suppose Him to have been--in those places let it not be
   supposable that we can be! Let us go only where we can remain in
   fellowship with our Divine Master and where we should be happy to be
   found if He were suddenly to come in His kingdom.

   Let us judge of where we may go by enquiring, "Would Jesus have gone
   there?" and if He would not have gone, let our feet refuse to carry us
   that way.

   II. But, secondly, THIS SUPPOSITION BROUGHT THEM GREAT SORROW, from
   which I gather that we ought, with regard to the Lord Jesus Christ, to
   leave nothing as a matter of supposition. By supposing Him to have been
   in the company, they were made to miss Him and to seek Him, sorrowing
   for three days. Why did they lose sight of Him at all? Why did they not
   abide with Him? We may not blame them, for He did not--but, at any
   rate, they fell into days and nights of trouble by supposing something
   about Him. Do not suppose anything about Jesus at all. Do not suppose
   anything about His Character, His doctrines or His work--go in for
   certainty on such points.

   I have heard of a German who evolved a camel out of his own inner
   consciousness. What kind of a camel it was, I do not know--but many
   persons evolve a Christ out of their own imaginations. Do not do it! If
   you do this, you will make yourselves a Christ nothing like Jesus--it
   will be a mere image--a false Christ, an idol Christ. No human thought
   could ever have invented our Savior! We put it to all those who doubt
   the Inspiration of the four Evangelists--would they kindly write us a
   fifth gospel? Could they even suggest another action of Jesus which
   would fit into the rest and be of the same order? They cannot do it!

   The whole conception of Jesus is original and Divine. It is not
   possible that the most ingenious fancy can add anything to the life of
   Christ which would square with that which is recorded. If you chance to
   read the Prot Evangelism, or the Gospel of the Infancy which are
   spurious narratives of the Childhood of Jesus, you will throw them into
   the fire and say at once, "These do not fit in with the records of the
   true Evangelists. These stories are ludicrously unlike the Child,
   Jesus." In fact, all the books which pretend to be a part of the canon
   will be detected and rejected at once by the simplest reader who is
   thoroughly versed in the four Evangelists. Do not, therefore, suppose
   anything concerning Jesus, but read the Word of God and see what is
   revealed about Him.

   Never clip the King's coin, but accept it as it is minted in all its
   purity and preciousness. Add not to the perfect Word of God, lest
   plagues be added to you. What the Holy Spirit has written concerning
   the Man, Christ Jesus, the everlasting Son of God, receive humbly and
   do not import suppositions into your theology. This has been the cause
   of the division of the Church into sects--the bones of contention have
   not been revealed Truths of God, but imagined fictions! I may invent
   one theory and another man, another, and we shall each fight for his
   theory. An hypothesis is set up and supported by the letter of
   Scripture, though not by the spirit of it--and straightway men begin to
   differ, dispute and divide. Let us lay aside all suppositions, for
   these things will only bring us sorrow in the end. Let us believe in
   the real Jesus as He is revealed in the Scriptures and as the Holy
   Spirit graciously enables us to behold Him in the glass of the Word of
   God. "Supposing Him to have been in the company." This supposition
   caused Jesus' parents great sorrow.

   Again, I say, Beloved, do not take anything about Jesus at haphazard
   and perhaps. Let this Truth apply to your personal dealing with Him,
   as, for instance, do not suppose Him to be in your hearts. Do not
   suppose that because you were baptized in infancy you are, therefore,
   in Christ and Christ in you. That is a dangerous supposition! Do not
   say, "But I

   have been baptized as a professed Believer and, therefore, Jesus is in
   my heart." The inward Grace is not tied to the outward sign! Water
   Baptism does not convey the Spirit of God. Blessed are they who, having
   the Spirit, can use the ordinance to their profit, but do not suppose
   that the Grace of God is tied to any outward rite.

   Do not say, "I have eaten at the communion table and, therefore, Jesus
   is in my heart." You may eat and drink at His table and yet never know
   Him--and He may never know you. Outward ceremonies convey no Grace to
   graceless persons. Do not take it for granted that because you are
   admitted into a Christian Church, and are generally accepted as being a
   Believer, that, therefore, you must be so. I dread lest any of you
   should think your Church membership to be a certificate of salvation!
   It was not given to you with that view--we judged favorably of your
   conduct and profession--but we could not read your heart! Do not even
   suppose that Grace must necessarily be in your souls because you have
   been professing Christians for a great many years, for the lapse of the
   will does not turn falsehood into truth!

   It is difficult to know how long hypocrisy can be kept up, or how far a
   man may be self-deceived. It is even possible that he may die with his
   eyes blinded through the exceeding deceitfulness of sin. Do not suppose
   that Jesus is in your heart because you are an elder, or a deacon, or a
   pastor! I will not make any supposition in my own case, for woe is unto
   me if, after having preached to others, I myself should be a castaway!
   Such things have happened--Judas was one of the Twelve. Men have been
   sweet of voice and yet bitter of heart--they have been taught in the
   Word of God as to the letter, but they have not known the power of the
   everlasting Spirit--and so they have perished!

   Verily, I say unto you, in Christ's name, unless the Spirit of God
   actually rests upon each one of us personally, it will be all in vain
   for us to suppose that He is in our hearts because of professions and
   ordinances, for the supposition may be a damning falsehood and may lull
   us into a fatal slumber. How terrible to be taken out to execution with
   our eyes bandaged by a supposition! Again, dear Friends, do not ever
   suppose that Christ is in our assemblies because we meet in this house.
   Do not go up to a place of worship and think Jesus is sure to be there.
   He may not have been there for many a day! Is it not sad that out of
   the tens of thousands of assemblies held on this day there will be many
   in which Jesus will not be present--for His Gospel will not be
   preached, or if preached--it will not be set forth in the living power
   of the Holy Spirit! Christ is not present where He is not honored.

   All your architecture, all your millinery, all your music, all your
   learning, all your eloquence are of small account. Jesus may be absent
   when all these things are present in profusion. And then your public
   worship will only be the magnificent funeral of religion, but the life
   of God will be far away! It brings great sorrow in the long run to a
   Church if they take it for granted that Jesus must be among them. Our
   question every Sunday morning ought to be, "What do you think, will He
   come to the feast?" If He does not come to the feast, it will be the
   mockery of a festival, but no bread will be on the table for hungry
   souls. We must have our Lord in our company or we will break our hearts
   over His absence! We desire His Presence even in the smallest Prayer
   Meeting and in our minor gatherings when we meet to consult as to His
   work. If He awakens us by His Spirit and reveals to us that He was not
   in our former meetings, we will seek Him sorrowing, as His father and
   mother did.

   Once more, let us not take it for granted that the Lord Jesus is
   necessarily with us in our Christian labors. Do we not, too often, go
   out to do good without special prayer, imagining that Jesus must surely
   be with us as a matter of course? Perhaps we thus conclude because He
   has been with us so long, or because we feel ourselves fully equipped
   for the occasion, or because we do not even think whether He is with us
   or not. This is perilous! If Jesus is not with us, we toil all the
   night and we take nothing. But if Jesus is with us, He teaches us how
   to cast the net and a great multitude of fish are taken! If Jesus is
   not with us, we are like Samson when his hair was shorn--he went out as
   at other times thinking to smite the Philistines hip and thigh, as he
   had done before, but as Watts puts it, he--

   "Shook his vain limbs with vast surprise, Made feeble fight and lost
   his eyes." So shall we be defeated if we imagine that we can succeed
   without fresh Divine assistance--the fact being that we ought to seek
   the Lord in prayer before the smallest Christian engagement--and then
   we may reap in it the most important result of our lives. You are going
   to see a poor bedridden old woman. Do not attempt to comfort this
   King's daughter without first seeking the Presence of "the Consolation
   of Israel." You are going to teach your Sunday school class this
   afternoon. You have done it so many times that you eat your lunch and
   walk off to the school scarcely thinking

   enough about what you are doing to breathe a prayer for your Lord's
   help! Is this right? Can you afford to waste one single Sunday
   afternoon, or one opportunity to speak for Jesus? And yet, it will be
   wasted if He is not with you.

   Some of your children may be dead before next Sunday, or never come to
   the class again! Go not, even once, without your Lord. Do not sit down
   to teach as if you had Jesus at your command and were sure that of
   necessity He must succeed your endeavors! He will withdraw from us if
   we fall into a careless, prayerless habit. Why was He not with His
   mother that day? Truly He had to be about the business of His heavenly
   Father, but why did He permit His human mother to miss Him? Was it not
   because she needed to be taught, as well as the rest of us, the value
   of His company? Perhaps if we never missed Him, we might not know how
   sweet He is!

   I can picture Mary, when she had lost the dear Child, weeping floods of
   tears. Then she began to understand what old Simeon meant when he said,
   "Yes, a sword shall pierce through your own heart, also." The sword was
   piercing her heart, even then, to prepare her for three other days in
   which she would mourn Him as dead with still bitterer grief. See how
   she enquired everywhere, "Have you seen Him?" She reminds me of the
   spouse in the Song, "Have you seen Him whom my soul loves?" I think I
   see her going through the streets and saying, at the close of the day,
   "I sought Him, but I found Him not." Everywhere the same question,
   "Have you seen Him whom my soul loves?" But she gets no tidings of Him.
   Peace is all unknown to her till she finds Him.

   But, oh, how precious He was in her eyes when, at last, she discovered
   Him in the Temple! How careful she was of Him afterwards. How happy to
   think that no harm had come to her dear charge! If you and I ever lose
   the society of Christ in our service, we will go to Him, and cry, "My
   Lord, do not leave me again! What a fool I am if You are not my wisdom!
   How weak I am if You are not my strength! How worse than silent I am if
   You are not my mouth to me! How heartless is all my talk and how flat
   it falls upon the hearer's ears, if You are not the spirit and the life
   of all my speaking!" Oh, if all our preaching and teaching were in the
   power of the Presence of our Divine Master, how different it would be!

   Do then, learn the lesson, Brothers and Sisters, as I desire to learn
   it for myself, that we must not take anything for granted about Jesus.
   We must make sure work concerning eternal things, for if these are
   allowed to slip, where are we? Grasp the Truth of God and know that it
   is the Truth of God! Never be satisfied with "ifs," and "buts," and, "I
   hope so," and, "I trust so," but make sure of Christ! If you are not
   sure about the health of your body, yet be sure about your being in
   Christ and so healthy in soul! If you are not sure about the solvency
   of your firm; if you are not sure about the deeds of your estate; if
   you are not sure about your marriage, yet at least be sure that you
   have Jesus within your heart! If you have any doubt, today, give no
   sleep to your eyes nor slumber to your eyelids until the Holy Spirit,
   Himself, has sealed upon your spirit the certainty that Jesus is yours!
   Thus have I used the supposition in two ways.

   III. Now for a third lesson--THE SUPPOSITION made by these two good
   people MAY INSTRUCT US. Let us use it as this, then, and turn to,
   "Supposing Him to have been in the company." I speak now to children
   who are hearing this sermon. This is for you. Jesus was about 12 years
   old and you are of much the same age. Suppose He had been in the
   company returning to Nazareth--how would He have behaved Himself? Think
   of Jesus as an example for yourselves. I am sure, when the whole
   company sang a Psalm, that bright-eyed Boy would have been among the
   sweetest singers! He would have sung most heartily the praises of God,
   His Father! There would have been no inattention or weariness in Him
   when God was to be praised. You would have numbered the Holy Child
   among the most devout worshippers.

   Therefore, dear children, whenever you come in among God's people, give
   your whole hearts to the worship--pray with us and sing with us--and
   endeavor to drink in the Truth of God which is spoken, for so will you
   be like the holy Jesus. Let all boys and girls pray that among God's
   people they may behave as Jesus would have done. I feel persuaded that
   Jesus would have been found in that company listening to those who
   talked of holy things! Especially would He have been eager to hear
   explanations of what He had seen in the Temple.

   When the conversation turned upon the Paschal lamb, how that dear
   Child, who was "the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the
   world," would have listened to it! I think I see His sweet face turned
   towards those who spoke of the sprinkled blood. He would surely have
   said, "What do you mean by this ordinance?" He would have been anxious
   to share with the grown-up people all the solemn thoughts of the day.
   So whenever you come up to the House of God, try and learn all that you
   can from all the teaching of God's Word. Seek good company and learn by
   it. Have a deaf ear to

   those who speak wickedly, but always be ready to listen to everything
   about your God, your Savior, your faith and the Heaven where you hope
   to dwell.

   I feel sure, also, that if He had been in the company going home, He
   would have been the most obliging, helpful, pleasing child in all the
   company--if anybody had needed to have a burden carried, this Boy of 12
   would have been the first to offer! As far as His strength allowed, if
   any kindly deed could be done, He would be first in doing it. He grew
   in favor both with God and men because He laid Himself out to be
   everybody's servant. Mary's Son won the love of all around, for He was
   so unselfish, kind, gentle and willing. He did all that He could to
   make others happy and blessed are those boys and girls who learn this
   lesson well. Oh, children, you will be happy if you live to make others
   happy! Act thus to your parents, brothers and sisters, friends and
   schoolfellows--and you will, in this, be like Jesus.

   I am sure, also, that Jesus would not have done in that company as too
   many boys are apt to do. He would not have been mischievous, noisy,
   annoying and disobedient--but He would have been a comfort and delight
   to all about Him. No doubt but He would have been the liveliest and
   most cheerful boy in the whole company, yet He would not have been
   rough, coarse, willful, or cruel. There would have been no quarreling
   where He was--His very Presence would have bred peace among all the
   children that were with Him. I should like you to think over all that
   Jesus would have done and would not have done. And then I should be
   glad to see you acting as He did. Take this little word home with you,
   dear children. Ask yourselves often, "What would Jesus do?" For what
   Jesus would have done is the best rule for you.

   And now to you elder folks, "supposing Him to have been in the
   company," and you had been in the company, I will warrant there is not
   one father or mother but what would have been willing to care for Him.
   Every matron here says, "I would have taken Him under my wing." You say
   that honestly, do you not? You mean it, I am sure. Well, you have an
   opportunity of proving that you are sincere, for Jesus is still in our
   company. You can find Him in the form of the poor. If you would have
   watched over Him, relieve their needs--do it to the least of these, and
   you have done it unto Him. You can find Jesus in the form of the
   sick--visit them. I wish more of God's people would addict themselves
   to calling upon the sick, visiting them in their homes and cheering
   them in their needs.

   As you say you would have taken care of Jesus, prove it at once by
   remembering His Words, "I was sick and you visited Me." If you would
   have taken care of Jesus, you can show it by caring for the young, for
   every young child comes to us under the guardian care of Him who said,
   "Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not." You
   that spend your leisure in seeking to bless the young are proving that
   if you had been in that company, you would have taken care of the
   Child, Jesus. Above all, consider the orphans! For, had He been in that
   company, He would have been practically an orphan, for He would have
   lost, for a while, both father and mother. Many among you have such
   fond maternal hearts that you would have said, "I must look after that
   bright, beautiful Boy who is now without parents. Evidently He has lost
   them. Come here Child, come here!"

   You would have felt a joy to have kissed Him and folded Him to your
   bosom. Prove it by looking after orphan children wherever they are--and
   let each represent to you the Jesus of that day as He would have been
   had His parents' supposition been correct. Let us see that the love you
   feel to Jesus when you read your Bibles is not mere emotion or
   sentiment, but that practical principle lies at the back of it and
   affects your life and conduct. So far have we gone and I hope not
   altogether without profit. May the Spirit of God help us yet further.

   IV. But now I change the line of our thought altogether for a little
   while. Forget the Child Jesus, now, and let me use

   the words concerning Jesus in the fullness of His power. SUPPOSING HIM
   TO BE IN OUR COMPANY IN ALL HIS

   GRACIOUS INFLUENCE, what then? Then, Brothers and Sisters, first, how
   happy will such company be! For with Christ known to be in their
   company, saints cannot but be glad! You may have seen a picture
   representing certain of the martyrs sitting together in prison. They
   are to be burned, by-and-by, and they are comforting each other. Now,
   supposing Him to have been in their company, as I doubt not He was, I
   could wish to have been there even at the price of sharing their
   burning--wouldn't you?

   Or look, a few poor people met together in a cottage talking about
   Jesus, as people seldom do now--Jesus is there and their hearts are
   burning within them! How favored they are! If their hearts might
   otherwise have been sad, yet supposing Him to be in the company--how
   restful all the mourners become--how light every burden grows, how
   every aching heart rejoices, for in His Presence there is fullness of
   joy! Get but Christ into your family circle and it is a ring of
   delight! Supposing Jesus to be in the company, next how united His
   people will all become! Whenever Christian people

   fall out, it is because Jesus is not in their company. Whenever there
   is a lack of love; whenever there is a lack of forbearance; when people
   fall to fault-finding and quarrelling, one with the other, my heart
   says to me, "Supposing Him to have been in the company, they would not
   have acted so."

   They would have looked at Him and straightway have forgiven one
   another! No, they would hardly have had need to forgive, for they would
   neither have given nor taken offense, and their hearts would have
   flowed together in one common stream. The sheep are scattered
   everywhere upon the hills till the Shepherd comes! They know His voice
   and they gather to Him! Jesus is the center and the source of unity and
   when we have Him reigning in His full glory in the midst of the Church,
   divisions and schisms will cease to be. "Supposing Him to have been in
   the company," how holy they would all grow! Sin dies as Jesus looks
   upon it and men's wayward passions yield to His sweet sway. How devout
   would all hearts be, "supposing Him to be in the company!"

   What prayer there is and what praise! There is no hurrying over morning
   devotion, no falling asleep at the bedside at night when Jesus is in
   our company! Then our heart is praying all day long and we delight to
   pray together for His coming and His kingdom. How teachable we are,
   too, when Jesus is in the company, opening the Scriptures and opening
   our hearts--what sweet communion we enjoy. How souls go out to His soul
   and hearts to His heart--and how fine we knit together in the one
   Christ! How happy, how united, how holy is the company supposing Jesus
   to be in it! When Jesus is in the company how lively they all are! Why,
   in these warm mornings, some seem half inclined to fall asleep, even in
   the House of Prayer--"The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is
   weak."

   But when Jesus is in the company, the spirit triumphs over the flesh
   and we feel full of life, power and energy in the Divine service! When
   our hearts burn within us because of His Words, our bodies cannot
   freeze. When the soul is quickened by His Presence, then the whole man
   is awakened. As when the sun rises, his light wakes thousands of
   sleepers, though no voice is heard, so the smiles of Jesus awaken a
   sleeping Church and stir it to zeal and energy. If Jesus is in the
   company, how earnest we grow! How zealous for His Glory! How intent to
   win souls! I am afraid it is because Jesus is not in the company that
   we allow many sinners to go by us without a warning and we neglect fine
   opportunities for serving our Lord.

   You have heard of holy Mr. Payson, the American Divine, a man who
   walked with God in his ministry. He was out one day with a brother
   minister who had to make a call at a lady's house and Payson went in
   with him. The lady pressed them both to stay to tea. She was not a
   Christian woman and Payson had other business and, therefore, he
   declined. But as she pressed him very earnestly, he sat down and
   invoked the Divine blessing which he did in terms so sweet and full of
   holy unction that he impressed everybody. The lady waited upon him with
   great attention and when he rose up to go, he said to her, "Madam, I
   thank you much for your great kindness to me, but how do you treat my
   Master?" A work of Grace was worked in that lady by the question--she
   was brought to Jesus and she opened her house for preaching--and a
   revival followed.

   Now, if Jesus had not been with Payson, what had become of that woman?
   I fear that we go in and out among dying men and women and we let them
   perish--yes, we let them be damned without an effort for their
   salvation--and all because we have not obeyed the voice which speaks to
   us as it did to Abraham, "I am God Almighty, walk before Me and be you
   perfect." We shall never be perfected as the servants of God unless we
   walk in His conscious Presence. But if we walk before Him and He is
   with us, then shall we be earnest in the winning of souls. I am sure,
   dear Friends, that if Jesus is in the company, then we shall be
   confident and all doubts will vanish. How firmly shall we believe
   because we are living in fellowship with "the Truth"! How safely we
   shall be guarded against temptation, even as the sheep are safe from
   the wolf when the shepherd is near!

   What blessed, heavenly lives shall we lead! Surely it will be a small
   change for us to rise from earth to Heaven if Jesus is always in the
   company, in the family, in the business, in our labors, recreations, in
   our joys and sorrows!

   V. Lastly, I want to dwell, for just a minute, by way of touching the
   conscience, upon the reflection that JESUS HAS BEEN IN THE
   COMPANY--whether we have seen Him or not. I want you to look back upon
   what He has seen in your company supposing Him to have been there, when
   you were disputing the other night. Yes, a point of doctrine had come
   up and you differed over it. Did you not wax very warm, my Brother,
   even so as to grow red in the face? Did you not go away from that
   friend with whom you disputed almost hating him? You know you did!
   Supposing Jesus to have been in the company? He was there and He was
   grieved at the way in which you remembered His doctrine but forgot His
   spirit!

   Had you perceived His Presence, you would have put your argument much
   more sweetly, and you would have spoken, not for the sake of beating
   your friend in argument, but for the sake of instructing him and
   glorifying your Lord.

   You know that you did not yield a point you ought to have yielded. You
   knew you were wrong at the time, but your friend pushed you hard and
   you said to yourself, "I will not give way though I see that he is
   right." Although I suppose that we shall differ about many points till
   the Lord comes, yet when differences arise, they will present fair
   opportunities for holy charity and mutual edification and these will
   gladly be seized if Jesus is in the company. When next we argue, let
   each one say, "Jesus is in this company and, therefore, while we speak
   up for what we believe to be true, let us do it in a loving spirit.''
   Our arguments will not lose force by being steeped in love. Truth is
   never stronger than when it walks with charity.

   Then, again, it may be that some little time ago certain of you were
   acting in such a way that no common observer could have seen any
   difference between you and worldlings. You were out in business,
   dealing with one who was trying to do his best for himself, and you
   were trying to do your best for yourselves. Do I blame you? Not for
   being prudent and circumspect--but I hope you will blame yourselves for
   going far beyond this. You did nothing which I may style
   dishon-est--but did you not sail dreadfully near the wind? You stated
   something which I must not call a lie, but still, it was not true as
   you meant it to be understood, was it? Businessmen too often aim at
   getting undue advantage of each other--it is "diamond cuts diamond,"
   and rather worse at times. If Christian men, in all their dealings,
   would suppose Jesus to be in the company, how it would change their
   manners!

   Think of Jesus on this side of the counter along with you who sell, and
   on that side of the counter along with you who buy. You both need His
   Presence, for the buyer is generally quite as intent upon cheating as
   the seller! He wants the goods for less than they are worth and the
   seller, therefore, baits the hook for him. They are both deceivers but
   the blame is not all on one. When persons must have goods far below the
   price for which they can be produced, they must not marvel if they find
   that they are sold an inferior article which looks well enough but
   turns out to be worthless. Oh, that you Christian people would always
   suppose Jesus to be in your company! I can hardly imagine Judas
   cheating John with Jesus looking on--nor Philip trading hardly with the
   lad who had the barley loaves!

   Should not our dealings among the sons of men be such as Jesus can
   approve? He is our Master and Lord--let us imitate Him and do nothing
   that we would be ashamed for Him to look upon. Do not accuse me of
   being personal this morning, for if you do, I will plead guilty! If the
   cap fits, you wear it! The other day you were in company and certain
   persons were talking profanely, or was it skepticism which they vented?
   And you, as Christ's disciple, heard them and what did you do? Did you
   bear witness for the Truth of God? They made a joke--it was not very
   clean, but you laughed! Did you not? And, alas, you said nothing for
   your Lord! Yet He was in the company, seeing all! You had several
   opportunities, but you did not put in a word for Truth and holiness!

   Now, supposing Jesus to have been in the company? I think He must have
   been sorely grieved. Surely your Lord must have thought, "What? All
   this said against Me and never a word in reply from him whom I redeemed
   with My own blood!" Was not this Peter, all over again, in his denials
   of his Lord? You did not deny Him with oaths and curses, but the same
   cowardly spirit ruled you! Oh, if you had but come out in your true
   colors! You do not know what an influence you might have had for good!
   If we set the Lord Jesus Christ always before us, should we not be
   brave to testify and quick to defend? Think, again, of those evenings
   when a few friends meet together--are they not often a waste of time?
   "Supposing Him to have been in the company," as He really is, do you
   think the evenings should be spent as they frequently are?

   Dr. Chalmers, a truly devout man, tells us that once, at a nobleman's
   house, he spent an evening with various friends and talked over the
   question of the cause and cure of pauperism--a subject most suitable
   for conversation. An aged Highland chieftain among the company listened
   with great attention to the doctor, for Chalmers was master of the
   subject. Surely they had not spent the evening amiss. But in the night
   an unusual noise and a heavy groan were heard. The chieftain was dying.
   In a few minutes he was dead and Dr. Chalmers stood over him, the
   picture of distress. "Alas," he cried, "had I known that my friend was
   within a few minutes of eternity, I would have preached to him and to
   you Christ Jesus and Him crucified."

   With how much more reason may many Christians repent of their
   conversation! How bitterly may they look back upon wasted hours!
   Supposing Jesus to have been in the company, how often must He have
   been grieved by our frivoli-

   ties! Do you not think that it is greatly to our discredit as Christian
   people that we should so often meet and so seldom pray? The happiest
   evenings that Christians spend are when they talk, even upon secular
   subjects, in a gracious manner, and do not fail to rise to holier
   themes--and mingle prayer and thanksgiving with their talk! Then when
   they retire, they feel that they have spent the evening as Jesus would
   approve. Did I not hear, the other day, of some Christian friend who
   was going to give up working for Christ? And of a dozen Christian
   friends who were going to break up and no more go on with their holy
   service for Jesus?

   One was going to leave the Sunday school in which he had been for
   years! Another was going to allow a weak Church to break up and go to
   pieces, for he had grown tired of working under discouragements.
   Another said, "I have had my turn, let somebody else do the work."
   Supposing Jesus to have been in the company, do you think that such
   observations pleased Him? If Jesus were perceived among us, would any
   of us turn his back in the day of battle? No, Brothers and Sisters,
   since Jesus is with us, let us serve Him as long as we have any being!
   Remember John Newton's speech when they told him that he was too old to
   preach--the venerable man exclaimed "What? Should the old African
   blasphemer cease to preach while there is breath in his body? Never!"

   Do not suffer any difficulty, or infirmity to prevent your persevering
   in the service of Jesus in some form or other. And when you feel as if
   you must leave the ranks, suppose Him to be in the company--and march
   on! Forward, Brethren! Jesus heads the way! Forward, for His Presence
   is victory! God bless you, dear Friends, and all this day may Jesus be
   in the company to make it a hallowed Sabbath to your souls. Amen.

Imitators of God

   (No. 1725)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 10, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children." Ephesians 5:1.

   WE shall read the text as it should more properly be translated--"Be
   you therefore imitators of God, as beloved children." Upon the word,
   "imitate," our discourse will hinge. The division into chapters is
   often most unfortunate and, in this case, it causes a break in a
   passage which, in its sense, is one and indivisible. The Apostle had
   said, "Be you kind, one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
   another, even as God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you. Be you
   therefore imitators of God, as dear children." He has forgiven you,
   therefore imitate Him. It is a pity to have divided the argument from
   the conclusion.

   Here, while your minds are fresh, let me remind you that this is
   Hospital Sunday. And let me add that my text is an argument, and a
   powerful one, for helping those houses of mercy. Your Lord would have
   you be kind, one to another, and tenderhearted--but how can we be kind
   and tenderhearted if the sick poor are not cared for? When all the
   machinery and all the medical skill are waiting to relieve the
   suffering poor, it is a crying shame that beds in hospitals should be
   unused because of lack of funds. Yet this is sadly the case and several
   of those grand institutions are running into debt. We may, ourselves,
   have no surgical skill, or nursing art, but we can each give of our
   substance to aid those whose lives are consecrated to the Christ-like
   work of healing.

   We cannot be kind and tenderhearted unless we give according to our
   ability to such noble institutions as our hospitals. Preachers
   generally put the application at the end of a discourse, but on these
   warm days you are apt to grow tired and, therefore, I put the
   application at the beginning, that you may not give faintly and
   scantily when the sermon is over! All sorts of religionists are
   contributing to the common fund and we must not be lacking. When the
   box comes round, "be you imitators of God, as dear children," in the
   largeness of your liberality and the freeness of your gifts! The
   Apostle urges us to give and forgive. If you are imitators of God,
   give, for He is always giving. Give, for if He were not to give, our
   lives would end! Give, for He gives unto all men liberally and upbraids
   not, and every good gift and every perfect gift is from above. Be you
   imitators of God, the constant, generous Giver, who spared not His own
   Son! Thanks be to His name for that unspeakable Gift!

   Then comes that which, to most men, is a harder task, but which to a
   Christian man is a delight--I mean to forgive. God, for Christ's sake,
   has forgiven us. He has blotted out our transgressions like a cloud and
   cast our sins into the depth of the sea, plunging them into oblivion!
   Therefore, let us forgive most freely all who have done us wrong, so
   that when we bow our knees, we may say without hypocrisy, "Forgive us
   our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us." Let
   giving and forgiving be two prominent features of our lives as
   Christians--giving to the needy and forgiving the guilty. Giving to
   such as ask of us and forgiving such as offend us. By these two things
   let us show that we walk in love as Christ also has loved us. He has
   given Himself for us and through His precious blood we are forgiven our
   iniquities. Let us, therefore, blend giving and forgiving into one
   God-like life, imitating our God. This is our Father's Commandment--let
   it be our delight!

   I. With this as a preface, let us now come closely to the text, and let
   us CONSIDER THE PRECEPT here laid down--"Be you imitators of God, as
   dear children." I note upon this precept, first, that it calls us to
   practical duty. Many precepts of the Word of God are thought by men of
   the world to be unpractical, but even in those instances, they are in
   error, for the result and outcome of such precepts produce the
   practical holiness which all profess to desire. In this instance there
   can be no argument at the too spiritual, sentimental, or speculative
   character of the text--there can be no question as to the eminently
   practical character of the exhortation--"Be you imitators of God, as
   dear children," for it points to action, continued action of the best
   kind.

   "Be you imitators"--that is, do not only meditate upon God and think
   that you have done enough, but go on to copy what you study. Meditation
   is a happy, holy, profitable engagement. It will instruct you,
   strengthen you, comfort you, inspire your heart and make your soul
   steadfast. But you may not stop at meditation--you must go on to
   imitation of the Character of God! Let your spiritual life not only bud
   and blossom in devout thought, but let it bring forth fruit in holy
   action. Be not satisfied with feeding the soul by meditation, but rise
   up from the banquet and use the strength which you have gained! Sitting
   at the feet of Jesus must be succeeded by following in the footsteps of
   Jesus!

   Neither does the text say to us, "Be you admirers of God." This we
   ought to be and shall be if we are true Christians. The pure in heart,
   who, alone, can truly see God, are filled with a reverent admiration of
   Him. With the angels, every gracious heart exclaims, "Holy, holy, holy,
   Lord God of Hosts." "There is none holy as the Lord" (Sam. 2:2). When
   the best of men are compared with the Lord, their holiness is not to be
   mentioned. "Who is like unto You, O God, glorious in holiness?" But we
   cannot rest satisfied with rendering such admiration--we must prove
   that we really admire by closely imitating. The world's proverb is that
   "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery." I shall alter it and
   adapt it to a higher use. "Imitation of God is the sincerest form of
   admiring Him!" Neither can we believe that you know God and are at all
   charmed with His holiness unless you endeavor, as He shall help you, to
   imitate Him as dear children.

   Neither does the text stop at adoration, though that is a sublime
   height. Adoration springs out of meditation and admiration and is a
   very high and noble exercise of the mind. Perhaps we rise to the
   highest possible service of God on earth when we are adoring Him--this
   is the engagement of saints and angels before His Throne and never are
   we nearer Heaven than when we follow the same occupation here below.
   Beloved, let your whole lives be adoration to God! Not only on Sundays
   and at certain hours, or in your assemblies, but everywhere adore, by
   good works--a manner of worship which is as real and acceptable as the
   most reverent public service! Remember, "to obey is better than
   sacrifice"--holy living outshines all other solemnities.

   To love is to adore! To obey is to praise! To act is to worship! If you
   are imitators of God as dear children, your adoration will be proved to
   be sincere. Worship unattended by imitation is fake--true adoration
   dwells not in words only--as it comes from the heart, so it affects the
   entire nature and shows itself in the daily behavior. Let us spread our
   adoration over all the day till, from the moment when we open our eyes
   till we close them again at night, we shall be practically worshipping
   the Lord by reverencing His law, delighting in His Commandments and
   imitating His Character! It is clear that the precept before us is
   eminently practical. You who boast in being such practical men, give
   heed to this!

   Next, this precept treats us as children--it treats us as what we are!
   And if we are lowly in heart, we shall be thankful that it is worded as
   it is. Some men are very high and mighty. Measured by their own rod,
   they are great men and, therefore, they must be original and strike out
   a path for themselves. You are not commanded to do anything of the
   kind--the path is laid down for you--"Be you imitators." This is a
   similar doctrine to that which we teach the children at school. You, my
   boy, are not to invent a system of writing--yours is a much easier
   task, keep to your copy, imitate every letter--yes, every turn and
   twist of your master's hand! Scholars can only learn by imitation and
   we are all scholars.

   It may be something to aspire to be the head of a school of painting,
   but the first thing for the young artist to do is to copy. He who
   cannot copy cannot originate--depend upon that! I have heard great
   outcries about young preachers imitating, but I would suggest that, in
   their early efforts, this is not blameworthy. What more natural than
   that Timothy should, at first, be much influenced by Paul's manner of
   speech? How could a man become an artist if he did not attach himself
   to some school of painting and sit under a certain master?

   He may be of the French school, or the Italian school, or the Flemish
   school, but he must begin as a follower even if he grows up to be a
   leader. When he has been well trained and has done much work, he may
   outgrow his master and become an original, but he must begin as a
   careful copyist. Here you are invited to become imitators--but the
   Master is such that you will never be able to learn all that He can
   teach and so strike out a better path. Though you are immortal, yet
   throughout eternity you will never advance beyond your Model, for it is
   written, "Be you imitators of God." Listen to me, you aspiring
   minds--if you must be original, the most wonderful originality in this
   world would be for a man's character to be a precise copy of the
   Character of God! In you there would be novelty, indeed, for you would
   be like He whose name is s called, "Wonderful!"

   When our Lord Jesus exhibited on earth the Character of God, His life
   was so original that the world knew Him not! They were puzzled and
   amazed at the sight of One who was so like unto the Father. His life
   struck men as being the most singular thing they had ever seen! And if
   we are close copyists of God, our characters will also stand out in
   relief and we shall, each one, be "a wonder unto many." You see it is a
   humbling exhortation which only men of childlike spirit are likely to
   regard. Wisely does the Scripture address it only to such--"Be you
   therefore imitators of God, as dear chil-dren"--if you are not His
   children you cannot imitate Him and you will not even desire to do so!

   Observe, next, that while it thus humbles us, this precept ennobles us,
   for what a grand thing it is to be imitators of God! It is an honor to
   be the lowliest follower of such a Leader. Time has been when men
   gloried in studying Homer and their lives were trained to heroism by
   his martial verse. Alexander carried a great warrior's head about with
   him in a casket studded with jewels, and his military life greatly
   sprung out of his imitation of the warriors of Greece and Troy. Ours is
   a nobler ambition, by far, than that which delights in battles. We
   desire to imitate the God of Peace, whose name is Love. In later ages,
   when men began to be a less savage race and contests of thought were
   carried on by the more educated class of minds, thousands of men
   gloried in being disciples of the mighty Stagyrite, the renowned
   Aristotle.

   He reigned supreme over the thoughts of men for centuries and students
   slavishly followed him till a greater arose and set free the human mind
   by a more true philosophy. To this day, however, our cultured men
   remain copyists and you can see a fashion in philosophy as well as in
   clothes. Some of these imitations are so childish as to be deplorable.
   It is no honor to imitate a poor example! But, oh, Beloved, he who
   seeks to imitate God has a noble enterprise before him--he shall rise
   as on eagle's wings! We are copying infinite goodness! We seek after
   moral perfection. We are to be "blameless and harmless, the sons of God
   without rebuke!"

   But as God is infinitely more than that, so are we to rise above mere
   innocence into actual holiness. To refrain from evil is not enough--we
   must be filled with all goodness by the Spirit of God. Is not this a
   mark worth aiming at? Judge you what that Grace must be which is to
   raise us to this height! O angels, what happier task could be laid
   before you? What higher ambition can you know? God's only-begotten Son,
   who is this day Lord of All, wears His Father's s image in His Glory,
   even as on earth He was such a copy of God that He could truly say, "He
   that has seen Me has seen the Father." "I do always," said He, "the
   things that please Him." The perfect Son of God is as His Father in
   holiness. You see your calling, Brothers and Sisters, to a high place
   in the rank of intelligences. You are bid to ascend, by God Himself! In
   this respect take your seats in the highest room. Imitate, but note
   well that you do not select an imperfect example--"Be you imitators of
   God, as dear children."

   While it ennobles us, this precept tests us--tests us in many points.
   "Be you imitators of God." This tests our knowledge. A man cannot
   imitate that which he has never seen. He who does not know God cannot
   possibly imitate Him. Do you know God, my Hearer? Have you turned unto
   Him with repentance? Have you ever spoken with Him in prayer? Have you
   had fellowship with Him in Christ? Can you say, "I have set the Lord
   always before me"? You cannot possibly follow a copy unless you fix
   your eyes upon that copy and have some intelligent knowledge of what it
   is. We must have a spiritual idea of God or we cannot imitate Him--and,
   therefore, the need of the Holy Spirit! How can we know the Lord unless
   the Spirit reveals Him in us?

   What is more, this precept tests our love. If we love God, love will
   impel us to imitate Him. But we shall not do so from any other force.
   We readily grow somewhat like that which we love. In married life,
   persons who have truly loved, though they may begin with great
   dissimilarity, will gradually be conformed to one another in the
   process of years. Likeness is the natural product of love and so, if we
   truly love God, we shall by very force of that love through His blessed
   Spirit grow more and more like He is. If we do not love the Lord, we
   shall not follow Him; but if we truly love Him, we shall say with
   David, "My soul follows hard after You; Your right hand upholds me."

   Our text does even more than this--it tests our sincerity. If a man is
   not really a Christian, he will take no care about his life. But in the
   matter of close copying, a man must be careful--a watchful care is
   implied in the idea of imitation. You cannot copy a document without
   being intent to read and mark each word. If I sit down to write an
   article out of my own mind, I have nothing to do but to make my own
   tracks and there is my work, such as it is. But if I have to copy from
   a book, them I must necessarily look to each line, and I must read it
   over attentively, for otherwise I may misrepresent the writer whose
   language I transcribe.

   In copying from Nature, how careful the artist has to be at every
   touch, or he will fail in his picture. If a sculptor is producing a
   replica of an ancient statue, he must keep his eyes open and follow
   every line and mark. My Friend, you cannot imitate God if you are one
   of that sort of Christians who are habitually in a condition between
   sleeping and wak-ing--with one eye a little open and the other closed!
   Such men live a slovenly life and attempt a sort of happy-go-lucky
   religion which may be right or which may be wrong--but its character
   they cannot tell--for they run with their neighbors and never examine
   for themselves! Such people live at random and never take a day's life
   at night and examine it to see its faults. Thus sin grows upon them
   like weeds in a sluggard's garden. Such persons, playing at hit or miss
   with holiness, are sure to come short of it! But he that is in earnest
   will give his prayerful thought and anxious desire to it, that he may
   become, in very deed, a successful imitator of God. He will also call
   in the aid of the Holy Spirit and thus be led into holiness.

   Moreover, the precept tests us as to our spirit whether it is of the
   Law or of the Gospel. "Be you imitators of God, as dear children" not
   as slaves might imitate their master--unwillingly, dreading the crack
   of his whip--but loving, willing imitators, such as children are. You
   do not urge your children to imitate you! They do this even in their
   games. See how the boy rides his wooden horse and the girl imitates her
   nurse. You see the minister's little boy trying to preach like his
   father--and you all remember the picture of the young girl with a Bible
   in front of her and an ancient pair of spectacles upon her nose,
   saying, "Now I'm Grandmamma!" They copy us by force of nature--they
   cannot help it. Such will be the holiness of the genuine Christian! He
   is born from above and, therefore, he lives above! His imitation of God
   springs out of his relationship to God.

   Holiness must be spontaneous, or it is spurious. We cannot be driven to
   holiness like a bullock to his plowing--we must delight in the Law of
   God after the inward man. "Be you imitators of God, as dear children,"
   because you do not wish for anything better than to be like your
   Father. You have no ambition in the world that approaches your
   aspiration to be holy even as God is holy, according to that Word of
   God, "Be you perfect even as your Father which is in Heaven is
   perfect." Have you that filial spirit? Have you a burning love to
   holiness? Or is sin your delight and God's service a weariness? Where
   your pleasure is--there is your heart. If you love evil you are not the
   children of God at all and cannot imitate Him nor render to Him any
   acceptable service whatever! The Lord make us to be imitators of Him,
   even as children, from a natural bent, copy their parents.

   While it tests us, this precept greatly aids us. It is a fine thing for
   a man to know what he has to do, for then he is led in a plain path
   because of his enemies. What a help it is to have a clear chart and a
   true compass! We have only to ask-- "What would our heavenly Father do
   in such a case?"--and our course is clear. As far as we are capable of
   imitating the Lord, our pathway is plain. We cannot imitate God in His
   power, or Omnipresence, or Omniscience--certain of His attributes are
   incommunicable--and of them we may say they are high and we cannot
   attain to them. But these are not intended in the precept! Creatures
   cannot imitate their Creator in His Divine attributes, but children may
   copy their Father in His moral attributes.

   By the aid of His Divine Spirit we can copy our God in His justice,
   righteousness, holiness, purity, truth and faithfulness. We can be
   tenderhearted, kind, forbearing, merciful, forgiving. In a word, we may
   walk in love as Christ, also, has loved us. To know what to do is a
   great aid to a holy life. This puts us into the light, while the poor
   heathen gropes in darkness, for his false gods are monsters of vice
   which he may not dream of imitating. Another blessing is that it backs
   us up in our position, for if we do a thing because we are imitating
   God. If any raise an objection, it does not trouble us, much less are
   we confounded. We did not expect, when we commenced a holy life, that
   everybody would applaud us, but we reckoned that they would criticize
   us. And so, when their censure comes, we are supported by the
   consideration that those who blame the imitation find fault with the
   copy--if, indeed, the imitation is well done. He who follows God minds
   not what the godless think of his way of life. A clear conscience is
   our portion when we have, in all things, endeavored to please God.

   I will leave my first head when I have made one more observation. This
   precept is greatly for our usefulness--"Be you imitators of God, as
   dear children." I do not know of anything which would make us so useful
   to our fellow men as this would do. What are we sent into the world
   for? Is it not that we may keep men in mind of God, whom they are most
   anxious to forget? If we are imitators of God, as dear children, they
   will be compelled to remember that there is a God, for they will see
   His Character reflected in ours. I have heard of an atheist who said he
   could get over every argument ex-

   cept the example of his godly mother--he could never answer that! A
   genuinely holy Christian is a beam of God's Glory and a testimony to
   the Being and the goodness of God. Men cannot forget that there is a
   God so long as they see His servants among them, dressed in the livery
   of holiness.

   We ought not only to be reminders for the careless, but teachers of the
   ignorant by our walk and conversation. When they look us up and down,
   and see how we live, they ought to be learning something of God. Holy
   men are the world's Bibles--the world reads not the Testament, but they
   read our testimony. Brothers and Sisters, a close imitation of God
   would make our religion honorable. The ungodly might still hate it, but
   they could not sneer at it! No, the more candid among unbelievers,
   perceiving our holiness to be the result of our faith, could say
   nothing against it. The name of Christ would not be so evil spoken of
   if our lives were not so faulty. Holiness is true preaching and
   preaching of the most successful kind.

   What a support it is to the preacher when he has a people around him
   who are daily witnessing for God at home and in business. If the pastor
   can turn to his Church and say, "See, here, what the doctrines of Grace
   can do! See in the lives of our Church members what the Spirit of God
   can produce"--then he will have an unanswerable argument with which to
   silence gainsayers. Does not the Lord say, "You are My witnesses?" Are
   we not detained in this world on purpose that we may bear testimony to
   our Lord? How can we bear forcible witness for Him unless our lives are
   pure? An unclean professor is a fountain of skepticism and a hindrance
   to the Gospel. To be useful we must be holy! If we would bless men as
   God blesses them, we must live as God lives! Therefore, "Be you
   imitators of God, as dear children."

   Thus much upon the precept.

   II. Secondly, I invite you, dear Friends, as we are helped of God's
   Spirit, to WEIGH THE ARGUMENT. The argument is this, "Be you imitators
   of God, as dear children." First, as children. It is the natural
   tendency of children to imitate their parents, yet there are
   exceptions, for some children are the opposite of their fathers,
   perhaps displaying the vices of a remote ancestor. Absalom did not
   imitate David, nor was Rehoboam a repetition of Solomon. In the case of
   God's children, it is a necessity that they should be like their
   Father, for it is a rule in spirituals that like begets its like. Those
   who live wickedly are the children of the Wicked One--no proof is
   needed, you may take it for granted--life is the evidence of Nature.

   Those who live godly and righteously in Christ Jesus, believing in Him,
   are God's children, and though the godly sin, yet they do not love sin,
   nor remain without repenting of it. Holiness of life is the proof of
   regeneration, neither can we accept any other. "By their fruits you
   shall know them," is a rule of universal application. God's children
   must be like He. With all their faults and failings, there must be
   about their lives, as a whole, a likeness to God. The copy may be
   blurred, but it is a copy. I say to any man here who bears the name of
   Christian and professes to be a child of God, either be like your
   Father or give up your name!

   You remember the old classic story of a soldier in Alexander's army
   whose name was Alexander, but when the battle was raging he trembled?
   Then Alexander said to him, "How can you bear the name of Alexander?
   Drop your cowardice, or drop your name." So I say to those who are
   unholy, unclean, impure, unkind, ungracious--be like God, or cease to
   bear the name of a child of God! What need is there that you should
   aggravate your sin by pretending to a character which you do not
   possess! Be like Christ, or be not called a Christian! Do not play the
   Judas unless you have a mind to be a second "son of perdition." The
   argument, then, is that if we are children we should imitate our
   Father.

   But it is also said, "as dear children." Read it as, "children
   beloved." Is not this a tender but mighty argument? How greatly has God
   loved us in that He permits us to be His children! "Behold what manner
   of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the
   children of God." A, "behold," is placed there, as if it were a thing
   of wonder. Do you not wonder at it in your own case, that you should be
   called a child of God? Behold the love which chose you when you were
   dead in trespasses and sins and quickened you into the life of God! Do
   you not remember the text--"As many as received Him, to them gave He
   power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His
   name"? What love was that which revealed itself in your new birth and
   your adoption, giving you the nature and the status of a child of God!

   Furthermore, since you have been a child, was there ever such kindness
   received by a child from a father as you have received? Behold, He
   deals with you as with children! You could not wish for God to improve
   upon His dealings with you, since He acts towards you as He use to do
   unto those that love His name. Behold how He has borne with you in
   manners! How He has put up with your mistakes and your forgetting! How
   He has cared for you in all your cares, helped

   you in all your difficulties and pardoned you in all your sins! I do
   not know what you have to say, my Brothers and Sisters, but this I can
   say--I am filled with admiration at the love of God for me! I have been
   a child greatly beloved of his Father. His love to me is wonderful! I
   am a deep debtor to His Grace. Are you not the same? Then imitate your
   Father, for the more the love of a child to his Father, the more his
   admiration of his Father and the stronger his desire to be like He in
   all things. Let it be so with you.

   However, this word, "as dear children," bears yet another meaning.
   Children differ. A father loves all his children, but he cannot be
   said, in all respects, to love them all alike, for some force him to
   love them beyond the rest. You have one dear son who lies nearest your
   heart. What a sweet child he is! You have got another boy--he is your
   child and you love him and do your best with him--but he is an awkward
   bit of stuff. He gives you little pleasure and you are not particularly
   anxious to have him around you all day long. The first child loves you
   with all his heart and strives to please you. How obedient he is! How
   content and happy! In all things he is a comfort in the house. Your
   heart binds its tendrils about your Joseph more closely than about the
   wayward boy--you do not make a favorite of him--and so excite the
   jealousy of the others.

   You must admit to a nearer and dearer love than usual when you think of
   him. You cannot help your heart clinging to him--his behavior is such
   that he is the son of your right hand and he has a tender place in your
   soul--in a word, he is one of those whom the text calls, "dear
   children." Just so, the Lord has certain dear children. Master Trapp
   says, "God has but a few such children." I am afraid that the quaint
   old commentator is correct and that few imitate the Lord as they
   should. Yet some of the Lord's children give themselves up wholly to
   Him, are watchful and tenderly obedient, and walk in such closeness
   with Him that they deserve the title of "dear children." Brothers and
   Sisters, aim at this! Here happiness lies! Here Heaven lies this side
   of Heaven! To be not only children, but dear children, is to antedate
   eternal bliss!

   Our Lord Jesus had disciples, but of some He said, "Then are you My
   disciples, indeed." Be such! May the Holy Spirit make you such! Around
   us there are troops of third-rate Christians--oh, for more first-class
   Believers! We have many who appear to come into the Father's House at
   mealtimes to get a bit of bread, and then they are off, again, into the
   world. I counsel you in one thing to be like the elder brother, to whom
   his father said, "Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is
   yours." "Blessed are they that dwell in Your house."

   Oh, to be of David's mind--"I will dwell in the house of the Lord
   forever." Be you imitators of God, then, in so high a sense that you
   become dear children, whose one thought is how to please their father,
   whose sorrow it is to grieve Him, whose beauty it is to be like He!

   III. In the third place, I desire, dear Friends, to SUGGEST
   ENCOURAGEMENTS. Did I hear one cry, "Oh, Sir,

   this imitation of God is beyond us! How are we to be copyists of God?"
   I will encourage you by giving hints which you can work out for
   yourselves. First, God has already made you His children! I speak to
   you that are Believers--you are God's sons and daughters! The greater
   work is done! If you are to be imitators of God, as dear children, you
   must first be His children--that is already accomplished! You could not
   have made yourselves children of God, but He has done that for you.
   "Beloved, now are we the sons of God." It must be a much easier thing
   to imitate the Father than to become a

   child.

   You might adopt a child and call it your own, but you could not really
   make it your offspring, do what you might. But the Lord has "begotten
   us, again, unto a lively hope." We are "born, not of blood, nor of the
   will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." And by this new
   birth we are renewed in His image! Hence the greater part of the task,
   the insurmountable hill of difficulty, is over and that which remains
   is but our reasonable service. Should not the child imitate his father?
   Will he not do so naturally?

   Next, remember that God has given you His Nature already. Does not
   Peter speak of our being "partakers of the Divine Nature, having
   escaped the corruption which is in the world through lust"? It remains
   for you to let the new nature act after its own manner. A well of
   living water is within you, sing you unto it, "Spring up, O well." Let
   the holy thing that has been born in you now occupy the throne and
   subdue the body of this death! Pray God it may. It seems to me a small
   thing to let the new nature have scope and freedom compared with the
   giving of that nature! A clean heart and a right spirit have been
   bestowed--let these show themselves in clean lives and right feelings.
   The living and incorruptible seed will produce a harvest of good
   works--water it with your prayer and watchfulness. If anything hinders
   it, repent and do your first works.

   Next, the Lord has given you His blessed Spirit to help you. "Likewise,
   also, the Spirit helps our infirmity." Never forget that! Things
   impossible with men are possible enough to the Spirit of God. We have
   the Spirit abiding in us, vitalizing our whole nature! The most
   beautiful harp you ever saw has no music in itself, but must be struck
   by the fingers of a musician--but the Holy Spirit makes us into living
   harps, which, from themselves, pour forth a natural and spontaneous
   melody. Is not this marvelous? We have not to look abroad for power to
   be holy, for the Spirit of God abides in us and works in us, creating
   in us "the spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind." Oh, to be
   filled with the Spirit of God! Meanwhile, it is no small help in the
   imitation of God to have the anointing of the Holy One and to be
   instructed by Him. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God and, therefore,
   He can teach us to imitate God. He is also the Spirit of Holiness and
   none can better promote our holiness. Be of good cheer! With such a
   Helper you cannot be defeated!

   Again, remember, dear Friend, that the Lord allows you to commune with
   Himself. If we had to imitate a man and yet could not see him, we
   should find it hard work. But in this case we can draw near to
   God--some of us can shut the closet door and be alone with God when we
   will--we can even walk with God all day. What better conditions could
   we be under for imitating our God? Nearness to God brings likeness to
   God. The more you see God, the more of God will be seen in you. You
   remember the Persian story of the scented clay? One said to it, "Clay,
   where did you get your delicious perfume?" It answered, "I was nothing
   but a piece of common clay, but I lay long in the sweet society of a
   rose till I drank in its fragrance and became perfumed, myself."

   Oh, if you dwell much with God in seasons of retirement and abide with
   Him in all the affairs of life, you will be changed into His image! As
   surely as the type will make its impression upon the paper and the seal
   will stamp itself upon the wax, so will the Lord impress Himself upon
   you and stamp His image upon you if you dwell in Him! This ought, also,
   to inspire you with ardor to remember that you have to imitate God or
   you cannot go to Heaven, for this is one of the main delights of
   Heaven--to be like Christ because we shall see Him as He is. "They are
   without fault before the Throne of God." His name shall be on their
   foreheads--that is to say, the Character of God shall be most
   conspicuous in them. Surely that which is to be our eternal destiny
   should be our desire today! We should strive after holiness according
   to His working who works in us mightily. We must become close copyists
   of God that we may enjoy everlasting communion with Him. May His Spirit
   work us to that end.

   IV. Now, by turning our subject a little, we shall close WITH CERTAIN
   INFERENCES. I have, up to now, spoken only to saints, but here is an
   inference for seekers. "Be you imitators of God, as dear children."
   What do I infer from this? I infer that God is ready to forgive those
   who you offended Him! O you that have never been pardoned, listen to
   this-- the Lord must be ready to forgive! We are to make God our
   pattern, but if God were unwilling to forgive, He could not be a
   pattern to us! We are to be ready to pass by the offenses of others
   and, therefore, if God is set forth as our example, He must certainly
   be more ready to forgive than any of us can be!

   O you that are covered with sin, I would urge you to catch at this
   fact! Suppose I were to bid you imitate your earthly father in frankly
   and freely forgiving all who vexed him? Then you might reply, "Do you
   know my father?" If I answered, "Yes," you would say, "Is he really a
   good example of patience and forgiveness? I offended him some time ago
   and I have always been afraid to go to him, lest he should refuse to
   receive me." If I could answer, "Yes, your father is an example that
   you may safely follow in that respect," then you would reply, "I will
   go home to him and tell him that I desire his forgiveness and am sorry
   to have caused him pain."

   O poor Sinners, you do not know what a forgiving spirit the heavenly
   Father has! He gave His Son, Jesus, that He might be able to pass by
   our sins and yet be the righteous Judge of men. There have been good
   men in the world who have delighted to pass by offenses. Some here
   present have been taught of the Lord till it has become easy and
   pleasurable to overlook injuries and forget wrongs. But our heavenly
   Father is much more kind--and with far more delight blots out the
   sinner's iniquities! They said of Cramer that he was more than ready to
   forgive, for he always returned good for evil. It was a common saying,
   "Do my lord of Canterbury an ill turn and he will be your friend as
   long as you live." That was fine, but my lord of Canterbury was nothing
   in gentleness compared with the Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus
   Christ!

   The holy Leighton, also, was of such a gentle spirit that one day when
   he went out for a walk and came back, he could not get into his own
   house, for it was locked up and his servant had gone away for a day's
   fishing without leave or notice. All the good man said was, "John, next
   time you go fishing, please to let me know, or at least leave me the
   key, so that I may open the door." That was all. If even men have come
   up to such a degree of patience, much more will you find

   long-suffering in God! Oh, Trembler, believe that our Father in Heaven
   is willing to forgive you! You backsliders, you great sinners, have
   right thoughts of God and come to Him at once for reconciliation! There
   is forgiveness with Him! "He delights in mercy." "The Lord is good and
   ready to forgive."

   Christian Friends, is there one among you who thinks God will not keep
   His promise to you? Now listen. God is an example to us, therefore He
   will surely keep His Word. He must be faithful and true, for you are
   bid to copy Him. If God could be false to His Word, we could not be
   exhorted to imitate Him and, therefore, we are sure that He is faithful
   and true because we are bid to imitate Him closely. You may be sure
   that every Word of His will stand fast, for He would have us righteous
   and upright in all our ways. "God is not unrighteous to forget your
   work and labor of love which you have showed towards His name."

   Another inference--only a hint at it--is, if you are told to be
   "imitators of God, as dear children," then you may depend upon it, the
   Lord is a dear Father! The dear children of God have a dear Father! We
   may rest assured that He will be kind and tender to us, since He would
   have us loving towards Himself. I know you are heavy in spirit at this
   time. I know you are depressed and troubled, but your Father is kind
   and good. Believe it if you cannot see it. If reason says that He deals
   somewhat harshly with you, for He chastens you, remember that this is
   His way with His beloved. Has He not said, "As many as I love I rebuke
   and chasten"? Those stripes are seals of love! Chastisement is a high
   proof of wise affection! Your heavenly Father is much better to you
   than you are to Him. He is dearer, kinder and more loving as a Father
   than you have been as a child to Him. Rejoice in your Father though you
   cannot rejoice in yourself!

   Lastly, when the text says, "Be you imitators of God," it bids us keep
   on imitating Him as long as we live! Therefore I conclude that God will
   always be to us what He is. He will continue in His love since He makes
   that love the example of ours! God will persevere in bringing us home
   to Heaven, for He teaches us to persevere and make this a part of our
   likeness to Himself. The Lord will not turn His heart away from us. He
   will not fail nor be discouraged--having begun to make us meet for
   Heaven, He will never stay His hand till that work is done! Rest upon
   the immutable goodness of your Father and pray for Grace to always
   imitate Him until you come to see His face. May His Presence be with
   you and may He give you rest. Amen.

Buying Without Money

   (No. 1726)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 17, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He that has no money; come, buy, and eat." Isaiah 55:1.

   THERE is a semicolon in our translation, but we need not take notice of
   it. It should not be there, since the text is the second of two
   parallel sentences arranged according to the method of Hebrew poetry--

   "Ho, everyone that thirsts, come you to the waters, And he that has no
   money, come, buy, and eat." We have before us the figure of a merchant
   selling his wares and crying like a chapman in the market, "Ho!" To
   attract attention he calls aloud, "Come! Come! Come!" three times; and
   he adds to this the cry of, "Buy! Buy!" Shall the Great King thus liken
   Himself to a trader in the market, earnest to dispose of His goods? It
   is even so and I, therefore, call upon you to admire the mercy of the
   Lord! In the 53rd and 54th chapters, this Divine Merchantman has been
   spreading out His wares. What treasures they are! Look at the 53rd
   chapter--what do you see there?

   Behold that Pearl of great price, the Lord Jesus Christ! Behold Him
   wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities! This is
   so costly a treasure that Heaven and earth could not match it! Where
   else could we find a Sacrifice for sin, a Justifier of many? This
   Anointed One of God, upon whom the chastisement of our peace was
   laid--who would not have Him to be his Savior? Surely with such a
   treasure to display, we ought not to cry long for buyers, for every
   truly wise man will exclaim, "This is what I need! Not only a Savior,
   but a great one! An atonement for sin is the one thing necessary for
   me." To this you are invited in these words, "He that has no money,
   come, buy, and eat."

   In the 54th chapter the Divine Merchantman sets forth the rare
   possession of His everlasting love. Read from verse seven, "For a small
   moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you.
   In a little wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; but with
   everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, says the Lord your
   Redeemer. For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but
   My kindness shall not depart from you, neither shall the Covenant of My
   peace be removed, says the Lord that has mercy on you." What more can
   be set forth to win men's hearts? First, a full atonement and now, love
   everlasting, making a Covenant confirmed by oath! Should there be need,
   often, to cry, "Come and buy," when such celestial wares are displayed
   before us?

   Added to this, we see a little further on, the blessing of heavenly
   edification. Notice the 11th verse--"I will lay your stones with fair
   colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires. And I will make your
   windows of agates, and your gates of carbuncles, and all your borders
   of pleasant stones." This is a rare building, is it not? There should
   be a quick market for such an array of choice things! Sapphires and
   agates--what more would you have? Here are all manner of precious
   stones and all of these given freely! The only terms are, "everything
   for nothing! Heaven for the asking!" All the treasures of God are
   freely bestowed upon the sons of men who are willing to accept them as
   gifts of Grace!

   As if this were not enough, the Lord brings out a fourth blessing,
   namely, everlasting safety by faith--"In righteousness shall you be
   established: you shall be far from oppression; for you shall not fear:
   and from terror; for it shall not come near you. No weapon that is
   formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise
   against you in judgment you shall condemn." Security is worth
   infinitely more than gold! To be protected by Divine Wisdom from every
   possible harm is the portion of Believers in Jesus! To be saved and
   made safe forever--is not this worth worlds? Never was there a market
   like the Gospel market! And never were such wares spread out before the
   eyes of men as those which are here presented to you!

   I shall, therefore, with the more hopefulness, speak to those who have
   not yet been buyers, and urge upon you the invitation of the text, "He
   that has no money, come, buy, and eat." In handling this text we shall
   notice, first, the description of the buyer, "He that has no money."
   Secondly, the selection of this particular buyer--why is he invited be-

   yond all others? Thirdly, the invitation to purchase, "Come, buy, and
   eat." And fourthly, we shall add the assurance that this Gospel market
   is no deception, for these things are really to be had.

   I. First, then, here is A DESCRIPTION of the buyer. I believe he is
   here this morning. I hope he will recognize his own portrait, though it
   is by no means a flattering one. It is the Truth of God itself, a
   photograph taken by the sunlight of Heaven. It is the portrait of a
   poor, penniless, broken-down creature reduced to the extremity of need.
   Here it is--"He that has no money." Of course, by this is meant, among
   other things, the man who literally has no money. Among the Jews of our
   Lord's day there existed an idea that a man who had money was at a
   great advantage with regard to heavenly things, so that when the Lord
   said, "How difficult shall they that have riches enter into the
   Kingdom," they exclaimed with wonder, "Who, then, can be saved?" as if
   they thought that if the rich could not be easily saved then none could
   be.

   The Word of God contains nothing to encourage such a notion. The rich
   man is never extolled in the Old Testament, but he is often spoken of
   most slightingly. It is the glory of the Messiah that "the poor have
   the Gospel preached to them," and it is the glory of the Gospel that it
   is freely provided by the bounty of God for the beggar on the dunghill!
   Let no man's heart fail him this day because he says, "Silver and gold
   have I none." Having nothing, you may yet possess all things! You are
   at no disadvantage in God's market because your pockets are empty--you
   may come penniless and bankrupt and receive the exceeding riches of His
   Grace!

   But we understand the reference of the text to be mainly spiritual and
   so the portrait, here, is that of a man who has no spiritual money, no
   gold of goodness, no silver of sanctity--he it is that is invited to
   come and buy the wine and milk of Heaven. His fancied stock of natural
   innocence is spent. At first he thought himself to be pure as the newly
   fallen snow, forgetting the question--"How can he be clean that is born
   of a woman?" They told him that he was made "a member of Christ, a
   child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven" while he was
   yet a babe--and thus he was led to think that he had started life's
   business with a respectable stock in trade.

   He knows better now. He has seen this fancied goodness melt away like
   the mist of the morning. He has gone, like the prodigal, into the far
   country, and there he has wasted his substance till not a coin remains.
   If he searches himself through and through, he cannot find a relic of
   innocence. The whole head is sick and the whole heart faint--from the
   soles of his feet even to his head, he is all wounds, bruises and
   putrefying sores. There is no health in him. Innocence is utterly gone,
   if it was ever there. He thought that he had accumulated some little
   savings of good works, but his imaginary righteousness turned out to be
   counterfeit! Had he not been honest? Had he not been sober? Had he not
   attended a place of worship and repeated forms of prayer? Did not all
   this make up a little fortune of righteousness?

   He thought so, but then he was ignorant and deluded. He knows better
   now, for he has found out that all his righteousness is base metal--he
   could not pass a penny's worth of it in the shop of his own conscience,
   much less in the market of Heaven. He knows that it would at once be
   detected and nailed to the counter. He finds that his silver is white
   metal of the basest sort and that his gold is a sham--he has not the
   face to offer it anywhere! Yes, he is so afraid of being seized by
   justice as a counterfeiter that, like a wise man, he has hidden his
   sham righteousness in the earth and has run away from it. He is now
   more afraid of his righteousness than of his unrighteousness! He would
   think it just as possible for him to be saved by cursing and swearing
   as by the merit of his own works!

   His good works are an ill odor with his conscience, for he sees them to
   be defiled within and without with sin--a rottenness is in the bones of
   his righteousness and thus he is without merit of any sort. Look at his
   poverty--his original stock is gone and all his savings have melted
   away! He is in a still worse plight, for he is also too poor to get
   anything, the procuring power is gone, for he has "no money." Now that
   he has come to his sober senses, he would repent, but he cannot find a
   tender heart. He would believe, but he cannot find faith. He has no
   money--that is to say, nothing with which he can procure those good
   things which are necessary unto salvation and eternal life! He sees
   them all before him, like many a poor man who walks the streets of
   London and sees just what he needs behind the glass of the shop
   window--but he puts his hand into his pocket and despairingly passes
   on, for he has no money.

   As without money nothing is to be bought in the world's market, so is
   this poor man afraid that no blessing of Grace can ever be his because
   he has no good thing to offer, no righteousness to give in exchange. If
   God would sell him even a penny's worth of righteousness, he has not
   the penny to buy it! And if the Lord would pardon all his sins for one
   sixpenny worth of holiness, he has not so much as that to offer--he has
   no money! Moreover, his stock with which to trade is gone. Money makes
   money and he that has a little to begin with may soon have more--but
   this man, having no stock to start

   with--cannot hope to be rich towards God in and by himself. He cannot
   open the smallest shop, or sell the most trifling wares, for he has no
   money to start with.

   Even the poorest will buy a few matches and hawk them about the
   streets, but this poor creature has "no money" and cannot even invest a
   two-pence in goods. He has no power, even, to think aright, much less
   to act aright, so as to become pleasing to God. He is as much without
   strength as without merit. Not only is he without good, but he appears
   to himself to be without power to get good. He is a broken trader who
   cannot, again, try his fortune, for he has "no money." He is worse than
   a common beggar, for he does not even know how to beg--"We know not
   what we should pray for as we ought." He even needs to be taught how to
   beg! What a pass to come to!

   There is your portrait, my poor Friend! Do you recognize it? I hope you
   do. I hear you say, "Yes, that is myself. I am without money." Then to
   you the word of this salvation is sent--"He that has no money, come,
   buy, and eat." "No money!" Then he cannot pay his old debts. His sins
   rise up before him, but he cannot make amends for them. What a long
   file is needed to hold the record of his debts--it must be deep as the
   bottomless pit and high as Heaven! He owes 10,000 talents and has
   "nothing to pay." He has not a sliver--he has no money whatever! He is
   reduced to bankruptcy and cannot pay a farthing in the pound.

   Moreover, he cannot meet his present expenses. Poor man! He must live.
   He must eat the Bread of Heaven and he must drink of the Water of
   Life--but he has nothing with which to procure these good things. His
   soul hungers, yes, even faints after the Mercy of God, but he has no
   price with which to procure it. This day he would pluck his eyes out to
   be pleasing to God, but he has nothing to offer which the Lord could
   accept. He is reduced to such beggary that, like the prodigal, he
   cries, "I perish with hunger!" He cannot face the future. He hardly
   dares to think of it and yet the thought of it will come in. He
   remembers the needs which will surround him on a dying bed and the
   terrible demands of the Resurrection Morning when the ringing trumpet
   shall introduce him to the dread Assize and he shall stand before his
   God to render his account.

   He knows that he cannot answer Him for one sin in a thousand. He dreads
   the thought of the world to come! He has nothing with which to meet the
   demands of the eternal future. He has "no money"--nothing that will
   pass current in the Day of Judgment. He is brought to the last stage of
   spiritual destitution--poverty has come upon him like an armed man.
   This is a terrible plight to be in, yet I wish that every sinner here
   might be reduced to it, for when he is so reduced and brought low,
   Grace will come in and the tide will turn! The only hope for a man who
   has "no money" must be outside himself. It is idle for him to look into
   his own coffers--he must look away from himself--and his only chance in
   thus looking is to appeal to charity and plead for mercy's sake. He
   cannot buy--it is only God's mercy that talks about his buying--he must
   beg, he must entreat for love's sake.

   This is an essential part of spiritual poverty and I would that every
   unregenerate person knew that in him there dwells no good thing--and
   that he were convinced that he must look out and look up for
   salvation--and that upon the ground of mercy since he cannot expect to
   obtain any blessing upon the footing of justice or as a matter of debt.
   This is the man who is called to buy Heaven's wine and milk! Do you
   need a fuller picture of him? Look at the 21st verse of the 14th
   chapter of Luke's Gospel, where He that made the feast said, "Bring in
   here the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind." This man is
   so poor that he cannot buy bread, so maimed that he cannot run for it,
   so halt that he cannot stand up to receive it and so blind that he
   cannot see it! Yet such a person we are to bring into the royal banquet
   of mercy!

   If you would like another picture, turn to Revelation 3:17, 18--"You
   know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
   naked." This portrait was taken by John, who had an eagle's eye, and
   saw deep into the inward misery of the heart. To the "wretched, and
   miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked," the Lord says, "I counsel
   you to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and
   white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your
   nakedness does not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that
   you may see." Gospel riches are sent to remove our wretchedness and
   mercy to remove our misery! It is to these wretches, these blind
   beggars, these naked vagrants, that the Gospel is sent!

   This day I have to present the promise of God and the exhortation of
   mercy to those who have failed in life, who are down at the heel,
   broken and crushed. Oh, you utterly lost ones, to you is there opened a
   door of hope! The Lord has come into the market and He bids you buy of
   Him without money and without price!

   II. Now a minute or two upon the second point--THE SELECTION of the
   buyer. It is a strange choice and it leads to a singular
   invitation--"He that has no money, come, buy, and eat." In the streets
   round about this Tabernacle, especially on a Saturday evening, you may
   note the salesmen standing before their shops and crying out
   vociferously, "Buy! Buy! Buy!" No one can refuse to hear their noise,
   but if they knew that a person had no money, I think they would save
   their breath so far as he is concerned. They need ready-money customers
   and plenty of them. What would be the use of crying, "Buy! Buy!" to a
   man whose purse is empty?

   Yet these are the very persons whom the Lord selects and to them He
   cries, "Come, buy, and eat." What is the reason? Well, first, these
   need mercy the most. Oh, poor Souls, when the Lord Jesus looks on you,
   He does not look at what you have, but at what you have not! He does
   not look at your excellences, but at your necessities! He is not
   looking out for a man's fullness, but for his emptiness! The Lord Jesus
   never gave Himself for our righteousness--He "gave Himself for our
   sins." Salvation is by Grace and it is presented to those who are lost,
   for they are the people whom it will suit-- how should those who are
   not lost value salvation? I say that God selects the most
   poverty-stricken, first, because this character most needs His pitying
   love! The greatness of your necessity is that which gives you a first
   call from the God of all Grace. Not merit, but demerit! Not desert of
   reward, but desert of wrath is the qualification for mercy!

   Again, this character is chosen because he is such an one as will
   exhibit in his own person the power of Divine Grace. If the Lord Jesus
   Christ takes one that is wretched, miserable, poor, blind and
   naked--and if He satisfies all his necessities by being riches for his
   wretchedness, comfort for his misery, wealth for his poverty, eyes for
   his blindness and raiment for his nakedness, then all the world will
   see what a great Savior He is and how wonderfully His salvation meets
   the necessities of the case! If you and I were only little sinners, I
   do not see how Christ could be anything but a little Savior to us. And
   if He only met our smaller needs, a small supply would suffice. Ah,
   Friends, it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell
   and He wills that this fullness should be seen!

   When He takes a man whose needs are as large as the sea and as many as
   the sands on the shore, whose danger is deep as the bottomless pit and
   whose sin is black as Tophet's midnight--when He makes that man into a
   child of God and an heir of Heaven, ah, then all intelligences are
   amazed and cry out, "What a Savior is this! What precious blood is
   this! What a fullness this must be which satisfies such immeasurable
   needs!" As it is one end of Christ's work to glorify Divine Grace,
   therefore He calls, first, upon those who have the most need, for in
   them His Grace will be best displayed.

   Next, the Lord Jesus delights to make evident the freeness of His
   Grace. Now, if those were first called who have the money of merit, it
   might be imagined that they had paid their way. But if those are called
   who have no good thing in them, it is clear that Grace is free! When a
   poor wretch cannot do a stroke of work, or contribute a button to you,
   then your lodging him must be of pure charity and nothing else. The
   Lord Jesus is very jealous of the freeness of His Grace. He will not
   let a sixpence of our merit cross His hand lest we should glory in our
   flesh and think that we have made Jesus rich. If you ask me, yet again,
   why is he who has no money so expressly called, I would answer because
   he is the kind of man that will listen. The man who is needy is the man
   that will listen to the tidings of a full and free supply. It is the
   guilty man who loves to hear of pardon! It is the bond-slave whose ears
   are charmed with the word, "redemption."

   If you are no sinner, you will not care about a Savior. Only real
   sinners rejoice in a real atonement! The Lord sends the Gospel to every
   creature under Heaven, but He knows, as we do, that the most of men
   will not regard it, for they fancy that they don't need it--but if
   there is one that has no merit or claim, he will listen with eagerness
   to the tidings of mercy! He that has no money is the man for Christ's
   money! He that is shivering in his nakedness will rejoice to be
   clothed! A wretched sinner jumps at mercy like a hungry fish leaping at
   the bait. When a soul is empty, then it longs for the fullness of
   Christ, but not till then. Full souls quarrel over honeycombs--they are
   not sweet enough for them--but to the hungry man, even every bitter
   thing is sweet! A man who is conscious of sin will not quibble about
   the way of Grace, but if pardon is to be had, he will have it at once.
   Whoever may be silent, you will hear his voice crying aloud, "Son of
   David, have mercy on me!"

   Let me add that such an empty, penniless soul, when he does get mercy,
   will prize it and praise it. He that has been shut up in the dark for
   years values the light of the sun. He that has been a prisoner for
   months--how happy he is when the prison doors are opened and he is at
   liberty again! Let a man once get Christ, who has bitterly known and
   felt his need of Him, and he will prize Him beyond all things and find
   his sole delight in Him! The impotent man at the beautiful gate of the
   Temple, when his ankles received strength, walked away and ran, yes,
   and leaped! He leaped, praising God,

   before all the people! He could not do enough to show his delight and
   his gratitude! Oh, for a few leaping Christians! The Lord Jesus loves
   us to prize the mercy which cost Him so dearly. Shall He die on the
   Cross and give us blessings to treat with contempt? No, no! We will
   love Him much because of His priceless gifts to us.

   Therefore the Well-Beloved delights to invite those who manifestly have
   no merit and no spiritual power because He knows that when they taste
   of His love, they will overflow with praise to His name forever and
   ever! You have heard of the old woman who said that if ever she got to
   Heaven the Lord Jesus Christ should never hear the last of it? Many of
   us, by His Grace, are of that mind--we shall never praise the Lord
   sufficiently throughout eternity! If I do but once cross the golden
   threshold and stand within the pearly gate, my heart, my soul, my
   tongue shall extol my Redeemer, world without end! This shall be the
   one and only contention among the birds of Paradise--who shall sing the
   most sweetly to the praise of infinite compassion!

   None of us will yield the palm in that contest--we will see which can
   sink lowest in sense of obligation, which can rise highest in adoring
   love. Singers are needed for the celestial choirs and there are no
   voices so sweet as those which have known the force of spiritual hunger
   and thirst! These take the alto notes and sing, "Glory to God in the
   highest." In any case, be the reason what it may, it is clear that
   there are special invitations issued for the royal feasts and these are
   all directed to those whose need has reached the extremity of distress.
   But I may not linger. How I wish that I knew how to preach! I long with
   my whole heart to use great plainness of speech. I would not utter a
   single sentence which would seem to have the wisdom of words in it. I
   aim not at fine language, but only to get at poor sinners' hearts!

   Oh that I could bring the sinner to his Savior! Extravagant oratory has
   been the curse of the Christian Church--it has hidden the Cross under
   roses and taken men's minds away from Christ. To strain after eloquence
   when preaching the Gospel is a sin worthy of eternal destruction! To
   point the sinner to Christ must be our only desire! Pray for me,
   Brothers and Sisters, as I go on, for I need aid from the Holy Spirit.

   III. I have now, in the third place, to notice THE INVITATION. The man
   who has no money is to come, buy, and eat. It looks odd to tell a
   penniless man to come and buy, does it not? And yet what other words
   could be used? "Come and buy" has a meaning of its own not to be
   otherwise expressed. In buying there are three or four stages--and the
   first is desiring to have the thing which is exhibited. The man who
   buys has, first, the wish that the property in the article should be
   vested in himself. Will you not desire that Christ, that forgiveness,
   that eternal life, that salvation should become yours? Do you not long
   for the Lord to grant it to you?

   Men in the streets, as I have said before, cry, "Buy! Buy!" because
   buying means business. They are not unwilling that people should stop
   and look at their goods--they even ask them to walk in and see for
   themselves--but they aim at finding buyers and not gazers! If a man
   were to come into the shop and turn over all the goods and never
   purchase anything, the tradesman would begin to cry, "Buy! Buy!" with
   quite another accent, for he does not want a crowd to look at him--he
   wants people to buy from him! Many of you who are here this morning
   have only come to hear what the preacher has to say--and to criticize
   his style and language. I pray you rise to something better than that!
   Come, and buy! Let us do business, this morning, for God and for our
   own souls!

   Do not waste the precious market day of the Sabbath. People come and
   go. They hear sermons, read books and all for a sort of amusement--they
   do not come to do business with the Lord. Look how they select striking
   sentences and cull sparkling and delightful extracts and take notes of
   telling anecdotes! But all this is comparatively wasting time. "Come,
   buy! Buy! Buy!" Do you mean business? Then come and buy! Do not stand
   huckstering by the years together! Come to terms and make an end of
   hesitation. If you have no desire, you will not buy, and I shall effect
   no sales. Again I cry, "Come, buy, and eat." Oh that the Spirit may
   work in you that strong desire without which no man will ever buy!

   Alas, there are thousands who are always discussing knotty points, not
   because they have a wish to understand the Gospel, but because they do
   not care to come to serious dealings! Perhaps you have read the story
   of a governor of one of the American States who called at an hotel
   where there was a black waiter who was well known to hold Calvinistic
   opinions and was, therefore, made the butt for many a jest. So the
   Governor said to him, "Sam, you do not really believe that doctrine of
   election, do you?" "Deed I do, Suh," he said. "Well, then," replied the
   Governor, "tell me whether I am elect or not." "Suh," said the Negro,
   "I did not know you were a candidate and I know nothing about a man's
   being elected if he has not put up for it."

   Now, that is common sense! It is a business-like way of answering an
   absurd question. Certain people who are not even candidates for Heaven
   will yet shelter themselves behind wrong ideas of
   predestination--playing with the blessings of Grace instead of desiring
   them! Have you not seen a man with a pack stand at a door trying to
   sell a few trinkets to a servant? He does not mind half-an-hour's talk
   about his goods, but when, at last, he finds that the maid does not
   mean buying, see how he shuts up his boxes, folds up his packages and
   indignantly takes off, saying by his gestures, "I wish I had not wasted
   so much time on you." It is just so with earnest preachers! They grow
   sick at heart when they see that men will not come to business. They
   cry, "Who has believed our report?" and are anxious to carry their
   heavenly burden to another people. Oh, dear Hearers, let us not have to
   shake the dust off of our feet for a testimony against you! Oh, that
   you would hunger and thirst after Christ and His salvation--and then we
   should soon do a trade with you!

   "Buy!"--This means, next, to agree to terms, for there cannot be any
   purchasing, however much the buyer desires to buy and the seller to
   sell, till they agree to terms. Now, our difficulty with God's goods is
   this--whereas ordinarily the buyer cannot be brought up to the seller's
   price--in our case we cannot get men down to God's price. They will
   persist in offering something or other as a price. They talk to us
   thus--"I cannot be saved, for I do not see any good thing in myself.
   Sir, if I had a deep sense of need, then I could be saved." Or, "Sir,
   if I could pray better." Or, "Sir, if I had more repentance, or more
   love, I could then believe in Jesus."

   Oh, yes, if you had a price in your hand, you would pay for Heaven's
   blessings, would you not? But then, you see, they are not presented to
   you upon such terms! Price is out of the question! God's terms are that
   there shall be no terms of purchase at all--you are to be nothing--and
   Jesus is to be your All in All. When you will come down to that, then
   take the goods--the bargain is made--Eternal Life is yours! The next
   thing in a purchase is that when the terms are carried out, the buyer
   appropriates the goods to himself. If I buy a thing, it is mine, and I
   take it into my possession. You do not see a man buy a thing and then
   leave it behind him for the seller to do as he likes with it, do you?

   In the things of God you are to appropriate the blessing to yourself.
   Put out the hand of faith and say, "Here is Christ for a sinner. I am a
   sinner and I take Christ to be my Savior. Here is washing for the
   filthy. I am filthy and I wash. Here is a robe of righteousness for the
   naked. I am naked, I take the raiment to be mine." Make Christ your own
   and He has made you His own! Take the Lord by an appropriating act of
   faith to be yours forever and the bargain is struck! But the text says
   a little more than that--it says, "Buy, and eat," as much as to say,
   "Make it yours in the most complete sense." If a man buys a loaf of
   bread it is his, but if he eats it, then all the lawyers in the world
   cannot dispute him out of it--he has it by a possession which is not
   only nine points of the law, but all the law!

   When a poor soul has confidence enough to take Christ and to live upon
   Him as his own, saying, "This Christ is able to save me. I take Him
   into me and I am saved," why, the devil, himself, cannot unsave him!
   What is to divide him from Christ? There is the bath and I wash in it
   and am clean! What then? Who can obliterate the fact that I have
   washed? The righteousness of Christ is bestowed upon me and put on by
   me--who can tear off that glorious dress? Christ fed upon is ours
   beyond all question. No method of possession is more sure and safe than
   that of eating what you have bought. Feed, then, on Christ, the Bread
   of Heaven, and though you are, in yourself, the poorest of the poor,
   yet He is yours forever and ever!

   See, then, the blessed invitation--the whole of God's mercy in
   Christ--infinite love and boundless compassion are to be had for no
   price at all! They are freely given to every man who has no money with
   which to procure them! The height of love meets the depths of poverty
   and fills them up. He that has nothing is invited to have all things,
   for he is the person for whom they were provided in the eternal
   purposes of God.

   IV. I conclude now by saying a few things by way of ASSURANCE, to show
   that this is all real and true, and no make-believe. Every needy,
   thirsty soul may have, this day, all the Grace of God! Oh, if the
   Spirit of God makes him willing, he shall have all the blessings of the
   Covenant of Grace to be his own forever and ever! This is no
   sham--there is an honest offer made to everyone who is conscious of
   soul-poverty! For, first, it is not God's way to mock men. He has,
   Himself, declared, "I said not unto the seed of Jacob, seek you My face
   in vain." God has not said one thing in one place and another in
   another to contradict Himself!

   He has not, in the Scriptures, bid men come to Him with the promise
   that He will not cast them out, all the while meaning of some of them
   that He will cast out! No, there are no exceptions made in the promises
   of God to empty sinners who come to Him! You must not dream of
   exceptions, which do not exist. Jesus says, "He that comes to Me, I
   will in no

   wise cast out," and this includes all who come. I am speaking to some,
   this morning, who have come across the Atlantic and are not yet
   saved--you may have been careless and thoughtless all your lives--but
   if you come to Jesus Christ, this morning, He will not refuse you His
   salvation!

   Many have come in from the country, today--oh, that this may become
   their spiritual birthday! Come to the Lord Jesus Christ, my Friend, and
   He will welcome you! He has never rejected one and He never will! He
   will not find pleasure in tantalizing you. He is too good, too true to
   become a deceiver even to one poor lonely seeker! His Word of promise
   to you is true and real--every word is full of meaning--sweeter meaning
   than you dream of! Grace shall be had by you at once if you will but
   take it "without money and without price." Men mock men, but God never
   deludes. We may say of Him, "Your word is Truth."

   Note that these mercies must be really meant to be given free to the
   poor because God is under no necessity to sell His benefits. He is not
   impoverished! He is so rich that none can add anything to His wealth.
   All things are His, therefore He must give freely since it would be
   beneath His all-sufficiency to be chauffeuring for compensation, or
   demanding a price at a creature's hands. He means the penniless to have
   everything for nothing, since nothing can be imagined to be a price to
   Him! If a poor tradesman began to give away his goods, you would say,
   "There is some trick about this." But when the Most High God, the
   possessor of Heaven and earth--WHO HAS EVERYTHING--freely gives to us,
   then there can be no design for His own advantage! His motive must be
   pure compassion!

   There is no adequate price that we could bring to God for His mercy.
   How could there be? Would it be mercy if it could be bought? Grace is
   without price because it is priceless! You can buy gold if you
   will--there is some medium of exchange for the purchase of every finite
   thing--but what medium of exchange could there be for the purchase of
   infinite blessings? Huge heaps of such things as the native Africans
   call money would be of no value to us--and what self-righteous men call
   merit is utterly despicable to God! Is there any comparison between a
   man's giving all his wealth and the possession of eternal Glory? No
   comparison can be instituted between carnal and spiritual joys!

   As you cannot bring any price, I pray you believe that God is honest
   when He declares that He will give you pardon of sin and all the
   blessings of His Grace without money and without price. You cannot have
   them otherwise! Believe that He means you to receive them by Grace!
   Remember that Jesus must be meant for sinners, for if sinners had not
   existed there never would have been a Savior. When the Lord Jesus
   Christ set up in business to save, He must have known that there was no
   sphere for His operations except among sinners and, therefore, He
   entered in His office with the view of saving sinners. If a doctor
   comes into a town and there is nobody ill--and it is certain that
   nobody ever will be ill--he had better drive off somewhere else! He
   will do most business where there is most sickness.

   When Christ Jesus became a Soul-Physician, He had His eyes on the
   spiritually sick and on them, alone. They are the patients who make up
   His practice and they, only. If, then, you are sick even unto death,
   put your case into the hands of Christ, for He will heal you! Remember,
   too, that it must be true that God will give these blessings to men who
   have no merits--and will bestow them as gifts--because Jesus, Himself,
   is a Gift! Did anybody ever dream of buying Christ? Stand at the foot
   of the Cross and say to yourself, "Could I ever have procured this vast
   display of love by any merit of my own? Could I have done anything
   which could have merited that the Son of God should become Man and,
   being found in fashion as a man, He should die such a death as this for
   me?"

   Salvation must be a gift, for Jesus is a Gift! Away with your
   sacraments, your ceremonies, your prayers, your alms, your good works!
   If these are made the brass penny with which you hope to buy such
   inestimable things as pardon, son-ship, Heaven--forget it! Salvation is
   seen to be such when it is given to those who have no money of their
   own. Beside that, Christ is All in All. Men have no notion what Christ
   is when they talk of getting ready for Christ, or bringing something to
   Him. What would you bring to Christ? Everything is in Christ and,
   therefore, you cannot bring anything to Him. "Oh, but," you say, "I
   must come with a broken heart." I tell you, no! You must go to Christ
   for a broken heart! "Oh, but I must come with a sense of need." I tell
   you that a true sense of need is His work in you! True repentance and a
   sense of need spring from His Grace--you must get them from Him without
   money and without price.

   "Ah, but I must be something." Say, rather, you must be nothing! We
   cannot drill this into men's brains! No, if we were to use steam power
   to work upon the mind, we could not get this thought fixed in their
   proud hearts! They will cling to merit! They must be something, feel
   something, say something, do something! Away with your somethings!
   Subside into nothingness! The Spirit of God brooded, of old, over
   chaos, so that order was clearly His work--and when the

   mind seems to be all chaos and darkness, then the Spirit of God is sure
   to work--and the Lord's voice is heard, saying, "Let there be light!"
   Go to the Lord Jesus just as you are! You will never be better--you may
   be worse! Go NOW, just as you are, to Jesus, and buy and eat without
   money, means, or merit!

   One thing more I would say, and that is the Gospel of Jesus Christ is
   blessedly free from all clogging conditions because all supposed
   conditions are supplied in Christ Jesus. We have heard of men
   advertising to give things away, but when you read the advertisement,
   carefully, you find that you are to pay, after all. The Gospel is not
   so! Its freedom is real! Many a good thing is to be had, but when you
   see how it is to be obtained, you say to yourself, "the conditions shut
   me out." But the conditions of Eternal Life shut no man out who needs
   to be saved and wills to be saved. Over the gate of Heaven is written,
   "Come, and welcome."

   But you remind me that it says, "Buy," and you insist upon it that,
   therefore, you must pay. Not so! Salvation is already paid for--all the
   paying has been done by Him who opened His veins to find the only price
   that is current in Heaven--the sin-atoning blood! If price may be
   spoken of--that price was all paid long before you were born-- the
   purchasing work was done nearly 1,900 years ago on Calvary's Cross!
   Jesus bowed His head and said, "It is finished." Will you add to that
   which is finished? Will you tag on your rags to the Lord's glistering
   cloth of gold and add your base farthings to the infinite price which
   He poured forth so lavishly at the foot of the Eternal Throne? Oh,
   don't do it!

   To yoke you with Christ can never be! You and Christ together? An
   archangel and an ant would make a better pair than you yoked with
   Christ! No, my Friend, sink, sink, sink--by a mighty descent sink to
   nothing--and let Jesus rise, rise, rise, till He fills the whole
   horizon of your thoughts and hopes, for then are you saved! Let us
   sing--

   "'Tis done! The great transaction's done! I am my Lord's and He is
   mine! He drew me, and I followed on, Charmed to confess the voice
   Divine."

The Voice from the Cloud and the Voice of the Beloved

   (No. 1727)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 24, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "While He yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and
   behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is My beloved Son, in
   whom I am well pleased; hear Him. And when the disciples heard it, they
   fell on their faces, and were afraid. And Jesus came and touched them,
   and said, Arise, and be not afraid." Matthew 17:5, 6, 7.

   IT is exceedingly important to have clear evidences of the truth of our
   holy religion. Sometimes, I dare say, you have wished that God would
   speak out of Heaven in your hearing, or that He would work some
   extraordinary marvel before your eyes, that you might know beyond all
   question the truth of the Gospel of Jesus. This desire for signs and
   wonders is no new thing. Ah, my dear Friends, we know not what we ask,
   nor what we desire, for if such a voice were to come to us out of a
   bright cloud--we are made of the same flesh and blood as Peter, James
   and John, and it would, therefore, produce the same effect upon us as
   upon them--we would fall on our faces and be sorely afraid.

   Spirituals must grow out of spirituals--saving faith can never be
   produced by carnal sight and hearing. The Holy Spirit can work faith in
   us apart from any form of miracle and, miracle, alone, can never create
   a spiritual faith. Do we wish to receive a sign in order to confirm our
   belief in God? Suppose that we had it--we would soon need to have it
   repeated, for unbelief dies hard. I cannot tell how often we should
   need to hear the voice out of the cloud, but certainly life would soon
   become a misery to us, for we should be so frequently lying on our
   faces, so often cast into a swoon of fear, that we should be shattered,
   nervous and incapable of the ordinary duties of life! Like Israel at
   Sinai, we would begin to entreat that the Lord would not speak to us
   any more!

   The fact is that the voice of God, as absolute God, is too awful, too
   majestic for mortal ears--and the sight of overwhelming miracles would
   put such a strain upon the human mind that it is better for us to be
   without them. It is plain from the example of Israel in the wilderness
   that even the lowest form of Grace does not grow out of frequent
   miracles, for the tribes fell into every form of evil, though they
   lived on miracles--and even ate and drank the result of them! Not signs
   and wonders on the outside, but a new heart within is the grand cure
   for unbelief! Christ in you is the hope of Glory and the death of
   doubt--anything else will fall short of your need.

   According to our text, what is needed is not an audible voice of God to
   confirm the evidences of our religion, but the touch and the voice of
   Christ to make us conscious within ourselves of the power of Him to
   whom God bears witness. Not external, but internal evidences are what
   we need! The best evidences in the world are what we call
   experimental--such as grow out of actual experience. It is a better
   thing for a man to live near to Christ and to enjoy His Presence, than
   it would be for him to be overshadowed with a bright cloud and to hear
   the Divine Father, Himself, speaking out of it! The voice out of the
   cloud would but dismay and distract--the voice of Christ would cheer
   and comfort and, at the same time, would be an equally powerful
   assurance to us of the divinity of the whole matter. Assurance is the
   thing which we so much desire and we can better obtain it by personal
   test than by any external witness.

   Brothers and Sisters, the most profitable thing for me, at any rate, is
   not so much to study evidences or to seek them, as to enjoy the Gospel,
   itself, by personal contact with the Christ of God. You may be told
   that this is the Bread of Heaven, but you will not know it, however
   heavenly the voice, one half so vividly as if you eat thereof and live!
   Then shall you know when Jesus touches you and bids you, "Be not
   afraid." A miraculous interposition would crush as well as convince. A
   spiritual visitation and a consoling word will convince as certainly
   and it will comfort at the same time! The verses which I have selected
   seem to me to teach us just this--that even the voice of God, the
   Father, would need to be supplemented by the voice and by the touch of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Son, or else we would not be so
   assured as to become active witnesses for Gospel truth.

   To preach Christ we must hear Christ! No other voice will suffice
   unless He speak to us. This morning I propose to treat the subject
   thus--first, let us hear the voice out of the cloud. And then,
   secondly, let us hear the voice of Jesus. May the Holy Spirit sweetly
   enable us to listen diligently in each case.

   I. First, LET US LISTEN TO THE VOICE THAT SPEAKS OUT OF THE CLOUD.
   Observe at the outset the words, "Behold, a bright cloud overshadowed
   them." When God draws near to man, it is absolutely necessary that His
   Glory should be veiled. No man can see His face and live. Therefore the
   cloud, in this instance, and in other cases. Hence that thick veil
   which hung over the entrance to the Most Holy Place. Hence the need of
   the incense to fill that place with smoke when the High Priest once a
   year went within the veil. Hence above all, the need of the Body and
   the Manhood of Christ that the Godhead may be softened to our view.

   God shines graciously through the Man and we behold the brightness of
   the Father's Glory without being blinded. There must be a cloud. Yet it
   was a bright cloud, which, in this case, yielded the shadow and not a
   thick darkness like that which became the canopy of Deity at the giving
   of the Law. Then Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke and the Lord sat
   enthroned in thick darkness. On other occasions we read, "He made
   darkness His secret place; His pavilion round about Him were dark
   waters and thick clouds of the skies." But now on Tabor, where God
   bears peaceful witness to His well-beloved Son, He veils Himself in a
   brightness significant of His good pleasure towards the sons of men!

   There were but three who saw this glory of the Transfiguration and
   heard the Father's voice. Such signs are not for unholy eyes and ears.
   Three were sufficient to bear complete witness, for "the testimony of
   two men is true" and, "in the mouth of two or three witnesses the whole
   shall be established." It is not necessary that you and I, therefore,
   should see the transfigured Savior--the fact of the Transfiguration is
   quite as sure as if we did see it, for three men saw it of whose
   truthfulness we have no question. It is not necessary that these ears
   should hear the attesting words of the Divine Father, for those three
   Apostles heard Him speak and they bore witness thereof by their honest
   lives and martyr deaths.

   We know that their witness is true and to us, today, there is an
   absolute certainty of belief that the Lord God Almighty did, with an
   audible voice, declare Jesus of Nazareth to be His Son, in whom He is
   well pleased. The testimony of honest men is all that we can have about
   most things and we are accustomed to accept it and act thereon. In this
   case we may be as sure as if we had been there, ourselves, and had seen
   and heard! It is a very instructive fact that the utterance of God out
   of the cloud was made up of words out of Scripture. We are told, "If
   any man speaks, let Him speak as the oracles of God." And what honor
   has the Father put upon Holy Scripture here! He did but utter three
   brief sentences and each of them might be called a quote!

   The Lord God is the master of language, for He is the creator of
   tongues! He need not, therefore, confine Himself to language used by
   Prophets and Seers in the volume of Inspiration. But because He did so
   in this instance we conclude that He intended to put special honor upon
   the Words of Scripture. The occasion was most august, yet no better
   words are needed by the Lord, Himself, concerning His own Son than
   those recorded in former ages in the pages of Holy Writ! First, the
   Father said, "This is My beloved Son." Turn to Psalm 2:7 and there you
   read, "You are My Son." Then the Father said, "In whom I am well
   pleased." Look at Isaiah 42:1 and there you will read of our Lord that
   He is called, "My elect, in whom My soul delights." This passage is
   quoted in Matthew 12:18 in a rather different form--"In whom My soul is
   well pleased," thus showing how nearly the words agree in all respects.

   Then comes the last word, "Hear Him," which is a repetition of
   Deuteronomy 18:15, where Moses says, "The Lord your God will raise up
   unto you a Prophet from the midst of you, of your brethren, like unto
   me; unto Him you shall listen." Or, as Stephen puts it, "Him shall you
   hear." The words of Moses are as much imperative as prophetic and
   contain the sense--"hear Him." So that this voice of the Lord utters
   three Bible phrases and surely, if the Lord speaks in the language of
   Scripture, how much more should His servants? We preach best when we
   preach the Word of God! We may be confident in what we say when we
   preach the Truths of God in the words which the Holy Spirit teaches and
   endeavor to convey the mind of the Holy Spirit in His own words.

   I take it that the Scripturalness of the Divine Witness is noteworthy
   and full of instruction. Coming to the words, themselves, the Father
   said, "This is My beloved Son." "This." As if He called their attention
   away from Moses and Elijah and said, "This is He of whom I speak to
   you. He is above the Law and the Prophets, He is My Son." There was a
   question among the Jews who the Messiah would be--they believed in the
   Messiah, but they did not know when He would come, nor where, nor
   how--and, therefore, when He did come, they made a mistake and missed
   Him. Here the great Fa-

   ther points to Jesus of Nazareth, who is the son of Mary as to His
   flesh and He says, "This is My beloved Son." It is a word of
   demonstration and distinction by which He marks Jesus out from all
   others as His own nearest and dearest One.

   By this He also points Him out as being present then and there--not as
   yet to come, but as actually with them-- their Master and Friend. "This
   is My beloved Son." It is not a finger pointing into history, but a
   hand laid upon the true Messiah, who, in very flesh and blood, stood
   before them, of whom they afterwards said, "We were eyewitnesses of His
   majesty. For He received from God the Father honor and glory, when
   there came such a voice to Him from the excellent Glory, This is My
   beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from
   Heaven we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount." In this very
   place, upon this Tabor, Jesus stood among them, and the Father pointed
   Him out, saying, "This is My beloved Son." They could make no mistake
   whatever about the Person--the Word of the Lord so distinctly pointed
   Him out.

   While it thus pointed Him out personally as being present, it separated
   Him from all others and set Him apart by Himself as the sole and only
   One. "This is My beloved Son," and no one else may claim that title.
   Truly, other sons are the Lord's by adoption and regeneration, but none
   are such in the sense in which the Lord said, "This is My beloved Son."
   Beyond all others and in a special sense, He is, "the only-begotten
   Son." "Unto which of the angels said He at any time, You are My son,
   this day have I begotten you?" We do not understand, we cannot
   understand the doctrine of the Eternal Affiliation of the Son of God. I
   suppose it to be well-high profane to endeavor to look into that
   sublime mys-tery--a holy delicacy forbids and, besides, the Glory is
   too bright! We lack the eyes which could perceive anything in such a
   blaze of light.

   This, however, we may observe, namely, that Jesus is not the Son of God
   so that the idea exactly tallies with sonship among men, for He is
   co-equal and co-eternal with the Father--and He is, Himself, called,
   "The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father." He is not of fewer years than
   the Father, for, "in the beginning was the Word." Concerning this
   matter we may sing--

   "Your generation who can tell, Or count the number of Your years?" Yet,
   doubtless, sonship is the nearest approach to the great mystery which
   could be found among human similitudes and the word, "Son," is the
   nearest description that could be given in human language. Hence the
   Father, looking at Jesus and at none other besides Him, says of Him and
   of Him, only, "This is My beloved Son." He says, "I proceeded forth and
   came from God." He is, "the only-begotten Son," which is in the bosom
   of the Father. Oh, dear Friends, how we ought to fix our gaze upon
   Jesus! His is a most singular personality, the wonder of wonders, for
   He is Son of God as truly as He is Son of Man! Verily, He is Man and we
   err not when we think so of Him, for He both suffered and died! Yet
   verily He is God, for He lives forever and ever and upholds all things
   by the word of His power!

   "This is My Son." Moses and Elijah were His servants--only Jesus was
   His Son. By His being thus called, Son, we are taught that Jesus is of
   the same Nature as God--is, indeed, God. A man is the father of a man;
   a man is not the father of that which he makes with his own hands, such
   as a statue or a painting. But a man is the father of another who is of
   the same nature as himself--and the Lord Jesus Christ is of the same
   Nature as God in all respects--a true Son. The Lord Jesus Christ is
   equal in Nature to the Father and, therefore, He counts it not robbery
   to be equal with God and He receives the same honor and worship as the
   Father, as says the Scripture, "that all men should honor the Son even
   as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the
   Father which has sent Him."

   A son bears the likeness of his father and assuredly the Lord Jesus is
   described as "the brightness of His Father's Glory and the express
   image of His Person," so that He said, Himself, "He that has seen Me
   has seen the Father." "He is the image of the invisible God." In Him is
   the Godhead better seen than in all the works of creation. Not only is
   there a likeness between them, but there is a perpetual union--"I and
   My Father are One." "I am in the Father," said Christ, "and the Father
   is in Me." This leads to continual communion with each other and a
   participation in plans and designs. "The Son can do nothing of Himself,
   but what He sees the Father do: for what things soever He does, these
   also does the Son, likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows Him
   all things that He does."

   The Lord Jesus was forever in the bosom of the Father and He says, "All
   things are delivered unto Me of My Father: and no man knows the Son,
   but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and He
   to whomever the Son will reveal Him." It was with the Son of God that
   the Father took counsel when He said, "Let Us make man in Our

   own image, after Our likeness." Our Lord knows and reveals the inmost
   heart of the Father. Yes, the Being and Essence of God, unknown to all
   besides, are with Him, for He, Himself, is "God over all, blessed
   forever, Amen." Let us never, Brothers and Sisters, think of the Lord
   Jesus without the lowliest reverence of Him as very God of very God,
   co-equal, co-eternal with the Father!

   While we call Him Master and Lord, let us take care that we render unto
   Him the glory which is due unto His name. There must be no trifling
   with Him, nor with the things which He speaks, for He is Lord of All
   and to Him every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that He
   is Lord to the glory of God the Father. For a minute let me dwell upon
   this declaration. "This is My Son." Does it not teach us the great love
   of God to us guilty creatures? "He spared not His own Son." You
   perceive the love of Abraham to God when he is ready to offer up Isaac
   at the Lord's bidding. Remember the words, "Take now your son, your
   only son, Isaac, whom you love, and offer Him for a burnt offering."
   This is just what the great Father did for us! And yet we were His
   enemies, living in alienation and in open rebellion against Him.

   Hear, O heavens, and wonder, O earth! He spared not His own Son, but
   freely delivered Him up for us all! "Herein is love, not that we loved
   God, but that God loved us, and sent His Son to be the Propitiation for
   our sins." What gratitude this should create! What devotion it should
   bring! "This is My Son." When you see Jesus on Tabor or on Calvary, you
   see God giving Himself to us, that we might not perish, but have
   everlasting life. Does the Father say, "This is My Son"? What a Savior
   this must be! How confidently may you and I trust Him! If the Lord
   Jesus Christ is no common person, but nothing less than God, Himself,
   who shall doubt His power to save? If He is God's only-begotten Son,
   how safely we may trust our souls' affairs in His almighty hands! He
   is, indeed, "a Savior, and a great one!" "It pleased the Father that in
   Him should all fullness dwell."

   What an Intercessor we have! So dear to Him with whom He pleads, for He
   is His beloved Son! What a Sacrifice we have that may cover all our
   sin, for, "He gave Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God,
   for a sweet smelling savor." However black our sin and however deep our
   despair, we may readily rise out of it and say, "Verily, there is
   salvation here!" If the Son of God has made His own Person the price of
   our redemption, then we are, indeed, redeemed, and none can hold us in
   bondage! One thing more is worthy to be noted here. If the Father says,
   "This is My Son," observe the graciousness of our adoption!

   With such a Son, the Lord had no need of children! He did not make us
   His children because He needed sons and daughters, but because we
   needed a Father. The infinite heart of the Father was well filled by
   the love of the Only-Begotten. There was enough in Jesus to satisfy the
   love of the Divine Father and yet He would not rest till He had made
   Him "the firstborn among many brethren." Herein we ought to exceedingly
   admire the Grace of God. "Behold what manner of love the Father has
   bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God." When a man
   is childless and desires an heir, it may be that he adopts a child to
   fill the vacancy which exists in His house. But the heavenly Father had
   no such need, for He says, "This is My beloved Son." Our adoption is,
   therefore, not for His gain, but for ours--it is a matter of Divine
   charity, arising out of the spontaneous love of God. Thanks be unto the
   Father evermore!

   Do you remind me that I have left out one word? The Father said, "This
   is My beloved Son." I have by no means forgotten it, for though I
   cannot speak as I would upon that word, yet it is exceedingly sweet in
   my ears. "This is My beloved Son." We, none of us, know how much
   beloved our Lord is of the Father. We love our children--we love them
   as our own souls--we could not measure our affection for them. But we
   are finite and so are our children! And the finite to the finite yields
   but a finite love. But here is an Infinite Father with an Infinite Son
   and He loves Him infinitely! Why should He not? He is most near to
   Him--His own Son! Why should He not? He is in all things like onto Him
   in nature, dignity, character, and glory. Why should He not? For He in
   all things does His will. Jesus said, "And He that sent Me is with Me:
   the Father has not left Me alone; for I do always those things that
   please Him."

   If we had such a son as God has in Jesus, then we should love him,
   indeed, for there has been nothing in the Son throughout eternity which
   is in the least opposed to the Father's mind. These are wonderful words
   of the Man, Christ Jesus--"Therefore does My Father love Me, because I
   lay down My life, that I might take it again." When Solomon speaks of
   wisdom, which is but another name for our Lord Jesus, he represents Him
   as saying, "The Lord possessed Me in the beginning of His way, before
   His works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or
   ever the earth was. When He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters
   should not pass His commandment: when He appointed the

   foundations of the earth: then I was by Him, as one brought up with
   Him: and I was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him."

   He has been in the bosom of the Father from of old and when He left the
   bosom of the Father it was to do His Father's will and to be obedient
   to Him even unto death! His will and His Father's will are perfectly
   joined together in one spirit and, therefore, we cannot fathom the
   depths of love which are indicated in these words which came from the
   Father who Himself is Love! He, looking at His own Son, says plainly,
   "This is My beloved Son." Oh that we might have Grace to trust without
   wavering in this glorious Son of God!

   Permit me, now, to introduce to you the second of the sentences--"In
   whom I am well pleased." I have heard it quoted, "With whom I am well
   pleased." The alteration cannot be tolerated--it robs the language of
   half its sense. True, God is pleased with Christ, but that is not all
   that He says here. He is pleased in Him, which means not only that God
   is eternally, infinitely pleased with Jesus Christ, Himself, but that
   God, Himself, is reconciled and pleased as we view Him in His Son. I
   thought this over last night till my heart seemed ready to dance for
   joy, for I thought--"Then, however much I have displeased the Father,
   my Lord Jesus, who stands for me, has pleased Him more than I have
   displeased Him! Mine is finite sin, but His is infinite righteousness!
   If my sins have vexed the Lord God, yet Christ's righteousness has
   pleased Him more. I cannot be more than finitely displeasing to God,
   but Jesus is infinitely pleasing to Him--and if He stands in my place,
   then the pleasure which the Father derives from His Son is greater than
   the displeasure which He has ever felt towards me."

   My Brothers and Sisters, how displeased the great God has been with
   men. He said that it repented Him that He had made men upon the earth.
   That was a striking expression which is used in Genesis 6:6--"It
   grieved Him at His heart." He seemed to grow so weary of man's wanton
   wickedness that He was sorry that He ever made beings capable of so
   much evil. Yet He is so well content with His beloved Son, who has
   assumed our Nature, that we read of Him, "The Lord is well pleased for
   His righteousness' sake: He will magnify the Law and make it honorable"
   (Isa. 42:21). The Lord looks down upon those who are in Christ with an
   intense affection. He loves them even as He loves the Son, for that is
   the meaning of this word, "In whom I am well pleased."

   All who are in Christ Jesus are pleasing to God! Yes, God in Christ
   looks with Divine satisfaction upon all those who trust His Son--He is
   not only pleased, but well pleased. If you are pleased with Jesus, God
   is pleased with you! If you are in the Son, then you are in the
   Father's good pleasure. Out of Christ there is nothing but Divine
   displeasure for you. Concerning you who are out of Christ, it is
   written, "The Lord will take vengeance on His adversaries." Who can
   stand before His indignation? Who can abide the fierceness of His
   anger? God cannot look on sin without hatred! He says of sinners, "My
   soul loathed them, and their souls also abhorred Me." There is no peace
   between a Christless soul and God, neither can there be.

   But when a poor sinner, by faith, enters into Christ, then such is the
   Father's delight in Christ's Person, that He delights in all that are
   in Him. Jesus said, "The Father Himself loves you." God is pleased with
   every hair of Christ's head--the meanest member of Christ's body is
   delightful to the Father! If I am pleased with a man, I am not angry
   with his foot or with any part of him. So, then, if I am a member of
   Christ, if I am joined to Him by a living, loving, lasting union, then
   I am well pleasing to God, because Jesus is well pleasing to Him!
   Indeed, the Scripture speaks of all saints as one with Christ--they are
   so perfectly joined to Him that they are one body with Him--and God has
   no hatred to some part of the body and love to another part of it. Is
   Christ divided? It cannot be! The Father is well pleased with the
   entire mystical body for the sake of Jesus Christ its Head.

   I wish I could speak at length upon this, but I might weary you upon
   this close and sultry day, when your spirit truly is willing but your
   flesh is weak. Oh, the charm of this voice of God! Each word has a
   Divine emphasis upon it. It is not the voice of man, but of the
   Eternal, Himself. "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
   Consider, next, the third word, which is, "Hear Him." Listen to what He
   says; remember it carefully; endeavor to understand it; heartily accept
   and believe it; confidently trust in it and cheerfully obey it. All
   these precepts are wrapped up in the expression "Hear Him" as we could
   prove if there were time available. "Hear Him"--it is as if the Father
   said, "You need not hear Moses any longer--hear Him. You need not
   listen to Elijah any more--hear My Son."

   There are thousands of priests in the world who say, "Hear us." But the
   Father says, "Hear Him." Many voices clamor for our attention--new
   philosophies, modern theologies and old heresies revived--all call to
   us and entreat us to

   listen, but the Father says, "Hear Him." As if He said, "Hear Him and
   no one besides." Does any man claim to be a successor of Christ? The
   Father speaks of no succession, but bids us, " Hear Him." If Jesus were
   dead and His prophetic office extinct, we might hear others, but since
   He lives, we hear the celestial voice rolling along the ages and
   distinctly crying, "Hear Him." Beloved Brothers and Sisters, do not
   hear me as though I spoke of myself, for I have no more claim upon your
   attention than any other man. I speak faultily, for I know but in part
   and prophesy in part.

   So far as I speak my own mind, I speak in vanity! But if I speak the
   words of Christ and the Truth of God which the Spirit of God has
   revealed, then it is no longer I that speak, but Christ, Himself, that
   speaks--and then you are bound by the Word from the Father, which says,
   "Hear Him." Oh, to be content with hearing Christ and letting other
   voices go away into eternal silence! Is He God's Son? Then "hear Him!"
   Is He God's beloved Son? Then "hear Him!" Is the Father well pleased
   with Him? Then "hear Him!" Is the Father well pleased in Him, and with
   you in Him? Then "hear Him!" What less can you do? Ought you not to do
   this always and with all your might? Peter, you need not build the
   taberna-cles--the Father bids you hear Jesus, your Lord!

   It is better to hear Christ, that is, to believe His teaching and obey
   it, than it would be to build cathedrals for Him, much more such frail
   tents as Peter intended. Peter, you need not cumber yourself with much
   serving and play the Martha--you will do better if you sit at His feet
   with Mary and hear Him! The highest honor we can render to Christ as a
   Prophet is to hear Him, trusting Him in His promises and obeying Him in
   His precepts! Jesus came on purpose to teach--and we are in our best
   position for adoration when we lend Him our ears and hearts--and are
   determined to believe what He says and to do what He commands! "This is
   My beloved Son; hear Him."

   It seems to me as if the great Father said, "I have spoken to you once,
   with My own voice, and I see you fall upon your faces with fear.
   Evidently you cannot bear My immediate Presence. I see your faces white
   with fright; you lie prone upon the ground, stiff with dismay: I will
   speak no more directly from Myself; I have made My beloved Son your
   Mediator; hear Him." The Psalmist David said, "The voice of the Lord is
   powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty. The voice of the
   Lord shakes the wilderness; the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh."
   Is it not gracious on His part that He should no more speak with us,
   Himself, but reveal Himself by His Son, whose name is, "The Word of
   God"?

   Remember what Israel said at Sinai to Moses, the typical
   mediator--"Speak with us and we will hear; but let not God speak with
   us, lest we die." To this the Lord replied to Moses, "They have well
   said all that they have spoken." The Lord recognized at once the need
   of a mediator and He finds us One in the Person of the Well-Beloved as
   He says, "Hear Him." It is like Pharaoh saying to those who came for
   corn, "Go to Joseph." This day God says to men, "Come not to Me at
   first--go to My Son. No man comes to the Father but by Jesus Christ His
   Son. I will not speak with you, for you are but dust and ashes, and you
   would be overwhelmed by the thunder of My voice. Hear HIM!"

   Blessed ordinance of that gracious One who knows our frame and
   remembers that we are dust! He has spoken to us by His Son! Let us
   incline our ears and come to Him. Let us hear that our soul may live.
   This links the first part of my discourse to the second, upon which I
   will speak as briefly as I can, though the subject might well demand a
   full sermon.

   II. Secondly, LET US HEAR THE VOICE OF JESUS. The Father Himself has
   sent us to Jesus and unto Jesus let us go. "When the disciples heard
   it, they fell on their faces, and were afraid. And Jesus came and
   touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid." Dear Friends, I
   think you will be cured of desiring miracles and of wishing to hear
   voices from God, if you well consider the effect of the Divine voice
   upon these favored Apostles. You could not hear the Divine voice any
   better than they could, if, indeed, as well. I hope that you will now
   be content with what the Father recommends to you--namely, that you
   hear His beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord!

   The Apostles, one would have thought, needed not to have been afraid,
   for they were holy men engaged in the best possible business--and in
   the company of their Lord who was their Protector and Friend! And yet
   such is the amazing power of the Glory of God upon the human mind that
   they fell on their faces! So was it with Job, Daniel, Isaiah, Habak-kuk
   and all such holy men--the Presence of the Lord filled them with fear,
   trembling and self-abhorrence! See how Jesus acts to His three
   disciples. We might have thought that they would have hastened to their
   Lord. Why didn't they? Why didn't they cry out to Him, "Master, we
   perish"? Why didn't Peter say, as he did on another occasion, "If it is
   You, bid me come unto You"?

   No, they are overpowered, bewildered, confused--the Glory of the Lord
   has laid them on their faces as dead, and they are terribly frightened!
   Then the Incarnate God, their Lord and yet their Brother, interposes
   His sacred ministry.

   First, He comes to them. Wycliffe's version puts it, "He came near." He
   approached them, for any distance is painful when a heart is afraid.
   Jesus came near to the frightened three. This is the beauty of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, that He comes so near to us, poor troubled ones, when we
   are overwhelmed with the Glory of God and our own sense of sin! "The
   man is near of kin unto us: one of our next kinsmen." God, the
   Glorious, must always be far off as to our weakness, however near He
   comes to us in condescending Grace. He is in Heaven and we upon earth.
   He is the Creator and we are the creatures of an hour.

   The Lord Jesus comes so very near to us because He bears our Nature and
   is bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. We may be familiar with Him
   and yet incur no censure. Little children climbed on His knees and He
   said, "Suffer the little children to come unto Me." We feel that we may
   come where children are welcomed! Yes, we rejoice that when we cannot
   come to Him, our Lord Jesus comes to us--and when our weakness makes us
   fall upon the ground, He stoops over us to help us up! His sympathy
   makes Him quick to draw near and calm our troubled breasts. When a
   child falls, how fast the mother runs to set it on its feet again! Yet
   she is no more in haste than Jesus, who leaves not His own to remain
   long in their distress. He draws very near to His poor, fainting,
   swooning disciples. He will not leave them comfortless. He will come
   unto them.

   He is the same Christ, at this hour, as in the days of His flesh--He is
   still in the habit of visiting His people and manifesting Himself to
   them as He does not to the world. Brothers and Sisters, do not ask for
   evidence any more! Do not begin searching books to find out arguments
   and reasons! Ask Jesus to come to you--His Presence will stand in the
   place of all reasoning and be better, by far! Communion with Christ
   supplies the soul with irresistible arguments as to His being, His
   love, His power, His Godhead. Actual nearness to Him clothes the mind
   with a coat of mail which wards off every arrow of unbelief! Let Christ
   come to us and questions and doubts are heard no more. Quibblings are
   nailed to His Cross; insinuations fall dead at His feet! This assurance
   works in an infinitely better manner than if out of yon black cloud,
   God Himself were to speak to us in thunder-tones!

   When Jesus came, the next thing He did was, He touched them. This is,
   to me, most precious! As they lie there all fainting, He touches Peter,
   and touches James, and touches John, just as in later days we read, "He
   laid His right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not." That was His
   way of healing those diseased with leprosy. He touched the blind man
   and gave him sight. The dead maiden was thus revived. Oh, the power of
   His touch! One touch of Jesus saves us! What will not His touch do? We
   are so much made up of feelings, after all, that we need to know that
   the Lord really feels for us and will enter so tenderly into our case
   as to touch us. That touch reassures our fainting hearts and we know
   our Lord to be Emanuel, God With Us. Sympathy! This is the meaning of
   that human touch of a hand which is, nevertheless, Divine!

   Oh, how sweetly Christ has touched us by being a partaker in all that
   is human! He touched us everywhere--in poverty, for He had not where to
   lay His head! In thirst, for He sat by the well and said, "Give Me to
   drink." In anguish, for He was betrayed by His friend. He has touched
   us in depression of spirit, for He cried, "My soul is exceedingly
   sorrowful even unto death." He is touched with a feeling of our
   infirmities, "for He was tempted in all points like as we are." An
   absolute God does not seem to touch us with a feeling as of a man--He
   pities us as a father pities His children--yet in this He is above us
   and our fears prevent our reaching up to Him. For the most tender
   sympathy in adversity, a brother must be born, and Jesus is that
   Brother. We are frail and sinful, and Jesus touches us in both
   respects, for He has taken our flesh and carried away our sins.

   He was "numbered with the transgressors," thus He touched
   transgressors, and He became frail, even as we are, until, at last, He
   said, "I am a worm, and no man"--thus He touched our infirmities. Dear
   Friends, nothing so cheers the heart as the Divine touch of Christ, for
   if you have felt it, you will bear witness that contact with His
   wondrous Person is like life from the dead! Virtue comes out of Christ
   to us when His garment's hem and our finger meet. The contact of Grace
   on His part and faith on our part brings into us strength, light,
   joy--and everything else that is laid up in Jesus to meet our needs.
   The hand of Jesus is laid upon us and, in the strength which it gives,
   a man might dash through Hell and climb to Heaven! Ezra said, "I was
   strengthened as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me." Touched with
   the almighty Sufferer's sacred sympathy, we glory in tribulation and
   triumph in death!

   Is not this more effective evidence of the Truth of the Gospel and of
   the commission of Christ than if the Lord God should again speak out of
   a cloud? To feel the wondrous power of Christ strengthening our
   hearts--surely this is the

   most certain witness! Next time you read of the Red Sea, and of God's
   dividing it for His people, and drowning Pharaoh in the deep waters, do
   not say to yourself, "I wish I had been there!" but pray God to make a
   way for you through your troubles, to dry up the Red Sea of your sins
   and lead you into Canaan! Pardoned sin will make you rejoice in Him! It
   must have been a fine demonstration of God's glorious majesty when He
   sent a thick darkness over all the land, even darkness that might be
   felt.

   For my part, I count it a more-to-be desired demonstration of the power
   of God when He took away my thick darkness and brought me into His
   marvelous light. When He turned all the waters of Egypt into blood, so
   that they loathed to drink of the river, it was a sure proof that God
   was there. But to my soul it was a more assuring proof when He turned
   my water into wine and made my ordinary life to become like the life of
   those in Heaven by His sovereign Grace! He has raised us up together
   from the depths of our natural ruin and made us sit together in the
   heavenly places--is not this as great a proof of His power and Godhead
   as when He raised up Israel from the brick-kilns and set His people
   free? It was a sure proof of God's being in Egypt when He called for
   the frogs--and they came--even into the king's chambers!

   But what a proof of His being with us is given to our mind when the
   Lord sweeps out of our soul all the frogs of fear that used to croak
   within us, even in the king's chambers of devotion and communion! We
   could not worship God for their croaking--we were defiled and disturbed
   with doubts and fears--but when Jesus comes and clears them all away,
   it is a surer proof and more effectual to the heart than a thousand
   plagues could be! So there were two actions of Christly sympathy--Jesus
   came near and He touched them. But always the great thing with Jesus is
   His Word--He spoke to them. He is the Word of God and as the Word He
   proves His Godhead. "Where the word of a king is, there is power."
   Jesus, after He had touched them, said, "Arise, be not afraid."

   Precious words! "Arise, be not afraid." When the Word of Jesus Christ
   comes with power to our discouraged souls and we are made strong in
   confidence, then we are persuaded of the truth of the Gospel! When we
   are disabled from the Divine service through fear and Jesus renews our
   strength by saying, "Arise," so that we are able to work, again--then
   do we believe and are sure! "The joy of the Lord is our strength."
   Whenever the blessed Comforter reveals Christ to us so that we are
   cheered and made glad in the midst of our tribulations, then we need
   not ask for signs and wonders, nor for voices speaking out of the
   clouds! It is enough, the truth is sealed in our consciences. The voice
   of Christ is far better than all other manifestations, for it does not
   leave us swooning with fear, but sends us out to fight the battles of
   the Lord!

   This is the sum of what I have spoken to you--ask not for signs and
   wonders which God will not give. But, "Hear Him." Listen to Jesus by
   faith and your personal experience of His Presence shall be to you all
   that you need by way of assurance. Live on Christ, live in Christ, live
   with Christ and this shall be better to you than visions or bright
   clouds, or celestial voices, or all supposable evidences! This shall
   make your spirit leap and your heart rejoice till the day breaks and
   the shadows flee away--and you see God, even the Father--face to face
   in Glory! May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you always.
   Amen.

The Works of the Devil Destroyed

   (No. 1728)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 1, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy
   the works of the devil." 1 John 3:8.

   IN this chapter John makes a sharp and clear division of mankind into
   two classes--he gives not even the slightest hint that there is, or
   ever was, or ever can be a third class. He describes men as being the
   children of God or else the children of the devil and tells us how the
   two classes are made manifest (see verse 10). Now, this distinction
   would not have been drawn by John so sharply if it had not existed, for
   he was a man of a most loving heart and gentle spirit, and if he could,
   somewhere or other, have found a space for neutrals, or what I call,
   "betweenites," or people who come in midway between saints and sinners,
   I am sure he would have done it. No one could suspect John of lack of
   charity and, therefore, as he was convinced that no middle position was
   possible, we may be quite clear upon that point and at once dismiss
   every theory which is meant to flatter the undecided.

   At this day the world is still divided into children of God and
   children of the Evil One. This distinction ought never to be forgotten
   and yet thousands of sermons are preached in which it is quite
   ignored--and congregations are commonly addressed as if they were all
   the people of God! How shall we preach the Truth of God if we begin by
   assuming a lie? Yet to assume that all our Hearers are Christians is to
   begin with an error! Is it not highly probable that men will be built
   up in falsehood if the very Truth which is addressed to them is stated
   in a false way? No, my Hearers, we cannot talk to you as all the people
   of God, for you are not! Some of you are the children of the Wicked One
   and though it may not be pleasant to be told so, yet it is no business
   of ours to please you! Our duty is to preach so as to please God and
   benefit the souls of men--and that can only be effected by an honest
   enunciation of matters of fact.

   There is a definite and fixed line, in the sight of God, between the
   living and the dead, between those who are born-again and those who
   abide in their fallen estate--between the spiritual and the carnal,
   between the believing and the unbelieving! There is a gulf fixed
   between the two orders of men, which, blessed be God, can be passed,
   but which, nevertheless, divides the whole race as though a vast chasm
   had opened up in the in midst of them and set them apart from each
   other, separating them into two camps. This important distinction ought
   to be observed in public prayer. And this is a point in which we are
   dissatisfied with most liturgies, because they are necessarily composed
   with the view of suiting both saints and sinners and, as a necessary
   result, they are not suitable for either!

   The joyous notes of confidence which are becoming in the children of
   God are left out because the ungodly could not use such expressions of
   exultant faith while, on the other hand, the wailing notes which are
   most suitable to anxious souls are put into the mouths of men who, by
   the Grace of God, have long ago found their Savior. Men walking in full
   fellowship with the Lord are not correctly described as "miserable
   sinners"--neither is it theirs to pray as if they had never found
   pardon and life in Christ Jesus! It is impossible that public prayer
   should be suitable for a mixed congregation unless a portion of it is
   evidently for such as fear the Lord and another portion for such as do
   not fear Him. I suppose it would be difficult, if not impossible, to
   compose a liturgy for common use upon strictly truthful principles--and
   yet that order of public prayer which ignores the distinction between
   the regenerate and the unregenerate must inevitably be mischievous to
   the souls of men! In this matter the servant of the Lord must discern
   between the precious and the vile, or he cannot be as God's mouth.

   If this distinction is to be thought of in preaching and in public
   prayer, it should be especially considered in our personal religion. We
   ought to know whose we are and whom we serve. We ought to know the
   differences, which the Lord has made by Grace, and whether or not He
   has made us to differ from the unrenewed. Every man in trade wishes to
   be sure of his position, whether he is prospering or not. And surely we
   ought, each one, to know our position in that one

   great enterprise of life which, if it finds us bankrupt at the last,
   must leave us so forever! It is of the utmost importance for a man to
   know whether he has been enlightened or abides in darkness; whether he
   is the slave of sin or the Lord's free man. Each man should know that
   he is either saved or lost, pardoned or condemned--he may not sit down
   in peace in the deceitful hope that though he may not be a child of
   God, he is, nevertheless, no heir of wrath, for it cannot be--he is one
   thing or the other at this moment!

   Everyone is under the wrath of God unless he has believed in Jesus and
   so has become accepted in the Beloved. There are two seeds and only
   two--the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent--and you, my
   Friend, belong to one or the other! John sums up the vital distinction
   when he writes, "He that has the Son has life; and he that has not the
   Son has not life. And we know that we are of God, and the whole world
   lies in wickedness." Let this stand as the preface of the sermon, for
   the spirit of it will run through my whole discourse. And now I come to
   the words of the text itself-- "For this purpose the Son of God was
   manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil."

   We shall speak of four things--the works of the devil. The purpose of
   God. The manifestation of the Son of God. And the experience within
   ourselves of the meaning of this text. Oh, for the aid of the Holy
   Spirit, that we may think aright and speak with power!

   I. First, then, let us say a little upon THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL. This
   very strong expression is descriptive of sin, for the preceding
   sentence so interprets it. I will read the whole verse--"He that
   commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sinned from the beginning.
   For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy
   the works of the devil"--that is, that He might destroy sin. This name
   for sin is, first of all, a word of detestation. Sin is so abominable
   in the sight of God and of good men that its various forms are said to
   be "the works of the devil." Men do not like the idea of having any
   connection with the devil and yet they have a most intimate connection
   with him until they are made anew by the Spirit of God.

   When it was supposed in a superstitious age that a man had commerce
   with the devil, he was abhorred or feared and, most properly so--he
   that is in league with Beelzebub has forfeited all right to honor. Yet
   let every man know that if he lives in sin, his actions are called by
   the Holy Spirit, "the works of the devil." Satan is "the spirit that
   now works in the children of disobedience." Think of that, you ungodly
   ones! The devil is at work in you--as a smith at his forge! Is it not a
   shocking thought that if I am living in sin, I am the bond slave of
   Satan and I am doing his work for him? If the devil is in the heart,
   the whole life will be, more or less, tainted by the presence of that
   arch-enemy of God and man! Do not laugh at sin, then! Do not dare to
   trifle with it! It is dangerous and deadly because it is of the devil,
   from whom no good thing can ever come. Oh, if men could but see the
   slime of the serpent upon their pleasurable sins; the venom of asps
   upon their dainty lusts and the smoke of Hell upon their proud and
   boastful thoughts, surely they would loathe that which they now delight
   in! If sin connects us with the devil, himself, let us flee from it as
   from a devouring lion. The expression is a word of detestation--may it
   enter into our hearts and make sin horrible to us!

   Next, it is a word of distinction--it distinguishes the course of the
   ungodly man from the life of the man who believes in the Lord Jesus. He
   that is of God does the works of God--his life is the work of God--it
   is a life which has much that is God-like about it and he is upheld by
   the power of God, the ever blessed Spirit. But the ungodly man's life
   is very different--he lives for himself, he seeks his own pleasure--he
   hates all that oppose him, he is up in arms against the Lord and His
   Truth--and all that is pure and good. His spirit is not the spirit of
   God, but of the Evil One. There is a radical distinction between the
   gracious and the graceless--and this comes out in their works--the one
   works the works of God and the other the works of the devil. I know
   that this doctrine is not pleasant, but it is true and, therefore, it
   must be plainly stated.

   I hear one say, "Look at me! Am I a child of the devil? I may not be
   much of a saint, but I am no worse than many of your professing
   Christians." I answer that may be the case, for professing Christians
   are sometimes horrible hypocrites! But what has that to do with you?
   Ah, my Friend, their perishing will not help your salvation! If you are
   not trusting in Christ and living under the power of His love, you may
   be as good as any hypocrite, or even better, and yet you may be widely
   different from a real Christian! If you have not the life of God in
   you, you cannot do the works of God! The mineral cannot rise into a
   vegetable by itself--it requires another touch from the creative hand!
   The vegetable cannot rise into an animal unless the Creator shall work
   a miracle and, even so, you, as a carnal man, cannot become a spiritual
   man by any spontaneous generation--the new life must be imparted to you
   by the quickening Spirit!

   The distinction of your works from those of the real Believer in Christ
   is as great as that between the works of the devil and the works of
   God--and this may show you how great the distinction of the natures
   must be by which these different fruits are produced! The language
   before us is, next, a word of descent. Sin is "of the devil." It came
   from him. He is its parent and patron. Sin is not so of the devil that
   we can lay the blame of our sins upon him, for that is our own. You
   must not blame the Tempter for tempting you to do that which, without
   your will, he could not make you do. He may tempt you, but that would
   be no sin of yours if your will did not yield to the temptation. The
   responsibility lies with your will. The devil has plenty of sin of his
   own to answer for and yet he is often made a packhorse to carry loads
   of evil which are none of his!

   Mother Eve taught us that art when she said, "The serpent beguiled me
   and I did eat." And since then men have become wonderfully proficient
   in the science of excuse-making, frequently imputing their own guilt to
   the devil's guile! Yet sin, in a sadly true sense, does come of the
   devil. He first introduced it into the world. How or when he, himself,
   first sinned and fell from being an angel of light to become the
   Apostle of Darkness we will not conjecture. Many have thought that the
   pride of his lofty station, or envy of the foreseen glories of the Son
   of Man, may have overthrown Him. But, at any rate, he kept not his
   first estate, but became a rebel against his Lord and the active
   promoter of all evil. Being expelled from Heaven for his wickedness, he
   desired to wreak his revenge upon God by alienating the human race from
   its obedience.

   He saw what an interest the Creator had taken in man and, therefore,
   judged that he could grieve Him greatly by seducing man from obedience.
   He perceived that the Maker, when He formed the earth, did not rest.
   When He had made the birds and fishes, He did not rest. When He had
   made the sun, moon and stars, He did not rest. But when He had
   fashioned man, He was so well content that He then took a day of rest
   and consecrated it forever to be a Sabbath. Thus was God's unresting
   care for man made manifest. "Surely," said the Evil One, "if I can turn
   this favored being into an enemy of God, then I shall bring dishonor
   upon the name of the Most High and have my revenge." Therefore he
   alighted in the garden and tempted our first parents, thus opening the
   gate by which sin entered into the world with all its train of woe.

   In that sense sin is truthfully described as being the work of the
   devil. He brought the flame which has caused so great a burning. Since
   then he has been, in some degree, the author of sin by often tempting
   men. I doubt not that he suggests to many a sinner the delights of the
   flesh and the pleasures of self--and that he shuts the eyes of
   conscience to the Truth of God and hardens the heart against the
   threats of God. Under these influences men doubtless rush into wild
   extravagances of evil, willingly yielding themselves to be led captive
   at his will. Doubtless, Satan not only suggests sin to men, but as one
   spirit influences another spirit, he influences men strongly towards
   that which is evil and blinds them against that which is good. "Lead us
   not into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One," is a prayer
   which plainly connects the Evil One with temptation, as we know as a
   matter of fact that he is connected with it. This is his constant
   employment, to be tempting, one way or another, the sons of men. Hence
   sin is the work of the devil, but not so that it excuses us--it is our
   work because we willingly yield--let us be thoroughly ashamed of such
   work when we find that the devil has a hand in it. May Almighty God
   deliver us from the mighty spirit of Evil!

   Consider, next, that we have here a word of description. The work of
   sin is the work of the devil because it is such work as he delights in.
   What are the works of the devil? They are such actions as are like he
   and exhibit his nature and spirit. Open your eyes and you will surely
   see "the works of the devil"--they are everywhere in this poor world.
   The earth is defiled with his horrible productions. How delightful it
   is to take a survey of the works of God. The wise men say, "The works
   of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure
   therein." I heard of a good man who went down the Rhine but took care
   to read a book all the way, for fear he should have his mind taken off
   from heavenly topics by the beauties of nature. I confess I do not
   understand such a spirit--I do not want to do so. If I go into an
   artist's home, I do that artist a displeasure if I take no notice of
   his works under the pretext that I am quite absorbed in him!

   Why not enjoy the objects in which our heavenly Father has set forth
   His wisdom and power? There is nothing in any of the works of God to
   defile, debase, or carnalize the soul. Delight yourself in all your
   heavenly Father's handiwork and make it to be a ladder by which you
   climb to Him! But what a very different contemplation is that which
   lies before us in the works of the devil! Ah, me, what a picture for a
   painter here--the works of the devil! Yet surely, brush and color would
   altogether fail. Oh, Evil One, how cunning are your works--in malice
   have you made them all! The earth is full of

   your abominable things! Look abroad in the world and you see
   atheism--men made by God deny His existence! They could not stand
   upright and speak if He did not enable them to do so, and yet they cry,
   "There is no God!"

   Into what a condition must an intelligent mind be brought before it can
   vent such folly! Surely this must come from that arch-fiend who, above
   all things desires, that there should be no God! See, also, how much
   there is of ignorance abroad, a leaden night of ignorance of God and of
   His Son. Is not this the work of the Prince of Darkness? Note, also,
   the abounding unbelief of the Truth of God which would be believed at
   once if men's minds were pure--of the Truth of God which is salvation
   to those who accept it and yet is rejected by many as if it were
   injurious to them! From where does all this indifference to God and His
   Grace come? And what is the origin of all this plague of doubting which
   is now upon us? Is it not of the same character as that which abode in
   the serpent's heart when he whispered, "Has God said?" and, again, "You
   shall not surely die." Here is he, who was a liar from the
   beginning--till producing a host of lies against God Himself!

   What is this idolatry which we see everywhere abroad, not only among
   the heathen, but among those who call themselves Christians--the
   worship of visible symbols instead of the spiritual adoration of the
   unseen Spirit? It must have come from Satan, who has made himself the
   god of this world, setting himself up to be God's rival. Things offered
   to idols are offered to devils, for a mere idol is nothing in the
   world--its evil lies in its representing a principle which is opposed
   to the one true, invisible God. The superstitions which degrade
   humanity--which are an insult to our manhood--all these are most
   pleasing to Satan and approved by him. And so they are fitly described
   as "the works of the devil." And what, my Brothers and Sisters, is
   blasphemy--that common profanity which pollutes our streets? Who could
   have taught men wantonly and for no purpose whatever, to use the foul
   and filthy language that is so common nowadays? This must be the speech
   of pandemonium, the dialect of Hell!

   And what is pride, my Brethren, pride in a creature that will die?
   Pride in a sinful worm?--the pride of dress, the pride of life, the
   pride of talent? What are those haughty looks? What are those
   presumptuous words? What are those contemptuous glances--what are all
   these things but works of the devil? He whom Milton describes as
   thinking it "better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven"--he surely
   is the great fomenter of all pride among mankind! As for deceit, so
   current everywhere and, worst of all, religious deceit, formalism and
   hypocrisy--from where come these but from the bottomless Pit--from him
   who transforms himself into an angel of light? Are not all liars his
   dear children? My list is long enough--but I see a numerous brood
   hatched beneath the wings of hate--envy, strife, wrath, bitterness,
   malice, revenge. These are as fiery flying serpents in this wilderness,
   inflaming men's blood. I see these accursed evils rousing nations into
   war, dividing communities with discords, embittering families that
   otherwise might be full of love.

   Yes, making men to be the worst enemies of men--these all come from him
   who is a murderer from the beginning and is the aider and abettor of
   all hatred and strife. What a busy being he has been! How he has toiled
   incessantly, day and night, to set up a kingdom of hate in opposition
   to the empire of eternal love! With what diligence has he smothered the
   world with a pall of darkness so that men sit down to weep and rise up
   to torment one another. Ah me, what mischief this unclean spirit has
   worked! His works are evil, only evil and that continually! He has led
   the human race to become accomplices in his treason against the God of
   Heaven, allies in his rebellion against the sovereignty of God Most
   High. The works of the devil make up a black picture--it is a thick
   darkness over all the land--even a darkness that may be

   felt.

   II. But now, secondly, and much more joyously, let us consider THE
   PURPOSE OF GOD--"For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that
   He might destroy the works of the devil." Ring out sweetly all the
   silver bells of earth and all the golden harps of Heaven--God has
   purposed that the terrible work of the devil upon the earth shall be,
   every atom of it, destroyed! Yes, mark that word, "destroyed!" Not
   limited, nor alleviated, nor neutralized, but destroyed! Oh, Brothers
   and Sisters, what could you and I do against such a power as Satan--so
   malicious and so strong--and withal so cunning and subtle and apt to
   deceive? Who among us can loosen his works and cast his cords from us?
   But if God has purposed it, verily the purpose of Jehovah shall stand!
   If this is the Divine decree, tremble, O Tophet, and you, Beelzebub,
   for there shall come an end to all your works if God has purposed to
   destroy them!

   The work which lies in this purpose is assuredly a Divine work. The
   Lord who can create can certainly destroy. Destruction lies in the hand
   of Omnipotence and is a prerogative of the Eternal One. Destruction of
   forces so terrible must come only from the Lord. What could you and I
   do in this business? Ourselves originally under Satan's power,
   ourselves

   destroyed--could we destroy the Destroyer? The image of God in us has
   been marred by the work of Satan! Could we restore that image? Enmity
   to God has been created in our hearts by Satan--could we, while yet
   enemies, tear out that enmity? No, another hand must make us friends--a
   hand outside of us. That which has been done by the powers of darkness
   must be undone by the Eternal Light, or else it will remain forever. It
   is a Divine work--this destruction of the works of the devil--and
   herein lies our hope of its being accomplished.

   And there is, to my mind, about it the idea of a conquering work. When
   are the palaces and the fortifications of great kings destroyed? Not
   till the kings, themselves, have been overthrown in a fair fight. When
   their power is broken, then it is that the conquerors raze the castle
   and burn the stronghold! Glory be unto Jehovah, it is His purpose to
   win such a victory over the Prince of Darkness that every work of his
   shall be destroyed! "Come, behold the works of the Lord, what
   desolations He has made in the earth; He breaks the bow, and cuts the
   spear in sunder. He burns the chariot in the fire." Your right hand, O
   Lord, has dashed the enemy in pieces. Our Almighty Champion has come
   forth with a shout of victory to divide the spoil with the strong. The
   arch-enemy is vanquished and, therefore, his works are to be destroyed!

   This means also a complete work. The product of evil is not to be cut
   down for a time and left to grow again. The tree of the forest is
   felled by the axe, but the root remains--and at the scent of water it
   will bud and send forth branches. But the purpose of God is utterly to
   destroy the works of the devil and destroyed they shall be! In the
   heart of man, when God begins His work, He does not cease till He has
   utterly destroyed all sin, yes, the very tendency and possibility of
   sin! And then He conducts the purified spirit up to His right hand,
   having neither spot or wrinkle, nor any such thing. In the world, also,
   do not doubt it, oh you soldiers of Christ who are ready to turn your
   backs in the day of battle--He will yet drive sin out of its
   entrenchments--the habitations of cruelty shall become the temples of
   adoration!

   All people shall bow before the Lord and there shall be a new Heaven
   and a new earth in which dwells righteousness. Up from this poor planet
   there shall ascend, like smoke from a great golden altar of incense,
   the perpetual hallelujahs of a ransomed race, redeemed by blood and
   power from all the rule of the enemy! Glory be to God, He has purposed
   it and He will accomplish it! It is a complete work and a conclusive
   work, for the Lord Jesus will so break the head of the old dragon that
   he shall never again wear the crown! Christ has come, not to fight a
   battle with Satan which shall continue throughout all ages, but to win
   a victory which shall so crush the power of evil that it shall not
   molest the world again!

   The powers of darkness upon this earth hang out their flags and ring
   out the clarions of victory, but they are too fast. Wait a little while
   and He that will come, shall come, and will not tarry! And when He
   comes, He shall lead captivity and the reign of captive goodness and
   truth--and love shall be established forever and ever! Rebellion shall
   not rise up a second time. Oh, how glorious is the text--"For this
   purpose the Son of God was manifest, that He might destroy the works of
   the devil." Sin, in every shape and form, the Lord shall destroy from
   off the face of the earth forever!

   III. Thirdly, our text plainly tells us how this is to be done--By THE
   MANIFESTATION OF THE SON OF GOD.

   "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested." The work of the devil
   was so clever; the foundations of it were so deeply laid and the whole
   thing had such a semblance of omnipotence about it, and was, indeed, in
   itself so strong, that no champion was found in Heaven or on earth that
   could hope to destroy it. It never entered Satan's thoughts that God,
   Himself, could deign to suffer and to die. He said within himself--"If
   I can make man to so offend God that He must justly be incensed against
   him, then I shall have done the work effectually. If I can make man a
   rebel, God's infinite holiness cannot overlook his rebellion and He
   must punish him! And so I shall have made for God a perpetual race of
   enemies and He will have lost the love of myriads of His creatures."

   He did not know the boundless love and wisdom of Jehovah! Even his
   angelic intellect could never have conceived the matchless plan of
   atonement by a sacrifice, propitiation by substitution! The blessed
   fact of the Son of God becoming manifest in human flesh and dying in
   human form--to destroy the works of the devil--entered not into a
   creature's mind. Yet this was always in God's purpose, for the better
   display of His Divine attributes. Behind, under and over the works of
   the devil, the Lord had always the design that this evil should be
   permitted that He might baffle it with love and that the glory of His
   Grace might be revealed! My text has in it, to my mind, a majestic
   idea, first, of the difficulties of the case--that the Son of God must
   necessarily be manifested to destroy the works of the devil. And then,
   secondly, of the ease of His victory.

   Have you been abroad at midnight when darkness has been all around you,
   dense and palpable? Not a star was visible, the moon had forgotten to
   shine. You could scarcely see your hand when you held it before your
   eyes. The blackness seemed to be not only above, beneath and around,
   but also within you! You were embedded in a thick, heavy, sensible
   ebony mass. How could all this be scattered? What power could lift up
   the veil and scatter the mass? Lo, in the east old Sol has lifted up
   his head and the black walls have vanished! Not a speck remains! The
   works of darkness are destroyed by the manifestation of the light! That
   is the thought of the text--"For this purpose the Son of God was
   manifested." Rising up from His Divine retreat in the silences of
   eternity, Christ appeared in human form and scattered and utterly
   destroyed the works of darkness!

   Let us see how this was done. First, Christ's manifestation, even in
   His Incarnation, was a fatal blow to the works of Satan. Did God come
   down to men? Was He Incarnate in the Infant that slept in Bethlehem's
   manger? Then the Almighty has not given up our nature to be the prey of
   sin! Despair may not be! If one is born on earth who is Divine as well
   as human, then peace be unto you, O race of Adam! Hear you not the
   song, "Glory, joy to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill
   toward men"? It cannot be that the race is given up to perpetual night
   if the Son of God is manifested in such fashion as this!

   Next, look to the life of Christ on earth and see how He there
   destroyed the works of the devil. It was a glorious duel in the
   wilderness when they stood feet to feet--the champions of good and
   evil! How dexterously the Evil One played his weapons! How cunningly he
   tempted the Christ of God! But the Lord Jesus used the sword of the
   Spirit and, "It is written!" "It is written!" "It is written!" struck
   home till the Evil One spread his dragon wings and fled away, for he
   had found his victor. Evil spirits had taken possession of human forms!
   Legions of devils were established in men! But the Lord Jesus Christ
   had only to speak and away they fled, glad to leap into swine and rush
   into the sea to escape from His Presence! They knew that He had come
   who was ordained "to destroy the works of the devil."

   All our Lord's preaching, all His teaching, all His labor here below
   was in order to the pulling away the cornerstone from the great house
   of darkness which Satan had built up. But oh, dear Friends, it was in
   His death that Jesus chiefly overthrew Satan and destroyed his works!
   Satan built upon this--that man had become offensive to God and God
   must punish him--that punishment was his hope for the continuance of
   alienation. Behold, the august Son of God takes the offender's place!
   Marvel of marvels, the Judge stands where the criminal should have
   stood and is "numbered with the transgressors!" Behold, the wrath of
   God falls upon His Well-Beloved and Jesus suffers, that He may
   reconcile man to his God and heal the breach which sin had caused!

   The deed was done! Man is no more offensive to Heaven, for one glorious
   Man's boundless merit has put away the demerit of the race! Jesus has,
   by His unutterable beauties, removed the deformities of all who are in
   Him. By His obedience unto death the Law is vindicated, justice is
   honored, Grace is glorified! Man, accepting this great Sacrifice, loves
   and adores the Father who ordained it--and so the works of the devil in
   his heart are destroyed! Our Lord's rising again; His ascension into
   Glory; His sitting at the right hand of the Father; His coming again in
   the latter days--all these are parts of the manifestation of the Son of
   God by which the works of the devil shall be destroyed! So, also, is
   the preaching of the Gospel.

   If we want to destroy the works of the devil, our best method is to
   manifest more and more the Son of God! Preach up Christ and you preach
   down the devil! All kinds of reforms are good and we are on the side of
   everything that is pure, honest, temperate and righteous. Still, the
   best Reformer is the Christ of God! The one medicine for man's moral
   sickness is the Cross and nothing but the Cross. Preach the Crucified
   Savior! Preach the Incarnate God! Preach Christ full of forgiveness and
   love, reconciling the world unto Himself and you have applied the best
   remedy to the sore! Only let it never be forgotten that Jesus destroys
   the works of darkness by His Spirit. It is the Spirit of God who puts
   Divine energy into the sacred Word of God. When the Spirit manifests
   Christ in a man--the works of darkness are destroyed in that man! When
   Christ is manifested in a nation--the works of Satan begin to fall in
   that nation! And in proportion as the Holy Spirit shall more and more
   reveal Christ to hearts and consciences, bringing them into obedience
   to the faith--in that degree shall the works of Satan be destroyed!

   Lastly, on this point, our blessed Lord is manifested in His eternal
   power and kingdom as enthroned in order to destroy the works of the
   devil, for "the government shall be upon His shoulders, and His name
   shall be called Wonderful, The Mighty God, The Father of the Ages." He
   is such a Father and the age is made to feel His forming hand. Kings,

   presidents, parliaments, poets, leaders and such like these are visible
   powers--but there is, over them all, an invisible power. A late
   philosopher asserted that over all the confusion of affairs he could
   see a power over all which works towards righteousness. There is such a
   power! There is a King of kings and a Lord of lords! And who is He? It
   is He of whom we read, "The Father has committed all things into His
   hands."

   He is ruling! He is reigning even now and, despite our unbelief, things
   are moving on! God is being glorified! His kingdom is coming! The
   ultimate destruction of evil on the earth is sure and the eternal reign
   of the right and of good is certain. "The Lord reigns; let the earth
   rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof." Enthroned at the
   right hand of the Eternal, Jesus sits, the Man of Love, the Crucified!
   He has reassumed His eternal Glory and Sovereignty, and without His
   bidding shall not a dog move his tongue! The dominion is with the Son
   of God and He shall end the reign of evil. Glory be to His name forever
   and ever!

   IV. Lastly, I would come close home to each dear friend as we utter a
   few words of inquiry as to THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL THIS IN OURSELVES. Has
   the Son of God been manifested to you to destroy the works of the devil
   in you? Come to the point and look at yourself! At first there was in
   your heart an enmity to God, for, "the carnal mind is enmity against
   God." Is that enmity destroyed? Has the love of God in Christ Jesus
   appeared to you in such a way that you can truly say you no longer hate
   God, but love Him? Though you do not love Him as you wish to do, yet
   your heart is toward Him and you desire to be like He and to be with
   Him forever. This is a good beginning--the Son of God has destroyed
   your enmity--you have seen the love of God in Christ and your rebellion
   against God has ceased.

   The next work of the devil which usually appears in the human mind is
   self-righteous pride. The man says, "I am no enemy to God! I am
   righteous! If I am not perfect, yet I am tolerably good. God, I thank
   You that I am not as other men are. I do this and I do that, and I do
   not do the other." This is our natural boasting, but the Son of God
   destroys it! Has the Son of God destroyed all your self-righteousness?
   It is a precious lot of rags! But we so constantly practice the art of
   patching and mending that we dream that we are clothed in royal
   apparel. Have all those rags gone from you? Has a strong wind blown
   them right away? Have you seen your own natural nakedness? Why, if I
   were to talk about my own righteousness, I would be a fool and a liar
   in one! I have no righteousness of my own! I dare not dream of such a
   thing!

   Is that your case? Then the Lord Jesus Christ has been manifested to
   destroy in you the works of the devil! That is a pretty name for your
   righteousness, is it not? It deserves that name, for the best
   righteousness of man, when it is set up in opposition to the
   righteousness of Christ, deserves small compliments--it is one of the
   works of the devil. When the Lord has destroyed self-righteousness in
   us, the devil generally sets us forth another form of his power--and
   that is despair. "Ah," he says, "you see what a sinner you are--God
   will never be reconciled to you! There is no forgiveness for you!" Oh
   that ever he should have the impudence to make a man believe so gross a
   slander of such a God as ours, whose very name is Love and who gave His
   Son to die for sinners!

   But, if the Lord Jesus Christ has been manifested to you, despair has
   gone--that work of the devil has been all de-stroyed--and now you have
   a humble hope in God and a joy in His mercy! Though you speak,
   sometimes, with bated breath, yet your doubt is about yourself, not
   about your Lord. You know whom you have believed and you know that He
   is a God that passes by transgression, iniquity and sin. Thus three
   sets of works of the devil are gone already--enmity is gone;
   self-righteousness is gone and despair is gone. What next? Have you any
   unbelief in your heart as to the promises of God? That is a favorite
   work of the devil--unbelief is one of his darling children. Now, I
   beseech you, do not say, "I must always feel this unbelief." No! Down
   with it! Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil. Grind
   your cutlasses and cut down these doubts!

   All mistrusts must die. Not one of them must be spared. Hang them up
   before the face of the sun! Jesus has not come that He may lock up our
   sins and keep them quiet, hidden away in a dark corner. He has come to
   destroy them. Israel was not to make a league with the Canaanites, as
   they unwisely did with the Gibeonites--they were to sweep out the
   entire race, root and branch! Thus must sin be exterminated and
   extirpated. Cry to the Lord Jesus Christ that you may never tolerate
   the sin of unbelief and look upon it as a pitiable infirmity! No, it is
   a grievous sin--war to the knife with it-- the Son of God is manifested
   that it may be utterly destroyed. Happy is that man who no longer
   doubts his God, but exercises the Abrahamic faith which staggers not at
   the promise through unbelief!

   Do fleshly lusts arise in your heart, my Brothers and Sisters? In whose
   heart do they not arise? The brightest saint is sometimes tempted by
   the foulest vice. Yes, but he yields not. By the Grace of God, he says,
   "Christ is manifested to de-

   stroy the works of the devil." He will not play with these things and
   dally with them, and let them be his Delilah, for he knows that they
   will cost him his eyes, even if they do not ruin his soul. He cries,
   "Away with them!" It is not meet, even, to mention these vile
   things--they are works of the devil and to be destroyed! My Brothers
   and Sisters, do you quickly become angry? I pray God you may be angry
   and sin not, but if you are of a hasty temper, I entreat you to
   overcome it. Do not say, "I cannot help it." You must help it, or
   rather, Christ must destroy it. It must not be tolerated. Does your
   anger ever intensify into hate? Do you ever feel envious of those who
   are better off than yourself, or better than yourself? Does that envy
   ever lead you to think harshly of them, to indulge yourself in
   suspicions that are groundless concerning them?

   Oh, for the sword of the Lord and of Gideon! Slay all these Midianites,
   for Christ is revealed on purpose to clear the heart of the whole brood
   of them! God is Love and he that dwells in love dwells in God--and hate
   and sin must not live! Every form of evil must fall! Destruction is
   meted out to them all. Every idol must be broken. Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, there is to be in every true Believer the ultimate abolition
   of sin! What a prospect this is! The cutting up of the very roots of
   evil! The sooner the better. The day shall come when every child of God
   shall be transformed and transfigured into the likeness of Christ--and
   shall be without fault before the Throne of God. This is already
   foreshadowed upon us, for the outlines are drawn in the fact that we
   hate all sin and long after perfect holiness. The great Father has put
   His mark upon the lump of clay and we can see from the rough draft that
   He will fashion it and form it into the perfect image of His dear

   Son!

   After that image we are struggling. It is begun in us by the power of
   the Spirit of God and He will not fail nor be discouraged till the
   purpose of God shall be accomplished and all the works of Satan in us
   shall be destroyed! This robs death of all dread--the prospect of being
   totally free from sin makes us welcome, even, the grave, if by that
   road we are to come to the home of the perfect! Meanwhile, let us seek
   after sanctification. Let us labor after holiness and let us abound in
   it to the glory of God. Despite our failures and mistakes let us pursue
   holiness! Taking it by the heel, let us keep close to it. So may the
   Lord enable us for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                             Beginning at Jerusalem

   A Sermon

   (No. 1729)

   Delivered on Thursday Evening, June 14th, 1883, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his
   name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."--Luke 24:47.

   The servants of God were not left to originate a gospel for themselves,
   as certain modern teachers appear to do, nor were they even left to map
   out their mode of procedure in the spreading of the glad tidings. They
   were told by their great Master what to preach, and where to preach it,
   and how to preach it, and even where to begin to preach it. There is
   ample room for the exercise of our thought in obeying Christ's
   commands; but the worldly wise in these days call no one a thoughtful
   person who is content to be a docile follower of Jesus. They call
   themselves "thoughtful and cultured" simply because they set up their
   own thoughts in opposition to the thoughts of God. It were well if they
   would remember the old proverb--"Let another praise thee, and not thine
   own lips." As a rule those who call themselves "intellectual" are by no
   means persons of great intellect. Great minds seldom proclaim their own
   greatness. These boasters are not satisfied to be "followers of God, as
   dear children," but must strike out a path for themselves; this reveals
   their folly rather than their culture. We shall find use for every
   faculty which we possess, even if we are endowed with ten talents, in
   doing just as we are bidden by our Lord. Implicit obedience is not
   thoughtless: on the contrary, it is necessary to its completeness that
   heart and mind should be active in it.

   I. Ye that would faithfully serve Christ note carefully how he taught
   his disciples WHAT THEY WERE TO PREACH. We find different descriptions
   of the subject of our preaching, but on this occasion it is comprised
   in two things--repentance and remission of sins. I am glad to find in
   this verse that old- fashioned virtue called repentance. It used to be
   preached, but it has gone out of fashion now. Indeed, we are told that
   we always misunderstood the meaning of the word "repentance"; and that
   it simply means a "change of mind," and nothing more. I wish that those
   who are so wise in their Greek knew a little more of that language, for
   they would not be so ready with their infallible statements. True, the
   word does signify a change of mind, but in its Scriptural connection it
   indicates a change of mind of an unusual character. It is not such a
   fitful thing as men mean when they speak of changing their minds, as
   some people do fifty times a day; but it is a change of mind of a
   deeper kind. Gospel repentance is a change of mind of the most radical
   sort--such a change as never was wrought in any man except by the
   Spirit of God. We mean to teach repentance, the old-fashioned
   repentance, too; and I do not know a better description of it that the
   child's verse:--

   "Repentance is to leave

   The things we loved before,

   And show that we in earnest grieve

   By doing so no more."

   Let every man understand that he will never have remission of sin while
   he is in love with sin; and that if he abides in sin he cannot obtain
   the pardon of sin. There must be a hatred of sin, a loathing of it, and
   a turning from it, or it is not blotted out. We are to preach
   repentance as a duty. "The times of this ignorance God winked at, but
   now commandeth all men everywhere to repent." "Repent, and be baptized
   every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
   sins." He that has sinned is bound to repent of having sinned: it is
   the least that he can do. How can any man ask God for mercy while he
   abides in his sin?

   We are to preach the acceptableness of repentance. In itself considered
   there is nothing in repentance deserving of the favour of God; but, the
   Lord Jesus Christ having come, we read, "He that confesseth and
   forsaketh his sin shall find mercy." God accepts repentance for the
   sake of his dear Son. He smiles upon the penitent sinner, and puts away
   his iniquities. this we are to make known on all sides.

   We are also to preach the motives of repentance--that men may not
   repent from mere fear of hell, but they must repent of sin itself.
   Every thief is sorry when he has to go to prison: every murderer is
   sorry when the noose is about his neck: the sinner must repent, not
   because of the punishment of sin, but because his sin is sin against a
   pardoning God, sin against a bleeding Saviour, sin against a holy law,
   sin against a tender gospel. The true penitent repents of sin against
   God, and he would do so even if there were no punishment. When he is
   forgiven, he repents of sin more than ever; for he sees more clearly
   than ever the wickedness of offending so gracious a God.

   We are to preach repentance in its perpetuity. Repentance is not a
   grace which is only to be exercised by us for a week or so at the
   beginning of our Christian career: it is to attend us all the way to
   heaven. Faith and repentance are to be inseparable companions
   throughout our pilgrimage to glory. Repenting of our sin, and trusting
   in the great Sinbearer, is to be the tenor of our lives; and we are to
   preach to men that it must be so.

   We are to tell them of the source of repentance, namely, that the Lord
   Jesus Christ is exalted on high to give repentance and remission of
   sins. Repentance is a plant that never grows on nature's dunghill: the
   nature must be changed, and repentance must be implanted by the Holy
   Spirit, or it will never flourish in our hearts. We preach repentance
   as a fruit of the Spirit, or else we greatly err.

   Our second theme is to be remission of sins. What a blessed subject is
   this! To preach the full pardon of sin--that it is blotted out once for
   all; the free pardon of sin--that God forgives voluntarily of his own
   grace; free forgiveness for the very chief of sinners for all their
   sins, however black they may be; is not this a grand subject? We are to
   preach a final and irreversible remission; not a pardon which is given
   and taken back again, so that a man may have his sins forgiven and yet
   be punished for them. I loathe such a gospel as that, and could not
   preach it. It would come with an ill grace from these lips. But the
   pardon of God once given stands for ever. If he has cast our sin into
   the depths of the sea it will never be washed up again.If he has
   removed our transgressions from us as far as the east is from the west,
   how can they return to condemn us? Once washed in the blood of the Lamb
   we are clean. The deed is done: the one offering has put away for ever
   all the guilt of believers.

   Now this is what we are to preach--free, full, irreversible pardon for
   all that repent of sin, and lay hold on Christ by faith. O servants of
   the Lord, be not ashamed to declare it, for this is your message!

   II. Next to this, we are told WHERE IT IS TO BE PREACHED. The text says
   that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name
   among all nations. Here, then, we have the divine warrant for missions.
   They are no speculations, or enthusiastic dreams; they are matters of
   divine command. I daresay you have heard of what the Duke of Wellington
   said to a missionary in India who was questioning whether it was of any
   use to preach the gospel to the Hindus. "What are your marching
   orders?" said this man of discipline and obedience. "What are your
   marching orders?" that is the deciding question. Now the marching
   orders are, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every
   creature." What a wonder it is that the church did not see this long
   before. After her first days she seems to have fallen asleep, and it is
   scarcely a hundred years ago since in the providence and grace of God
   the church began to wake to her high enterprise. We are to preach the
   gospel everywhere: missions are to be universal. All nations need the
   preaching of the word. The gospel is a remedy for every human ill among
   all the races that live upon the face of the earth. Some out of all
   nations shall receive it; for there shall be gathered before the
   eternal throne men out of every kindred, and nation, and tongue. No
   nation will utterly refuse it: there will be found a remnant according
   to the election of grace even among the most perverse of the tribes of
   men.

   We ought to preach it to every creature, for it is written that it
   behoved to be so. Read the forty-sixth verse: "Thus it is written, and
   thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third
   day: . . . and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
   among all nations." Brethren, there was a divine necessity that Christ
   should die, and an equally imperative must that he should arise again
   from the dead; but there is an equally absolute necessity that Jesus
   should be preached to every creature under heaven. It behooves to be
   so. Who, then, will linger? Let us each one, according to his ability
   and opportunity, tell to all around us the story of the forgiveness of
   sin through the Mediator's sacrifice to as many as confess their sin
   and forsake it. We are bidden to preach repentance of sin and faith in
   our Lord Jesus Christ, let us not be slow to do so.

   III. But this is not all . We are actually told HOW TO PREACH IT.
   Repentance and remission are to be preached in Christ's name. What does
   this mean? Ought we not to learn from this that we are to tell the
   gospel to others, because Christ orders us to do so? In Christ's name
   we must do it. Silence is sin when salvation is the theme. If these
   should hold their peace, the stones would cry out against them. My
   brethren, you must proclaim the gospel according to your ability: it is
   not a thing which you may do or may not do at your own discretion; but
   you must do it if you have any respect for your Saviour's name. If you
   dare pray in that name, if you dare hope in that name, if you hear the
   music of joy in that name, then in the name of Jesus Christ preach the
   gospel in every land.

   But it means more than that. Not only preach it under his orders, but
   preach it on his authority. The true servant of Christ has his Master
   to back him up. The Lord Jesus will seal by threatening or by grace the
   word of his faithful messengers. If we threaten the ungodly, the
   threatening shall be fulfilled. If we announce God's promise to the
   penitent, that promise shall be surely kept. The Lord Jesus will not
   let the words of his own ambassadors fall to the ground. "Lo, I am with
   you alway," says he, "even to the end of the world. Go ye therefore and
   teach all nations." You have Christ with you: teach the nations by his
   authority.

   But does it not mean, also, that the repentance and the remission which
   are so bound together come to men by virtue of his name? Oh, sinner,
   there would be no acceptance of your repentance if it were not for that
   dear name! Oh, guilty conscience, there would be no ease for you
   through the remission of sin if it were not that the blessed name of
   Jesus is sweet to the Lord God of hosts! We dare preach pardon to you
   in his name. The blood has been shed and sprinkled on the burning
   throne: the Christ has gone in within the veil, and stands there "able
   to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing he ever
   liveth to make intercession for them." Salvation in his name there is
   assuredly, and this is our glory; but "there is none other name given
   under heaven among men whereby we must be saved." That name has a
   fullness of saving efficacy, and if you will but rest in it, you shall
   find salvation, and find it now. Thus you see we are not bidden to go
   forth and say--We preach you the gospel in the name of our own reason;
   or we preach you the gospel in the name of the church to which we
   belong, or by the authority of a synod, or a bishop, or a creed, or a
   whole church. No, we declare the truth in the name of Christ. Christ
   has set his honour to pawn for the truth of the gospel. He will lose
   his glory if sinners that believe and repent are not saved. Dishonour
   will come to the Son of God if any man repenting of sin is not accepted
   before God. For his name's sake he will not cast away one that comes to
   him. O chief of sinners! he will receive you if you will come. He
   cannot reject you; that were to be false to his own promise, untrue to
   his own nature.

   Be sure then that you preach in Christ's name. If you preach in your
   own name it is poor work. A man says to me, "I cannot tell a dead
   sinner to live. I cannot tell a blind sinner to see. I cannot invite an
   insensible sinner; it is absurd; for the sinner is altogether without
   strength." No, dear sir, I do not suppose you can do so while you speak
   according to carnal reason. Does the good man say that God has not sent
   him to bid the dead arise? Then let him not do it. Pray let him not try
   to do what God never sent him to do. Let him go home and go to bed; he
   will probably do as much good asleep as awake. But as for me, I am sent
   to preach in Jesus' name, "Believe and live," and therefore I am not
   slow to do so. I am sent on purpose to say, Ye dry bones, live, and I
   dare do no otherwise. No faithful minister who knows what faith means
   looks to the sinner for power to believe, or looks to himself for
   power; but he looks to the Master that sent him for power; and in the
   name of Christ he says to the withered hand, "Be stretched out," and he
   says to the dead, "Come forth!" and he does not speak in vain. Oh, yes,
   it is in Christ's name that we fulfill our office! We are
   miracle-workers: he endows us with his power if in faith we tell out
   his gospel. All of you who try to speak the gospel may do it without
   fear of failure; for the power lies in the gospel and in the Spirit who
   goes with it, not in the preacher or in the sinner. Blessed be the name
   of God, we have this treasure in earthen vessels but the excellency of
   the power is of God, and not of us. So he tells us, then, what to
   preach, and where to preach it, and how to preach it.

   IV. Now, I shall ask your attention to the principal topic of the
   present discourse, and that is, that he told his disciples WHERE TO
   BEGIN.

   I have heard of a Puritan who had in his sermon forty-five main
   divisions, and about ten subdivisions under every head. He might be
   said largely to divide the word of truth, even if he did not rightly
   divide it. Now,I have nine subheads to-night, and yet I hope I shall
   not detain you beyond the usual time. I cannot make fewer of them and
   give the full meaning of this sentence--"Beginning at Jerusalem." The
   apostles were not to pick and choose where they should start, but they
   were to begin at Jerusalem. Why?

   First, because it was written in the Scriptures that they were to begin
   at Jerusalem: "Thus it is written, and thus it behooves, that
   repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among
   all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." It was so written: I will give
   you two or three proofs. Read in the second chapter of Isaiah, at the
   third verse: "Out of Zion shall come forth the law, and the word of the
   Lord from Jerusalem." Isaiah's word would have fallen to the ground if
   the preaching had not begun at Jerusalem; but now, to the very letter,
   this prediction of the evangelical prophet is kept. In Joel, that
   famous Joel who prophesied the descent of the Spirit and the speaking
   of the servants and the handmaidens, we read in the second chapter, at
   the thirty-second verse, "In mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
   deliverance;" and again in the sixteenth verse of the third chapter of
   the same prophet--"The Lord shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice
   from Jerusalem." As if the Lord were as a strong lion in the midst of
   Jerusalem, and as if the sounding forth of the gospel was like the
   roaring of his voice, that the nations might hear and tremble. How
   could those promises have been kept if the gospel had begun to be
   preached in the deserts of Arabia, or if the first church of Christ had
   been set up at Damascus? Note another passage. Obadiah in his
   twenty-first verse says, "Saviours shall come up on mount Zion." Who
   were these saviours but those who instrumentally became so by
   proclaiming the Saviour Jesus Christ. And Zechariah, who is full of
   visions, but not visionary, says in his fourteenth chapter at the
   eighth verse, "Living waters shall flow out of Jerusalem," and then he
   describes the course of those waters till they flowed even unto the
   Dead Sea, and made its waters sweet. Because the Bible said so,
   therefore they must begin at Jerusalem, and I call your attention to
   this, for our Lord Jesus was particular that every jot and tittle of
   the Old Testament should be fulfilled. Do you not think that this reads
   us a lesson that we should be very reverent towards every sentence of
   both the Old and the New Testaments; and if there be anything taught by
   our Lord ought not his people to consider well, and act according to
   the divine ordinance? I am afraid that many take their religion from
   their parents, or from the church that is nearest to them, without
   weighing it. "I counsel thee to keep the King's commandment." Oh, that
   we may be more faithful servants of the Lord; for if we are faithful we
   shall be careful upon what men call small points, such as the doctrine
   of baptism, the manner of the Lord's Supper, or this small point of
   where the gospel should be first preached. It must begin at Jerusalem
   and nowhere else; for the Scripture cannot be broken. See ye to it,
   then, that ye walk according to the word of God, and that ye test
   everything by it. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not
   according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." So
   much on that first head.

   Secondly, I suppose that our Lord bade his disciples begin to preach
   the gospel at Jerusalem, because it was at Jerusalem that the facts
   which make up the gospel had occurred. It was there that Jesus Christ
   died, that he was buried, that he rose again, and that he ascended into
   heaven. All these things happened at Jerusalem, or not far from it.
   Therefore the witness-bearing of the apostles must be upon the spot
   where if they lie they can be confuted, and where persons can come
   forward and say, "It was not so; you are deceivers." If our Lord had
   said, "Do not say anything in Jerusalem. Go away to Rome and begin
   preaching there," it would not have looked quite so straightforward as
   it now does when he says, "Preach this before the scribes and the
   priests. They know that it is so. They have bribed the soldiers to say
   otherwise, but they know that I have risen." The disciples were to
   preach the gospel in the streets of Jerusalem. There were people in
   that city who were once lame, and who leaped like a hart when Jesus
   healed them. There were men and women there who ate of the fish and
   that bread that Jesus multiplied. There were people in Jerusalem who
   had seen their children and their friends healed of dreadful diseases.
   Jesus bids his disciples beard the lion in his den, and declare the
   gospel on the spot where, if it had been untrue, it would have been
   contradicted with violence. Our Lord seemed to say, "Point to the very
   place where my death took place. Tell them that they crucified me; and
   see if they dare deny it. Bring it home to their consciences that they
   rejected the Christ of God." Hence it was that, coming to the very
   people who had seen these things, the preaching of Peter had unusual
   force about it: in addition to the power of the Holy Spirit there was
   also this--that he was telling them of a crime which they had newly
   committed, and could not deny: and when they saw their error they
   turned to God with penitent hearts. I like this thought--that they were
   to begin at Jerusalem, because there the events of the gospel occurred.
   This is a direction for you, dear friend: if you have been newly
   converted, do not be ashamed to tell those who know you. A religion
   which will not stand the test of the fireside is not worth much! "Oh,"
   says one. "I have never told my husband. I get out on a Thursday night,
   but he does not know where I am going, and I steal in here. I have
   never even told my children that I am a believer. I do not like to let
   it be known. I am afraid that all my family would oppose me." Oh, yes;
   you are going to heaven, round by the back lanes. Going to sneak into
   glory as a rat crawls into a room through a hole in the floor! Do not
   attempt it. Never be ashamed of Christ. Come straight out and say to
   your friends, "You know what I was; but now I have become a disciple of
   Jesus Christ." Begin at Jerusalem: it was your Lord's command. He had
   nothing to be ashamed of. There was no falsehood in what he bade his
   disciples preach, and therefore he did as good as say, "Hang up my
   gospel to the light. It is nothing but truth, therefore display it
   before mine enemies' eyes." If yours is a true, genuine, thorough
   conversion, I do not say that you are to go up and down the street
   crying out that you are converted; but on due occasions you must not
   hide your convictions. Conceal not what the Lord has done for you, but
   hold up your candle in your own house.

   The third reason why the Lord Jesus told them to begin at Jerusalem may
   have been that he knew that there would come a time when some of his
   disciples would despise the Jews, and therefore he said--When you
   preach my gospel, begin with them. This is a standing commandment, and
   everywhere we ought to preach the gospel to the Jew as well as to the
   Gentile; Paul even says, "to the Jew first." Some seem to think that
   there ought to be no mission to the Jews--that there is no hope of
   converting them, that they are of no use when they are converted, and
   so on. I have even heard some who call themselves Christians speak
   slightingly of the Jewish people. What! and your Lord and Master a Jew!
   There is no race on earth so exalted as they are. They are the seed of
   Abraham, God's friend. We have nobles and dukes in England, but how far
   could they trace their pedigree? Why, up to a nobody. But the poorest
   Jew on earth is descended linearly from Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham.
   Instead of treating them with anything like disrespect, the Saviour
   says, "Begin at Jerusalem." Just as we say, "Ladies first," so it is
   "the Jew first." They take precedence among races, and are to be first
   waited on at the gospel feast. Jesus would have us entertain a deep
   regard to that nation which God chose of old, and out of which Christ
   also came, for he is of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh. He
   puts those first who knew him first. Let us never sneer at a Jew again;
   for our Lord teaches us the rule of his house when he says, "Begin at
   Jerusalem." Let the seed of Israel first have the gospel presented to
   them, and if they reject it we shall be clear of their blood. But we
   shall not be faithful to our orders unless we have taken note of Jews
   as well as Gentiles.

   The fourth reason for beginning at Jerusalem is a practical lesson for
   you. Begin where you are tempted not to begin. Naturally these
   disciples would have said one to another when they met, "We cannot do
   much here in Jerusalem. The first night that we met together the doors
   were shut for fear of the Jews. It is of no use for us to go out into
   the street; these people are all in such an excited frame of mind that
   they will not receive us; we had better go up to Damascus, or take a
   long journey and then commence preaching; and when this excitement is
   cooled down, and they have forgotten about the crucifixion, we will
   come and introduce Christ gradually, and say as little as we can about
   putting him to death." That would have been the rule of policy--that
   rule which often governs men who ought to be led by faith. But our Lord
   had said, "Beginning at Jerusalem," and so Peter must stand up in the
   midst of that motley throng, and he must tell them, "This Jesus whom ye
   have with wicked hands crucified and slain is now risen from the dead."
   Instead of tearing Peter to pieces they come crowding up, crying, "We
   believe in Jesus: let us be baptized into his sacred name." The same
   day there were added to the church three thousand souls, and a day or
   two afterwards five thousand were converted by the same kind of
   preaching. We ought always to try to do good where we think that it
   will not succeed. If we have a very strong aversion as a token that we
   are not called to it, we may regard it as a sign that we ought at least
   to try it. The devil knows you, dear friend, better than you know
   yourself. You see, he has been longer in the world than you have, and
   he knows a great deal more about human nature than you do; and so he
   comes to you, and he reckons you up pretty accurately, and says, "This
   brother would be very useful in a certain sphere of labour, and I must
   keep him from it." So he tells the brother that he is not called to it,
   and that it is not the sort of thing for him, and so on; and then he
   says to himself, "I have turned aside one foe from harming my cause."
   Yonder is a good sister. Oh, how much she might do for Christ, but
   Satan guides her into a work in which she will never shine; while the
   holy work which she could do right well is dreaded by her. I heard a
   beautiful story last Wednesday, when I was sitting to see inquirers,
   and I cannot help mentioning it here, for it may be a suggestion to
   some Christian who is present. A brother, who will be received into the
   church, was converted in the following way. He came up to London, and
   worked in a certain parish in the West- end. He was at work on a sewer,
   and a lady from one of the best houses in the West-end came to the men
   that were making the sewer and said, "You men, come into my servants'
   hall and eat your dinners. I will give you either tea or coffee with
   your meal, and then you will not have to go into the public-house."
   Some of them went in, but others did not. So the next day the lady came
   out, and said, "Now, I know that you think my place too fine for you.
   You do not like to come; so I have come out to fetch you in. While this
   sewer is being done I should like you to eat your dinners in my house."
   She got them all in; and when they had done their dinners and drank
   their tea or coffee she began to talk to them about Jesus Christ. The
   work was a month or so about, and it was every day the same. Our friend
   does not know the lady's name, but he knows the name of Jesus through
   her teaching. Friends, we lose hosts of opportunities; I am sure we do.
   Many ways of doing good have never occurred to our minds, but they
   ought to occur to us; and when they do occur we should use them. Let us
   crucify the flesh about this. Let us overcome natural timidity. Let us
   in some way or other begin at Jerusalem, which is just where we thought
   that we never could begin.

   Now fifthly. We are getting on, you see. "Beginning at Jerusalem," must
   surely mean begin at home. Jerusalem was the capital city of their own
   country. You know the old proverb, "The cobbler's wife goes barefoot."
   I am afraid that this proverb is verified by some Christians. They do a
   deal of good five miles off home, but none at home. I knew a man who
   used to go out with preachers every night in the week, and try to
   preach himself, poor soul that he was; but his children were so
   neglected that they were the most wicked children in the street, and
   they grew up in all manner of vice. The father was prancing about and
   looking after other people, and did not care for his own family. Now,
   if you are going to serve Christ to the very ends of the earth, take
   care that you begin at home. Dear parents, need I urge you to look to
   your own children? It is a great joy to me to know that the members of
   the church for the most part do this. When a dear sister came to me on
   Wednesday night with three of her children, making four that had come
   within the last six weeks, I felt grateful to God that parents were
   looking after their offspring. But if any of you are in the
   Sabbath-school, and never have a Sabbath-school at home; if any of you
   talk to strangers in the aisles, but are neglecting your own sons and
   daughters--oh, let it not be so! The power of a father's prayers with
   his arms about his boy's neck I know full well. The power of a mother's
   prayers with her children all kneeling round her is far greater with
   the young than any public ministry will be. Look well to your children:
   begin at Jerusalem.

   Begin with your servants. Do not let a servant live in your house in
   ignorance of the gospel. Do not have family prayer merely as a matter
   of form, but let it be a reality. Do not have one person working for
   you to whom you have never spoken about his or her soul.

   Begin with your brothers. Oh, the influence of sisters over brothers! I
   have a friend--a dear friend, too--who has long been a man of God, but
   in his young days he was a very loose fellow, and often he was all the
   night away from home. His sister used to write letters to him, and
   frequently while half tipsy he has read them under the street lamp. One
   letter which he read cut him to the quick. His sister's grief about him
   was too much for him, and he was compelled to seek and find the
   Saviour. Well has the sister been rewarded for all her love to him. Oh,
   dear friends, begin at Jerusalem! Begin with your brothers and sisters.

   Begin with your neighbours. Oh, this London of ours! It is a horrible
   place for Christian people to live in! Round about this neighbourhood
   scarcely can a decent person remain by reason of the vice that abounds,
   and the language that is heard on every side. Many of you are as much
   vexed to-day as Lot was when he was in Sodom. Well, bear your witness.
   Do not be dumb dogs, but speak up for your Lord and Master whenever you
   are. Look at our dear brother Lazenby, who entered a workshop where
   none feared the Lord, and has been the means of bringing all in the
   shop to God. Another shop has felt his influence, and the first recruit
   has come to join the church: I should not wonder if the whole of the
   workmen in the second shop should come, too. The Lord grant it. It is
   marvelous how the gospel spreads when men are in earnest, and their
   lives are right. God make you so to live that you show piety at home.

   Then, sixthly, begin where much has been already done. Begin at
   Jerusalem. It is hard work, dear friends, to preach to certain people:
   they have been preached to so long, like the people at Jerusalem. They
   know all about the gospel, it is hard to tell them anything fresh, and
   yet they have felt nothing, but remain wedded to their sins. The
   Jerusalem people had been taught for centuries in vain; and yet
   Christ's disciples were to speak to them first. We must not pass the
   gospel-hardened; we must labour for the conversion of those who have
   enjoyed privileges but have neglected them, those who have had
   impressions and have crushed them out, those who seem now as if they
   had sealed their own death-warrants and would never be saved. Do not
   hesitate to go to them. The Lord has done much already: it may be that
   he has laid the fire, and you are to strike the match and set it all
   alight. Many people have a love to the gospel, a love to the house of
   God, a love to God's people, and yet they have no saving faith. What a
   pity! Do not hesitate to address them. I think I hear you say, "I would
   rather go and preach to the outcasts." So would I; but you and I are
   not allowed to pick our work. Virgin soil yields the best harvest; and
   if a man might choose a congregation that is likely to be fruitful, he
   might well select those that have never heard the word before. But we
   have not our choice. The Saviour's disciples were to begin where the
   prophets had prophesied, and had been put to death; where sinners had
   rejected God's voice times out of mind. Therefore do not pass by your
   fellow-seatholders. Perhaps you say, "Sir, I have spoken to them a
   great many times, but I cannot make anything of them." No, you cannot;
   but God can. Try again. Suppose that for twenty years you were to sit
   in this Tabernacle side by side with an unconverted person, and you
   were to speak to that person twice every Sunday and twice in the week,
   and all the twenty years it should be in vain; yet if the individual
   was brought to Christ at last would not his conversion repay you? Is
   your time so very precious? Is your ability so very great? Oh, my dear
   friend, if you were an archangel it would be worth while for you to
   work a thousand years to bring one soul to Christ! A soul is such a
   precious jewel that you would be abundantly rewarded if a century of
   service only brought you one conversion. Wherefore, in working for
   Christ, do not hesitate to go to those who have refused the gospel
   hitherto, for you may yet prevail.

   Seventhly, begin where the gospel day is short. If you ask me where I
   get that thought, it is from the fact that within a very short time
   Jerusalem was to be destroyed. The Romans were to come there to slay
   men, women, and children, and break down the walls and leave not one
   stone upon another. And Christ's disciples knew this; wherefore their
   Lord said, "Begin at Jerusalem." Now, then, if you have any choice as
   to the person you shall speak to, select an old man. He is near his
   journey's end, and if he is unsaved there is but a little bit of candle
   left by the light of which he may come to Christ. Choose the old man,
   and do not let him remain ignorant of the gospel. Fish him up at once,
   for with him it is now or never, since he is on the borders of the
   grave. Or when any of you notice a girl upon whose cheek you see that
   hectic flush which marks consumption--if you notice during service the
   deep "churchyard" cough--say to yourself, "I will not let you go
   without speaking to you, for you may soon be dead." How many a time
   have I seen a consumptive at Mentone apparently getting better; but I
   have noticed him rise from dinner with his handkerchief to his mouth
   and soon they have whispered, "He died of hemorrhage"--suddenly taken
   off. When you meet with a pining case, do not wait to be introduced,
   but introduce yourself; and tenderly, gently, quietly, lovingly say a
   word about coming to Christ at once. We ought speedily to look up those
   whose day of grace is short. Perhaps, also, there is a stranger near
   you who is going far away to a distant land, and may never hear the
   gospel again; therefore, if you have an opportunity, take care that you
   avail yourself of it, and reason with him for Jesus at once. Begin at
   Jerusalem: begin where the day of grace is short.

   Eighthly, begin, dear friend, where you may expect opposition. That is
   a singular thing to advise, but I recommend it because the Saviour
   advised it. It was as certain as that twice two are four that if they
   preached Christ in Jerusalem, there would be a noise, for there were
   persons living there who hated the very name of Jesus, for they had
   conspired to put him to death. If they began at Jerusalem they would
   arouse a ferocious opposition. But nothing is much better for the
   gospel than opposition. A man comes into the Tabernacle to-night, and
   as he goes away he says, "Yes, I was pleased and satisfied." In that
   man's case I have failed. But another man keeps biting his tongue, for
   he cannot endure the preaching. He is very angry; something in the
   doctrine dos not suit him, and he cries, "As long as I live I will
   never come here again." That man is hopeful. He begins to think. The
   hook has taken hold of him. Give us time, and we will have that fish.
   It is no ill omen when a man gets angry with the gospel. It is bad
   enough, but it is infinitely better than that horrible lethargy into
   which men fall when they do not think. Some are not good enough even to
   oppose the gospel of Jesus Christ. Be hopeful of the man who will not
   let you speak to him, he is one that you must approach again; and if,
   when he does let you speak to him, he seems as if he would spit on you,
   be grateful for it. He feels your words. You are touching him on a sore
   place. You will have him yet. When he swears that he does not believe a
   word of what you say, do not believe a word of what he says; for often
   the man who openly objects secretly believes. Just as boys whistle when
   they go through a churchyard in order to keep their courage up, so many
   a blasphemer is profane in order to silence his conscience. When he
   feels the hook, like the fish, the man will drag away from it. Give him
   line. Let him go. The hook will hold, and in due time you will have
   him. Do not despair. Do not think it a horrible thing that he should
   oppose you; you should rather be grateful for it, and go to God and cry
   that he will give you that soul for your hire. Begin courageously where
   you may expect opposition.

   And, lastly, to come to the meaning which Mr John Bunyan has put upon
   the text in his famous book called "The Jerusalem Sinner Saved," I have
   no doubt that the Saviour bade them begin at Jerusalem, because the
   biggest sinners lived there. There they lived who had crucified him.
   The loving Jesus bids them preach repentance and remission to them.
   There he lived who had pierced the Saviour's side, and they that had
   plaited the crown of thorns, and put it on his head. There dwell those
   who had mocked him and spat upon him; therefore the loving Jesus, who
   so freely forgives, says, "Go and preach the gospel first to them." The
   greatest sinners are the objects of the greatest mercy. Preach first to
   them. Are there any such here? My dear friend, we must preach the
   gospel first to you because you want it most. You are dying; your
   wounds are bleeding; the heavenly surgeon bids us staunch your wounds
   first. Others who are not so badly hurt may wait awhile, but you must
   be first served lest you die of your injuries. Should not this
   encourage you great sinners to come to Jesus, when he bids us preach to
   you first?

   We are to preach to you first because, when you have received him, you
   will praise him most. If you are saved you will encourage others to
   come, and you will cheer up those who have come already. We shall be
   glad to get fresh blood poured into the veins of the church by the
   conversion of big sinners who love much because they have had much
   forgiven. Therefore, we are to come to you first. Will you not come to
   Christ at once? Oh, that you would believe in him! Oh that you would
   believe in him to-night! To you is the word of this salvation sent. You
   old sinners--you that have added sin to sin, and done all you can do
   with both hands wickedly--you that have cursed his name--you that have
   robbed others--you that have told lies--you that have blackened
   yourselves with every crime, come and welcome to Jesus. Come to Christ
   and live at once. Mercy's door is set wide open on purpose that the
   vilest of the vile may come; and they are called to come first. Just as
   you are, come along with you. Tarry not to cleanse or mend, but now
   "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." This night
   if you believe in Jesus you shall go out of these doors rejoicing that
   the Lord has put away your sin. To believe is to trust--simply to trust
   in Christ. It seems a very simple thing, but that is why it is so hard.
   If it were a hard thing you would more readily attend to it; but being
   so easy you cannot believe that it is effectual. But it is so; faith
   does save. Christ wants nothing of you but that you accept what he
   freely presents to you. Put out an empty hand, a black hand, a
   trembling hand; accept what Jesus gives, and salvation is yours.

   Thus have I tried to expound "Beginning at Jerusalem," O that my Lord
   would begin with you. Amen.

A Cure For Unsavory Meats--or, Salt for the White of an Egg

   (No. 1730)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY 5, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? Or is there any
   taste in the white of an egg?" Job 6:6.

   THIS is a question which Job asked of his friends who turned out to be
   so unfriendly. Thus he battles with those "miserable comforters" who
   inflamed his wounds by pouring in salt and vinegar instead of oil and
   wine. The first of them had just opened fire upon him and Job, by this
   question, was firing a return shot. He wanted the three stern watchers
   to understand that he did not complain without cause. If he had spoken
   bitterly, it was because he suffered grievously. He was in great bodily
   pain; he was enduring great mental depression and, at the same time, he
   had been smitten with poverty and bereavement. He had, therefore,
   reason for his sorrow. He had no comforts left and every arrow of grief
   was sticking in his flesh. If he groaned, he had reason to groan.

   His were not sorrows which he had imagined. They were real and true
   and, therefore, he asks this question first, "Does the wild ass bray
   when he has grass? Or bellows the ox over his fodder?" If these
   creatures lift up their notes of complaint, it is when they are
   starving. When the wild ass cannot find a mouthful of grass, anywhere,
   then his complaint is heard far and near. When the ox at the stall has
   no fodder--when he is fastened there and no farmer brings him
   provision--then he lows and there is good reason for his bellowing. Job
   seems to say, "I do not complain without cause. If I still enjoyed my
   former comforts, or even a tithe of them, you should hear no voice of
   murmuring from me. But I am tried to the utmost. I am grievously
   afflicted and there is overflowing cause for my moaning."

   He had lost all care to breathe. The zest of life was gone. No joy
   remained to make existence worth the having. He was like one who finds
   no flavor in his food and loathes the morsel which he swallows. That
   which was left to him was tasteless as the white of an egg--it yielded
   him no kind of comfort. In fact, it was disgusting to him. He was fed,
   he says, upon meat which yielded him no solace. "The things that my
   soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat." Therefore, he
   virtually asks his friends, "How can you expect me to eat such meat as
   this without sighs and tears? Can that which is unsavory be eaten
   without salt? Is there any taste in the white of an egg?"

   He means that everything about him had lost its flavor and life had
   become dull and dreary to him and, therefore, they must not wonder that
   he uttered words of complaint. The speech, also, to which Job had
   listened from Eliphaz the Temanite, did not put much sweetness into his
   mouth, for it was devoid of sympathy and consolation. If you read it at
   home you will see that it was worthy to be the first of a singular
   selection of galling utterances. Job, we must admit, was sufficiently
   acid, himself, and abundantly sarcastic, but his friends produced the
   irritation and took care to always repay him double for all his
   wormwood. For every hard speech of his, they returned compound
   interest. They grieved and vexed his upright soul till he said no more
   than the truth when he cried, "Miserable comforters are you all."

   Here he tells them that Eliphaz had administered unto him unsavory meat
   without salt--mere whites of eggs without taste. Not a word of love,
   pity, or fellow feeling had the Temanite uttered. He had spoken as
   harshly and severely as if he were a judge addressing a criminal who
   was suffering no more than he deserved. Looking at the speech--and
   looking at all his surroundings--poor Job feels that he has very
   unsavory meat to eat and he asks them whether they expect him to eat it
   without salt. They have given him something that is no more gratifying
   to him than the white of an egg and he enquires if they really think
   that he can accept this at their hands and thank them for their
   treatment.

   We may now forget the much-tortured Patriarch, Job, and apply this text
   to ourselves. "Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? Or is
   there any taste in the white of an egg?" Three thoughts arise out of
   it.

   I. The first point will be this--A LACK OF SAVOR IS A VERY GREAT NEED
   in anything that is meant for food. I am not going to deliver a cookery
   lecture and so I shall not enlarge upon the passage so far as it refers
   to the bread upon our table, or the food which we eat and drink.
   Everybody knows that all kinds of animal life delight in food that has
   a

   flavor in it--and even "dumb driven cattle" will turn away from dry,
   flavorless food and will go a long way to find something that has a
   juice and a taste in it which suits the palate which God has created in
   them.

   It is exactly the same with regard to the food of our souls. It is a
   very great fault with a sermon when there is no savor in it. It is a
   killing fault to the people of God when a book contains a good deal of
   what may be true, but yet lacks holy savor--or what, in other words, we
   call, "unction." Somebody says, "Tell us what unction is." I can much
   more easily tell you what it is not! You know a discourse when there is
   savor in it--and you also know when a sermon is dry, sapless,
   marrowless. And yet you could not state the difference in words. Some
   sermons could not even be suspected of anything like unction--their
   authors would sneer at you if you accused them of it!

   But salt is still to be had. The fat things, full of marrow, are not
   quite out of the market yet. But what kind of savor is that which we
   expect in a sermon? I answer, first, it is a savor of the Lord Jesus
   Christ. Years ago, before ministers grew so wise as to question the
   Divine Inspiration of Scripture and renounce the Doctrine of Atonement,
   there used to be men in the country whose ministry was full of savor to
   the people of God. There were numbers of Christians in London who would
   go to the north, or go to the south, or go to the east, or go to the
   west to hear such preachers--and count it a great feast to listen to
   them! What was there about them? Were they great critics? I do not
   suppose that the good men ever read a work on criticism.

   Were they profoundly learned? Assuredly they were not! Profoundly
   learned brothers were preaching in churches and chapels where there
   were more spiders than people! Those who displayed their learning and
   rhetoric had empty places--but these men were followed by multitudes!
   Wherever they spoke, the places were too small for them. Those who did
   not know the reason said, one to another, "What is there about these
   men? We do not see any peculiar talent." And there was not much. "We do
   not see any profound learning." And there was none to see. "We do not
   hear anything of advanced thought and liberal ideas." No, these good
   men were innocent of these modern diseases!

   Yet there are people of God tonight, now gray-headed, who remember the
   happy hours they spent, and the joyful seasons they knew while hearing
   these men, and how they journeyed home, perhaps, seven or eight or 10
   miles from such a sermon and only wished they could go again the next
   night, when their labor was done, to be fed again! What was it that
   made this preaching so attractive, so edifying? What drew the Lord's
   people so far? What evoked such enthusiasm? Why, it was that the
   preacher spoke of his Lord and never wandered from the Cross! When we
   were children we learned Dr. Watts' Catechism of the Bible and I
   remember one question--"Who was Isaiah?" and the answer was, "He was
   that Prophet who spoke more of Jesus Christ than all the rest."

   Who were these men, then, that were followed by God's people so
   earnestly? They were men that spoke more of Jesus Christ than all the
   rest! You have read Dr. Hawker's Morning and Evening Portions, perhaps?
   I do not suppose that you have learned much of fresh exposition from
   them, or that you have been struck with any great originality of idea
   in them. But if you have read them profitably you have said to
   yourself, "Well, there is this one point in Hawker, his subject is
   Christ on the first of January, Christ on the last of December and
   Christ all the other days of the year." He speaks of nothing else but
   Christ! He seems to bring forth the Lord Jesus in his portions every
   day as a matter of course, just as your maid always puts the bread on
   the table, whatever else she does not place there.

   So it was with Hawker and men like he--Christ Crucified was their All
   in All. Their dear Lord and Master was never long absent from their
   discourses. If they preached doctrine, it was "the Truth of God as it
   is in Jesus." If they preached experience, it was "to know Him and the
   fellowship of His suffering." And if they went into practice, as they
   did, their idea of holiness was to be made like Jesus and to follow Him
   outside the camp, bearing His reproach. Now, I do not believe a sermon
   can have savor in it unless it has Christ in it, for He has the savor
   of all good ointments and there is no sweetness without Him!

   What shall we say of Him? "Your name is as ointment poured forth;
   therefore the virgins love You." His name is so fragrant that it
   perfumes Heaven itself! Jehovah smells a savor of rest in the name,
   Person and work of His well-beloved Son. Therefore an essential to
   savory meat is that it shall have Christ in it! He has said, "My flesh
   is meat, indeed, and My blood is drink, indeed." And there is no meat
   and no drink that has such savor in it as this! Oh, that we might hear
   more of a crucified Christ in all our places of assembly!

   The next necessity to secure savor is a devout spirit in the
   preacher--a savor of devotion. I am trying to explain savor by not
   attempting a definition, but by noticing its accompaniments. Why, those
   men who have now gone to Heaven,

   whom you used to hear, seemed to be praying while they preached! Their
   sermons were devotions as well as discourses! Their rhetoric was
   rapture, their oratory was emotion. Their preaching came from the
   heart, but it came also from "the deep that lies under," that secret
   reservoir of the everlasting Truth of God which is opened up by the
   Spirit to those who know the Lord, and to none else! They could say,
   "All my fresh springs are in You." They drew up the Truth of God, which
   they preached out of this deep--out of the very heart of God!

   They preached the Gospel of Grace as men that knew it, loved it, lived
   on it! It was no irksome task to them to speak of Christ and Grace, and
   pardon and Covenant faithfulness. You could not always see traces of
   elaboration or even of preparation about their utterances--you could
   see something better--the sparkling salt of Divine Grace! If the
   midnight oil had not smeared their sermons, the unction of the Spirit
   had anointed them! Their heart was inditing a good matter, for they
   spoke the things which they had learned touching the King! They spoke
   with such cheerfulness and reverence that it was good to hear them!
   They spoke with profound belief that what they said was Infallibly
   true, for had they not received it fresh from the Spirit of God?

   Coming from their heart, it went to your heart--and by their realizing
   faith you were helped to believe it joyfully! It is an evil sign when a
   teacher of the Truth of God does not, himself, believe it, for thus he
   becomes a virtual spreader of error. David said, "I believed: therefore
   have I spoken." Do you not believe, Brother? Then go home and be quiet
   till you do! At least, do not come into the pulpit until you know what
   your Lord would have you say. Woe to the man who lets the smoke of
   undried wood come from off his hearth and blow into poor seekers' eyes!
   We need live coals from off the altar--and the less doubt-smoke the
   better!

   Where a man has evidently been with God to learn His Truth and has been
   baptized into the everlasting spirit of that truth and, therefore,
   speaks what he knows and testifies what he has seen in the fear of the
   living God, there is a savor about his witness and the saints discern
   it gladly. This holy savor cannot be imitated or borrowed! It must come
   of personal assurance. It is a holy thing and the composition thereof
   is known only to the great Giver of all spiritual gifts, the Lord,
   Himself. It is a holy anointing oil which comes not of man's flesh and
   is far removed from all carnality. It never comes on any man except as
   it descends from Him who is "the Head," and so drops even to the skirts
   of His garments. From Christ, alone, the true anointing comes, and
   blessed is he who is made partaker with Him.

   Very well, then, as food without savor is an evil and undesirable sort
   of food, so is all Christian teaching unacceptable if it lack the savor
   of Christ and of devotion. Another matter goes to make up sweet savor
   in a discourse, and that is a savor of experience. You used to delight
   in those men because they had tasted and tested the doctrines which
   they preached. The younger Brothers were somewhat at a discount
   because, you said, "That good Brother speaks fluently, but he cannot
   have experienced so much as the man of God under whom I have now sat
   for many years." You prefer to have the Truth of God spoken to you by
   one who has felt for himself the renewing, upholding and comforting
   power of Divine Grace.

   And I cannot blame you for your liking. If the preacher has done
   business on great waters, in deep soul trouble, or personal affliction,
   so much the better for you. If he is one who loves much because much
   has been forgiven him, so much the better for you. If he is a man
   conscious of his own infirmity and weakness, who speaks humbly of
   himself as out of the very dust, though he speaks confidently the word
   from Heaven, so much the better for you! Such experience puts a kind of
   spice into the food which he presents to you. It is so in all our
   communications one to another. We do not speak with certainty of
   edification unless we speak of what we have, ourselves, enjoyed.

   I have been greatly benefited by hearing an aged blind man stand up and
   tell of the faithfulness of God to himself. I have been much
   encouraged, at times, by hearing a poor but gracious woman near to the
   gates of death telling with tears in her eyes of the goodness of the
   Lord to her. Testimonies from such people have weight in them. These
   people do not play at religion! Poor and tried people; people with
   aches and pains; people who have none of this world's comforts; people
   on the borders of the grave tell us of the great Father's love--and
   when they do so, there is great force of conviction in their testimony.
   We attach weight to every word they say because their experience is
   taken into consideration.

   I never heard a man who spoke more to my soul than dear Mr. George
   Mueller. The sermon that I heard from him was like an address to a
   Sunday school, it was so simple and unadorned. But then there was the
   man behind it--that simple-hearted child of God who has believed the
   promises and has gone on doing wonders such as astonish all beholders!
   That man has no more doubt about God's answering his prayers than he
   has about two times two making four--why

   should he have? He acts out the Truth of God which he has received--why
   shouldn't he? Entertaining no modern questions and no ancient
   questions, either, he triumphs by knowing the Truth of God and living
   the Truth of God, and rejoicing in the Truth of God! Such a man is a
   pattern and example to us all. And there is a precious savor in what he
   utters because he speaks experimentally of Truths which he has carried
   out in his own life.

   Thus three things help to make up savor in sermons--Christ as the
   doctrine, devotion as the spirit and experience as adding weight to
   testimony. But these three things are not the whole of it. There is a
   sacred something--it is not nameless, for I will name it, by-and-by--it
   is a heavenly influence which comes into man, but which has no name
   among the things that belong to men. This sacred influence pervades the
   speaker, flavoring his matter and governing his spirit-- while, at the
   same time, it rests upon the hearer so that he finds his mind awake,
   his faculties attentive, his heart stirred. Under this mysterious
   influence the hearer's spirit is in a receptive condition and, as he
   hears the Truth of God, it sinks into his soul as snowflakes drop into
   the sea. He finds himself warmed, cheered, comforted and stirred up as
   fainting men are apt to be when refreshed after a long fast.

   Now, what is this? From where comes this savor? In a word, it comes of
   the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit bears witness with the Word of God
   upon the quickened heart and conscience of the people of God--and that
   Word of God becomes life, light and power to them. All this we greatly
   need! And if we have it not, what shall we do? I have often trembled as
   I have come to preach here lest I should have to speak among you
   without the help of the Divine Spirit. It would be much better to be
   silent. I could almost wish that we had the liberty of our Quaker
   friends just to sit still until we feel that we are moved to speak, for
   sometimes we might do better to wait without a spoken word for the hour
   and a half rather than for one of us to talk without the guidance of
   the Spirit of God!

   Pray much, Beloved, that there may be a great deal of dew about--that
   heavenly showers may fall on us and on all the Churches of God! Let our
   belief in the Holy Spirit never become a mere compliment which we feel
   bound to pay Him, but in deep and reverent sincerity may we acknowledge
   that He is the great Worker in the Church--the real actor and doer of
   the wondrous works of quickening, saving and comforting! Let us wait
   upon Him with lowly spirits, feeling that we can do nothing without
   Him, but that if He is with us then all is well. Take away from any
   preaching or any teaching Christ as the subject, devotion as the
   spirit, experience as the strength of testimony--and the Holy Spirit as
   being All in All--and you have removed all the savor!

   And what is left? What can we do with a savorless Gospel? "Can that
   which is unsavory be eaten without salt? Is there any taste in the
   white of an egg?" They said of a Brother, the other day, that he liked
   savory doctrine. "He had a sweet tooth," they said. It was said in
   scorn, but if there is anything to be scoffed at in that matter, I
   desire to be a partaker in the reproach, for I have a sweet tooth,
   myself! I like such books as have savor in them and I declare to you
   that whatever scorn it brings upon me, I think that the majority of
   modern books seem to me to be fit for nothing but to be burned! The old
   theology has the sweetness and the savor in it which the people of God
   delight in and I, for one, mean to stick to it, for I cannot eat the
   white of your eggs--I cannot endure your unsavory meat!

   I must hear of the electing love and Covenant purpose of the
   Father--this is savory meat such as my soul loves! I must have teaching
   that is full of Christ, the Doctrines of Grace and the Holy Spirit, or
   my soul will die of famine! This is my first head.

   II. Our second remark is this. I find a rendering given to the text,
   which, if it is not absolutely accurate, nevertheless

   states an important truth, namely, that THAT WHICH IS UNSAVORY FROM
   NEED OF SALT MUST NOT BE

   EATEN. I shall only mention this second head as a note of caution. A
   word to the wise suffices. There is a great deal in this world which is
   unsavory for lack of salt. I mean in common conversation. Alas, it is
   easy to meet with people--even people wearing the Christian name--whose
   conversation has not a particle of salt in it. Nothing that tends to
   edification is spoken by them. Their talk has an abundance of gaiety,
   but no Grace in it. They exhibit any amount of frivolity, but no
   godliness.

   In other conversation there is weighty information and solid upon
   common matters, but there is a lack of that spirit which God's people
   desire to live in, for the Lord Jesus is forgotten. Someone said to me,
   the other day, "When we were young people, we knew many good old folk
   who used to meet together and talk about the Lord Jesus Christ by the
   hour together. And we used to sit and wonder whether we should ever
   join in such talk as that. But where do you hear it now?" So I said to
   him, "I hope that we can hear it in a great many places." He said, "I
   do not meet with it. I find that

   the ordinary talk among professors has not much in it for the helping
   of souls onward towards Heaven." I do not profess to form a judgment on
   this matter, but I will say this--it is a great pity if holy
   conversation is a scarce commodity--and it is well for you and for me
   to get away from that conversation which does not benefit us. If there
   is no salt in conversation, it will be unsavory to a true Christian
   spirit, and the less he has of it, the better.

   Again, there is some talk in the world--I hope not among
   professors--which has no salt in it even of common morality and,
   consequently, it corrupts and becomes impure and obnoxious. Old Trapp
   says, somewhat roughly, that it is full of maggots and that is,
   perhaps, what Job meant. That is to say, many persons use coarse
   allusions and evil sugges-tions--to such things shut your ears! Things
   are often said which sparkle, but the flash is born of decay. The wit
   which owes its pungency to sin is of the devil. The brilliance which
   comes of corruption is not for holy eyes. Oh, child of God, never
   tolerate it in your company! If it is not in your power to stop evil
   communications, remove yourself out of their reach. It is not for us to
   associate with those whose lips are cankered with lascivious words.

   We have enough within these gunpowder hearts to make us afraid to go
   near the forge when the sparks are flying about. Let us keep ourselves
   from ever permitting corrupt communication to proceed out of our own
   lips--that would be horrible, indeed. Let us avoid all company in which
   the purity of a renewed heart would be in danger of taint. Yet I fear
   that in our daily avocations we shall have grave cause to watch against
   the things which are unsavory and corrupt, for the preserving salt is
   not so abundantly used in these days as it ought to be.

   Now, the same thing is true, not only of common conversation, but of a
   great deal of modern teaching. Have nothing to do with teaching that is
   tainted with heresy, Brothers and Sisters! If a man's discourse has not
   salt enough in it to keep false doctrine out of it, it is not the kind
   of food for you. Clean provender is not so scarce that you need to eat
   carrion. Some like their meat rather high and there are hearers who are
   inclined to a preacher who has a sniff of heresy about him. But, as for
   us, our taste conducts us where salt is found. Where Grace is lacking
   we are not eager to be feeding! The banquets of the Truth of God need
   not be supplemented by the tables of error. But I shall not dwell upon
   this because I require all my time for the third head.

   III. The third point is that THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS IN THE WORLD
   WHICH NEED SOMETHING

   ELSE WITH THEM. "Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? Or
   is there any taste in the white of an egg?" There are many things in
   this world which we cannot tolerate by themselves--they need seasoning.
   One of the first of these may read us a lesson of prudence, that is,
   reproof. It is a Christian duty to reprove a Brother who is in a
   sin--we should speak to him with all gentleness and quietness--that we
   may prevent his going farther into evil and lead him back to the right
   way.

   But will you please remember, Brothers and Sisters, that the giving of
   reproofs is delicate work and needs a delicate hand. It was said of
   good Andrew Fuller that frequently he gave a rebuke so severely that it
   reminded you of one who saw a fly upon his Brother's forehead and
   seized a sledge hammer to knock it off. It is the habit of some
   Brethren to do everything forcibly. But in this case one needs more
   love than vigor, more prudence than warmth, more Grace than energy.
   Some persons have a very quick eye for the faults of others and they
   have a ready tongue to descant upon them when they perceive them--to
   all which they add a tendency to exaggerate the importance of the
   fault.

   Now, these Brethren always reprove in a wrong way. Listen. One of them
   cries--"Come here, Brother! Come here. Let me take that beam out of
   your eye." The aforesaid "beam" is really only a gnat and the Brother
   who is addressed becomes indignant at such injustice and will not have
   his eye touched at all. Why destroy your own influence by such
   unwisdom? If the gnat can be removed, well and good. But if you will
   ruin the eye in the process, would it not be better to leave it alone?
   We have known persons who, to spread the Truth of God, have killed
   love, which is the Truth of God's life. They wish to set a Brother
   right in doctrine and, in order that his sight may be clearer, they
   knock his eyes out and call it "controversy."

   It is one thing to be "valiant for the truth," and quite another thing
   to be bitter for your own opinion. Rebuke, however kindly you put it,
   and however prudently you administer it, will always be an unsavory
   thing! Therefore, salt it well. Think over it. Pray over it. Mix
   kindness with it. Rub the salt of brotherly love into it. Speak with
   much deference to your erring friend and use much tenderness, because
   you are not faultless yourself. Speak acknowledging all the excellences
   and virtues of your Brother which may, after all, be greater than your
   own. And try, if you can, to wrap up what you have to say in gentle
   words of praise for something else in which the friend excels. Express
   the rebuke in one of your

   Master's sentences, if you can find one that will exactly fit. Give
   your patient the pill silver-coated with gentleness--it will be
   received the more willingly and have none the less efficacy.

   If you speak unkindly, the reproved one may turn round upon you in
   anger. And if you ask him why he is angry, he may answer, "Can that
   which is unsavory be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the
   white of an egg?" Do not expect your neighbor to eat your eggs without
   salt! Do not expect him to receive your words of rebuke without the
   true kindness of voice and spirit which will act as salt. Be not silent
   about sin, but be not harsh in your rebuke of it. Savor your
   admonitions with affection and may the Lord make them acceptable to
   those who need them.

   Now, for other matters which many people do not like by themselves. I
   mean the Doctrines of the Gospel. The true Doctrines of the Gospel
   never were popular and never will be, but there is no need for any of
   us to make them more distasteful than they naturally are. The human
   heart especially revolts at the Sovereignty of Divine Grace. Man is a
   king, so he thinks, and when he hears of another King, he straightway
   grows rebellious. Man would have God bound hand and foot to give His
   mercy as man likes--and when the Lord defies the bond and declares, "I
   will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion
   on whom I will have compassion," man burns with wrath!

   When the Lord says, "It is not of him that wills or of him that runs,
   but of God who shows mercy," man is up in arms! He will not tolerate
   the Divine prerogative. It becomes us who preach this doctrine to take
   care that we do not add needless offensiveness to it. Not one of the
   Doctrines of Grace is palatable to natural man. He does not like the
   truth of Total Depravity. Over that he grows exceedingly angry. He
   calls it a libel upon the nobility of human nature. I have often read
   of human nature as a noble thing, but I am sorry to say that I have
   never seen it in that aspect. I am told that our fallen nature is
   sublime and that we defame mankind when we speak of them as altogether
   fallen and say, "There is none that does good, no, not one." It is
   little wonder that this is unsavory to carnal pride!

   As to the doctrine of Justification by Faith Alone, Mrs. Toogood stamps
   her foot at such teaching--is she to be none the better for all her
   good works? Mr. Good-Enough gnashes his teeth at the idea that human
   merits cannot save! He cannot endure to hear that we must be saved by
   faith in Jesus Christ and that the most moral and excellent need Christ
   just as much as the most depraved and abandoned! Carnal minds have no
   taste for the Gospel--they rave against the system of theology that
   glorifies God! Man wants to be the great MAN and he would have God to
   be the little god and then he will be satisfied. But if God is set on
   high as being All in All, then straightway many are offended.

   Brothers and Sisters, since we need people to receive these doctrines,
   what must we do? We must mix an abundance of salt with them! If the
   Gospel is distasteful, we must add flavoring to it. What shall it be?
   We cannot do better than flavor it with holiness! Where there is a holy
   life, men cannot easily doubt the principles out of which it springs.
   If it is so that men and women are kindly, generous, tender,
   affectionate, upright, truthful, Christ-like because of the doctrines
   they hold, then the world begins to think that there must be truth in
   those doctrines! The evangelical school must always draw its strongest
   arguments, first, from the Gospel and, next, from the lives of its
   believers--and if we cannot point to those who profess this faith as
   being famous for holiness--what will the world say?

   In former ages, holy living has been our battle-ax and weapons of war.
   Look at the Puritan age. To this day it is the stumbling-block of
   infidelity! In these times it is very common to laugh at the Puritans
   and to say that their faith is worn out and that we have got beyond
   their teaching. And yet the very same men who say this cannot read
   Carlyle's writings without marveling at Oliver Cromwell and the great
   men who trooped around him. Do they never say to themselves, "Upon what
   meat did these men feed that they have grown so great?" They cannot
   turn to the lives of the Puritans without reading how they saturated
   all England with godliness, till, as you passed down Cheapside in the
   morning, you would have noticed that there was scarcely a single house
   in which the blinds were not drawn down because the inhabitants were at
   family prayer!

   The whole land felt the force of the Truth of God and righteousness
   through these men--these poor, benighted, foolish Puritans whom our
   boys fresh from college call by names. In their contests for the Truth
   of God, the Puritans were as mighty as Cromwell's Ironsides in the days
   of battle when they drove the foe before them like chaff before the
   wind! Then there followed an age of driveling in which our
   Non-conformity existed--but gradually dwindled down, first into
   Arminianism and then into Unitarianism--until it almost ceased to be.
   Men know that it was so and yet they would act it all over again! They
   read history and yet demand that the old Doctrines of Grace should
   again be given

   up--and the experiment be tried again of starving our churches with
   human philosophies. Oh, fools and slow of heart! Will not history teach
   them?

   No, it will not if the Bible does not. If they hear not Christ and His
   Apostles, neither will they believe even though another Unitarian ghost
   should pass before their eyes. Surely evil days are near unless the
   Church shall again clasp the Truths of God to her heart! But I diverge.
   The point I had in hand was this--that in the case of the Puritans,
   their doctrines were rendered respectable and forceful by their
   glorious lives--and it must be so now. Holy living must salt our
   doctrines! We must be like Christ that men may believe what we have to
   say about Christ!

   Now, a third egg which cannot be eaten without salt is affliction.
   Afflictions are very unsavory things. I think I hear one say, "I should
   not mind any affliction except the one which now oppresses me."
   Brother, you speak as other foolish Brethren have done before you! This
   has been my language in my turn! Somebody sitting next to you would not
   mind your affliction at all--at least that is what he thinks! He thinks
   it is his own cross which is so galling. The loads borne by people in
   yonder street have no great weight for you. But if you had to carry a
   sack of flour, yourself, the sack would prove very heavy. We all know
   the weight of our own burden and we underestimate that of others.
   People in trouble know where their own shoe pinches--yet other people's
   shoes pinch, too--and other people's crosses are weighty. "No
   affliction for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous."

   Afflictions are unsavory meat. What is to be done with them, then? Why,
   let us salt them, if we can. Salt your affliction with patience and it
   will make a royal dish! By Grace, like the Apostle, we shall, "glory in
   tribulations also." Look at those who endure constant infirmities. Do
   you know any? I do. A dear Sister has been blind many years and yet I
   do not know a happier woman than she. She has more visions of joy than
   the most of us, though her eyes are closed to the light of the sun. I
   know a Brother in the ministry who has lost his sight almost entirely,
   but he preaches more sweetly than he ever did! He has become a seer in
   our Israel, enjoying a depth of insight into the Truths of God which
   few possess. Truly the lame take the prey!

   Some that are deaf hear the voice of their Master better than others.
   And so infirmities become things to glory in, since more of Christ's
   power rests upon us. It is so when the Lord gives Grace to the poor man
   and he becomes content with his lot. Has he not far greater joy than
   the rich man who still craves for more? Many of God's poor prisoners in
   the martyr days were happier in prison than they ever were out of it.
   In the days of the Covenanters, when they worshipped God on the bleak
   hill or by the moss side, the Lord was specially near to them. When
   those times had passed away and they went to plenty and sat with the
   congregation undisturbed, they said, "Ah, man, the Lord was not here
   today as He was out on the brae and on the hillside." The Master was
   transfigured before His disciples among the mists of the glens. Then He
   wore no veil over His face, but He revealed Himself so clearly that the
   sanctuary among the hills was none other than the House of God and the
   very gate of Heaven!

   The Lord salted their afflictions with His Presence and with the
   abundant power of the Holy Spirit--and so they enjoyed a sweet savor in
   them. It is even thus with you and me--

   "I can do all things, or can bear All sufferings if my Lord is there.
   Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains, While His left hand my head
   sustains." There now, Brother, do not go on eating that egg without
   salt! No longer say to yourself, "Here is nothing but the white, with
   no taste in it. I cannot bear to eat such loathsome food." Put the salt
   in, Brother! Put the salt in, Sister! Have you been forgetting that
   salt? Have you failed to ask the Lord for Grace equal to your day?
   Grace to see that "all things work together for good to them that love
   God"? Be forgetful no longer, but throw in a pinch of salt! Then the
   tasteless thing will go down comfortably enough and you will bless the
   name of the Lord for it.

   I will not detain you longer to speak about persecution, though that is
   another unsavory article with which salt of consolation is much to be
   desired. But, lastly, there is the thought of death. Is not death an
   unsavory thing in itself? The body dreads dissolution and corruption
   and the mind starts back from the prospect of quitting the warm
   precincts of this house of clay and going into what seems a cold,
   rarefied region where the shivering spirit flits naked into untried
   mystery. Who likes to sit down and think of his last hour--the corpse,
   the coffin and the shroud? The spade, the mattock and the falling clods
   make poor music for happy minds! Who cares for morgues?

   Oh, but dear Friends, thoughts of death, when they are salted, are
   among the richest, daintiest things that ever come to the Believer's
   table! What is it to die? Is it not to end our pilgrimage and come to
   the place where the many mansions are? Is it not to quit the
   storm-tossed seas for the Fair Havens where all is forever bliss? Death
   strips the soul of its garments and, by itself, this seems a trying
   process--but season it well and you will long for evening in order to
   undress that you may rest with God! Salt it well and you will almost
   grow impatient of your length of days and look for your last hours as
   children do for their holidays when they may go home!. Salt it well and
   your heart will grow like hers whose husband tarries away and she
   reckons how long it will be before he will come home, again, to her
   house and to her heart!

   You will cry, "Why are His chariots so long in coming?" I have known
   saints to salt their thoughts of death until they were transfigured
   into visions of Heaven and they began to drink of that wine of the
   Kingdom which the Beloved will drink new with us in the day of His
   appearing! Oh, happy spirits who can do this! "What salt," you ask,
   "shall I mingle with my thoughts of death?" Why the thought that you
   cannot die! Because He lives, you shall live, also! Add to it the
   persuasion that though you are dead, you shall yet live. Thoughts of
   the Resurrection and the swinging open of the pearly gates and of your
   entrance there! Thoughts of the vision of the Well-Beloved's face!
   Thoughts of the glory that shall be yours forever and ever at His own
   right hand! These are the things with which to savor your meditations
   among the tombs.

   As for you that are not in Christ, you must eat this unsavory meat and
   there will be no salt with it. I see you put it away from you. You say,
   "No, I do not mean to think of death." Oh, Man, but you will have to
   die, and it may be soon. Oh, Woman, you will have to die--the seeds of
   death are now in your bosom. As surely as you live, you will have to
   die! And after death, the judgment. This is the meat which will be laid
   in your dish and there will be no leaving it. This is the white of the
   egg and you must even down with it, whether you will or not! It has no
   taste which your palate can enjoy. It has no savor about it but that of
   fear. Ah, when your conscience awakes, what will you do with the
   burning thought that, dying, you must go where hope can never come?

   O Soul, if you pass out of this world as you are, you can never see the
   face of God with joy! You will be driven from His Presence and from the
   glory of His power to experience what it means--"Where their worm dies
   not and their fire is not quenched." They say that everlasting does not
   mean everlasting. What then? Are the righteous to perish after a while?
   In these two sentences the same word must mean the same thing--"These
   shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life
   eternal." If eternal life lasts forever, so must eternal punishment!

   When the righteous cease to be, the wicked will cease to be. When the
   godly cease their joy, the ungodly will cease their misery--but not
   till then! That is unsavory meat for you. The Lord help you to salt it,
   even now, by believing in Jesus and so finding eternal salvation. Amen.

Accepted of the Great Father

   (No. 1731)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 15, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He has made us accepted in the Beloved." Ephesians 1:6.

   A FEW Sabbath mornings ago I spoke to you upon those memorable words of
   the great Father, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased"
   [The Voice from the Cloud and the Voice of the Beloved--Sermon #1727.]
   We now go a step farther and see how the love of God to His beloved Son
   overflows and runs like a river of life to all those who are in Christ
   Jesus. To Jesus He says, "This is My beloved Son," and then He turns to
   all who are in union with Him and says, "These, also, are My beloved
   for His sake." As Believers we are assured by the text that we are
   "accepted in the Beloved," to the praise of the glory of God's Grace!
   Why is that peculiar title used here? It might have been said we are
   accepted in Christ, or accepted in the Mediator! There must be some
   motive for giving Him this special name in this place.

   The motive is declared to be that we may praise the glory of Divine
   Grace. God did not need a beloved when He made us His beloved--His
   heart was not pining for an object--His affections were not lonely and
   desolate. His only-begotten Son was His delight and there was room
   enough in Him for all the Father's love! It was we that needed to be
   loved and so the Beloved is mentioned that we may remember the
   unselfishness of Divine Grace. He makes us His beloved, but He already
   had a Beloved. We are also reminded that we are "accepted in the
   Beloved" to let us know that God has not shifted His love--His first
   Beloved is still His Beloved. We have not supplanted His dear Son, nor
   even diverted a beam of love from Him.

   The Lord has called us beloved who were not so and made us a people who
   were not a people. But He has not withdrawn a grain of love from Jesus,
   whom He still calls, "My Elect, in whom My soul delights." All the
   infinite love of God still flows to Jesus and then to us in Him. It
   pleased the Father that to Him a fullness of love should be given, that
   out of it we might each one receive. Gods love to us is His love to His
   Son flowing in a hundred channels. For His sake He makes the wedding
   feast and we are the happy guests who sit at the table. Not for our
   sakes is this done, but for Jesus' sake, that so it might be all of
   Grace. His perpetual acceptance with God is our acceptance--that
   nothing legal, nothing of which we might boast--might be mingled with
   the work of Sovereign Grace. We are "accepted in the Beloved."

   Do you not love that sweet title? Is it not the highest quality of the
   acceptance, that it comes through such an One? He is beloved in the
   highest conceivable degree by the Father and in this you imitate the
   great God, for to you, also, the Lord Jesus is altogether lovely. He is
   your Beloved as well as God's Beloved--and this is one proof that you
   are ac-cepted--for all who truly love the Son are approved by the
   Father. Thus says the Scripture--"Because he has set His love upon Me,
   therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high because he has
   known My name."

   Is Christ your Beloved? Then, as He is the Father's Beloved, you and
   the Father have evidently come to a sweet agreement! You have come to
   look at things from the same standpoint as the glorious Jehovah. The
   Lord and you evidently have a mutual interest in one common Person--the
   Incarnate God. Your recognition of Christ as your Beloved is thus a
   sure proof that you are accepted in the Beloved! Do you see this? It is
   because He is the Father's Beloved that the Father loves you in Him.
   And because He is your Beloved, therefore you have an evidence within
   yourself that you have come to an agreement with the Father and so to
   an acceptance by Him!

   I delight in being accepted all the more because therein I am still
   further linked with Him who joins God and man in one grand affection!
   God's love of His dear Son covers all Believers, as a canopy covers all
   who come beneath it. As a hen covers her chickens with her wings, so
   God's love to Christ covers all the children of promise. As the sun
   shining forth from the gates of the morning gilds all the earth with
   golden splendor, so this great love of God to the Well-Beloved,
   streaming forth to Him, enlightens all who are in Him! God is so
   boundlessly pleased with Jesus that in Him He is alto-

   gether well pleased with us. Oh, the joy of this blending of our
   interests with those of the Well-Beloved! I scarcely know where I am
   borne, even by a single word of my text.

   Let this stand for our preface and now let us come close to our
   subject, upon which I do not desire so much to preach as to lead you
   individually to meditate and personally to feed. I would much rather
   put the text into your mouths as a sweet fruit from the garden of the
   Lord, most mellow and ripe, than be judged, myself, to handle it well.
   I seek not to exhibit my own skill in words, but I long that you may be
   refreshed with the marrow and fatness of this choice Word of God! I
   desire that you may, this morning, experimentally enjoy the precious
   drop of honey from the Rock, Christ Jesus, which is contained in the
   four words--"Accepted in the Beloved." Oh that the Holy Spirit may make
   you enter into the treasures which they contain!

   I. I will begin by treating the text by way of CONTRAST. Brothers and
   Sisters, the Grace of God has made us to be, this day, "accepted in the
   Beloved." But it was not always so. As many of us as have, through
   Grace, believed in Christ, we are, now, to a certainty, at this very
   moment, "accepted in the Beloved." But in times past it was very
   different. It is not a matter of question, nor of imagination, nor of
   sentiment, but a matter offact, declared by the Holy Spirit, Himself,
   that the Lord has "made us accepted in the Beloved." But it was far
   otherwise a little while ago. What a contrast is our present condition
   of acceptance to our position under the Law through Adam's fall!

   By actual sin we made ourselves to be the very reverse of accepted, for
   we were utterly refused. It might have been said of us, "Reprobate
   silver shall men call them, because God has rejected them." Our way was
   contrary to God's way! Our thoughts were not His thoughts, our hearts
   were not according to His heart. Oh, if He had dealt with us, then,
   according to our sins--what would have become of us? At that time we
   were condemned, "condemned already," because we had not believed on the
   Son of God! We had no acceptableness before God. He could take no
   complacency in us. His pure and holy eyes could not look upon us--we
   were full of everything that provoked Him to jealousy!

   But now we are--oh, let me pronounce it like music!--"accepted in the
   Beloved." The criminal is now a child! The enemy is now a friend! The
   condemned one is now justified! Mark, it is not said that we are
   "acceptable," though that were a very great thing, but we are actually
   accepted--it has become not a thing possible that God might accept us,
   but He has accepted us in Christ! Lay this to your soul and may it fill
   you with delight! The Lord has chosen you--He has received you to
   Himself and set His love upon you--and His delight is now in you! What
   a contrast from what you were a season ago in your own
   consciousness--in your own judgment.

   Refresh your memories a little. If you passed through the same state of
   mind as I did, you loathed your very selves in the sight of God. You
   felt that God must abhor you, for you abhorred yourselves! You saw sin
   to be exceedingly sinful and that sinful thing was permeating your
   entire being, saturating your thoughts, putrefying your aims, making
   you to be corrupt and offensive in the sight of the Most High! I know I
   felt that if the Lord swept me away with the broom of destruction and
   cast me into the lowest Hell, I well deserved it.

   But now that condemnation is no more to be dreaded! We receive not the
   spirit of bondage, but the spirit of adoption! Lift up your eyes out of
   the thick darkness and behold the Light of God! You who, in your own
   judgment, were cast away forever! You who thought that the Lord would
   never be favorable to you, nor blot out your sins, are this day
   ac-cepted--"accepted in the Beloved!" No contrast could be more sharp
   and clear and no reflections could be more joyful than this contrast
   suggests to the heart. Think, again, of the contrast between what you
   are now and what you would have been had not Grace stepped in. Left out
   of Christ as we then were, we might, at this time, have been going from
   sin to sin, reveling and rioting in it, as so many do. We might at this
   moment have been sinning with a high hand, finding even in the Lord's
   Day a special opportunity for double transgression!

   In our daring rebellion we might have been crying, "The better the day,
   the better the deed," and so might have shown how completely we had
   thrown off the yoke of allegiance to the great King. Yes, by this we
   might have been dead as the result of our own sins. The measure of our
   iniquity might have been full and we might have been in Hell! Be
   startled, my Soul, at this thought--that nothing but infinite
   long-suffering has kept you out of the Pit that is bottomless, "where
   their worm dies not, and their fire is not quenched." But, Brothers and
   Sisters, we are not in Hell and, what is more, we never shall be, for
   those iron gates can never close upon a soul that is "accepted in the
   Beloved!" And that is our condition now. We have fled for refuge to the
   hope set before us and now no more need we be in terror of the Great

   White Throne and the righteous Judge, and the stern sentence, "Depart,
   you cursed." Clinging to the Cross and beholding ourselves covered with
   the righteousness of Christ, we know that we are saved and, what is
   more, we are accepted!

   This blessed fact is true of those who might have been among the
   damned! Our laments might have been going up today amidst the wailings
   of the wretched who are eternally cast away from hope! But now, instead
   thereof, we lift the joyful song of praise unto our God and bless and
   magnify His name in whom this day we are accepted! Oh, my Soul, sing
   your own song to your Beloved--"Just as You are--how wondrous fair,
   Lord Jesus, are all Your members! A life Divine to them is given--a
   long inheritance in Heaven--

   "Just as I was I came to You,

   An heir of wrath and misery!

   Just as You are before the Throne,

   I stand in righteousness Your own.

   Just as You are--nor doubt, nor fear,

   Can with Your spotlessness appear;

   Oh timeless love! As You, I'm seen,

   The righteousness of God in Him." One more point I cannot quite pass
   over, and that is the contrast between what we now are and all we ever
   could have been in the most favorable circumstances apart from the
   Beloved. If it had been possible for us, out of Christ, to have had
   desires after righteousness, yet those desires would all have run in a
   wrong direction! We wd have had a zeal of God, but not according to
   knowledge, and so, going about to establish our own righteousness, we
   would not have submitted ourselves to the righteousness of God. We
   would have been weaving a righteousness of our own with heavy
   la-bor--which would have proved no better, when completed, than a
   cobweb that could never conceal our nakedness!

   At this moment the prayers we offered would never have been received at
   the Throne of God. The praises we presented would have been unsavory
   unto God. All that we could have aimed to accomplish in the matter of
   good works, had we striven to our utmost, would have been done in
   willfulness and pride--and so must necessarily have fallen short of
   acceptance. We should have heard the voice of the Eternal saying,
   "Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto Me!"--for
   out of Christ our righteousness is as unacceptable as our
   unrighteousness--and all our attempts to merit acceptance increase our
   unworthiness.

   Oh, strive as you will, you self-righteous! Labor as you may after a
   righteousness of your own--what can come of it but confusion? Why is it
   that the people labor as in the very fire? This shall they have at the
   Lord's hands--they shall lie down in sorrow! The bed is shorter than a
   man may stretch himself on it and the covering is narrower than what a
   man may wrap himself in it! Woe unto the man who is out of Christ,
   wherever he may be! In any case, the wrath of God abides on him.

   But we are not out of Christ, we are not striving in vain, we are not
   spending our strength for nothing, for here is the blessed contrast--we
   are "accepted in the Beloved!" A touch of the black pencil brings out
   the bright lights and, therefore, I have laid on these shades. Such
   were some of you, but now you are washed; now you are sanctified; now
   you are justified; now you are "accepted in the Beloved." All glory be
   unto the Grace by which we have received this heavenly benefit!

   II. Secondly, we will say a little by way of EXPLANATION, that the text
   may sink yet deeper into your hearts and afford you richer enjoyment.
   Remember, Brothers and Sisters, that once we were pitied of God as
   poor, lost, self-destroyed creatures that were, in a degree, hopeful.
   We were chosen of God while in that pitiable condition and, although
   forlorn, wretched and ruined, yet were we marked by His electing
   love--this was still more encouraging. Then came a time of dealing with
   us and we were pardoned--our transgressions were put away--we were
   renewed in the spirit of our minds by the Holy Spirit! The
   righteousness of Christ was imputed to us and, at length, burst forth
   the light of this Word of God, "He has made us accepted in the
   Beloved."

   Much went before this, but, oh, what a morning without clouds rose upon
   us when we knew our acceptance and were assured of it! Acceptance was
   the watchword and had troops of angels met us, we should have rejoiced
   that we were as blest as they! Understand that this acceptance comes to
   us entirely as a work of God--"He has made us accepted in the Beloved."
   We never made ourselves acceptable, nor could we have done so! He that
   first made us in creation, has now

   made us new, by His Grace, and so has made us accepted in the Beloved.
   That this was an act of pure Grace there can be no doubt, for the verse
   runs thus, "Wherein He has made us accepted in the Beloved"--that is,
   made us by His Grace.

   There was no reason in ourselves why we should have been put into
   Christ and so accepted. The reason lay in the heart of the Eternal
   Father, Himself. He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy--and by
   this will we were saved. To the great First Cause we must always trace
   the motive for our acceptance. Grace reigns supreme! It is a gracious
   acceptance of those who but for Grace had been rejected. Notice this
   and dwell upon the Truth of God, glorifying God therein.

   Again, our acceptance is "in the Beloved." It is only as we are in
   Christ that we are accepted. Let no man steal out of Christ and then
   say, "God has accepted me." Nothing of the kind! If the Lord views you
   apart from Christ, whoever you may be, you are a thing to be consumed
   and not to be accepted "in the Beloved," that is, as it were, within
   the gates of a City of Refuge. You must abide within that wall of fire
   of which the Cross is the center, or else you are not accepted. You
   must remain within the arms of the Well-Beloved, living in the very
   heart of Christ, and then you shall know yourself to be "accepted in
   the Beloved." For Christ's sake and because you are a part of Him, you
   shall be approved of the Father. He has taken you into Covenant union
   so that you can say with the favored Apostle, "Truly our fellowship is
   with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ." Therefore the Father
   accepts you because He cannot dissociate you from His Son, nor His Son
   from you, nor think of Christ without you, nor of you without Christ!
   Therefore it is, you are, "accepted in the Beloved."

   That explains the words. The following remarks may make the sense
   somewhat more transparent. No man, my Brothers and Sisters, can be
   accepted of God while he is guilty of sin, so that our acceptance in
   the Beloved involves the fact that our sin, at this moment, is forever
   put away. Our unrighteousness is covered and, therefore, we are free
   from condemnation and we are accepted! Realize this Truth of God! It
   does not require any oratory to set it forth--it needs only that your
   faith should fully apprehend it. Realize that you are forgiven right
   now. With your eyes upon the wounds of Christ, say unto your soul by
   the Spirit, "I am without spot or wrinkle in the sight of God, for
   Christ has washed me whiter than driven snow." He has said of His
   people, "You are clean every whit." Rejoice in this! You could not be
   accepted if He had not made you clean, for the filthy are not accepted
   of the Lord.

   Neither could God accept a man devoid of righteousness. A mere
   colorless person, whose sin was forgiven, but who had no righteousness,
   could not be acceptable with Him. I cannot suppose the existence of
   such a being! But if there were such, he would be like one who was
   neither cold nor hot and must be vomited out of God's mouth! He that is
   accepted with God must be positively righteous! Very well, then, if He
   has made Believers "accepted in the Beloved," they that believe in
   Christ are righteous in the sight of God! Mark you, they are NOT
   righteous with a sham righteousness, an imaginary, fictitious
   righteousness! No, the righteousness which is of faith is the most real
   righteousness under Heaven! The righteousness of works may be
   questioned, but the righteousness of faith cannot be, for it is the
   righteousness of God Himself! Now drink that in. Do not let me hold it
   up and show you what a draught it is, but drink it up for yourselves!
   You are righteous in Christ, or else you could not be accepted! Sin is
   gone and righteousness is positively yours.

   Now to come back again. If we are, indeed, "accepted in the Beloved,"
   does it not show how close, how real our union with the Beloved must
   be? Do we even share in Christ's acceptance with God? Then we are one
   with Him in everything! Here is a father who has no particular interest
   in such-and-such a woman, but his son takes to himself that woman to be
   his wife. And now the loving father says, "That woman is my daughter,"
   and so she is received into his love for his son's sake. He says to
   her, "You are my dear son's wife; therefore you are my daughter and
   dear to me. You are welcome in my house at any time."

   Thus it is with the great God. He says to us, whom Christ has espoused
   unto Himself, that we may be His bride in blessed conjugal union
   forever and ever! "Come to My heart, My children, for He is My Son and
   I love you for His sake; I accept you in Him." Is not that a wonderful
   union--closer than the marriage bond--which causes us to share in
   Christ's righteousness so that the holy God can say to us who are
   sinful by nature, "You are acceptable to Me because of your connection
   with My Son"? If a woman of base character were married to the best of
   men, it would not make her acceptable. A father scarcely know what to
   do with such a daughter-in-law! We would try and carry out our
   relationship, as far as we could, with all kindness, but we could
   hardly say that such a person brought into our family by marriage would
   be acceptable to us!

   But, oh, the Lord sees His people so wrapped up in Christ that He must
   accept them in Him! If I accept a man, I cannot quarrel with his little
   finger. If I accept a man, I accept his whole body and so, since the
   Father accepts Christ, He accepts every member of His mystical body! If
   I am one with Christ, though I am but, as it were, only the sole of His
   foot, and exposed often to the mire of the streets, yet, because the
   glorious Head is accepted, the meanest member joined in living union to
   that Head is accepted, too! Is not this glorious? Can you get a firm
   hold of it? Unless you intelligently grasp its full significance, you
   will not heartily enjoy this unspeakable privilege! But if your faith
   receives and welcomes it, you will not need any further explanation.

   "You are accepted in the Beloved" and it is clear that there is a
   blessed union between you and Christ. The acceptance which the Father
   gives to Christ, He gives to you. Now, see if you can measure it. How
   acceptable is Christ to God? Must it not be an infinite acceptance? For
   it is an infinite Being infinitely accepting an infinitely holy and
   well-pleasing One--and then accepting us who are in Him with the same
   acceptance! Oh, how acceptable is every Believer to the eternal Father
   in Christ Jesus!

   III. Can we go a step farther? Will the Holy Spirit help us while I say
   a few words by way of ENLARGEMENT? If we are "accepted in the Beloved,"
   then, first, our persons are accepted--we ourselves are well-pleasing
   to Him. God now looks upon us with pleasure. Once He said of men that
   it repented Him that He had made them, but now when He looks at His
   people, He never repents that He made us. He is glad He made us! He
   takes delight in us! Look at your own children. Sometimes they grieve
   you, but still you are pleased with them. It is a pleasure to have them
   near you and if they are out of your sight very long, you grow anxious
   about them.

   They are soon coming home for their holidays--they are glad to return
   home and I am sure their mothers are glad at the thought of seeing them
   again. Our Father is as truly pleased with us--our very persons are
   accepted of God. He delights in us individually! He thinks of us with
   joy and when we are near Him, it gives pleasure to His great heart.
   Being ourselves accepted, the right of access to Him is given us. When
   a person is accepted with God, he may come to God when he chooses. He
   is one of those sheep who may go in and out and find pasture. He is one
   of those courtiers who may come, even, to the royal Throne and meet
   with no rebuff. No chamber of our great Father's house is closed
   against us!

   No blessing of the Covenant is withheld from us! No sweet smile of the
   Father's face is refused us. He that accepted us gives us access into
   all blessings. "See, I have accepted you concerning this thing, also."
   You remember the story of King Ahasuerus and his poor trembling spouse,
   Esther--how she ventured in at peril of her life--for if her royal lord
   and master did not stretch out the golden scepter, the guards that
   stood about the throne would cut her down? The queen, royal though she
   was, dared to come unbidden into the despot's presence. But today, when
   you and I come to God, we have no fear of that kind because we are
   already accepted--He has already stretched out to us the golden scepter
   and He bids us come boldly.

   All is well between us and Him. We have access with boldness into this
   Grace in which we stand. And, being accepted, ourselves, our prayers
   are also accepted. Children of God, can you sincerely believe this? Do
   you not sometimes pray as if you were beggars in the street, pleading
   with unwilling persons to give you a gratuity of coppers? I believe
   many children of God do so, but when we know we are "accepted in the
   Beloved," we speak to God with a sweet confidence--expecting Him to
   answer us! To us it is no surprise that our heavenly Father should hear
   our prayers. He does it so often and so generously that we expect Him
   to do so always! It is a way of His to hear the prayers of the
   Well-Beloved. When unaccepted men pray, they pray unaccepted prayers.
   But when accepted men plead with God, He says, "In an acceptable day
   have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I succored you."

   When God delights in men, He gives them the desires of their hearts.
   Oh, the splendor of that man's position who is "accepted in the
   Beloved!" To him the Lord seems to say, "Ask what you will and it shall
   be given you, not only to the half of My kingdom, but My kingdom,
   itself, shall be yours--you shall sit with Me upon My throne." Oh, the
   blessedness of being "accepted in the Beloved" because the acceptance
   makes our prayers to be as sweet incense before the Lord! It follows,
   then, as a pleasant sequence, that our gifts are accepted, for those
   who are accepted with God find a great delight in giving of their
   substance to the glory of His name.

   I know that when money is needed for the Church of God and one of the
   Brothers goes round to collect the offerings, the subjects of the
   kingdom are apt to say, "Here comes the tax-gatherer again." Yes, that
   is what the subjects say. Oh, but when the children are about, they
   cry, "Here is another opportunity of presenting an offering to our
   Father, a wel-

   come occasion of proving that our love to Him is pure, without greed or
   grudging." They clap their hands to think that they may come before the
   Lord with their sacrifices! Their only question is, "Will He accept it?
   Oh, what would I not give if I did but know that He would accept it?"
   Many a poor woman will take her two mites and not more stealthily than
   joyfully cast them into the treasury, as she says, "Will He really
   accept them when dropped into the offering box? Will He even know about
   them?"

   And some of God's children get schemes into their heads of doing great
   things for God, but they say, "May I not, after all, be working for
   myself? May it not be that pride and vain-glory so leaven my labors
   that 'the odor of a sweet smell,' like to that 'acceptable sacrifice'
   which the Philippians presented, will be all a-wanting." No, my
   Friends, my helpers in every good work--you need not ask that question
   if He has accepted you--for the accepted man brings an accepted
   offering! It is wonderful how God sees good things in His people where
   we cannot see them. He saw in Abijah some good thing towards the Lord
   God of Israel when, perhaps, no one else saw it.

   Mistress Sarah once made a rather naughty speech, yet there was one
   good word in it. I doubt very much if any one of us would have been
   quick enough to discern it. Yet the Holy Spirit picked out that one
   word and put it into the Old Testament to her praise! She spoke
   unbelievingly as to her bearing a child at her advanced age, thought
   the promise was announced that she should bring forth a son. She said,
   "Shall it be, I being old, my lord being old, also?" This was a bad
   speech, but we are somewhat startled to read in the New Testament, "As
   Sarah also obeyed her husband, calling him lord." If God can find a
   speck of good in us, He will! Then let us try what we can do for Him.
   Here is a great lump of quartz, but if the Lord can see a grain of
   gold, He will save the quartz for the sake of it. He says, "Destroy it
   not, for a blessing is in it."

   I do not mean that the Lord deals thus with all men. It is only for
   accepted men that He has this kind way of accepting their gifts. Had
   you seen me, when a young man, and an usher walking through the streets
   with rolls of drawings from a boys' school, you would have guessed that
   I considered them of no value and fit only to be consigned to the fire.
   But I always took a great interest in the drawings of my own boy and I
   still think them rather remarkable. You smile, I dare say, but I do so
   think and my judgment is as good as yours! I value them because they
   are his and I think I see budding genius in every touch! But you do not
   see it because you are so blind! I see it since love has opened my
   eyes!

   God can see in His people's gifts to Him and their works for Him a
   beauty which no eyes but His can perceive. Oh, if He so treats our poor
   service, what ought we not do for Him? What zeal, what cheerfulness
   should stimulate us! If we are accepted, our sacrifices shall be
   acceptable! The Almighty will permit us to be called His servants and
   we shall find His blessing resting on all that we do. If the tree is
   good, the fruit is good. As is the man so is his strength--and as is
   his prestige, so is his power. "Accepted in the Beloved" has for its
   accompaniment, "God has accepted your works."

   IV. We have thus pursued our train of thought in a contrast, an
   explanation and an enlargement. Let us now indulge in a few "Accepted
   in the Beloveds." May not each Believer talk thus with himself--I have
   my sorrows and grief. I have my aches and pains and weaknesses, but I
   must not repine, for God accepts me. Ah me! How one can laugh at griefs
   when this sweet word comes in, "accepted in the Beloved!" I may be
   blind, but I am "accepted in the Beloved!" I may be lame, I may be
   poor, I may be despised, I may be persecuted, I may have much to put up
   with in many ways, but really, these troubles of the flesh count for
   little or nothing to me since I am, "accepted in the Beloved!"

   I have to mourn over a multitude of infirmities and imperfections and
   there is never a day but I have repenting work to do and feel compelled
   to fly to the precious blood, again, for a renewed sense of pardon.
   Yes, but I am "accepted in the Beloved!" I have been struggling with
   this evil and that, and I hope I have got the victory, though I have
   had many a wound in the battle--yes, but I am, "accepted in the
   Beloved." I have just now been blaming myself for my shortcomings and
   mourning over my many slips and failures--yes, but I am, "accepted in
   the Beloved!" I am speaking for you, or at least I am trying to
   interpret your meditations--I want you to let this blessed fact go down
   sweetly with you--that whatever may be the trials of life, whatever the
   burdens that oppress you, whatever the difficulties of the way,
   whatever the infirmities of the body, whatever the frailties of the
   mind, still, as being, "in the Beloved," you are accepted!

   Oh, will you not be accepted when you stand where golden harps ring out
   perpetual hallelujahs? Where every robe is spotless, and every heart is
   sinless? Yes, but you will not be a jot more accepted, then, than you
   are now! In all this noise, strife and turmoil of everyday life, you
   are, "accepted in the Beloved!" Is not this present Grace in the
   highest perfection? What more can you have till you behold the unveiled
   face of infinite Love! Drink down that Truth of God, I pray you!

   Let a further reflection be added to the sweetness of your enjoyment.
   Think of who it is that accepts you. It is no common person who admits
   us to his favor--it is God, whose name is Jehovah, The Jealous God.
   "Holy, holy, Holy," cry the seraphim unceasingly--and nothing that is
   defiled can ever enter His palace gates, nor can His heart endure the
   thought of iniquity--and yet it is He that has accepted you!

   Did your Brethren cast you out? Did your friend condemn you? Did your
   own heart accuse you? Did the devil roar against you? What does it
   matter, for He has accepted you! "Who shall lay anything to the charge
   of God's elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he that condemns?" He
   has made us "accepted in the Beloved!" And if that is so, we need not
   fear what men can do to us. Now, just think again--He has made you
   "accepted it the Beloved." He that is God has accepted you in Christ!
   Would you have liked any other way of acceptance one half as well? For
   my part, I had infinitely rather receive everything through Christ than
   from myself. Mercy smells so much sweeter and better from the fact that
   it all comes from the dear, pierced hands of my Master!

   If I were, this day, accepted in myself, I should fear that I might
   lose my acceptance, for I am a poor, changeable being! But if I am
   "accepted in the Beloved," then the Beloved will never change and I
   always must and shall be accepted, come what may! Is not this a word to
   die with? We will meet death and face his open jaws with this word,
   "Accepted in the Beloved." Will not this be a word to rise with amidst
   the blaze of the great Judgment Day? You wake up from your tomb, lift
   up your eyes, and as you gaze upon the terrors of that tremendous hour,
   you say, "I am accepted in the Beloved"--what can fill you with alarm?
   Forever and ever, as the cycles of eternity revolve, will not this be
   the core and center of Heaven's most supreme bliss-- that we are still
   "accepted in the Beloved"?

   I hear strange theories, nowadays, of what may happen to the
   saints--they tell us sinners will die out, or be restored, or something
   else--for they are not content with the Scripture's teaching of
   eternity--they must invent strange notions about the punishment of the
   ungodly! Then they begin to picture new destiny for saints, too, and
   the Heaven of our fathers has sad doubts cast on it. I care not for
   their dreams, for I am "accepted in the Beloved!" It matters nothing
   what all the eternities can reveal--he that is accepted in Christ and
   eternally one with Him--has nothing before him at which he need
   tremble!

   My time is gone--I heard the warning bell just now--and so I must
   forbear to amplify on the many reflections that spontaneously flow out
   of our text--all fitted to stifle anxious care, to sweeten mortal life
   and to set our souls longing for the Home which is above where so
   hearty a welcome awaits us!

   V. So now I wish to finish with this one PRACTICAL USE. If it is so
   that we are "accepted in the Beloved," then let us go forth and tell
   poor sinners how they can be accepted, too. Are you, today, though
   unconverted, anxious to be found right at last? Listen, Friend! If you
   want to be accepted, you must accept! "And what," do you ask, "must I
   accept?" You must accept Christ as the free gift of God. You must
   accept Christ as God's way of accepting you, for if you get into Christ
   you are accepted. The guiltiest of the guilty may be accepted in Christ
   no matter how great and grievous their transgressions may have
   been--the atoning Sacrifice can take all their guilt away--and the
   perfect Righteousness can justify the most heinous sinner before God.
   You may be accepted!

   Listen! If you come to Christ, now, and trust Him, you will be
   accepted. Never did one come to Christ to be re-jected--you shall not
   be the first. Try it! And though you came into this house condemned,
   you shall go out accepted if you come, now, and hide in those dear
   wounds of His as doves hide in the clefts of the rocks! Listen again.
   It is not only that you may be accepted--it is rather that you will be
   accepted! You cannot but be accepted in Christ! There is no sort of
   fear nor possibility that you shall come to Christ and be cast out!
   Christ must change. The Truth of God must change. God must change
   towards His Well-Beloved--He must cease to love Him before He could
   refrain from loving a soul that is in Him!

   Guilty as you are, come to Christ this morning! Come! Despise not the
   exhortation, for you will be accepted--it cannot but be that you will
   be accepted if you come! And you shall be accepted at once. If at this
   moment you are as vile as vile can be, if, while I speak, you know that
   you are black as Hell's dark night, yet the moment that you come to
   Christ you are "accepted in the Beloved!" Trust Him! Trust Him! Have
   you done so? Your sin is gone! Righteousness is imputed! You are saved!

   And, then, to close, if you get into Christ you shall be accepted us
   long as you are in Christ and as the Grace of God will never let you go
   out of Christ, you shall be accepted forever--"accepted in the Beloved"
   world without end! If that is

   the verdict of this day, it shall be the verdict of every day till days
   shall be no more! The hope for you dying; the song for your rising
   again; the verdict which shall be given out when the great assize shall
   sit and you shall be tried for your life for the last time! They that
   sit in judgment shall say, "Let that man go! He is accepted in the
   Beloved." If you believe in Jesus, it shall be so! It IS so! It shall
   be so forever and ever! God bless you all by His good Spirit, for
   Christ's sake. Amen.

                                In Him: Like Him

   A Sermon

   (No. 1732)

   Delivered on Thursday Evening, May 17th, 1883, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as
   he walked."--1 John 2:6.

   He that saith he abideth in him: "--that is exactly what every
   Christian does say. He cannot be a Christian unless this be true of
   him, and be cannot fully enjoy his religion unless he assuredly knows
   that he is in Christ, and can boldly say as much. We must be in Christ,
   and abidingly in Christ, or else We are not saved in the Lord. It is
   our union with the Christ that makes us Christians: by union with him
   as our life we truly live,--live in the favour of God.--We are in
   Christ, dear brethren, as the manslayer was in the city of refuge: I
   hope that we can say we abide in him as our sanctuary and shelter. We
   have fled for refuge to him who is the hope set before us in the
   gospel; even as David and his men sheltered themselves in the eaves of
   En-gedi, so we hide ourselves in Christ. We each one sing, and our
   heart goes with the words--

   "Rock of ages, cleft for me,

   Let me hide myself in thee."

   We have entered into Christ as into the shadow of a great rock in a
   weary land, as guest; into a banquet-hall, as returning travellers into
   their home. And now we abide--in Christ in this sense, that we are
   joined to him : as the stone is, in the wall, as the wave is in the
   sea, as the branch is in the vine, so are we in Christ. As the branch
   receives all its sap from the stem, so all the sap of spiritual life
   flows from Christ into us. If we were separated from him, we should be
   as branches cut off from the vine, only fit to be gathered up for the
   fire, and to be burned. So that we abide in Christ as our shelter, our
   home, and our life. Today we remain in Christ, and hope for ever to
   remain in him, as our Head. Ours is no transient union; while he lives
   as our Head we shall remain his members. We are nothing apart from him.
   As a finger is nothing without the head, as the whole body is nothing
   without the head, so should we be nothing without our Lord Jesus
   Christ. But we are in him vitally, and therefore we dare ask the
   question, "Who shall separate us from the love of God which is in
   Christ Jesus our Lord?"

   Beloved, since we, then, are the people who say that we abide in him,
   it is upon us that the obligation of the text falls: we ought ourselves
   also so to walk even as he walked. A Bible ought has great weight with
   a conscientious man. Ought it to be so? Then it shall be so, God
   helping me. If we say we must do. If we talk, we must walk, or it will,
   be mere talk. If we make the profession of abiding in Christ, we must
   prove it by our practice of walking with Christ. If we say that we are
   in Christ and abide in him, we must take care that our life and
   character are conformed to Christ, or else we shall be making an empty
   boast. This is true of every man who says he is in Christ, for the text
   is put in the most general and absolute manner: be the man old or
   young, rich or poor, learned or simple, pastor or hearer, it is
   incumbent upon him to live like Christ if he professes to live in
   Christ.

   The first thing about a Christian is initiation, initiation into
   Christ: the next thing is imitation, the imitation of Christ. We cannot
   be Christians unless we are in Christ; and we are not truly in Christ
   unless in him we live and move and have our being, and the life of
   Christ is lived over again by us according to our measure. "Be ye
   imitators of God, as dear children." It is the nature of children to
   imitate their parents. Be ye imitators; of Christ as good soldiers, who
   cannot have a better model for their soldierly life than their Captain
   and Lord. Ought we not to be very grateful to Christ that he deigns to
   be our example? If he were not perfectly able to meet all our other
   wants, if he were an expiation and nothing else, we should glory in him
   as our atoning sacrifice, for we always put that to the front, and
   magnify the virtue of his precious blood beyond everything: but at the
   same time we need an example, and it is delightful to find it where we
   find our pardon and justification. They that are saved from the death
   of sin need to be guided in the life of holiness, and it is infinitely
   condescending on the part of Christ that he becomes an example to such
   poor creatures as we are. It is said to have been the distinguishing
   mark of Caesar as a soldier that he never said to his followers "Go!"
   but he always said "Come!" Of Alexander, also, it was noted that in
   weary marches he was sure to be on foot with his warriors, and in
   fierce attack's he always was in the van. The most persuasive sermon is
   the example which leads the way. This certainly is one trait in the
   Good Shepherd's character, "when he putteth forth his own sheep he
   goeth before them." If Jesus bids us do anything, he first does it
   himself. He would have us wash one another's feet; and this is the
   argument--"Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well; for so I am. If
   I, then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to
   wash one another's feet." Shall we not do as he does whom we profess to
   follow? He has left his footprints that we may set our feet in
   them.Will we not joyfully fix our feet upon this royal road?

   That is our theme at this time. We do many of us say that we are in
   Christ: let us hear how obliged we are by this to walk even as he
   walked. Oh, Holy Spirit, let us feel the weight of the sacred
   obligation!

   But I stop a minute. I know that there are some here who cannot say
   that they are in Christ. Then, if you are not in Christ, you are out of
   Christ; and out of Christ your position is dangerous, terrible,
   ruinous. If we saw a man hanging over a deep pit, if we saw a man
   exposed to a sea of fire, and likely to perish in it, all our tenderest
   emotions would begin to flow, and we should pray in an agony of spirit,
   "Oh, God, save this man from danger!" My brethren, there are some among
   us tonight who are in the utmost danger; in a most emphatic sense they
   are lost already, for they are without God, and without Christ,
   strangers to the commonwealth of Israel. Oh, my hearers, how shall I
   speak of you without tears? Poor souls, abiding under the wrath of God!
   Poor souls! The mercy is that you are not past hope. There is an arm
   that can reach you: there is a voice that calls you--calls you even
   now; hear it: "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the
   earth; for I am God, and besides me there is none else." Can you not
   even now give one look to him who died for you? Will you not turn the
   eye of faith that way, and trust him who was nailed to the tree on your
   behalf? God grant that you may, and then I may include you also in the
   blessed instruction of the text. "He that saith he abideth in him,
   ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."

   I. I shall first of all ask you to CONSIDER HOW THIS OBLIGATION IS
   PROVED. Let us spend a few minutes over the question, Why ought we to
   walk as Jesus did?

   When we read the word "ought," if we are honest men, we begin to look
   about us and to make enquiries as to the reason and the measure of this
   obligation. An "ought" is a compulsion to a true heart. There is a
   "needs be" to every godly man that he should do what he ought.

   What, then, is the ground upon which this "ought" is fixed?

   First, it is the design of God that those who are in Christ should walk
   as Christ walked. It is a part of the original covenant purpose; for
   "whom he did foreknow be also did predestinate to be conformed to the
   image of his Son." That is the drift of the plan of grace, the aim of
   the covenant. Grace looks towards holiness, that there should be a
   people called forth to whom Christ should be the elder brother, the
   firstborn among many brethren. You certainly have not had the purpose
   of God fulfilled in you, dear friend, unless you have been conformed to
   the image of his dear Son. "He hath chosen us in Christ Jesus before
   the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame
   before him in love." This is the aim of election; this is the object of
   redemption; this is the fruit of calling; this is the concomitant of
   justification; this is the evidence of adoption; this is the earnest of
   glory; that we should be holy, even as Christ is holy, and in this
   respect should wear the lineaments of the Son of God. He hath given his
   own Son to die for us, that we may die to sin; he has given him to live
   that we may live like him. In every one of us the Father desires to see
   Christ, that so Christ may be glorified in every one of us. Do you not
   feel this to be an imperative necessity to be laid upon you? Would you
   have the Lord miss his purpose? You are chosen of God to this end, that
   you should be "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
   a peculiar people, zealous of good works," and what is this but that
   you should walk even as he walked? Observe,

   again, another point of this necessity: it is necessary to the mystical
   Christ that we should walk as he walked, for we are joined unto the
   Lord Jesus in one body. Now, Christ cannot be made a monster that would
   be a blasphemous notion. And yet if any man had eyes, ears, hands, or
   other members that were not conformable to the head, he would be a
   strange being. The mouth of a lion, the eye of an ox, the feathers of a
   bird--these things would have no consistency with the head of a man. We
   read of the image in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, that it had a head of fine
   gold, but legs of iron, and feet part of iron and part of clay. Surely,
   Christ's spiritual body is not compounded of such discordant elements.
   No, no. He must be all of a piece. The mystical body must be the most
   beautiful and precious production of God; for the church is Christ's
   body, "the fulness of him that filleth all in all." And shall that
   mysterious fulness be something defiled, deformed, full of sin, subject
   to Satan? God forbid! "As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye
   holy," and as your HEAD is holy, so be ye, as members of his body, holy
   too. Ought it not to be so? Does anybody raise a question? Does not
   every member of Christ, by the very fact that he is joined to him by
   living union, feel at once that he must walk even as Christ walked?

   And this, beloved, again, must all be the fruit of the one Spirit that
   is in Christ and in us. The Father anointed Christ of old with the same
   anointing, which rests on us in our measure. The Holy Spirit descended
   upon him, and rested upon him, and we have an unction from the same
   Holy One. The Spirit of God has anointed all the chosen of God who are
   regenerated, and he dwelleth with them and in them. Now, the Spirit of
   God in every case works to the same result. It cannot be supposed that
   the Spirit of God in any case produces unholiness: the thought were
   blasphemy. The fruit of the Spirit is everything that is delightful,
   right, and good towards God, and generous towards man. The Spirit of
   God, wherever He works, works according to the mind of God; and God is
   hymned as "Holy, holy, holy," by those pure spirits who know him best.
   He is altogether without spot or trace of sin, and so shall we be when
   the Spirit's work is done. If, then, the Spirit of God dwell in you
   (and if it do not, you are not in Christ), it must work in you
   conformity to Christ that you should walk even as he walked.

   Perhaps further argument is not needed; but I would have true
   Christians remember that this is one article of the agreement which we
   make with Christ when we become his disciples. It is taken for granted
   that when we enter the service of Jesus we by that act and deed
   undertake by his help to follow his example. "Whosoever doth not bear
   his cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple." "Take my yoke upon
   you, and learn of me, and ye shall find rest unto your souls." You
   know, if any man love Christ, he must follow him:--"If ye love me, keep
   my commandments." When we took Christ's cross to be our salvation we
   took it also to be our heavenly burden. When we yielded ourselves up to
   Christ to be saved by him, we in spirit renounced every sin. We felt
   that we had come out from under the yoke of Satan, and that we made no
   reserve for the lusts of the flesh that we might obey them, but bowed
   our necks to the yoke of the Lord Jesus. We put ourselves into Christ's
   hands unreservedly, and we said, "Lord, sanctify me, and then use me.
   Take my body and all its members; take my mind and all its faculties;
   take my spirit and all the new powers which thou hast bestowed upon me
   with it; and let all these be thine. Reign in me; rule me absolutely,
   sovereignly, always and alone. I do not ask to be my own, for I am not
   my own, I am bought with a price." After we have learned the grand
   truth that, "if one died for all, then all died," we infer that "Christ
   died for all, that we that live might not henceforth live unto
   ourselves, but unto him that died for us, and rose again." Are we not,
   then, to be true to this blessed compact? "I do remember my faults this
   day," says one. Ay, but remember also the vows that still engage you.
   Do not desire to escape from the sacred bond. This day remember the
   Lord to whom you dedicated yourself in the days of your youth, perhaps
   long, years ago, and again entreat him to take full possession of the
   purchased possession, and hold it against all comers, for ever. So it
   ought to be. He that says, "I am in him" ought also so to walk even as
   he walked. Obey the sacrifice of Jesus, yield yourselves as living
   sacrifices; by your hope of being saved by him put your whole being
   into his hands to love and serve him all your days.

   For, once more, inasmuch as we are in Christ, we are now bound to live
   to Christ's glory, and this is a great means of glorifying Christ. What
   can we do to glorify Christ if we do not walk even as he walked? If I
   came and preached to you, and if I had the tongues of men and of
   angels, yet if I did not seek to do as my Master did, what avails all
   that I can say? It is but "sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal." You
   know what men say to unholy preachers: they bid them be silent or be
   consistent. Unholy ministers are a derision, and a scoff, and a
   by-word. And so it is with unholy Christians, too. You may teach your
   children at home, or teach them in the Sunday-school class; but if they
   see your lives to be Christless, prayerless, godless, they will not
   learn any good from you. They will rather learn from what you do amiss,
   than from what you say that is right. Do you blame them that it is so?
   Are not actions far more forcible than words? Suppose you
   church-members are unjust in your trade; suppose that in your common
   conversation you are loose; suppose that in your acts you are
   licentious or untrue; what does the world say of your Christianity?
   Why, it becomes to them a thing of contempt. They sniff at it. It is so
   much dung and sweepings of the street to them, and so it ought to be.
   In the early ages some of the worst opponents of Christianity used to
   wing their shafts with the inconsistencies of Christian professors, and
   they were wise in their generation. One of them said, "Where is that
   catholic holiness of which we have often heard so much?" and another
   said, "We heard of these people that they love their Christ, and love
   other men so that they would even die for love of their brethren; but
   many of them do not love as well as the heathen whom they despise." I
   dare say there was a good deal of slander and scandal in what they
   said; but I am also afraid that, if it were said today, there would be
   a vast deal of sorrowful truth in it. Christian love is by no means so
   plentiful as it might be, nor holy living, either. Is not this the
   thing that weakens the preaching, of the gospel--the want of living the
   gospel? If all the professed Christians who live in London really
   walked as Christ walked, would not the salt have more effect upon the
   corrupt mass than the stuff which is now called salt seems to have? We
   preach here in the pulpit; but what can we do, unless you preach yonder
   at home? It is you preaching in your shops, in your kitchens, in your
   nurseries, in your parlours, in the streets, which will tell on the
   masses. This is the preaching--the best preaching in the world, for it
   is seen as well as heard. I heard one say he liked to see men preach
   with their feet; and this is it, " they ought also so to walk even as
   Christ walked." No testimony excels that which is borne in ordinary
   life. Christ ought to be glorified by us, and therefore we ought to be
   like him, for if we are not, we cannot glorify him, but must dishonor
   him.

   Now, that is my first point. Consider how this obligation is proved,
   and when you have weighed the argument pray the Holy Ghost to make you
   yield to its gentle pressure.

   II. Now, secondly, CONSIDER WHEREIN THIS WALKING WITH CHRIST AS HE
   WALKED CONSISTS. Here is a wide subject. I have a sea before me with as
   much sailing, room as Noah in the ark. I can only just point out the
   direction in which you should sail if you would make a prosperous
   voyage.

   First, brothers to put it all together in one word, the first thing
   that every Christian has to see to is holiness. I will not try at any
   great length to explain what that word means, but it always sounds to
   me as if it explained itself. You know what wholeness is--a thing,
   without a crack, or flaw, or break; complete, entire, uninjured, whole.
   Well, that is the main meaning of holy. The character of God is
   perfectly holy; in it nothing is lacking; nothing is redundant. When a
   thing, is complete it is whole, and this applied to moral and spiritual
   things gives you the inner meaning of "holy." When a man is healthy,
   perfectly healthy, in spirit, soul, and body, then he is perfectly
   holy; for sin is a moral disorder, and righteousness is the right state
   of every faculty. The man whose spiritual health is altogether right is
   right towards God, right towards himself, right towards men, right
   towards time, right towards eternity. He is right towards the first
   table of the law, and right towards the second table. He is an
   all-round man; he is a whole man, a holy man. Truth is within him;
   truth is spoken by him; truth is acted by him. Righteousness is in him;
   he thinks the right thing, and chooses that which is according to the
   law of uprightness. There is justice in him; he abhors that which is
   evil. There is goodness in him; he follows after that which will
   benefit his fellow-men. I cannot spare time to tell you all that the
   word "holy" means; but if you wish to see holiness, look at Christ. In
   him you see a perfect character, an all-round character. He is the
   perfect one; be ye like him in all holiness.

   We must go a little into detail; so I say, next, one main point in
   which we ought to walk according to the walk of our great Exemplar is
   obedience. Our Lord Jesus Christ took upon himself the form of a
   servant; and what service it was that he rendered! "He was a son; yet
   learned he obedience by the things that he suffered." And what
   obedience that dear Son of God rendered to the Father! He did not come
   to do his own will, but the will of him that sent him. He yielded
   himself up to come under law to God, and to do the Fathers will. Now in
   this respect we ought also to walk even as he walked. We have not come
   into the world to do what we like, to possess what we choose, or to
   say, "That is my notion, and therefore so shall it be." Sin promised
   freedom, and brought us bondage; grace now binds us, and ensures us
   liberty. Obedience is the law of every spiritual nature. It is the
   Lord's will that in his house his word should be the supreme law, for
   so only can our fallen natures be restored to their original glory. Set
   the wandering stars in their spheres, and rule them by the majestic
   sway of the sun, and then they will keep their happy estate, but not
   else. Understanding, heart, life, lip, everything, is now to enter into
   the service of God, even the Father, and it is to be ours to say,
   "Lord, show me what thou wouldest have me to do." Surely, beyond any
   other quality, we see in the career of the Son of God the perfection of
   self-abnegation. No man was ever so truly free as Jesus, and yet no man
   was so fully subservient to the heavenly will. Never saw these seas a
   pilot so able to steer according to his own judgment, and never one so
   carefully to follow the channel as marked down in the chart. His was
   the unique originality of absolute obedience. Dear friends, you see how
   it ought to be with you also. It is ours to walk in cheerful
   subservience to the mind of the Father, even as Jesus did. Does this
   strike you as an easy thing? It is child's work, certainly; but
   assuredly it is not child's play.

   Such a life would necessarily be one of great activity, for the life of
   Jesus was intensely energetic. The life of Christ was as fall as it
   could hold. After he had been developed and disciplined by thirty years
   of seclusion, he showed himself among men as one moved to vehemence
   with love: "he was clad with zeal as with a cloak." From the day of his
   baptism till his death he went about doing good. It is wonderful what
   was packed into about three years: each action had a world of meaning
   within its own self, and there were thousands of such acts; each sermon
   was a complete revelation, and every day heard him pour forth such
   sermons. His biography is made up of the essence of life. Some one
   remarks that it is wonderful that he did not begin his active life when
   he was younger. We reply, that it is beautiful that he did not, because
   he was not called to it, and he was best obeying the Father by living
   in obscurity. Those thirty years at Nazareth were thirty wonderful
   years of obedience--obedience; tested by obscurity, patience,
   restraint, and perhaps dulness. Who among us would find such obedience
   easy? Would we not far rather rush into notice and make to ourselves a
   name? Some of us, perhaps, never learned the obedience of being
   quiet--but it is a wonderful one. Oh, for more of it! Do we know the
   obedience of being hidden when our light seems needed?--the obedience
   of going into the desert for forty years, like Moses, with nothing, to
   do but wait upon God till God shall put us in commission? There is a
   wonderful service in waiting till the order comes for us actively to be
   at it. Samuel said, "To obey is better than sacrifice;" it is in fact
   better than anything which we can possibly present to God. But when our
   Lord was at length loosed from his obscurity, with what force he sped
   along his life-way. How he spent himself! It was a candle burning not
   only at both ends, but altogether. He not only had zeal burning at his
   heart, but, like a sheet of flame, it covered him from head to foot
   There is never an idle hour in the life of Christ. It is wonderful how
   he sustained the toil. Perhaps he measured out his zeal and his open
   industry by the fact that he was only to be for a short time here
   below. It might not be possible to others that they should do as much
   as he did in so short a space, because they are intended to live longer
   here, and must not destroy future usefulness by present indiscretion:
   but still, activity was the rule of our Master's existence. At it,
   always at it, altogether at it, spending and being spent for his
   Father; such was his mode of walking, among, men. Oh, friends, if we,
   indeed, are in him, we ought also so to walk even. as he walked! Wake
   up, you lazy ones!

   Next, we ought to walk as Christ did in the matter of self-denial. Of
   course, in this work of self-denial we are not called to imitate Christ
   in offering up ourselves as a propitiatory sacrifice. That would be a
   vain intrusion into things which are his peculiar domain. The
   self-denials which we practise should be such as he prescribes us.
   There is a will-worship which is practised in the Church of Rome of
   self-denials which are absurd, and must, I think, be hateful in the
   sight of God rather than pleasing to him. Saint Bernard was a man whom
   I admire to the last degree, and I count him to be one of the Lord's
   choice ones; yet in the early part of his life there is no doubt that
   he lessened his powers of usefulness to a large extent by the
   emaciation which he endured, and the way in which he brought himself to
   death's door. At times he was incapable of activity by reason of the
   weakness which he had incurred through fasting, and colds and exposure,
   There is no need to inflict useless torture upon the body. When did the
   Saviour thus behave himself? Point me to a single mortification of a
   needless kind. Enough self-denials come naturally in every Christian
   man's way to make him try whether he can deny himself in very deed for
   the Lord's sake. You are thus tested when you are put in positions
   where you might get gain by an unrighteous act, or win fame by
   withholding a truth, or earn love and honour by pandering to the
   passions of those about you. May you have grace enough to say, "No; it
   cannot be. I love not myself, but my Lord. I seek not myself, but
   Christ. I desire to propagate nothing but his truth, and not my own
   ideas": then will you have exhibited the self-denial of Jesus. These
   self-denials will sometimes be hard to flesh and blood. And then in the
   Church of God to be able to give all your substance, to devote all your
   time, to lay out all your ability--this is to walk as Jesus walked.
   When weary and worn, still to be busy; to deny, yourself things which
   may be allowable, but which if allowable to you would be dangerous to
   others--this also is like the Lord. Such self-denial as may be helpful
   to the weak you ought to practise. Think what Christ would do in such a
   case, and do it; and, whenever you can glorify him by denying yourself,
   do it. So walk as he did who made himself of no reputation, but took
   upon himself the form of a servant. and who, though he was rich,
   brought himself down to poverty for our sakes, that we might be rich
   unto God. Think of that.

   Another point in which we ought to imitate Christ most certainly is
   that of lowliness. I wish that all Christians did this. When I see some
   Christian women dressed out--well, like women of the world, though not
   with half a worldling's taste, and when I see men so big that they
   cannot speak to poor people, as if they were made of something better
   than ordinary flesh and blood; when I notice a haughty, high, hectoring
   disposition anywhere, it grates upon my feelings, and makes me wonder
   whether these blunderers hope to go to the heaven of the lowly. The
   Lord Jesus would never have been half as big as some of his followers
   are. What great folk some of his disciples are, as compared with him!
   He was lowly, meek, gentle, a man who so loved the souls of others that
   he forgot himself. You never detect in the Lord Jesus Christ any
   tendency towards pride or self-exaltation. Quite the reverse: he is
   ever compassionate and condescending to men of low estate.

   And then note again another point, and that is his great tenderness,
   and gentleness, and readiness to forgive. His dying words ought to ring
   in the ear of all who find it hard to pass by affronts, "Father,
   forgive them, for they know not what they do." Did he not set us an
   example of bearing and forbearing? "Who, when he was reviled, reviled
   not again." For every curse he gave a blessing,,. You cannot be
   Christians if this spirit of love is foreign to you. "Oh," say you, "we
   endorse the confession." I do not care. You must love your enemies, or
   you will die with the Creed in your throats. "Oh," say you, "we are
   regular in our pews, hearing the gospel." I do not care; you must
   forgive them that trespass against you, or you will go from your pews
   to perdition "Oh, but we have been baptized, and we come to the
   communion." I do not care even about that; for unless you are made meek
   and lowly in heart you will not find rest unto your souls. Pride goeth
   not before salvation, but before destruction; and a haughty spirit is
   no prophecy of elevation, but the herald of a fall. Take care, take
   care, you that say that you are in Christ; you ought also to walk in
   all the lowliness and in all the tenderness of Christ, or else at the
   end you will be discovered to be none of his. Hard, cruel, unrelenting,
   iron-hearted professors will no more go to heaven than the hogs they
   fatten.

   There is one little big word which tells us more than all this about
   how Christ walked, and that is the word "love." Jesus was incarnate
   love. "God is love," but God is a spirit, therefore if you wish to see
   love embodied, look at Christ. He loves the little children, and
   suffers them to come to him. He loves the widow, and he is tender to
   her, and raises her dead son. He loves the sinners, and they draw near
   to him. He loves all sinful and tempted and tried ones, and therefore
   he comes to seek and to save. He loves the Father first, and then for
   the Father's sake he loves the myriads of men. Do you love nobody? Do
   you live within yourself? Are you immured within your own ribs? Is self
   all your world? Then you will go to hell. There is no help for it; for
   the place of unloving spirits is the bottomless pit. Only he that loves
   can live in heaven, for heaven is love: and you cannot go to glory
   unless you have learned to love, and to find it your very life to do
   good to those about you.

   Let me add to all this, that he who says that Christ is in him ought
   also to live as Christ lived in secret. And how was this?

   His life was spent in abounding devotion. Ah, me! I fear I shall
   condemn some here when I remind them of the hymn we just now sang--

   "Cold mountains and the midnight air

   Witnessed the fervour of his prayer."

   If the perfect Christ could not live without prayer, how can such poor
   imperfect ones as we are live without it? He had no sin within him, and
   yet he had need to pray. He was pure and holy, and yet he must needs
   wait upon God all day long, and often speak with his Father; and then
   when the night came, and others went to their beds, he withdrew himself
   into the wilderness and prayed. If the Lord Jesus be in you, you must
   walk as he walked in that matter.

   And, then, think of his delight in God. How wonderful was Christ's
   delight in his God! I can never think of his life as an unhappy one. He
   was, it is true, "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief"; but
   still there was a deep spring of wondrous happiness in the midst of his
   heart, which made him always blessed; for he said to his Father, "I
   delight to do thy will, my God! Yea, thy law is within heart." He
   delighted in God. Many a sweet night he spent in those prayer-times of
   his in fellowship with the Father. Why, it was that which prepared him
   for the agony of his bloody sweat, and for the "Why hast thou forsaken
   me?" Those love-visits, those near and dear communings which his holy
   heart had with the Father were his secret meat and drink. And you and I
   also must delight in God. This charming duty is far too much neglected.
   Strange that this honey should so seldom be in men's mouths! Listen to
   this text, "Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he shall give thee
   the desires of thine heart." Many a man says, "I should like to have
   the desires of my heart" Brother, here is the royal road thereto, the
   King's ascent to his treasury--"Delight thyself also in the Lord." But,
   listen. it is very likely you would not obtain the desire that is now
   in your heart if you did that; for he that delights himself in God
   rises above the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and comes to
   desire that which God desires, and therefore it is that he wins the
   desire of his heart. But, oh, the pleasure, the joy, the bliss of
   delighting in God! How many times have I sung to myself that last dear
   stanza of the psalm, wherein the inspired poet sings--

   "For yet I know I shall him praise,

   Who graciously to me,

   The health is of my countenance,

   Yea, mine own God is he."

   Oh, what a pleasure! "Mine own God is he." Rich men glory in wealth,
   famous men in valour, great men in honour, and I in "mine own God."
   There is nothing about God but what is delightful to a saint. The
   infinite God is infinitely delightful to his people. Once get really to
   know God and to be like him, and even his sternest attributes--his
   power, his justice, his indignation against sin--will come to be
   delightful to you. Those men who are cavilling at what God does,
   questioning over what God has revealed, do not know him, for to know
   him is to adore him. Oh, brethren, let us find our pleasure, our
   treasure, our heaven, our all, in the Lord our God, even as our Lord
   Jesus did. In this thing let us walk even as he walked.

   I have not quite done. Dear friends, we ought to walk in holy
   contentment. Jesus was perfectly content with his lot. When the foxes
   had holes and the birds of the air had nests, and he had not where to
   lay his head, yet he never murmured, but found rest in pursuing his
   life-work. The cravings of covetousness and pinings of ambition never
   touched our Lord. Friends, if you do, indeed, say that you abide in
   him, I pray you be of the same contented spirit. "I have learned," said
   the apostle, as if it were a thing which had to be taught, "in
   whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content."

   In a word, Christ lived above this world; let us walk as he walked.
   Christ lived for God, and for God alone; let us live after his fashion.
   And Christ persevered in such living; he never turned aside from it at
   all; but as he lived so he died, still serving his God, obedient to his
   Father's will, even unto death. May our lives be a mosaic of perfect
   obedience, and our deaths the completion of the fair design. From our
   Bethlehem to our Gethsemane may our walk run parallel with the pathway
   of the Well-beloved! Oh, Holy Spirit, work us to this sacred pattern!

   III. I close now by saying, in the last place, consider, dear friends,
   WHAT IS NEEDFUL TO ALL THIS.

   First, it is needful to have a nature like that of Christ. You cannot
   give out sweet waters so long as the fountains are impure. "Ye must be
   born again." There is no walking with Jesus in newness of life unless
   we have a new heart and a right spirit. See to it, dear friends, that
   your nature is renewed--that the Holy Ghost has wrought in you a
   resurrection from among the dead; for, if not, your walk and
   conversation will savour of death and corruption. A new creature is
   essential to likeness to Christ: it is not possible that the carnal
   mind should wear the image of Jesus.

   That being done, the next thing that is necessary is a constant
   anointing of the Holy Spirit. Can any Christian here do without the
   Holy Spirit? Then I am afraid that he is no Christian. But, as for us,
   we feel every day that we must cry for a fresh visitation of the
   Spirit, a renewed sense of indwelling, a fresh anointing from the Holy
   One of Israel, or else we cannot walk as Christ walked.

   And then, again, there must be in us a strong resolve that we will walk
   as Christ walked; for our Lord himself did not lead in that holy life
   without stern resolution. He set his face like a flint that he would do
   the right; and he did the right. Do not, I pray you, be led astray by
   thoughtlessly following your fellow-men: it is a poor, sheepish
   business, that running in crowds. Dare to be singular dare to stand
   alone. Stand to it firmly that you will follow Christ. A Christian man
   in a discussion attempted to defend the truth, but his opponent grew
   angry, and cried out vehemently again and again, "Hear me! Hear me!" At
   last the good man answered, "No, I shall not hear you, nor shall you
   hear me; but let us both sit down and hear the word of the Lord." And
   that is the thing to do, brethren, to be hearing Christ and following
   him; not I to learn of you, nor you of me, but both of Christ: so shall
   we end all controversy in a blessed agreement at his feet. God help us
   to get there.

   And so, once again, I add that if we want to walk as Christ walked, we
   must have much communion with him. We cannot possibly get to be like
   Christ except by being with him. I wish that we could rise to be so
   much like the Saviour that we should resemble a certain ancient saint
   who died a martyr's death, to whom the world said, "What are you?" He
   said, "I am a Christian." They asked, , What trade do you follow?" And
   he said, "I am a Christian." They inquired, "What language do you
   speak?" And he said, "I am a Christian." "But what treasures have you?"
   said they; and he replied, "I am a Christian." They asked him what
   friends he had, and he said, "I am a Christian;" for all he was, and
   all he had, and all he wished to be, and all he hoped to be, were all
   wrapped up in Christ. If you live with Christ you will be absorbed by
   him, and he will embrace the whole of your existence: and, in
   consequence, your walk will be like his.

   Take care that you do not in all things copy any but Christ; for if I
   set my watch by the watch of one of my friends, and be sets his watch
   by that of another friend, we may all be wrong together. If we shall,
   each one, take his time from the sun, we shall all be right. There is
   nothing like going to.the fountain-head. Take your lessons in holiness,
   not from a poor erring disciple, but from the infallible Master. God
   help you to do so.

   A person has written to me this morning to say that he has painted my
   portrait, but that he cannot finish it until he sees me. I should think
   not. Certainly you cannot paint a portrait of Christ in your own life
   unless you see him--see him clearly, see him continually. You may have
   it general notion of what Christ is like, and you may put a good deal
   of colour into your copy; but I am sure you will fail unless you see
   the grand original. You must get to commune with Jesus. You know what
   we did when we went to school. Our schoolmasters were not quite so wise
   then as schoolmasters are now. They wrote at the top of the page a
   certain line for us to follow, and a poor following it was. When I
   wrote my first line I copied the writing-master's model, but when I
   wrote the next line I copied my copy of the top line; so that when I
   reached the bottom of the page I produced a copy of my copy of my copy
   of my copy of the top line. Thus my handwriting fed upon itself, and
   was nothing bettered but rather grew worse. So one man copies Christ,
   perhaps; a friend who hears him preach copies him, and his wife at home
   copies the hearer, and somebody copies her; and so it goes on all down
   the line, till we all miss that glorious hand-writing which Jesus has
   come to teach us. Keep your eye on Christ, dear brother. Never mind me:
   never mind your friend: never mind the old doctor that you have been
   hearing so long. Look to Jesus, and to him alone. We have had our sects
   and our divisions all through that copying of the lines of the boys,
   instead of looking to the top-line that the Master wrote. "He that
   saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he
   walked" May the Spirit of God cause us to do it! Amen and Amen.

On Humbling Ourselves before God

   (No. 1733)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may
   exalt you in due time." 1 Peter 5:6.

   PRIDE is so natural to fallen man that it springs up in his heart like
   weeds in a watered garden, or rushes by a flowing brook. It is an all
   pervading sin and smothers all things like dust on the roads, or flour
   in the mill. Its every touch is evil as the breath of the
   cholera-fiend, or the blast of the Sahara wind. Pride is as hard to get
   rid of as charlock from the furrows, or the American blight from the
   apple trees. If killed, it revives; if buried, it bursts the tomb. You
   may hunt down this fox and think you have destroyed it, but lo, your
   very exultation is pride! None have more pride than those who dream
   that they have none! You may labor against vainglory till you conceive
   that you are humble and the fond conceit of your humility will prove to
   be pride in full bloom. It imitates humility, but is most truly pride!

   Pride is a sin with a thousand lives! It seems impossible to kill it,
   it flourishes on that which should be its poison, glorying in its
   shame. It is a sin with a thousand shapes and by perpetual change it
   escapes capture. It seems impossible to hold it--the vapory demon slips
   from you, only to appear in another form and mock your fruitless
   pursuit. To die to pride and self, one would need to die himself. Pride
   was man's first sin and it will be his last. In the first sin that man
   ever committed, there was certainly a large mixture of pride, for he
   imagined that he knew better than his Maker--and even dreamed that his
   Maker feared that man might grow too great!

   It has been questioned whether pride was not the sin by which the
   angels fell when they lost their first estate--I will not go into any
   controversy upon that subject--but there was certainly pride in the sin
   of Satan and pride in the sin of Adam. This is the torch which kindled
   Hell and set the world on fire! Pride is a ringleader and captain among
   iniquities--it attains unto the first three of Satan's champions. It is
   a daring and God-defying sin, arraigning Divine justice as Cain did;
   challenging Jehovah to combat as Pharaoh did; or making self into God
   as Nebuchadnezzar did. It would murder God if it could, that it might
   fill His Throne. While it is first to come and first in horrible
   supremacy, it is also last to go. As Paul said, "The last enemy that
   shall be destroyed is death."

   I think I might say that the last enemy but one is pride, for even at
   our deathbed pride will be found in attendance. In his last moments,
   John Knox had a sharp conflict with self-righteousness though he had
   preached against it with all his might and knew, with a clearness
   seldom given to men, that salvation is of the Lord alone. Even within
   an hour of Glory he had to make a stand against that vile thing, the
   pride of the human heart! Many others of the Lord's valiant ones have
   been sorely assailed by the same crafty foe which shoots with feathered
   flatteries, shafts of destruction. In the most quiet minds the deadly
   calm of self-conceit may be found. Our hearts are deceitful above all
   things and in nothing less to be trusted than in this matter of pride.

   Even while we breathe out our souls unto God it will attempt to puff us
   up--yes, it will puff up poor dying worms! Brothers and Sisters, for
   certain you and I are in danger of pride--possibly we are even now
   victims of it! Let us be on our guard, for it may be ruining us without
   our knowledge, even as the moth in secret eats up the garment, or as
   unseen rust cankers the hidden treasure. Let pride lodge where it may,
   it does its entertainer great mischief, for it bars out the favor of
   God, "God resists the proud." It must be sent adrift before God can
   visit us with favor, for no Grace comes to the proud, "but He gives
   Grace unto the humble." Humility is the Grace that attracts more Grace!
   As money makes money, so humility increases humility and, with it,
   every other spiritual gift.

   If you would have much Grace, have much humility. God has assistance
   for the humble, but resistance for the proud. You know how He fought
   Pharaoh. What blows He struck at the haughty monarch! He would have him
   down from the pinnacle of defiance, one way or another, and make him
   learn, in bitterness, the answer to his own insolent question, "Who is
   the Lord?" Remember how Nebuchadnezzar had to eat grass like an ox
   because he spoke with a haughty tongue? Wherever God sees pride lifting
   itself on high, He resolves to level it in the dust! He draws His bow,
   He fits His arrow to

   the string--and pride is the target that He shoots at. The more pride
   enters into the Christian's heart, the less Grace will enter there--and
   the more opposition from God will come--for pride is never so hateful
   to God as when He sees it in His own people.

   If you see disease in a stranger you are very sorry, but if you
   discover its symptoms in your own child, your grief is much more deep.
   A viper is loathsome anywhere, but how it would make you start if you
   saw the head of one of those creatures peeping out from the bosom of a
   beloved friend! So pride is detestable anywhere, but it is worst in
   those whom the Lord loves best. If God sees pride in a David, He will
   smite him till he ceases from his high thoughts. Or if it is in a
   Hezekiah, he will abase him--and you can be sure that if the Lord sees
   pride in you, he will smite you! Yes, smite you again and again till
   you wait humbly at His feet!

   All this I have given by way of preface, but I think it is also an
   argument which may run before the words of the text and strengthen
   them. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God! I
   shall handle the text, not at any great length, but for practical
   purposes in three or four ways. May the Holy Spirit bless the
   discourse!

   I. First, our text is evidently intended to bear upon us IN OUR CHURCH
   LIFE. We will use it in that respect. Observe that Peter has been
   speaking to the elders and telling them how they should behave
   themselves in the flock over which they are set as overseers. Then he
   speaks to the younger members and says, "Submit yourselves unto the
   elders." He says to all Church members, "All of you be subject, one to
   another, and be clothed with humility." And it is in the same context
   that he writes, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of
   God." I am, as a member of a Church, not to seek honor for myself, but
   I am to walk humbly. I am not to make it in any respect the objective
   of my Christian life to be esteemed among my fellow Christians so as to
   have influence over them and to take the lead among them.

   I am to have far humbler motives than that. I am to think very little
   of myself and to think so much of others that I admire all that I see
   of God's Grace in them--and am glad to learn from them as well as to
   help them in their progress to Heaven. Each one of us should think
   little of himself and highly of his Brothers and Sisters. I cannot say
   that all of us, as Christians, are clothed with humility as we should
   be. I am afraid that from the preacher down to the most obscure member,
   we may, everyone of us, listen with awe to the injunction, "humble
   yourselves under the mighty hand of God." And I am afraid that all of
   us can confess that we fall short of this command. Yet I may honestly
   add that in this Church I have seen more submissiveness, deference to
   others and less of ambitious self-esteem than anywhere else in the
   world. I have spoken nothing less than bare justice when I have said
   this.

   Let all the world know that as a pastor I can, in this point, praise
   the people of my charge beyond any that I have ever heard of! I am not
   apt to judge too favorably--I speak as I have seen and this is my
   honest testimony. We owe our union and prosperity under God to the
   readiness of most of the Brethren to do anything and everything for
   Christ, without considering ourselves. Now, true humility in our Church
   relationship will show itself in our being willing to undertake the
   very lowest offices for Christ. Some cannot do little things--they must
   be ordained to great offices or they will sulk in indolence. Genuine
   humility makes a man think it a great honor to be a doorkeeper in the
   house of God, or to be allowed to speak a word to a little child about
   Jesus, or even to wash the saints' feet. I am sure, Brothers and
   Sisters, that those who are not willing to fulfill the lesser offices
   will never be used by Christ to mind the greater duties.

   Humility is a qualification for greatness. Do you know how to be
   little? You are learning to be great. Can you submit? You are learning
   to rule. My symbolic sketch of a perfect Christian would be a king
   keeping the door, or a prince feeding lambs, or, better still, the
   Master washing His disciples' feet! The next point of humility is that
   we are conscious of our own incompetence to do anything right. He who
   can do all things without Christ will end in doing nothing! The man who
   can preach without Divine aid cannot preach at all. The woman who can
   teach a Bible class without the Holy Spirit cannot teach a Bible class.
   Human ability without the Grace of God is puffed-up inability! Those of
   you who, apart from supernatural help, feel quite sufficient for any
   kind of holy service, are miserably deluded. Self-sufficiency is
   inefficiency. The fullness of self is a double emptiness. He that has
   no sense of his weakness has a weakness in his sense!

   I believe, Brothers and Sisters, that any man whom God uses for a great
   purpose will be so emptied out that he will wonder that God uses him in
   the least degree--and he will be ready to hide his head and long to get
   out of public notice because he will feel himself to be utterly
   unworthy of the favor which God manifests towards him. I do not believe
   that God ever fills a cup which was not empty, or that He ever fills a
   man's mouth with His Words while that man has his mouth full of his own
   words. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God! If
   you desire that the Holy

   Spirit should bless you, be purged from your own spirit. The way to
   rise into God is to sink in your own self. As our Lord Jesus descended
   into the depths, that He might rise above all things and fill all
   things, so we, in our imitation of Him, must descend to the uttermost
   that we may rise to the highest.

   This humility will show itself, next, in that we shall be willing to be
   ignored by men. There is a craving in the heart of many to have what
   they do written upon tablets and set up in the market places. I once
   heard a professing Christian complain bitterly that he had been
   ignored. He had been a Sunday school teacher for years and yet he had
   never been publicly mentioned by anyone. Did he make that a complaint?
   He might far rather have rejoiced in his quietude! The fierce light of
   public notoriety is not much valued by those upon whom it falls. I wish
   some people would ignore me--at least all next week, so much as not to
   call to see me, or write me a letter, or name me in the papers! I would
   be as happy as all the birds in the air to be ignored--if I might be
   left alone and allowed peacefully to work for God with His sweet smile
   to cheer me in my loneliness! Oh, to be a little ant, allowed to labor
   on at God's bidding, receiving nothing of men but the high privilege of
   being left alone!

   A saintly soul was known to pray, "Grant me, O Lord, that I may pass
   unnoticed through the world!" It seems to me to be one of the highest
   delights of life for people to permit you to work for God without being
   interrupted by their praises or censures. When I have seen a certain
   great artist at work, I have peeped at him from a corner and have kept
   out of his sunshine--I am quite sure he did not want me to express my
   valueless opinion about his glorious creations! To have people forever
   talking about you, for you and against you is one of the wearinesses of
   mortal life--and yet some people sigh for the attention that others
   would be glad to be rid of! Yes, so it is. It is but a little thing
   that certain friends have done, but they would like much made of
   it--their slender alms must be published at the corners of the
   streets-- their prosy speech must be reported in all the papers!

   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, do not let us care about its being known that
   we have done our part! Let it be done as to God and in God's sight! And
   then, as to what our fellow mortals shall say, let us have scant
   concern, for, if we live on human praise, we shall grow not only proud,
   but vain, which, if it is not more wicked, is certainly more silly.
   Serve God and do not wish to have a trumpet blown before you. Never cry
   with Jehonadab, "Come, see my zeal for the Lord of Hosts." Go on
   serving God year after year, though you are altogether unknown, feeling
   it quite sufficient that you have, by the Grace of God, served your
   generation and honored your Redeemer. This would be a great attainment
   in our Church life if we could reach to it. Brethren, we need humility,
   all of us, in our Church life, in the sense of never being rough,
   haughty, arrogant, hard, domineering, lordly--or, on the other
   hand--unruly, quarrelsome and unreasonable.

   We should endeavor to think very carefully of those who are poor, for
   fear we should hurt their feelings. And we should be very noticeable of
   those who are obscure, lest we should seem to despise them. It is ours
   never to take offense and to be most cautious never to cause it even by
   inadvertence. He that is set as a leader in the Church of God, let him
   be the person that is most ready to bear blame and least ready to give
   offense--let him say, "You may think what you please of me, but I shall
   lay myself out to do you good and to be your servant, for Christ's
   sake." The lower you can stoop, the greater is your honor. In the eyes
   of wisdom, no piece of furniture in the house of God has greater
   dignity than the doormat. If you are willing to let others wipe their
   feet on you, then shall Christ Jesus take pleasure in you, for you are
   a partaker of His lowly mind.

   Even for your own sake it will be wise to occupy a humble place, for in
   the valleys the streams of peace are flowing. The mountains are the
   playgrounds of the storm, but in the quiet villages the dove finds her
   shelter. If you would escape from ill will and live peaceably with all
   men, practice the maxims of an influential man, who, when asked, after
   the Revolution, how he managed to escape the executioner's axe,
   replied, "I made myself of no reputation and kept silent." I am
   speaking to a number of young men who have begun to speak for Jesus
   Christ in the Church--let me earnestly entreat them to take great
   notice of my text--"Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God."
   Remember, you cannot do any good unless "the mighty hand of God" is
   with you! Therefore be humble and look to His hand for all success.

   Feel it to be a wonderful thing that the mighty hand of God should ever
   use you and, therefore, lie very low in that hand, and beneath that
   hand, for then you may claim the promise that He will exalt you in due
   time. If you are willing to look after a few poor people in a village
   and to do your duty thoroughly well among a lowly company, you shall
   have a larger sphere before long. If you are satisfied, young Brother,
   to stand in the corner of the street and talk about Jesus

   Christ to a few rough folk, you shall find hundreds of hearers,
   by-and-by. If you are willing to be nothing, God will make something of
   you! The way to the top of the ladder is to begin at the lowest rung.

   In fact, in the Church of God, the way up is to go down--and he that is
   ambitious to be at the top will find himself, before long, at the
   bottom. "He that exalts himself shall be abased but he that humbles
   himself shall be exalted." Suffer, my younger Brethren, this word of
   exhortation.

   II. And now, secondly, I will use the text in quite another way--in
   reference to OUR BEHAVIOR IN OUR AFFLICTIONS. Here let every tried
   Believer listen to the counsel of the Holy Spirit. Certain of us are
   never long together without affliction and trial. Like salamanders, we
   live in the flame, passing from fire to fire. As by a succession of
   shafts we descend into the heart of the earth, going down from woe to
   woe--we need to learn the way of these dark places! Frequently our
   heavenly Father's design in sending trial to His children is to make
   and keep them humble. Let us remember this and learn a lesson of
   wisdom. The advice of Peter is that we should humble ourselves. Many
   people have been often humbled and yet they have not become humble.
   There is a great difference between the two things.

   If God withdraws His Grace and allows a Christian man to fall into sin,
   that fall humbles him in the esteem of all good men--and yet he may not
   be humble. He may never have a true sense of how evil his action was.
   He may still persevere in his lofty spirit and be far from humility.
   When this is the case, the haughty spirit may expect a fall. The rod
   will make blue wounds when pride ignores gentler blows. The most
   hopeful way of avoiding the humbling affliction is to humble yourself.
   Be humble that you may not be humbled! Put yourself into a humble
   attitude and draw near to God in a lowly spirit--and so He will cease
   from His chiding. And do this, first, by noticing whether you have been
   guilty of any special sin of pride. You are suffering--let the rod
   point out to you in which way you have erred through pride. I believe
   that David was afflicted in his children because he had been proud of
   his children and had indulged them.

   When there is a breakage in the house, it is generally the idol that is
   broken. Usually our sins lie at the roots of our sorrows. If we will
   repent of the sin, the Lord will remove the sorrow. Have you been tried
   in your worldly possessions? Were you ever puffed up by them? Is your
   health failing? Did you ever glory in your bodily strength? Are you
   deceived? Were you ever boastful of your own wisdom? Are you mourning
   over a failure in character? Did you not once dream that you were past
   temptation? Look into your affliction till you see, as in a glass, what
   was the thing you were proud of-- then take the idol down from its
   pedestal, humble yourself before God--and from then on worship only
   Him! In your affliction, humble yourself by confessing that you deserve
   all that you are suffering. Is it poverty? Then, dear child of God,
   admit that you deserve poverty because of your love of the world!

   Is it physical pain? Then acknowledge how every erring member deserves
   to smart. It is a great thing to have wrung out of us the confession
   that our chastisement is less than we deserve and that the Lord is not
   dealing with us according to our sins, but rewarding us according to
   our iniquities. Is there a bereavement in the house? Then, I pray you,
   acknowledge that if God were to visit you, as He did Job, and take all
   your children away in a stroke, you deserve it at His hands! Confess
   that the chastening hand is not dealing too severely with you. Humble
   yourself and then you will not quarrel with your grief.

   But, more than that, humble yourself so as to submit entirely to God's
   will. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you in this act of self-humiliation
   while you meekly kiss the rod. Bow yourself before the mighty hand of
   God, ready to receive harder blows if God so pleases, for when your
   will entirely yields to the will of God, it is highly probable that
   either the affliction will be removed, or else the sting of it will be
   taken away. Down, Brothers and Sisters, down in the dust as low as you
   can get! God is evidently dealing within you as with a child and a
   child's wisdom lies in cheerful submission to parental discipline. When
   a child is under his father's chastening hand, it will not help him to
   kick, quarrel and say any-thing--his best hope lies in submitting
   absolutely to his father's good pleasure. When that is done, the
   chastisement will soon end.

   Humble yourself, therefore, under the mighty hand of God. Yield up your
   will so as to have no suit-in-law against the Lord--no difference as to
   His goodness, not even if the evil you dread should actually come and
   come in the worst form! Submit to the Lord's will as the rush bends to
   the wind, or as the wax yields to the seal. Pray against the calamity
   which moves you to fear, but let your petition always end with,
   "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will." Ask that you may not be
   obliged to drink the bitter drink, but do not upset the cup, nor push
   it away. There let it stand, while

   you, for the moment, supplicate for its removal. And when there comes
   no answer to your prayer, then take it up meekly, put it to your lips
   resolutely, and drink right on, even as your Master drank His cup and
   drained it to the dregs.

   This needs the help of the Holy Spirit and truly He waits to help
   us--He delights to aid us in such holy acts of submission! Nothing is
   better for us in our time of tribulation than to bow ourselves in
   lowliest obeisance before the hand of God. Dear Friend, what can be the
   use of striving against the hand of the Lord? It is a mighty hand--we
   cannot resist it, even if we are wicked enough to attempt rebellion! If
   affliction is to come, it will come, and come with all the greater
   sharpness because we refuse to yield. If God appoints a trial, we
   cannot escape it. What can be the use of our striving against Divine
   decrees? It will only make our sorrow more severe. When the ox kicks
   against the goad, the iron enters deeper into its flesh, but when the
   bullock hastens on its way, sensitive to the least touch, the driver
   scarcely urges it again.

   The tender, sensitive horse scarcely receives a stroke from the whip;
   he feels it too much. But the mule that will not move is struck again
   and again for his obstinacy. So will it be with us. We can make rods
   for ourselves by willfulness. Oh foolish fingers which prepare thorns
   for our own pillows! Humble yourself, therefore, under the mighty hand
   of God and, by-and-by, Brothers and Sisters, you shall be exalted to
   consolation and prosperity. Your affliction shall bring forth the
   comfortable fruits of righteousness. You shall come out of the furnace
   purified and refined. You shall have more knowledge, more Grace, more
   zeal, more of every excellence as the result of sanctified trial--but
   all this must come by obedient resignation.

   A rebellious heart comes out of affliction worse rather than better.
   Submit, and you shall be so exalted by your affliction that you shall
   bless God for it, and feel that you would not have missed the trouble
   for 10,000 pounds if you could have done so! Heavy tribulation shall
   bring with it unspeakable preferment. You shall be exalted to a higher
   degree in the peerage of Christianity by putting up with adversities.
   Therefore, I pray you, humble yourselves under the hand of

   God.

   III. Thirdly, I am going to use the text in another way. IN OUR DAILY
   DEALINGS WITH GOD, whether in affliction or not, let us humble
   ourselves under His hand, for only so can we hope to be exalted. It is
   a blessed thing whenever you come to God, to come wondering that you
   are allowed to come, wondering that you have been led to come--
   marveling at Divine election, that the Lord should ever have chosen you
   to come--wondering at Divine redemption, astonished that such a price
   should have been paid that you might be brought near to God! It is well
   to draw near to God weighed down with gratitude that the Holy Spirit
   should have ever deigned to work effectual calling upon you. Humble
   yourself under the mighty hand of Divine Grace which has brought you
   into the family of love--constantly say, "Why me, Lord? Why me?"

   A grateful walk is a gracious walk and there is no gratitude where
   there is no humility. Never trace the difference between yourself and
   others to your own free will, nor to any betterness of your natural
   disposition, but entirely to the mercy and Grace of God which have been
   freely bestowed on you! Let Grace be magnified by your grateful heart!
   When you are doing this, be very humble before God because you have not
   made more improvement of the Grace that He has given you. You are
   chosen, but you are not as choice as you ought to be! You are redeemed,
   but you are not so much your Lord's as you ought to be! You are called,
   but you are still too deaf to the Divine call! You are blessed,
   enriched, instructed, adopted, comforted--with Heaven before you and
   everything prepared on the road--but what a poor return you have made!
   Always feel thus humbled in reference to your God and His Grace.

   When you are doing most and God is using you most, always feel that if
   you had been fit for it, He might have done much more by you--that if
   you had been meet to be used, He might have used you far more
   extensively. Thus you will always see cause for humility, even when you
   discern abounding reason for gratitude. Walk always so with God that
   when you stand on the highest point you still feel, "I might have been
   higher but for my own fault. I have not, because I have not asked, or
   because I have asked amiss. I have not become as rich as I might have
   been in spiritual things because I have not been as diligent in my
   Lord's business, or as fervent in spirit, or as abundant in serving God
   as I ought to have

   been."

   Next, humble yourself, dear Brothers and Sisters, under the hand of God
   by feeling your own need of knowledge whenever you come to God. Do not
   think that you understand all Divinity. There is only one body of
   Divinity and that is Christ, Himself--and who knows Him to the fullest?
   When even His love, which is the most plain point about Him,

   passes knowledge, who shall know Christ in all His fullness? Come
   before God to be instructed in the knowledge of your God and Savior. Do
   not think that you understand Providence, for I am sure that none of us
   do. We sometimes think that we could manage things a great deal better
   than they are managed. Many farmers would not have appointed that heavy
   shower for this afternoon and yet that downpour was essential to the
   general well-being of the universal kingdom. I cannot tell why, but it
   is so. Everything that comes by God's appointment is a cog in the wheel
   of Providence--and if that cog were gone, the machinery would be out of
   order. The Lord does all things wisely--only a vile pride will suspect
   otherwise.

   Consider, O man that you do not know--only God knows! Little children
   sometimes think they are wise but they know nothing. Wisdom is with
   their father, not with them. Let us be content to humble ourselves
   under the hand of God as poor know-nothings, satisfied that He knows
   what is best for us. This humility is the vestibule of knowledge, the
   cornerstone of true philosophy. Commence with a confession of
   ignorance, or you will never be taught of the Lord! It cannot be hard
   to confess this when the mighty hand of the Lord is seen and felt. One
   point concerning which I should like everyone of us to humble ourselves
   under the hand of God is about our little enjoyment of Divine things.
   The elder brother in the parable said, "Lo, these many years do I serve
   you! Neither transgressed I at any time your commandment: and yet you
   never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends."

   So have I known certain sincere Christian men fall into a horribly
   legal state of mind. They have always been very regular in their
   giving, constant in their religious observances, persevering in their
   prayers and yet they have never had much joy. But they see a poor soul,
   just saved from sin, full of delight, and they envy him and cry out,
   "Why is a fuss made over such a sinner, when I have been all these
   years a Christian and my Brethren have never made any rejoicing over
   me? There is no music and dancing about me! You never gave me a kid
   that I might make merry with my friends." I do not know how we could
   make a fuss over some of the elder Brothers--they would not allow
   it--they would be angry and enquire, in hard and surly tones, what
   these things meant! Music and dancing are things too trivial for their
   solid souls. They stand outside and grumble--and we cannot warm them
   into a revival spirit! They are freezing outside the door of our happy
   home. Must they always stand there?

   How divinely sweet was the father's answer to that naughty elder
   brother! He said to him, "Son, you are always with me and all that I
   have is yours." That is to say, "You live in my house. You are with me
   as my own dear son. Everything I have is yours by heirship. Your
   brother had his portion and he spent it, but all that remains to me is
   yours." Hence his short commons had been of his own appointing! If he
   had not made merry with his friends, it was his own fault. Is it not
   much the same with us if we have been dull and melancholy? I mean those
   of us who are Believers. Are not all things ours? Come, let us humble
   ourselves under the hand of God because we have not made merry with our
   friends! You growling Christians--if you growl it is because you will
   growl--there is nothing to growl at!

   You who never have a happy day, who never have any of the fervor and
   enthusiasm of young beginners--whose fault is that? It is your own! You
   might have anything in the Father's house. You have a right to rare
   music and dancing, for you are always with God, and all that He has is
   yours. It is meet that we should make merry and be glad! And if we are
   dull at the business of holy merry-making, let us humble ourselves
   under the hand of God because of our despondency and mistrust! O my
   Soul, if your ceilings are painted with black instead of vermilion,
   blame only yourself--not your

   God!

   I am sure, dear Friends, if any of us will go over our daily lives, we
   shall find plenty of reasons for humbling ourselves under the hand of
   God. It is really dreadful how a man can serve God nobly and do great
   things and yet, in a certain matter, he may sadly fail. A grand old
   Prophet is that Jonah, going through the streets of Nineveh and bravely
   delivering the Lord's warning. Whoever did the same? "Yet forty days
   and Nineveh shall be overthrown" are the words which he hurls into the
   face of princes. Grand man! One, yet a conqueror of myriads! Yes! But
   look at him a day or two later! Call that a grand man sitting there
   crying because the cucumber that grew up over his head is withered? He
   is fretting because a worm has devoured a gourd! He is angry and he
   says that he does well to be angry about a couple of melon leaves! Dear
   me, that a man can be so great in noble things and so little in a
   trifling matter!

   How many have the same cause to be humble before God? Observe that good
   man--he bore the loss of his property with holy resignation, but he
   lost his temper because a button was undone from his linen! Such a
   thing has often happened. Do I put it so that you smile at it? It would
   be better to weep over it! As you think about yourselves, my Brothers

   and Sisters, remember the causes that you have to be humble under the
   hand of God because of the gross weakness by which you have shown the
   natural depravity of your heart and the faultiness of your nature apart
   from the strengthening Spirit of God. Humble yourselves, therefore,
   under the hand of God as creatures under the hand of the Creator. We
   are the clay and You our potter, O Lord! It becomes us to be lowly.

   Humble yourselves under the hand of God as criminals under the hand of
   their judge. Cry, "Against You, You only, have I sinned and done this
   evil in Your sight, that You might be justified when You speak and be
   clear when You judge." Humble yourselves under the hand of God as
   chastened children under a father's rod, for He chastens us for our
   profit and right well do we deserve each smarting blow. Humble
   yourselves under the mighty hand of God, lastly, as servants under
   their Lord's Word. Ask no questions about your Master's command, but go
   and do it! And when He rebukes you for shortcomings, answer not, but
   accept the reproof with bowed head and tearful eyes, acknowledging that
   His rebuke is well deserved. Humble yourselves thus, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, in your daily lives and God will exalt you in due time.

   IV. I finish by using my text with all the earnestness my soul can feel
   in reference to the unconverted part of this audience IN OUR SEEKING
   FORGIVENESS AS SINNERS. Oh, tender Spirit of God, help me! The text was
   not originally meant for the ungodly, but it may fitly be applied to
   them. If you would find Grace in God's sight and live, dear unconverted
   Hearers, you must humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God. So
   you want to be saved, do you? The way of salvation is, "Believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ." "But," you say, "I do not understand it." Yet it is
   very simple--no hidden meaning lies in the words--you are simply bid to
   trust Jesus.

   If, however, you feel as if you could not do that, let me urge you to
   go to God in secret and admit the sin of this unbelief, for a it is
   great sin! Humble yourself. Do not try to make out that you are good.
   That will be fatal, for it will be a falsehood which will shut the gate
   of Grace. Confess that you are guilty. When a man is clearly and
   manifestly guilty, it is of no use his standing before the judge and
   beginning to urge his own merit--his best course is to cast himself
   upon the mercy of the court. It is your only course, dear Soul, the
   only one that can be of use to you. Know that you have transgressed and
   feel that it is so. Sit down and think over the many ways in which you
   have done wrong, or failed to do right. Pray God to break you down with
   deep penitence. It is no waste of time to dig out foundations when you
   build a house, and it is no superfluity to labor after a deep sense of
   sin.

   When your sin is confessed, then acknowledge that if justice were
   carried out towards you, apart from undeserved Grace, you would be sent
   to Hell. Do not quibble at that fact! Do not entertain skeptical
   questions as to whether there is a punishment for sin and as to what it
   will be, but acknowledge that whatever it is, you deserve it. Do not
   fence with God or quarrel with Scripture, but as His Word declares that
   the wicked shall be cast into Hell with all the nations that forget
   God, admit that you deserve to be so dealt, for you deserve it. When
   this is acknowledged, you are on the road to mercy. You have almost
   obtained mercy when you have fully submitted to justice. You have, in a
   measure, received Grace when you are brought to admit your sin and the
   justice of its penalty.

   Then, next, accept God's mercy in His own way. Do not be so vain as to
   dictate to God how you ought to be saved. Be willing to be saved by
   Free Grace through the blood of Jesus Christ, for that is God's way. Be
   willing to be saved by faith in Jesus Christ, for that, also, is God's
   way. If your unbelief begins to ask, "How can it be and why should it
   be?" cease from such questions! Humble yourself and say, "God says it
   is so and, therefore, it must be so." If God says, "Believe and be
   saved," I will believe and be saved. And if He says, "Trust Christ, and
   live," I will trust Christ and live! If a man had forfeited his life,
   but should be told by the court that he shall have pardon freely given
   to him if he will freely accept it--he would be a fool if he began to
   enquire, "But is this according to law? Is this according to precedent?
   What may be the effect of this pardon?" and so on. These enquiries are
   for the court, not for the prisoner! My dear Sir, you do not want to
   hang yourself, do you?

   Yet some men argue against their own souls and labor to find out
   reasons why they should not be saved! If this perverse ingenuity could
   but be taught right reason and men would strive to find out why they
   should at once yield themselves to God's way of salvation, they might
   enter into comfort and rest much sooner. O quibbling Sinner, let your
   artful doubts and reasoning be nailed with Jesus to the Cross! Be a
   little child and come and believe in the salvation which is revealed in
   Jesus Christ. Trust Christ to save you and He will do it, as He has
   saved so many of us to the praise and glory of His Grace. "Ah," you
   say, "I have done this, but I cannot get peace." Then dear Friend, sink
   lower down! Sink lower

   down! Did I hear you say, "Alas, Sir, I need to get comfort"? Cease
   from that! Do not ask for comfort--ask for forgiveness--and that
   blessing may come through your greater discomfort. Sink lower down!
   Sink lower down! There is a point at which God will surely accept you
   and that point is lower down!

   "Oh," you say, "I think I have a due sense of sin." That will not do! I
   want you to feel that you have not a due sense of sin and come to Jesus
   for it! "Oh, but I think that I have been brokenhearted." I should like
   to see you lower than that, till you cry, "I am afraid I never knew
   what it was to be brokenhearted." I want you to sink so low that you
   cannot say anything good about yourself--no, nor see an atom of
   goodness in yourself! When you look inside your heart and can see
   nothing but that which would condemn you. When you look at your life
   and see everything there that deserves wrath--then you are on the road
   to hope! Come before God a criminal, in the prison dress, with the rope
   about your neck! You will be saved, then! When you confess that you
   have nothing of your own but sin. When you acknowledge that you deserve
   to die and to be cast away forever--God, in infinite pity, will let you
   live through faith in Christ Jesus!

   Many years ago a certain prince visited the Spanish galleys where a
   large number of convicts were confined, chained to their oars to toil
   on without relief. I think nearly all of them were condemned to a life
   sentence. Being a great prince, the King of Spain told him that he
   might, in honor of his visit, set free any one of the galley slaves he
   chose. He went down among them to choose his man. He said to one, "Man,
   how did you come here?" He replied that false witnesses swore away his
   character. "Ah!" said the prince and passed on. He went to the next,
   who stated that he had done something that was certainly wrong, but not
   very much, and that he never ought to have been condemned. "Ah," said
   the prince, and again passed on. He went the round and found that they
   were all good fellows--all convicted by mistake.

   At last he came to one who said, "You ask me why I came here? I am
   ashamed to say that I richly deserve it. I am guilty, I cannot for a
   moment say that I am not. And if I die at this oar, I thoroughly
   deserve the punishment. In fact, I think it a mercy that my life is
   spared me." The prince stopped and said, "It is a pity that such a bad
   fellow as you should be placed amongst such a number of innocent
   people! I will set you free." You smile at that, but let me make you
   smile again. My Lord Jesus Christ has come here, at this time, to set
   somebody free! He has come here, at this time, to pardon somebody's
   sins!

   You that have no sins shall have no pardon. You good people shall die
   in your sins! But, you guilty ones, who humble yourselves under the
   hand of God, my Master thinks that it is a pity that you should be
   among these self-righteous people! So come right away and trust your
   Savior--and obtain life eternal through His precious blood! And to Him
   shall be glory forever and ever. Amen.

A Gospel Worth Dying For

   (No. 1734)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 12, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT EXETER HALL.

   "To testify the Gospel of the Grace of God." Acts 20:24.

   PAUL says that in comparison with his great objective of preaching the
   Gospel, he did not count even his life to be dear to himself; yet we
   are sure Paul highly valued life. He had the same love of life as other
   men and he knew that his own life was of great consequence to the
   Churches and to the cause of Christ. In another place he said, "To
   abide in the flesh is more necessary for you." He was not weary of
   life, nor was he a vain person who could treat life as though it were a
   thing to fling away in sport. He valued life, for he prized time, which
   is the stuff that life is made of, and he turned to practical account,
   each day and hour, "redeeming the time because the days are evil." Yet
   he soberly said to the elders of the Church at Ephesus that he did not
   regard his life as a dear thing in comparison with bearing testimony to
   the Gospel of the Grace of God.

   According to the verse before us, the Apostle regarded life as a race
   which he had to run. Now, the more quickly a race is run, the
   better--certainly, length is not the object or desire. The one thought
   of a runner is how he can most speedily reach the winning post. He
   spurns the ground beneath him; he cares not for the course he traverses
   except so far as it is the way over which he must run to reach his
   desired end. Such was life to Paul--all the energies of his spirit were
   consecrated to the pursuit of one objective--namely, that he might,
   everywhere, bear testimony to the Gospel of the Grace of God--and the
   life which he lived here below was only valued by him as a means to
   that end. He also regarded the Gospel and His ministry in witnessing to
   it, as a sacred deposit which had been committed to him by the Lord,
   Himself. He looked upon himself "as put in trust with the Gospel" and
   he resolved to be faithful though it should cost him his

   life.

   He says he "desired to fulfill the ministry which he had received of
   the Lord Jesus Christ." Before his mind's eye he saw the Savior taking
   into His pierced hands the priceless case which contains the celestial
   jewel of the Grace of God and saying to him--"I have redeemed you with
   My blood and I have called you by My name--and now I commit this
   precious thing into your hands, that you may take care of it and guard
   it with your heart's blood. I commission you to go everywhere in My
   place and to make known to every people under Heaven the Gospel of the
   Grace of God." All Believers occupy a somewhat similar place. We are,
   none of us, called to the Apostleship--and we may not all have been
   called to the public preaching of the Word of God--but we are all
   charged to be valiant for the Truth of God upon the earth and to
   contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. Oh, to do
   this in the spirit of the Apostle of the Gentiles!

   As Believers, we are all called to some form of ministry, and this
   ought to make our life a race and cause us to regard ourselves as the
   guardians of the Gospel, even as he that bears the colors of a regiment
   regards himself as bound to sacrifice everything for their
   preservation. Paul was a true hero--a hero of even a nobler stamp than
   those brave Greeks whose stories still stir the blood and fire the
   soul! Their heroism, to a large extent, depended upon public note, the
   present approval of their fellow citizens, or upon the animal
   excitement of the battlefield. But Paul's heroism, so far as man was
   concerned, was self-contained--deliberate and as sure to display itself
   in the solitude of a dungeon as in the assembly of the faithful. He was
   parting with his weeping friends and going forward to trials of unknown
   intensity, but he was altogether unmoved by fear and advanced on his
   way without a question.

   His leave-taking of the elders irresistibly reminds me of the old
   historian's record of Epaminondas the Theban general who, when he was
   mortally wounded by a Spartan spear, the head of which remained in his
   flesh, bade his friends leave it alone a little, "for" he said, "I have
   lived long enough only if I die unconquered." And when they told him
   that the battle was won and that his comrades were victorious, he bade
   them draw out the head of the spear, that his life might end. One
   observed to him that he had fallen but that he had not lost his shield
   and that the victory was won--to

   which he replied with his last breath, "Your Epaminondas thus dying
   does not die." So Paul has lived long enough if the Gospel is
   prospering in its course! And though he lays down his life, he does not
   die if his ministry is fulfilled!

   Let me read you his words and you shall judge if they have not this
   heroic ring--"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem,
   not knowing the things that shall befall me there: save that the Holy
   Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide
   me. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto
   myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry,
   which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the
   Grace of God."

   We shall, this morning, first of all inquire what was this Gospel which
   Paul judged to be worth dying for?--"The Gospel of the Grace of God."
   When we have made that inquiry, I think we shall be prepared for
   another. If we cannot die for it, how can we live for it? And then,
   thirdly, I shall press this consecration upon you by answering the
   question-- Why should we? Oh, that the Holy Spirit may work in us the
   holy devotion and self-sacrifice of Paul!

   I. First, then, our enquiry this morning is, WHAT WAS THIS GOSPEL FOR
   WHICH PAUL WOULD DIE? It is not everything called, "gospel," which
   would produce such enthusiasm, or deserve it. For, my Brothers and
   Sisters, we have gospels, nowadays, which I would not die for, nor
   recommend anyone of you to live for, inasmuch as they are gospels that
   will be snuffed out within a few years. It is never worth while to die
   for a doctrine which will, itself, die out. I have lived long enough to
   see half-a-dozen new gospels rise, flourish and decay. They told me
   long ago that my old Cal-vinistic doctrine was far behind the age and
   was an exploded thing!

   And, next, I heard that evangelical teaching in any form was a thing of
   the past, to be supplanted by "advanced thought." I have heard of one
   improvement upon the old faith and then of another--and the
   philosophical divines are still improving their theology! They have
   gone on advancing and advancing, till Heaven knows and perhaps Hell
   knows what next they will advance to, but I am sure I do not. I would
   not die for any one of all the modern systems. I would like to ask
   broad church divines whether there is any positive doctrine in the
   Bible at all--and whether any form of teaching could, for a moment, be
   judged worth dying for--and whether the martyrs were not great fools to
   die for Truths of God which might be valuable to them, but which the
   advance of thought has cast into disuse!

   Those men and women who went to Smithfield and were burnt to death for
   Christ--were they not fools, every one of them, to die for a set of
   ideas which "modern thought" has quite exploded? I do verily think that
   to our modern divines, there is no such thing as fixed truth, or that,
   if there is, they are not sure of having yet reached it. They have dug
   and dug, and dug--look at the dark pits of unbelief which they have
   opened--but they have not come yet to the rock. Wait a little
   longer--they may, one of these days, find out something solid--but as
   yet they have only bored through layers of sand. Yet there used to be a
   Gospel in the world which consisted of facts which Christians never
   questioned. There was once, in the Church, a Gospel which Believers
   hugged to their hearts as if it were their soul's life! There used to
   be a Gospel in the world which provoked enthusiasm and commanded
   sacrifice!

   Tens of thousands have met together to hear this Gospel at peril of
   their lives. Men, to the teeth of tyrants, have proclaimed it and have
   suffered the loss of all things--they went to prison and to death for
   it--all the while singing Psalms! Is there not such a Gospel remaining?
   Or have we arrived at cloudland, where souls starve on suppositions and
   become incapable of confidence or ardor? Are the disciples of Jesus now
   to be fed upon the froth of "thought" and the wind of imagination on
   which men become heady and high-minded? No! We will return to the
   substantial meat of Infallible Revelation and cry to the Holy Spirit to
   feed us upon His own Inspired Word! What is this Gospel which Paul
   valued before his own life? It was called, by him, "the Gospel of the
   Grace of God." That which most forcibly struck the Apostle in the
   Gospel was that it was a message of Grace and of Grace, alone!

   Amid the music of the glad tidings, one note rang out above all others
   and charmed the Apostle's ears--that note was Grace--the Grace of God.
   He regarded that note as characteristic of the whole strain! The Gospel
   was "the Gospel of the Grace of God." In these days that word, "Grace,"
   is not often heard--we hear of moral duties, scientific adjustments and
   human progress--but who tells us of "the Grace of God" except a few
   old-fashioned people who will soon be gone? As one of those antiquated
   folk, I am here this morning, and I shall try to proclaim that word,
   "GRACE," so that those who know its joyful sound shall be glad, and
   those who despise it shall be cut to the heart! Grace is the essence of
   the Gospel! Grace is the one hope for this fallen world! Grace is the
   sole comfort of saints looking forward to Heaven!

   Perhaps Paul had a clearer view of Grace than even Peter, or James, or
   John and, therefore, he has so much larger space in the New Testament.
   The other Apostolic writers excelled Paul in certain respects, but
   Paul, as to his depth and clearness in the Doctrines of Grace, stood
   first and foremost. We need Paul again, or at least the Pauline
   evangelism and definiteness. He would make short work of the new
   gospels and say of those who follow them, "I marvel that you are so
   soon removed from him that called you into the Grace of Christ unto
   another Gospel, which is not another; but there are some that trouble
   you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ."

   Let me try to explain in a brief manner how the Gospel is the good news
   of Grace. The Gospel is an announcement that God is prepared to deal
   with guilty man on the ground of free favor and pure mercy. There would
   be no good news in saying that God is just, for, in the first place,
   that is not even news--we know that God is just. The natural conscience
   teaches man that. That God will punish sin and reward righteousness is
   not news at all and, if it were news, yet it would not be good news,
   for we have all sinned--and upon the ground of justice we must perish.
   But it is news and news of the best kind, that the Judge of all is
   prepared to pardon transgression and to justify the ungodly! It is good
   news to the sinful that the Lord will blot out sin, cover the sinner
   with righteousness and receive him into His favor--and that not on
   account of anything he has done, or will do--but out of Sovereign
   Grace!

   Though we are all guilty without exception and all most justly
   condemned for our sins, yet God is ready to take us from under the
   curse of His Law and give us all the blessedness of righteous men as an
   act of pure mercy! Remember how David saw this and spoke of it in the
   32nd Psalm--"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin
   is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity,
   and in whose spirit there is no guile." This is a message worth dying
   for, that through the Covenant of Grace, God can be just and yet the
   Justifier of him that believes in Jesus! That He can be the righteous
   Judge of men and yet believing men can be freely justified by His Grace
   through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus! That God is merciful
   and gracious--and is ready to bless the most unworthy--is a wonderful
   piece of news, worth a man's spending a hundred lives to tell!

   My heart leaps within me as I repeat it in this Hall and tell the
   penitent, the desponding and the despairing that, though their sins
   deserve Hell, yet Grace can give them Heaven and make them fit for
   it--and that as a sovereign act of love--altogether independent of
   their character or what they deserve! Because the Lord has said, "I
   will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion
   on whom I will have compassion," there is hope for the most hopeless!
   Since "it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God
   that shows mercy," (Rom. 9:16), there is an open door of hope for those
   who otherwise might despair!

   It is as though there had been held a great assize and the judge had
   passed from county to county and a number of prisoners had been
   condemned. Now there remained nothing further in the course of justice
   but that their sentences should be carried into execution. Lo,
   suddenly, by the silver trumpets of messengers clothed in silken
   apparel, it is proclaimed that the king has discovered a method by
   which, without violating justice, he can deal with the condemned in
   pure mercy and so grant them free pardon, immediate release from prison
   and a place in his majesty's favor and service! This would be glad
   tidings in the condemned cells, would it not? Would you not be glad to
   carry such news to the poor prisoners? Ah, Paul, I can understand your
   getting into a holy excitement over such a Revelation as that of Free
   Grace! I can understand your being willing to throw your life away that
   you might tell to your fellow sinners that Grace reigns through
   righteousness unto eternal life!

   But the Gospel tells us much more than this, namely, that in order to
   His dealing with men upon the ground of free favor, God the Father has,
   Himself, removed the grand obstacle which stood in the way of mercy.
   God is just--that is a Truth most sure--man's conscience knows it to be
   so--and man's conscience will never rest content unless it can see that
   the justice of God is vindicated. Therefore, in order that God might
   justly deal in a way of pure mercy with men, He gave His only-begotten
   Son, that by His death the Law might receive its due and the eternal
   principles of His government might be maintained. Jesus was appointed
   to stand in man's place; to bear man's sin and endure the chastisement
   of man's

   guilt. rd

   How clearly does Isaiah state this in his 53rd chapter! Man is now
   saved because the commandment is not set aside, nor the penalty
   revoked--all is done and suffered which could be exacted by the
   sternest justice and yet Grace has her hands untied to distribute
   pardons as she pleases. The debtor is loosed, for the debt is paid! See
   a dying Savior and hear the Prophet say, "The chastisement of our peace
   was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed." Here, too, every-

   thing is of Grace. Brothers and Sisters, it was Grace on God's part to
   resolve upon devising and accepting an atonement and, especially, in
   His actually providing that atonement at His own cost! There is the
   wonder of it--He that was offended provides the reconciliation! He had
   but one Son and sooner than there should be any obstacle in His way as
   to dealing with men on the footing of pure Grace, He took that Son from
   His bosom, allowed Him to assume our frail nature and, in that nature
   permitted Him to die--the Just for the unjust--to bring us to God!

   You admire Abraham's giving up his son to God? Much more admire
   Jehovah's giving up His Son for sinners! "Herein is love, not that we
   loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the
   propitiation for our sins." This, then, is the Gospel of the Grace of
   God--that God is able, without injustice, to deal with men in a way of
   pure mercy, altogether apart from their sins or their merits because
   their sins were laid upon His dear Son Jesus Christ, who has offered to
   Divine Justice a complete satisfaction, so that God is glorious in
   holiness and yet rich in mercy! Ah, beloved Paul, there is something
   worth preaching here!

   In the Gospel there is also revealed a motive for mercy which is in
   agreement with the Grace of God. There is always needed, in the action
   of every wise man, a competent motive. Men do not act without reason if
   they are reasonable men. The same is true with God, the highest of all
   intelligences--He acts upon the highest reasons. His motive for dealing
   with men on the footing of Free Grace is the revealing of His own
   glorious Character. He says, "Not for your sakes do I do this, says the
   Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own
   ways, O house of Israel." He works the wonders of His Grace "to the
   intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places
   might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God, according to
   the eternal purpose, which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord."

   He finds a motive in His own Nature and mercy since He could not find
   it anywhere else! He will deal with guilty men according to the
   sovereignty of His will, "to the praise of the glory of His Grace in
   which He has made us accepted in the Beloved." He saves men that His
   own beloved Son, Jesus Christ, may be magnified and extolled, and be
   very high, and that His Holy Spirit may be honored in the new-creating
   of rebellious natures. Listen to this, you that feel your guilt-- God
   is able, without infringement of His justice, to deal with you on the
   footing of pure Grace, and He has found a reason for so doing, a reason
   which will apply as much to the worst of men as to the best! If it is
   for His own glory's sake that He saves guilty sinners! Then a window is
   opened by which light can come to those who sit in the thickest gloom
   of despair!

   In order to the accomplishment of the designs of Grace, it was
   necessary, further, that a Gospel message should be issued full of
   promise, encouragement and blessing. And truly that message has been
   delivered to us, for that Gospel which we preach today is full of Grace
   to the very brim! It speaks on this wise--Sinner, just as you are,
   return to the Lord and He will receive you graciously and love you
   freely! God has said, "I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and
   their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more." For Christ's
   sake, and not because of any agonies, or tears, or sorrows on your
   part, He will remove your sins as far from you as the east is from the
   west! He says, "Come now, and let us reason together: though your sins
   are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red
   like crimson, they shall be as wool."

   You may come to Jesus just as you are and He will give you full
   remission upon your believing in Him. The Lord says today, "Look not
   within, as though you would search for any merit there, but look unto
   Me, and be you saved. I will bless you apart from merit, according to
   the Atonement of Christ Jesus." He says, "Look not within as though you
   looked for any strength for future life--I am both your strength and
   your salvation, for when you were yet without strength, in due time
   Christ died for the ungodly." The Gospel invitation is, "Ho, everyone
   that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money, come
   buy and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without
   price." Come and welcome, you lame, you halt, you blind, you wandering,
   you foul, you miserable! You are invited, not because you are good, but
   because you are evil--not because you are hopeful, but because you are
   hopeless!

   The Gospel message is of Grace because it is directed to those whose
   only claim is their need. The whole have no need of a physician, but
   they that are sick. Christ came not to call the righteous but sinners
   to repentance. Come, therefore, you morally sick--you whose brows are
   white with the leprosy of sin--come and welcome, for to you is this
   free Gospel proclaimed by Divine authority! Assuredly such a message as
   this is worth any exertion for its spreading and it is so blessed, so
   Divine, that we may gladly pour out our blood to proclaim it!

   Further, Brethren, that this Gospel blessing might come within the
   reach of men, God's Grace has adopted a method suitable to their
   condition. "How can I be forgiven?" one asks, "tell me truly and
   quickly!" "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved!"
   God asks of you no good works, nor good feelings, either, but only that
   you are willing to accept what He most freely gives! He saves upon
   believing. This is faith--that you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son
   of God and that you trust yourself with Him! "But as many as received
   Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that
   believe on His name." If you believe, you are saved! Salvation "is of
   faith that it might be of Grace, to the end the promise might be sure
   to all the seed."

   Do you say, "But faith itself seems beyond my reach"? Then, in the
   Gospel of the Grace of God, we are told that even faith is God's
   gift--and that He works it in men by His Holy Spirit--for apart from
   that Spirit they lie dead in trespasses and sins. Oh, what Grace is
   this, that the faith which is commanded is also conferred! "But," says
   one, "if I were to believe in Christ and have my past sins forgiven,
   yet I fear I should go back to sin, for I have no strength by which to
   keep myself for the future." Listen! The Gospel of the Grace of God is
   this, that He will keep you to the end--that He will preserve within
   you the fire which He kindles, for He says, "I give unto My sheep
   eternal life." And again He says, "The water that I shall give him
   shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life."
   The sheep of Christ shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them
   out of Christ's hand!

   Do you hear this, you guilty ones--you who have no claim upon God's
   Grace whatever? His Free Grace comes to you, even to you! And if you
   are made willing to receive it, you are this day a saved man and saved
   forever beyond all question! I say it again, this is a Gospel so well
   worth the preaching that I can understand Paul saying, "Neither count I
   my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy,
   and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify
   the Gospel of the Grace of God." I read in an old book a dream of one
   who was under concern of soul. He fell asleep and dreamed that he was
   out in the wilds in a terrible storm. The lightning flamed around him
   and the voice of the thunder made the earth rock beneath him.

   He looked eagerly around for a shelter. He ran to the first house
   before him, but he was denied admittance. He that dwelt there was named
   Justice and he said in angry tones, "Get out of here--I cannot shelter
   a criminal, a traitor to his King and God!" He fled to the next house
   and it turned out to be the mansion of Truth. Truth came to the door
   with a calm but stern countenance and said, "You are full of falsehood,
   you can not sojourn here." He fled to the home of Peace, which stood
   near, and hoped that there, perhaps, he might be housed from the storm.
   But Peace said, "Go away! There is no peace, says my God, unto the
   wicked." He could not, then, tell what to do, for the storm waxed yet
   more furious, when lo, he saw a portal over which was written, "Mercy."
   "Yes," he said, "this is the place for me, for I am guilty." The door
   was open and he was welcomed there.

   To that house I invite you! Come in and be at rest. You who cannot as
   yet be harbored by justice, or peace, or truth, may come to mercy and
   receive abundant Grace! Do you seem inclined to accept the way and
   method of Grace? Let me test you. Some men think they love a thing and
   yet they do not, for they have made a mistake concerning it. Do you
   understand that you are to have no claim upon God? He says, "I will
   have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on
   whom I will have compassion." When it comes to pure mercy, then, no one
   can possibly make a claim! In fact, no claim can exist! If it is of
   Grace it is not of debt, and if of debt it is not of Grace. If God
   wills to save one man and another is left to perish in his own willful
   sin, that other cannot dare to dispute with God! Or if he does, the
   answer is-- "Can I not do as I will with My own?"

   Oh, but you seem now as if you started back from it! See, your pride
   revolts against the Sovereignty of Grace! Let me beckon you back again.
   Though you have no claim, there is another Truth of God which smiles
   upon you, for, on the other hand, there is no bar to your obtaining
   mercy. If no goodness is needed to recommend you to God--since all must
   be pure favor which He gives--then also no evil can shut you out from
   that favor! However guilty you may be, it may be God may show favor to
   you. He has in other cases called out the chief of sinners--why not in
   your case also? At any rate, no aggravation of sin, no continuance in
   sin, no height of sin can be a reason why God should not look with
   Grace upon you, for if pure Grace and nothing else but Grace is to have
   sway, then the jet black transgressor may be saved. In his case there
   is room for Grace to manifest its greatness!

   I have heard men make excuses out of the Doctrine of Election. They
   have said, "What if I should not be elect?" It seems to me far wiser to
   say, "What if I should be elect?" Yes, I am elect if I believe in
   Jesus, for there never was a soul yet

   that cast itself upon the Atonement of Christ but what that soul was
   chosen of God from before the foundation of the world! This is the
   Gospel of the Grace of God and I know that it touches the heart of many
   of you. It often stirs my soul like the sound of martial music to think
   of my Lord's Grace from old eternity, a Grace that is constant to its
   choice and will be constant to it when all these visible things shall
   disappear as sparks that fly from the chimney!

   My heart is glad within me to preach Free Grace and dying love--I can
   understand why crowds met at the dead of night to hear of the Grace of
   God. I can understand the Covenanters on the bleak hills listening with
   sparkling eyes as Cameron preached of the Grace of the great King!
   There is something in a Free-Grace Gospel worth preaching, worth
   listening to, worth living for and worth dying for!

   II. This brings me to the second head. You and I are not called to die
   for it just yet--let us make sure that today we live for it. HOW CAN WE
   LIVE FOR THIS GOSPEL OF THE GRACE OF GOD? I answer first, if anybody
   here is to live for this Gospel, he must have received it from God and
   he must have received a call to minister or serve for it. He must feel
   himself under bonds to hold and keep this Gospel not so much because he
   has chosen it, but because it has chosen him. I forget who it was, but
   a quaint old minister was once told that he could not preach in a
   certain pulpit if he held to the Doctrines of Grace. "Well," he said,
   "I think I might be allowed to preach there for I can truly say that I
   do not hold to the Doctrines of Grace--the Doctrines of Grace hold me."

   That might be rather a quibble, but there is a grand truth in it. When
   a man picks and selects his creed, the probabilities are that,
   by-and-by, he will pick again and will select another next time. There
   is about the love which constitutes our domestic bliss a something of
   necessity--our beloved one was chosen by us, but yet we could not help
   it--we were carried away and overborne and so our marriage came to
   pass. It was not altogether choice--there was a mystic power that
   enchained our hearts. And I am sure it is so with the Doctrines of
   Grace if we believe them--we chose them with a willing soul--but yet we
   were under constraint and could do no other.

   To me there is but one form of doctrine. I know no other. Brothers and
   Sisters, I cannot be of any other faith than that which I preached
   nearly 29 years ago on this platform! [Exeter Hall.] I think I have
   read as much as most men and I know most of the maunderings of advanced
   thinkers. But I have never come into their secret and I never can! I
   abhor the very idea of an advance upon the Gospel which Paul preached.
   I am today what I was when, as a youth, I preached to crowds in this
   Hall. I have progressed in my theology not so much as a tithe of an
   inch! I hope I preach better and with more experimental knowledge of
   the Truth of God; but that which I preached 33 years ago, I preach
   today!

   You know the story of the boy who stood upon the burning deck because
   his father said, "Stand there." And I desire to imitate his
   steadfastness. Other boys might be much wiser than he was, but his
   wisdom was obedience. I prefer obeying God to being wise with my own
   wisdom. The Gospel which the Bible has revealed and the Holy Spirit has
   taught me, I must preach--and no other! I am incapable of believing the
   novelties of the hour. I must abide in my old faith! I would say with
   Luther, "I cannot help it, so help me God!" I know no other Gospel
   today than that which I knew when I first believed in Jesus! 1 know
   that by Grace we are saved through faith and that not of ourselves--it
   is the gift of God! What more do I need to know? You may leave this
   Rock, if you like, my Brother, for you may be able to swim. But I must
   stay right where I am, for I would drown. When the crack of doom shall
   be heard, I shall be here, God helping me, believing the Gospel of the
   Grace of God and no other creed. I hope there is something in
   adhesiveness which will help to preserve, if not to spread the Gospel.
   Steadfastness at this particular time has a special value and I urge
   you to it--to the Gospel which you have received--to the Gospel of the
   Grace of God! I implore you to stand fast so long as you live.

   But the next thing Paul did was to make it known. Wherever he went, he
   published the Gospel. This is what we must do. "Oh," says one, "I
   cannot make it known." Why not? "I could not tell out the Gospel." Why
   not? "Why, I am a person of mean appearance and I do not suppose people
   would pay me any respect." Just what they said about Paul--"His
   personal presence is weak." "Oh, but I am no speaker." Just so, that
   also is what they said of Paul--"His speech is contemptible." "Oh, but
   if I were to say anything, I could not adorn it with a figure of
   speech, or illustrate it with a simile; I could not even quote a bit of
   poetry to make it fine." Paul also used homespun. He says, "We use
   great plainness of speech."

   Many of the other teachers were great orators, but Paul always fought
   shy of oratory. He stood up and allowed the Truth of God to freely flow
   out of his mouth, in its own way, and I believe at the present moment
   we need a race of preachers who will not be fine, or scholarly, or
   rhetorical, or sensational! We need men of whom you will say, when you

   have heard them--"I cannot make out why people flock to hear such a
   ministry. All that they can go for is what the man says, for he does
   not say it grandly. He does not seem as if he wanted to do so He
   appears only concerned to get his message out of his own heart and get
   it into the people's hearts." That is just what Paul did. Do you not
   think that you could tell the Gospel out in his fashion? "Oh, but I
   have so many infirmities." Yes, Paul said he gloried in infirmities
   because the power of Christ the more clearly rested on him. When he had
   done preaching the people could not say, "Oh, we understand why we felt
   it so! You see, Paul practices all the graces of manner. We quite
   understand why his speech penetrated our hearts--he has such a
   melodious, bell-like voice! We can understand why we like to hear
   him--he has such expressive eyes, they look into our souls."

   Now, Paul, in all probability, had weak eyes. According to his name, he
   was a short man and it is likely that he spoke very plainly. Yet he
   never felt sorry that it was so. On the contrary, he believed that in
   his weakness he was strong, for the power of Christ rested upon him. He
   hoped, also, that for this very reason their faith would not stand in
   the wisdom of man, but in the power of God! Brothers and Sisters, we
   are all qualified, if this is the case, to go and tell others the
   Gospel of the Grace of God! Yet further, Paul desired to testify to the
   Gospel. Now, to testify is something more than to proclaim--it means to
   bear personal witness to the Truth of God. Paul was specially qualified
   to testify, was he not? When he preached, he frequently told that story
   about the fierce persecutor who was on the way to Damascus and was
   suddenly struck down--a persecutor who had never asked to be saved by
   Grace, who had no free will towards Christ, but who had a very strong
   will against Him and was hauling men and women to prison--compelling
   them to blaspheme, being exceedingly mad against them.

   Oh how sweetly Paul told out the Gospel of the Grace of God when he
   said, "The Lord appeared to me by the way." "I obtained mercy, that in
   me, first, Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a
   pattern to them which should hereafter believe on Him to life
   everlasting." Friend, cannot you tell of your conversion, and let men
   know how Free Grace came to you when you were not looking for it? Nor
   would Paul end there, for he would often tell his consolations, how the
   Gospel had comforted him when he had been stoned and tried by false
   brethren--and yet had been upheld by the Grace of God. Paul could tell,
   also of his heavenly joys--how he had been often exceedingly lifted up
   and made to triumph in Christ by feeding upon the Gospel of the Grace
   of God! His personal experience of its power over himself was that
   which he used as the great instrument and argument for spreading the
   Gospel--for this is the meaning of testifying.

   My Friend, if the Gospel has done nothing for you, hold your tongue or
   speak against it! But if the Gospel has done for you what it has done
   for some of us--if it has changed the current of your life; if it has
   lifted you up from the dunghill and made you to sit as on a throne; if
   it is, today, your meat and your drink--if to your life it is the very
   center and sun, then bear constant witness to it! If the Gospel has
   become to you what it is to me--the light of my innermost heart, the
   core of my being--then proclaim it, proclaim it wherever you go and
   make men know that even if they reject it, it is to you the power of
   God unto salvation and will be the same to every man that believes!

   III. My time is gone, but yet I must detain you a minute while I remind
   you of reasons WHY WE, MY BRETHREN,

   SHOULD LIVE TO MAKE KNOWN THE GOSPEL OF THE GRACE OF GOD. First,
   because it is, after all, the only

   Gospel in the world! These mushroom gospels of the hour, which come and
   go like a penny newspaper which has its day and then is thrown aside,
   have no claim on any man's zeal! These changing moons of doctrine, what
   are they doing for England? They are doing much evil in this city--they
   are alienating the mass of the people from going to any place of
   worship at all! Why should they come to hear uncertainties? Why should
   they come merely to be taught their duty and to be moralized, and so
   on?

   Men are not led to assemble in multitudes by such poor attractions. I
   do not think that I would go across the street Sunday after Sunday
   merely to hear a moral essay! I might as well stay at home and read the
   paper. But to hear the Gospel of the Grace of God is worth many a
   mile's walk! And if it is plainly set forth in all our churches and
   chapels, I guarantee we should see very few empty pews--the people
   would come and hear it, for they always have done so! It is your
   graceless Gospel which starves the flock till they forsake the pasture!
   It is your Socinian reasoning which leads men to treat ministry and
   public worship with contempt! The old Gospel is a sweet savor which
   attracts the masses. When Whitefield sounded it forth, what common was
   big enough to hold the thousands? Man needs something that will cheer
   his heart in the midst of his labor and give him hope under a sense of
   sin. As the thirsty need water, so does man need the Gospel of the
   Grace of God!

   And there are no two gospels in the world any more than there are two
   suns in the heavens. There is but one atmosphere for us to breathe and
   one Gospel for us to live by. "Other foundation can no man lay than
   that which is laid, Jesus Christ the Righteous." Therefore proclaim the
   Gospel lest men die for lack of the knowledge of it! Do it, next,
   because it is for God's Glory. Do you not see how it glorifies God? It
   lays the sinner low; it makes man nobody, but God All in All. It sets
   God on a Throne and trails man in the dust! And then it sweetly leads
   men to worship and reverence the God of all Grace, who passes by
   transgression, iniquity and sin--therefore spread it! Spread it because
   thus you will glorify Christ! Oh, if He should come on this platform
   this morning, how gladly would we all make way for Him! How devoutly
   would we adore Him! If we might but see that head, that dear majestic
   head, would we not all bow in worship?

   And if He then spoke and said, "My Beloved, I have committed to you My
   Gospel. Hold it fast as you have received it! Give not way to the
   notions and inventions of men, but hold fast the Truth of God as you
   have received it and go and proclaim My Word, for I have other sheep,
   that are not yet of My fold, who must be brought in; and you have
   brothers that yet are prodigals and they must come home." I say, if He
   looked you, each one, in the face and addressed you so, your soul would
   answer, "Lord, I will live for You! I will make You known! I will die
   for You, if necessary, to publish the Gospel of Jesus Christ."

   Now, if you and I awaken ourselves this day, and God's Holy Spirit
   shall help us to do so--and we begin to proclaim the Gospel of the
   Grace of God--do you know what I think is sure to happen? I prophesy
   the best results! They tell us that all sorts of evils are growing
   strong--and Brothers, darkly prophetic, tell us that awful times are
   coming--I cannot tell you how dreadful they are to be! Popery is to
   come back, according to some, and once again the harlot of the Seven
   Hills is to dominate over all the earth! Is she? We shall see. If you
   boldly proclaim the Gospel, I tell you it will not be so! If the Gospel
   of the Grace of God is fully and fairly preached, it cannot be so!
   Listen to what John saw--"I saw another angel fly in the midst of
   Heaven having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on
   the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
   saying with a loud voice, fear God and give glory to Him."

   Do you see that angel? Observe what follows! Close behind him flies
   another celestial herald. "And there followed another angel, saying,
   Babylon is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink
   of the wine of the wrath of her fornication." Fly, angel of the
   everlasting Gospel! Fly, for as surely as you speed your flight, that
   other angel will follow who shall proclaim the downfall of Babylon and
   of every other system that opposes itself to the Grace of the Lord God
   Almighty! The Lord stir you up for His name's sake. Amen.

                   The Doctrines of Grace Do Not Lead to Sin

   A Sermon

   (No. 1735)

   Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, August 19th, 1883, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At Exeter-Hall.

   "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
   law, but under grace. What then? shall we sin, because we are not under
   the law, but under grace? God forbid."--Romans 6:14, 15.

   Last Sabbath morning I tried to show that the substance and essence of
   the true gospel is the doctrine of God's grace--that, in fact, if you
   take away the grace of God from the gospel you have extracted from it
   its very life-blood, and there is nothing left worth preaching, worth
   believing, or worth contending for. Grace is the soul of the gospel:
   without it the gospel is dead. Grace is the music of the gospel:
   without it the gospel is silent as to all comfort. I endeavoured also
   to set forth the doctrine of grace in brief terms, teaching that God
   deals with sinful men upon the footing of pure mercy: finding them
   guilty and condemned, he gives free pardons, altogether irrespective of
   past character, or of any good works which may be foreseen. Moved only
   by pity he devises a plan for their rescue from sin and its
   consequences--a plan in which grace is the leading feature. Out of free
   favour he has provided, in the death of his dear Son, an atonement by
   means of which his mercy can be justly bestowed. He accepts all those
   who place their trust in this atonement, selecting faith as the way of
   salvation, that it may be all of grace. In this he acts, from a motive
   found within himself, and not because of any reason found in the
   sinner's conduct, past, present, or future. I tried to show that this
   grace of God flows towards the sinner from of old, and begins its
   operations upon him when there is nothing good in him: it works in him
   that which is good and acceptable, and continues so to work in him till
   the deed of grace is complete, and the believer is received up into the
   glory for which he is made meet. Grace commences to save, and it
   perseveres till all is done. From first to last, from the "A" to the
   "Z" of the heavenly alphabet, everything in salvation is of grace, and
   grace alone; all is of free favour, nothing of merit. "By grace are ye
   saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of
   God," "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
   but of God that sheweth mercy."

   No sooner is this doctrine set forth in a clear light than men begin to
   cavil at it. It is the target for all carnal logic to shoot at.
   Unrenewed minds never did like it, and they never will; it is so
   humbling to human pride, making so light of the nobility of human
   nature. That men are to be saved by divine charity, that they must as
   condemned criminals receive pardon by the exercise of the royal
   prerogative, or else perish in their sins, is a teaching which they
   cannot endure. God alone is exalted in the sovereignty of his mercy;
   and the sinner can do no better than meekly touch the silver scepter,
   and accept undeserved favour just because God wills to give it:--this
   is not pleasant to the great minds of our philosophers, and the broad
   phylacteries of our moralists, and therefore they turn aside, and fight
   against the empire of grace. Straightway the unrenewed man seeks out
   artillery with which to fight against the gospel of the grace of God,
   and one of the biggest guns he has ever brought to the front is the
   declaration that the doctrine of the grace of God must lead to
   licentiousness. If great sinners are freely saved, then men will more
   readily become great sinners; and if when God's grace regenerates a man
   it abides with him, then men will infer that they may live as they
   like, and yet be saved. This is the constantly-repeated objection which
   I have heard till it wearies me with its vain and false noise. I am
   almost ashamed to have to refute so rotten an argument. They dare to
   assert that men will take license to be guilty because God is gracious,
   and they do not hesitate to say that if men are not to be saved by
   their works they will come to the conclusion that their conduct is a
   matter of indifference, and that they may as well sin that grace may
   abound.

   This morning I want to talk a little about this notion; for in part it
   is a great mistake, and in part it is a great lie. In part it is a
   mistake because it arises from misconception, and in part it is a lie
   because men know better, or might know better if they pleased.

   I begin by admitting that the charge does appear somewhat probable. It
   does seem very likely that if we are to go up and down the country, and
   say, "The very chief of sinners may be forgiven through believing in
   Jesus Christ, for God is displaying mercy to the very vilest of the
   vile," then sin will seem to be a cheap thing. If we are everywhere to
   cry, "Come, ye sinners, come and welcome, and receive free and
   immediate pardon through the sovereign grace of God," it does seem
   probable that some may basely reply, "Let us sin without stint, for we
   can easily obtain forgiveness." But that which looks to be probable is
   not, therefore, certain: on the contrary, the improbable and the
   unexpected full often come to pass. In questions of moral influence
   nothing is more deceptive than theory. The ways of the human mind are
   not to be laid down with a pencil and compasses; man is a singular
   being. Even that which is logical is not always inevitable, for men's
   minds are not governed by the rules of the schools. I believe that the
   inference which would lead men to sin because grace reigns is not
   logical, but the very reverse; and I venture to assert that, as a
   matter of fact, ungodly men do not, as a rule plead the grace of God as
   an excuse for their sin. As a rule they are too indifferent to care
   about reasons at all; and if they do offer an excuse it is usually more
   flimsy and superficial. There may be a few men of perverse minds who
   have used this argument, but there is no accounting for the freaks of
   the fallen understanding. I shrewdly suspect that in any cases in which
   such reasoning has been put forward it was a mere pretence, and by no
   means a plea which satisfied the sinner's own conscience. If men do
   thus excuse themselves, it is generally in some veiled manner, for the
   most of them would be utterly ashamed to state the argument in plain
   terms. I question whether the devil himself would be found reasoning
   thus--"God is merciful, therefore let us be more sinful." It is so
   diabolical an inference, that I do not like to charge my fellow-men
   with it, though our moralist opposers do not hesitate thus to degrade
   them. Surely, no intelligent being can really persuade itself that the
   goodness of God is a reason for offending him more than ever. Moral
   insanity produces strange reasonings, but it is my solemn conviction
   that very rarely do men practically consider the grace of God to be a
   motive for sin. That which seems so probable at the first blush, is not
   so when we come to consider it.

   I have admitted that a few human beings have turned the grace of God
   into lasciviousness; but I trust no one will ever argue against any
   doctrine on account of the perverse use made of it by the baser sort.
   Cannot every truth be perverted? Is there a single doctrine of
   Scripture which graceless hands have not twisted into mischief? Is
   there not an almost infinite ingenuity in wicked men for making evil
   out of good? If we are to condemn a truth because of the misbehaviour
   of individuals who profess to believe it, we should be found condemning
   our Lord himself for what Judas did, and our holy faith would die at
   the hands of apostates and hypocrites. Let us act like rational men. We
   do not find fault with ropes because poor insane creatures have hanged
   themselves therewith; nor do we ask that the wares of Sheffield may be
   destroyed because edged tools are the murderer's instruments.

   It may appear probable that the doctrine of free grace will be made
   into a license for sin, but a better acquaintance with the curious
   working of the human mind corrects the notion. Fallen as human nature
   is, it is still human, and therefore does not take kindly to certain
   forms of evil--such, for instance, as inhuman ingratitude. It is hardly
   human to multiply injuries upon those who return us continued benefits.
   The case reminds me of the story of half-a-dozen boys who had severe
   fathers, accustomed to flog them within an inch of their lives. Another
   boy was with them who was tenderly beloved by his parents, and known to
   do so. These young gentlemen met together to hold a council of war
   about robbing an orchard. They were all of them anxious to get about it
   except the favoured youth, who did not enjoy the proposal. One of them
   cried out, "You need not be afraid: if our fathers catch us at this
   work, we shall be half-killed, but your father won't lay a hand upon
   you." The little boy answered, "And do you think because my father is
   kind to me, that therefore I will do wrong and grieve him? I will do
   nothing of the sort to my dear father. He is so good to me that I
   cannot vex him." It would appear that the argument of the many boys was
   not overpoweringly convincing to their companion: the opposite
   conclusion was quite as logical, and evidently carried weight with it.
   If God is good to the undeserving, some men will go into sin, but there
   are others of a nobler order whom the goodness of God leadeth to
   repentance. They scorn the beast-like argument--that the more loving
   God is, the more rebellious we may be; and they feel that against a God
   of goodness it is an evil thing to rebel.

   By-the-way I cannot help observing that I have known persons object to
   the evil influence of the doctrines of grace who were by no means
   qualified by their own morality to be judges of the subject. Morals
   must be in a poor way when immoral persons become their guardians. The
   doctrine of justification by faith is frequently objected to as
   injurious to morals. A newspaper some time ago quoted a verse from one
   of our popular hymns--

   "Weary, working, plodding one,

   Why toil you so?

   Cease your doing; all was done

   Long, long ago.

   "Till to Jesus' work you cling

   By a simple faith,

   'Doing' is a deadly thing,

   'Doing' ends in death."

   This is styled mischievous teaching. When I read the article I felt a
   deep interest in this corrector of Luther and Paul, and I wondered how
   much he had drunk in order to elevate his mind to such a pitch of
   theological knowledge. I have found men pleading against the doctrines
   of grace on the ground that they did not promote morality, to whom I
   could have justly replied, "What has morality to do with you, or you
   with it?" These sticklers for good works are not often the doers of
   them. Let legalists look to their own hands and tongues, and leave the
   gospel of grace and its advocates to answer for themselves.

   Looking back in history, I see upon its pages a refutation of the
   oft-repeated calumny. Who dares to suggest that the men who believed in
   the grace of God have been sinners above other sinners? With all their
   faults, those who throw stones at them will be few if they first prove
   themselves to be their superiors in character. When have they been the
   patrons of vice, or the defenders of injustice? Pitch upon the point in
   English history when this doctrine was very strong in the land; who
   were the men that held these doctrines most firmly? Men like Owen,
   Charnock, Manton, Howe, and I hesitate not to add Oliver Cromwell. What
   kind of men were these? Did they pander to the licentiousness of a
   court? Did they invent a Book of Sports for Sabbath diversion? Did they
   haunt ale-houses and places of revelry? Every historian will tell you,
   the greatest fault of these men in the eyes of their enemies was that
   they were too precise for the generation in which they lived, so that
   they called them Puritans, and condemned them as holding a gloomy
   theology. Sirs, if there was iniquity in the land in that day, it was
   to be found with the theological party which preached up salvation by
   works. The gentlemen with their womanish locks and essenced hair, whose
   speech savoured of profanity, were the advocates of salvation by works,
   and all bedabbled with lust they pleaded for human merit; but the men
   who believed in grace alone were of another style. They were not in the
   chambers of rioting and wantonness; where were they? They might be
   found on their knees crying to God for help in temptation; and in
   persecuting times they might be found in prison, cheerfully suffering
   the loss of all things for the truth's sake. The Puritans were the
   godliest men on the face of the earth. Are men so inconsistent as to
   nickname them for their purity, and yet say that their doctrines lead
   to sin?

   Nor is this a solitary instance--this instance of Puritanism; all
   history confirms the rule: and when it is said that these doctrines
   will create sin, I appeal to facts, and leave the oracle to answer as
   it may. If we are ever to see a pure and godly England we must have a
   gospelized England: if we are to put down drunkenness and the social
   evil it must be by the proclamation of the grace of God. Men must be
   forgiven by grace, renewed by grace, transformed by grace, sanctified
   by grace, preserved by grace; and when that comes to pass the golden
   age will dawn; but while they are merely taught their duty, and left to
   do it of themselves in their own strength, it is labour in vain. You
   may flog a dead horse a long while before it will stir: you need to put
   life into it, for else all your flogging will fail. To teach men to
   walk who have no feet is poor work, and such is instruction in morals
   before grace gives a heart to love holiness. The gospel alone supplies
   men with motive and strength, and therefore it is to the gospel that we
   must look as the real reformer of men.

   I shall fight this morning with the objection before us as I shall find
   strength. The doctrine of grace, the whole plan of salvation by grace,
   is most promotive of holiness. Wherever it comes it helps us to say,
   "God forbid," to the question, "Shall we sin, because we are not under
   the law, but under grace?" This I would set out in the clear sunlight.

   I wish to call your attention to some six or seven points.

   I. First, you will see that the gospel of the grace of God promotes
   real holiness in men by remembering that THE SALVATION WHICH IT BRINGS
   IS SALVATION FROM THE POWER OF SIN. When we preach salvation to the
   vilest of men, some suppose we mean by that a mere deliverance from
   hell and an entrance into heaven. It includes all that, and results in
   that, but that is not what we mean. What we mean by salvation is
   this--deliverance from the love of sin, rescue from the habit of sin,
   setting free from the desire to sin. Now listen. If it be so, that that
   boon of deliverance from sin is the gift of divine grace, in what way
   will that gift, or the free distribution of it, produce sin? I fail to
   see any such danger. On the contrary, I say to the man who proclaims a
   gracious promise of victory over sin, "Make all speed: go up and down
   throughout the world, and tell the vilest of mankind that God is
   willing by his grace to set them free from the love of sin and to make
   new creatures of them." Suppose the salvation we preach be this:--you
   that have lived ungodly and wicked lives may enjoy your sins, and yet
   escape the penalty--that would be mischievous indeed; but if it be
   this,--you that live the most ungodly and wicked lives may yet by
   believing in the Lord Jesus be enabled to change those lives, so that
   you shall live unto God instead of serving sin and Satan,--what harm
   can come to the most prudish morals? Why, I say spread such a gospel,
   and let it circulate through every part of our vast empire, and let all
   men hear it, whether they rule in the House of Lords or suffer in the
   house of bondage. Tell them everywhere that God freely and of infinite
   grace is willing to renew men, and make them new creatures in Christ
   Jesus. Can any evil consequences come of the freest proclamation of
   this news? The worse men are, the more gladly would we see them
   embracing this truth, for these are they who most need it. I say to
   every one of you, whoever you may be, whatever your past condition, God
   can renew you according to the power of his grace; so that you who are
   to him like dead, dry bones, can be made to live by his Spirit. That
   renewal will be seen in holy thoughts, and pure words, and righteous
   acts to the glory of God. In great love he is prepared to work all
   these things in all who believe. Why should any men be angry at such a
   statement? What possible harm can come of it? I defy the most cunning
   adversary to object, upon the ground of morals, to God's giving men new
   hearts and right spirits even as he pleases.

   II. Secondly, let it not be forgotten as a matter of fact that THE
   PRINCIPLE OF LOVE HAS BEEN FOUND TO POSSESS VERY GREAT POWER OVER MEN.
   In the infancy of history nations dream that crime can be put down by
   severity, and they rely upon fierce punishments; but experience
   corrects the error. Our forefathers dreaded forgery, which is a
   troublesome fraud, and interferes with the confidence which should
   exist between man and man. To put it down they made forgery a capital
   offence. Alas for the murders committed by that law! Yet the constant
   use of the gallows was never sufficient to stamp out the crime. Many
   offences have been created and multiplied by the penalty which was
   meant to suppress them. Some offences have almost ceased when the
   penalty against them has been lightened.

   It is a notable fact as to men, that if they are forbidden to do a
   thing they straightway pine to do it, though they had never thought of
   doing it before. Law commands obedience, but does not promote it; it
   often creates disobedience, and an over-weighted penalty has been known
   to provoke an offence. Law fails, but love wins.

   Love in any case makes sin infamous. If one should rob another it would
   be sufficiently bad; but suppose a man robbed his friend, who had
   helped him often when he was in need, everyone would say that his crime
   was most disgraceful. Love brands sin on the forehead with a red-hot
   iron. If a man should kill an enemy, the offence would be grievous; but
   if he slew his father, to whom he owes his life, or his mother, on
   whose breasts he was nursed in infancy, then all would cry out against
   the monster. In the light of love sin is seen to be exceeding sinful.

   Nor is this all. Love has a great constraining power towards the
   highest form of virtue. Deeds to which a man could not be compelled on
   the ground of law, men have cheerfully done because of love. Would our
   brave seamen man the life-boat to obey an Act of Parliament? No, they
   would indignantly revolt against being forced to risk their lives; but
   they will do it freely to save their fellow-men. Remember that text of
   the apostle, "Scarcely for a righteous (or merely just) man will one
   die: yet peradventure," says he, "for a good (benevolent) man some
   would even dare to die." Goodness wins the heart, and one is ready to
   die for the kind and generous. Look how men have thrown away their
   lives for great leaders. That was an immortal saying of the wounded
   French soldier. When searching for the bullet the surgeon cut deeply,
   and the patient cried out, "A little lower and you will touch the
   Emperor," meaning that the Emperor's name was written on his heart. In
   several notable instances men have thrown themselves into the jaws of
   death to save a leader whom they loved. Duty holds the fort, but love
   casts its body in the way of the deadly bullet. Who would think of
   sacrificing his life on the ground of law? Love alone counts not life
   so dear as the service of the beloved. Love to Jesus creates a heroism
   of which law knows nothing. All the history of the church of Christ,
   when it has been true to its Lord, is a proof of this.

   Kindness also, working by the law of love, has often changed the most
   unworthy, and therein proved that it is not a factor of evil. We have
   often heard the story of the soldier who had been degraded to the
   ranks, and flogged and imprisoned, and yet for all that he would get
   drunk and misbehave himself. The commanding officer said one day, "I
   have tried almost everything with this man, and can do nothing with
   him. I will try one thing more." When he was brought in, the officer
   addressed him, and said, "You seem incorrigible: we have tried
   everything with you; there seems to be no hope of a change in your
   wicked conduct. I am determined to try if another plan will have any
   effect. Though you deserve flogging and long imprisonment, I shall
   freely forgive you." The man was greatly moved by the unexpected and
   undeserved pardon, and became a good soldier. The story wears truth on
   its brow: we all see that it would probably end so.

   That anecdote is such good argument that I will give you another. A
   drunkard woke up one morning from his drunken sleep, with his clothes
   on him just as he had rolled down the night before. He saw his only
   child, his daughter Millie, getting his breakfast. Coming to his senses
   he said to her, "Millie, why do you stay with me?" She answered,
   "Because you are my father, and because I love you." He looked at
   himself, and saw what a sottish, ragged, good-for-nothing creature he
   was, and he answered her, "Millie, do you really love me?" The child
   cried, "Yes, father, I do, and I will never leave you, because when
   mother died she said, Millie, stick to your father, and always pray for
   him, and one of these days he will give up drink, and be a good father
   to you'; so I will never leave you." Is it wonderful when I add that,
   as the story has it, Millie's father cast away his drink, and became a
   Christian man? It would have been more remarkable if he had not. Millie
   was trying free grace, was she not? According to our moralists she
   should have said, "Father, you are a horrible wretch! I have stuck to
   you long enough: I must now leave you, or else I shall be encouraging
   other fathers to get drunk." Under such proper dealing I fear Millie's
   father would have continued a drunkard till he drank himself into
   perdition. But the power of love made a better man of him. Do not these
   instances prove that undeserved love has a great influence for good?

   Hear another story: In the old persecuting times there lived in
   Cheapside one who feared God and attended the secret meetings of the
   saints; and near him there dwelt a poor cobbler, whose wants were often
   relieved by the merchant; but the poor man was a cross-grained being,
   and, most ungratefully, from hope of reward, laid an information
   against his kind friend on the score of religion. This accusation would
   have brought the merchant to death by burning if he had not found a
   means of escape. Returning to his house, the injured man did not change
   his generous behaviour to the malignant cobbler, but, on the contrary,
   was more liberal than ever. The cobbler was, however, in an ill mood,
   and avoided the good man with all his might, running away at his
   approach. One day he was obliged to meet him face to face, and the
   Christian man asked him gently, "Why do you shun me? I am not your
   enemy. I know all that you did to injure me, but I never had an angry
   thought against you. I have helped you, and I am willing to do so as
   long as I live, only let us be friends." Do you marvel that they
   clasped hands? Would you wonder if ere long the poor man was found at
   the Lollards' meeting? All such anecdotes rest upon the assured fact
   that grace has a strange subduing power, and leads men to goodness,
   drawing them with cords of love, and bands of a man. The Lord knows
   that bad as men are the key of their hearts hangs on the nail of love.
   He knows that his almighty goodness, though often baffled, will triumph
   in the end. I believe my point is proved. To myself it is so. However,
   we must pass on.

   III. There is no fear that the doctrine of the grace of God will lead
   men to sin, because ITS OPERATIONS ARE CONNECTED WITH A SPECIAL
   REVELATION OF THE EVIL OF SIN. Iniquity is made to be exceeding bitter
   before it is forgiven or when it is forgiven. When God begins to deal
   with a man with a view of blotting out his sins and making him his
   child, he usually causes him to see his evil ways in all their
   heinousness; he makes him look on sin with fixed eyes, till he cries
   with David, "My sin is ever before me." In my own case, when under
   conviction of sin, no cheering object met my mental eye, my soul saw
   only darkness and a horrible tempest. It seemed as though a horrible
   spot were painted on my eyeballs. Guilt, like a grim chamberlain, drew
   the curtains of my bed, so that I rested not, but in my slumbers
   anticipated the wrath to come. I felt that I had offended God, and that
   this was the most awful thing a human being could do. I was out of
   order with my Creator, out of order with the universe; I had damned
   myself for ever, and I wondered that I did not immediately feel the
   gnawing of the undying worm. Even to this hour a sight of sin causes
   the most dreadful emotions in my heart. Any man or woman here who has
   passed through that experience, or anything like it, will henceforth
   feel a deep horror of sin. A burnt child dreads the fire. "No," says
   the sinner to his tempter, "you once deceived me, and I so smarted in
   consequence, that I will not again be deluded. I have been delivered,
   like a brand from the burning, and I cannot go back to the fire." By
   the operations of grace we are made weary of sin; we loathe both it and
   its imaginary pleasures. We would utterly exterminate it from the soil
   of our nature. It is a thing accursed, even as Amalek was to Israel. If
   you, my friend, do not detest every sinful thing, I fear you are still
   in the gall of bitterness; for one of the sure fruits of the Spirit is
   a love of holiness, and a loathing of every false way. A deep inward
   experience forbids the child of God to sin: he has known within himself
   its judgment and its condemnation, and henceforth it is a thing
   abhorrent to him. An enmity both fierce and endless exists between the
   chosen seed and the serpent brood of evil: hence the fear that grace
   will be abused is abundantly safeguarded.

   IV. Remember also that not only is the forgiven man thus set against
   sin by the process of conviction, but EVERY MAN WHO TASTES OF THE
   SAVING GRACE OF GOD IS MADE A NEW CREATURE IN CHRIST JESUS. Now if the
   doctrine of grace in the hands of an ordinary man might be dangerous,
   yet it would cease to be so in the hands of one who is quickened by the
   Spirit, and created anew in the image of God. The Holy Spirit comes
   upon the chosen one, and transforms him: his ignorance is removed, his
   affections are changed, his understanding is enlightened, his will is
   subdued, his desires are refined, his life is changed--in fact, he is
   as one new-born, to whom all things have become new. This change is
   compared in Scripture to the resurrection from the dead, to a creation,
   and to a new birth. This takes place in every man who becomes a
   partaker of the free grace of God. "Ye must be born again," said Christ
   to Nicodemus; and gracious men are born again. One said the other day,
   "If I believed that I was eternally saved, I should live in sin."
   Perhaps you would; but if you were renewed in heart you would not.
   "But," says one, "if I believed God loved me from before the foundation
   of the world, and that therefore I should be saved, I would take a full
   swing of sin." Perhaps you and the devil would; but God's regenerate
   children are not of so base a nature. To them the abounding grace of
   the Father is a bond to righteousness which they never think of
   breaking: they feel the sweet constraints of sacred gratitude, and
   desire to perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord. All beings live
   according to their nature, and the regenerated man works out the holy
   instincts of his renewed mind: crying after holiness, warring against
   sin, labouring to be pure in all things, the regenerate man puts forth
   all his strength towards that which is pure and perfect. A new heart
   makes all the difference. Given a new nature, and then all the
   propensities run in a different way, and the blessings of almighty love
   no longer involve peril, but suggest the loftiest aspirations.

   V. One of the chief securities for the holiness of the pardoned is
   found in the way of CLEANSING THROUGH ATONEMENT. The blood of Jesus
   sanctifies as well as pardons. The sinner learns that his free pardon
   cost the life of his best Friend; that in order to his salvation the
   Son of God himself agonized even to a bloody sweat, and died forsaken
   of his God. This causes a sacred mourning for sin, as he looks upon the
   Lord whom he pierced. Love to Jesus burns within the pardoned sinner's
   breast, for the Lord is his Redeemer; and therefore he feels a burning
   indignation against the murderous evil of sin. To him all manner of
   evil is detestable, since it is stained with the Saviour's heart's
   blood. As the penitent sinner hears the cry of, "Eloi, sabachthani!" he
   is horrified to think that one so pure and good should be forsaken of
   heaven because of the sin which he bore in his people's stead. From the
   death of Jesus the mind draws the conclusion that sin is exceedingly
   sinful in the sight of the Lord; for if eternal justice would not spare
   even the Well-beloved Jesus when imputed sin was upon him, how much
   less will it spare guilty men? It must be a thing unutterably full of
   poison which could make even the immaculate Jesus suffer so terribly.
   Nothing can be imagined which can have greater power over gracious
   minds than the vision of a crucified Saviour denouncing sin by all his
   wounds, and by every falling drop of blood. What! live in the sin which
   slew Jesus? Find pleasure in that which wrought his death? Trifle with
   that which laid his glory in the dust? Impossible! Thus you see that
   the gifts of free grace, when handed down by a pierced hand, are never
   likely to suggest self-indulgence in sin, but the very reverse.

   VI. Sixthly, a man who becomes a partaker of divine grace, and receives
   the new nature, is ever afterwards A PARTAKER OF DAILY HELPS FROM GOD'S
   HOLY SPIRIT. God the Holy Ghost deigns to dwell in the bosom, of every
   man whom God has saved by his grace. Is not that a wonderful means of
   sanctifying? By what process can men be better kept from sin than by
   having the Holy Spirit himself to dwell as Vice-regent within their
   hearts? The Ever- blessed Spirit leads believers to be much in prayer,
   and what a power for holiness is found in the child of grace speaking
   to the heavenly Father! The tempted man flies to his chamber, unbosoms
   his grief to God, looks to the flowing wounds of his Redeemer, and
   comes down strong to resist temptation. The divine word also, with its
   precepts and promises, is a never-failing source of sanctification.
   Were it not that we every day bathe in the sacred fountain of eternal
   strength we might soon be weak and irresolute; but fellowship with God
   renews us in our vigorous warfare with sin. How is it possible that the
   doctrines of grace should suggest sin to men who constantly draw near
   to God? The renewed man is also by God's Spirit frequently quickened in
   conscience; so that things which heretofore did not strike him as
   sinful are seen in a clearer light, and are consequently condemned. I
   know that certain matters are sinful to me today which did not appear
   so ten years ago: my judgment has, I trust, been more and more cleared
   of the blindness of sin. The natural conscience is callous and hard;
   but the gracious conscience grows more and more tender till at last it
   becomes as sensitive as a raw wound. He who has most grace is most
   conscious of his need of more grace. The gracious are often afraid to
   put one foot before another for fear of doing wrong. Have you not felt
   this holy fear, this sacred caution? It is by this means that the Holy
   Spirit prevents your ever turning your Christian liberty into
   licentiousness, or daring to make the grace of God an argument for
   folly.

   Then, in addition to this, the good Spirit leads us into high and
   hallowed intercourse with God, and I defy a man to live upon the mount
   with God, and then come down to transgress like men of the world. If
   thou hast walked the palace floor of glory, and seen the King in his
   beauty, till the light of his countenance has been thy heaven, thou
   canst not be content with the gloom and murkiness of the tents of
   wickedness. To lie, to deceive, to feign, as the men of the world do,
   will no longer beseem thee. Thou art of another race, and thy
   conversation is above them: "Thy speech betrayeth thee." If thou dost
   indeed dwell with God, the perfume of the ivory palaces will be about
   thee, and men will know that thou hast been in other haunts than
   theirs. If the child of God goes wrong in any degree, he loses to some
   extent the sweetness of his communion, and only as he walks carefully
   with God does he enjoy full fellowship; so that this rising or falling
   in communion becomes a sort of parental discipline in the house of the
   Lord. We have no court with a judge, but we have home with its
   fatherhood, its smile and its rod. We lack not for order in the family
   of love, for our Father dealeth with us as with sons. Thus, in a
   thousand ways, all danger of our presuming upon the grace of God is
   effectually removed.

   VII. THE ENTIRE ELEVATION OF THE MAN WHO IS MADE A PARTAKER OF THE
   GRACE OF GOD is also a special preservative against sin. I venture to
   say, though it may be controverted, that the man who believes the
   glorious doctrines of grace is usually a much higher style of man than
   the person who has no opinion upon the matter. What do most men think
   about? Bread-and-butter, house-rent and clothes. But the men who
   consider the doctrines of the gospel muse upon the everlasting
   covenant, predestination, immutable love, effectual calling, God in
   Christ Jesus, the work of the Spirit, justification, sanctification,
   adoption, and such like noble themes. Why, it is a refreshment merely
   to look over the catalogue of these grand truths! Others are as
   children playing with little sand-heaps on the seashore; but the
   believer in free grace walks among hills and mountains. The themes of
   thought around him tower upward, Alps on Alps; the man's mental stature
   rises with his surroundings, and he becomes a thoughtful being,
   communing with sublimities. No small matter this, for a thing so apt to
   grovel as the average human intellect. So far as deliverance from mean
   vices and degrading lusts must in this way be promoted, I say, it is no
   small thing. Thoughtlessness is the prolific mother of iniquity. It is
   a hopeful sign when minds begin to roam among lofty truths. The man who
   has been taught of God to think will not so readily sin as the being
   whose mind is buried beneath his flesh. The man has now obtained a
   different view of himself from that which led him to trifle away his
   time with the idea that there was nothing better for him than to be
   merry while he could. He says, "I am one of God's chosen, ordained to
   be his son, his heir, joint-heir with Jesus Christ. I am set apart to
   be a king and priest unto God, and as such I cannot be godless, nor
   live for the common objects of life." He rises in the object of his
   pursuit: he cannot henceforth live unto himself, for he is not his own,
   he is bought with a price. Now he dwells in the presence of God, and
   life to him is real, earnest, and sublime. He cares not to scrape
   together gold with the muck-rake of the covetous, for he is immortal,
   and must needs seek eternal gains. He feels that he is born for divine
   purposes, and enquires "Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do?" He
   feels that God has loved him that his love may flow forth to others.
   God's choice of any one man has a bearing upon all the rest: he elects
   a Joseph that a whole family, a whole nation, nay, the whole world, may
   be preserved alive when famine had broken the staff of bread. We are
   each one as a lamp kindled that we may shine in the dark, and light up
   other lamps.

   New hopes come crowding on the man who is saved by grace. His immortal
   spirit enjoys glimpses of the endless. As God has loved him in time, he
   believes that the like love will bless him in eternity. He knows that
   his Redeemer lives, and that in the latter days he shall behold him;
   and therefore he has no fears for the future. Even while here below he
   begins to sing the songs of the angels, for his spirit spies from afar
   the dawn of the glory which is yet to be revealed. Thus with joyous
   heart and light footstep he goes forward to the unknown future as
   merrily as to a wedding-feast.

   Is there a sinner here, a guilty sinner, one who has no merit, no claim
   to mercy whatever; is there one willing to be saved by God's free grace
   through believing in Jesus Christ? Then let me tell thee, sinner, there
   is not a word in God's book against thee, not a line or syllable, but
   everything is in thy favour. "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of
   all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
   sinners," even the chief. Jesus came into the world to save thee. Only
   do thou trust him, and rest in him. I will tell thee what ought to
   fetch thee to Christ at once, it is the thought of his amazing love. A
   profligate son had been a great grief to his father; he had robbed him
   and disgraced him, and at last he ended by bringing his grey hairs with
   sorrow to the grave. He was a horrible wretch of a son: no one could
   have been more graceless. However, he attended his father's funeral,
   and he stayed to hear the will read: perhaps it was the chief reason
   why he was there. He had fully made up his mind that his father would
   cut him off with a shilling, and he meant to make it very unpleasant
   for the rest of the family. To his great astonishment, as the will was
   read it ran something like this: "As for my son Richard, though he has
   fearfully wasted my substance, and though he has often grieved my
   heart, I would have him know that I consider him still to be my own
   dear child, and therefore, in token of my undying love, I leave him the
   same share as the rest of his brothers." He left the room; he could not
   stand it, the surprising love of his father had mastered him. He came
   down to the executor the next morning, and said, "You surely did not
   read correctly?" "Yes I did; there it stands." "Then," he said, "I feel
   ready to curse myself that I ever grieved my dear old father. Oh, that
   I could fetch him back again!" Love was born in that base heart by an
   unexpected display of love. May not your case be similar? Our Lord
   Jesus Christ is dead, but he has left it in his will that the chief of
   sinners are objects of his choicest mercy. Dying he prayed, "Father,
   forgive them." Risen he pleads for transgressors. Sinners are ever on
   his mind: their salvation is his great object. His blood is for them,
   his heart for them, his righteousness for them, his heaven for them.
   Come, O ye guilty ones, and receive your legacy. Put out the hand of
   faith and grasp your portion. Trust Jesus with your souls, and he will
   save you. God bless you. Amen.

The King's Weighings

   (No. 1736)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 26. 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT EXETER HALL.

   "Talk no more so exceedingly proud; let not arrogance come out of your
   mouth, for the Lord is the God of knowledge and by Him actions are
   weighed." 1 Samuel 2:3.

   IT is very beautiful to see how the saints of old were accustomed to
   find comfort in their God. When they came into sore straits; when
   troubles multiplied; when helpers failed; when earthly comforts were
   removed, they were accustomed to go to the Lord and to the Lord alone.
   Thus Hannah thinks of the Lord and comforts herself in His name. By
   this means they were made strong and glad--they began to sing instead
   of sighing and to work wonders instead of fainting under their burdens
   even as here the Inspired poetess sings, "My heart rejoices in the
   Lord, my horn is exalted in the Lord." To them God was a reality, a
   present reality, and they looked to Him as their rock of refuge, their
   helper and defense, a very present help in time of trouble.

   Can we not, at the outset, learn a valuable lesson from their example?
   Let us do as they did--let us lean upon our God and stay ourselves upon
   Him when heart and flesh are failing. Does not the Apostle say,
   "Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice"? There is always
   cause for thankfulness that the Lord lives and that He is what He is,
   for "there is no rock like our God" and He is still ready to lay bare
   the arm of His strength on the behalf of them that serve Him. Oh,
   Believer, the fountain of your joy is never dried up! If, like Jonah,
   your gourds are withered, yet your God is living! If, like Job, your
   goods have been plundered, yet the highest good is still your own! Are
   the rivers dry? Yet is this ocean full! Are the stars hidden? Yet the
   heavenly sun shines on in his eternal brightness! You have a possession
   that is unbinding, a promise that is unfailing, a protector who is
   unchanging!

   Though you dwell in a faithless world, you also dwell in a faithful
   God! Your trials are present and so is your Helper, who has said, "I
   will never leave you, nor forsake you." As the bird to the woods, and
   the cony to the rocks, so let your soul flee away unto the Lord, your
   Refuge. "Straightforward makes the best runner"--do not beat the bush
   and go about to friends and cry, "Have pity upon me! Have pity upon
   me!" but, "turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope." As for the
   son of man whose breath is in his nostrils, in which is he to be
   accounted? Men are vanity in the hour of distress! Miserable comforters
   are they all. "Cursed is the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh
   his arm." The heath in the desert which sees neither dew nor rain is
   the fit image of this spiritual idolater.

   "Blessed is the man that trusts in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is,
   for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreads out
   her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat comes." Oh, learn
   to live upon the Lord alone! Hannah, who was once a woman of a
   sorrowful spirit, had so learned to delight herself in God that she
   could dwell upon the different points of the Divine Character with
   joyful adoration. Like others of God's instructed people, she was very
   happy in the thought of God's holiness. Notice the second verse--"There
   is none holy as the Lord." I have heard many persons praise the Lord
   for His goodness, but it is a far higher and surer mark of Grace when a
   man can praise the Lord for His holiness. Is it not noteworthy that in
   Heaven, the abode of happiness, which happiness springs mainly out of
   the Presence of their God, the adoration of the blessed chiefly tends
   to this point--the reverent celebration of His holiness?

   We read of the seraphim, "And one cried unto another, and said, Holy,
   holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts: the whole earth is full of His
   glory." We read, again, in Revelation, concerning the living creatures,
   "They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
   Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come." Are you conscious that
   you are unholy? Then, O Believer, rejoice that God is holy! Are those
   around you unholy? Is your soul among lions? Do you dwell among those
   that are set on the fires of Hell? Yet say, as the Lord Jesus did, "You
   are holy, O You that inhabits the praises of Israel." Does it seem as
   if unholiness covered all things, breaking forth like a flood and
   deluging the earth with

   its black and filthy waters? Yet the Lord sits upon the Throne of His
   holiness and cuts asunder the cords of the wicked! Let this be our song
   in the night--"There is none as holy as the Lord."

   Hannah also tuned her heart to celebrate the power of Jehovah, saying,
   "Neither is there any rock like our God." One of the leading ideas in
   the metaphor of a rock is strength, abiding endurance, unmoving
   stability, unconquerable power. Let us also rejoice in the Lord God
   Almighty and delight in the mighty God of Jacob, the Lord strong and
   mighty, the Lord mighty in battle! Even His finger brought plagues upon
   the Egyptians. And as for His hand, it utterly overthrew them! The Lord
   God Omnipotent is the joy of His people, for the Lord is our strength
   and song. He also has become our salvation. He shall surely show
   Himself strong on the behalf of all them that put their trust in Him.
   Fly, then, O timid Soul, to the cover of Jehovah's wings! Abide under
   the shadow of the Almighty and His Divine power shall cause you to lie
   down in safety.

   Oh, for a well-tuned harp to celebrate these two attributes so terrible
   to the ungodly, so full of exultation to those who are saved by Grace!
   Hannah touched, in her rapturous hymn, upon the wisdom of the Lord, and
   sang thus, "For the Lord is the God of knowledge," or of, "knowledges,"
   for every kind of knowledge is with Him. We are not among those who
   impiously ask, "How does God know?" Or, "Is there knowledge in the Most
   High?" We are assured that nothing past, present, or future is hidden
   from the eternal eyes! In His knowledge there is no error and to it
   there is no limit. The Lord knows them that are His and He knows the
   way that they take. He knows how to deliver His people and when to
   bring them out of the furnace. Reverently do we worship the Lord and
   say, "O Lord, You have searched me, and known me. You know my sitting
   down and my rising up; You understand my thoughts afar off. You compass
   my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways. For
   there is not a word on my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, You know it
   altogether. You have beset me behind and before, and laid Your hand
   upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
   attain unto it!"

   Let us rejoice that our God is not unconscious, or ignorant. And when
   our own ignorance grieves us, let us rejoice that the Lord will teach
   us and what we do not know, now, we shall know hereafter. Hannah also
   derived comfort from the fact that God is strictly just, for she says
   with delight, "By Him actions are weighed." It is to this that I would
   turn your attention. May the Holy Spirit direct our meditations.
   Justice is a very terrible attribute to the unforgiven, to those who
   are not justified by the righteousness of Christ--and even on God's own
   people it turns a heart-searching glance at times.

   I. The staple of our discourse will consist of a consideration of THE
   PROCESS OF DIVINE JUDGMENT, which is continually going on--"The Lord is
   a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed." The figure of
   weighing suggests a thorough testing and an accurate estimating of the
   matters under consideration. Solomon says, "All the ways of a man are
   pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the spirits." God sees men's
   actions, notes them, thinks upon them and deliberately forms an
   estimate of them. "For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord
   and He ponders all his goings."

   Our first note here shall stand thus--this is not as man dreams. Many
   imagine that God takes no note of what is done among the sons of men.
   Indeed, their god does not appear to be a personal, intelligent
   existence at all. Or, if intelligent, they boast that he is too great
   to mark the trivial actions of men--that is to say--in order to make
   their god great, they would make him blind! Their idea of his greatness
   would seem to be loftiness, impassiveness and a measure of ignorance.
   Our notion of greatness is the reverse--we believe in the great God to
   whom all things are known and by whom the least matters are observed!
   Our God is neither unobservant nor indifferent. "He humbles Himself to
   behold the things that are in Heaven and in the earth!" He is
   constantly observant of all that is done in Heaven above, in the earth
   beneath and in all deep places.

   Each movement of the tiniest worm upon the sea bottom is marked by Him,
   together with the migration of fishes, the flight of birds and the
   falling of the sear leaves. There are no forces so minute as to be
   beneath His notice, no movements so rapid as to escape His observation.
   The Psalmist says, "Yes, the darkness hides not from You; but the night
   shivers as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to You."
   The atheist cries, "No god" and he who would deny universal knowledge
   to God is twin brother to him! As good have no god at all as a god who
   does not know. "Jehovah is the God of knowledge and by Him actions are
   weighed." This text plainly rebukes those who say God is too merciful
   to take much account of what we do--poor creatures that we are--shot
   out of the back of a tumbrel into the midst of a

   society all in chaos which tempts us to indulge the passions of our
   nature! They dream that God will surely wink at such inconsiderable
   things as the actions of men! But surely it is not so, since it is
   written, "The Lord is the God of knowledge and by Him actions are
   weighed."

   The Lord our God is merciful, but this mercy is consistent with the
   severest justice--He pardons sin, but He never suffers it to go
   unpunished! Strange as the statement may seem, the Lord never ceases to
   be the righteous Judge, even when He is passing by transgression. The
   great and glorious God does not forgive sin because He does not know of
   it, or does not remember how sinful it is--but this is the wonder of
   His mercy--He blots out the sins of His people with the fullest
   knowledge of their foulness! After having weighed sin, noted its
   motive, marked its meaning and considered its consequences, the Lord
   nevertheless forgives it for Jesus' sake. Do not fall into any error on
   this point, or imagine that the Lord thinks little of human guilt and,
   therefore, readily pardons it. No! "The Lord is the God of knowledge
   and by Him actions are weighed."

   Consider, next, that this form of procedure is not as man judges. By
   men, actions are judged flippantly, but, "by God actions are weighed."
   By men, actions are more frequently counted. Such a man has done this,
   and that, and that, and that, and that--what a wonderful man he is!
   Yes, but by God, human deeds are not so much measured in the bushel as
   weighed in the scale. A man's life may be made up of countless bubbles,
   each one brilliant as the rainbow--but what a collapse there will be
   when the Lord comes with the balances to weigh the deeds done in the
   body! By men, actions are frequently measured as to apparent bulk, and
   persons placed in certain positions bulk very largely upon the public
   mind. Their doings fill the newspapers though they are empty enough in
   themselves. You scarcely get a day's issue of a journal but what
   something is reported of a man of mark--not that what he has done is by
   any means surprisingly good, or wise, or benevolent, but it is done by
   him and, therefore, it must be emblazoned. Men and women must have
   something to talk about and certain persons are selected for
   observation and, therefore, to their lives an exaggerated importance is
   attached.

   Let no such person delude himself! At the bar of Divine Justice, the
   acts of princes and peasants, of lords and laborers, shall have an
   equal trial and shall be tested in the same scales! Apparent greatness
   shrivels before the Divine balance! Measure a cloud by its volume and
   it is vast. But condense it and how small is the weight of the water!
   When our lives shall be freed from vapor and judged by their solid
   contents, how small will some of us appear! Constantly men measure
   actions by their brilliance. Oh, it was a splendid action! It was so
   dashing, so unlooked for, so extraordinary! Was it right and pure and
   holy? If not, the light of genius cannot save it from condemnation! He
   who gave £10,000 to a fund did a brilliant act of charity. And yet the
   legacy may not have weighed so much as the two mites that made a
   farthing which were all the poor widow's living.

   He who silently adores the Lord may have given Him a greater weight of
   praise than he whose charming voice led the great congregation. The
   godly life of a poor bedridden woman may have been more highly esteemed
   by the Lord than the flaming eloquence of the great preacher. Ah me!
   How easily we are deceived by appearances! But not so the Lord, for,
   "By Him actions are weighed." Men are exceedingly apt to measure
   actions by their consequences. How wrong it is to measure actions by
   results, rather than by their own intrinsic character A man upon the
   railway neglected to turn a switch, but, by the care of another, no
   accident occurred. Is he to be excused? Another man was equally
   negligent, certainly not more so, but in his case the natural result
   followed--there was a collision and many lives were lost. This last man
   was blamed most deservedly, but yet the former offender was equally
   guilty!

   If we do wrong and no harm comes of it, we are not thereby justified.
   Yes, if we did evil and good came of it, the evil would be just as
   evil! It is not the result of the action but the action itself which
   God weighs! He who swindles and prospers is just as vile as he whose
   theft lodged him in prison. He who acts uprightly and becomes a loser
   thereby, is just as honored before God as if his honesty had led on to
   wealth. If we seek to do good and fail in our endeavor, we shall be
   accepted for the attempt and not condemned for the failure! You have
   all admired Grace Darling because of her gallant act in rescuing
   mariners from a wreck--but suppose she had not saved a single
   sailor--and had herself been drowned? Would she not have been equally a
   heroine? Of course she would! Her success had nothing to do with the
   excellence of her actions--the moral weight of her conduct lay in the
   self-sacrificing courage which led her on such a howling, murky night
   to risk her life upon the cruel waters for her unknown follow men! Had
   she been swallowed up by the remorseless

   deep, her actions would have weighed as much before the Throne of God
   as when she landed the saved ones at the lighthouse.

   If a man gives his life to convert the heathen and he does not succeed,
   he shall have as much reward from God as he who turns a nation to the
   faith. Two ministers have labored in the same field--the first preached
   the Gospel faithfully, but saw scant results. The second, following
   him, found the rough work done and reaped full sheaves from the field.
   The thoughtless are apt to think the second man greatly superior to the
   first, but it is not so--one sows and another reaps. When God comes to
   weigh the actions of men, He may give greater praise to the sower than
   to the reaper. We have odd ways of measuring up our fellow men--odd, I
   mean, as compared with our self-measurement. Usually we have two sets
   of weights--one for ourselves and a second for our friends. When we
   place ourselves in the scale, we weigh pretty heavily-- we are full
   weight, and a little bit over! It is very different with our fellow
   men--they may really weigh more than we do, but we adjust the machine
   in such a way that it is greatly to their disadvantage. I am not an
   admirer of the machine called a "steel yard," for it is singularly easy
   to fix it according to your wishes and certainly our estimates of
   others are as easily affected by prejudice. But by God, "actions are
   weighed" truly, honestly, righteously--and the result is very different
   from the judgment of men.

   I would now have you note that this weighing is a very searching
   business. "By Him actions are weighed." A man eaters a goldsmith's shop
   and says, "Here is old gold to sell. See, I have quite a lot of it."
   "Yes," says the goldsmith, "let me weigh it." "Weigh it? Why, look at
   the quantity! It fills this basket!" What is the goldsmith doing?
   Looking for his weights and certain acids by which he means to test the
   metal. When he has used his acids, he puts the trinkets into the scale.
   "You are not going to buy by weight?" "I never buy in any other way,"
   says the goldsmith. "But there is such a quantity." "That may be, but I
   buy by weight." It is always so with God in all our actions--He
   estimates their real weight. We may hammer out our little gold and make
   a great show of it, but the Lord is not mocked or deceived. Every
   dealing between us and God will have to be by a just balance and
   standard weight.

   And in what way will He weigh it? The weights are somewhat of this
   sort. The standard is His just and holy Law and all which falls short
   of that is sin. Any lack of conformity to the Law of God is sin and by
   so much our acts are found wanting. Remember this, you who would
   justify yourselves! The Lord also enquires how much of sincerity is
   found in the action. You acted in such a manner and therein you were
   right--but did you do this in pretense, or from force, or in sincerity
   and in truth? In worship did you heartily adore? In charity did you
   give cheerfully? Did your heart go with your voice and hand? You prayed
   so long but did your heart truly pray? You attended so many religious
   services, but did you personally attend them, or did you send your
   chrysalis and leave the living thing at home? Yes, you preached the
   Truth of God--but did you believe it in your own soul? You gave your
   gold--was it with the motive of doing good, or that your name might be
   on a list, or because it would not look well for your name to be left
   out? That which is not done sincerely has no weight in it! It is
   weighed in the balances and found wanting.

   The Lord also weighs actions according to their motives. He asks not
   only what you did, but why you did it? Was self the motive force? The
   preacher weighs his sermon, this morning, and asks his conscience
   whether he seeks only the glory of God. Will not you, my Brothers and
   Sisters, weigh what you are doing in this world? To what end are you
   living? What wind is filling your sails? You have been kept from
   outward transgressions. Your life has been moral and pure in the sight
   of men--but have you lived for God's glory? Have you sought to obey God
   and please Him? Have you been moved by love to God and man? Have you
   been in heart, God's servant? If not, if another motive has ruled you,
   you are his servant whom you have obeyed.

   The motive which lies at the fountainhead colors all the streams of
   action and God, who judges us, not according to what is done
   externally, but according to what is meant internally, will make short
   work of a great multitude of human virtues! When you cannot find a
   fault with a day's life as to what you have outwardly done, it may yet
   be faulty all through because of the reason which actuated you. When
   you sum up your actions at night, Pride may lean over your shoulder and
   whisper, "You have done well today!" At such a time it may be well for
   Conscience to awaken itself and ask, "But was this done purely for the
   Lord's glory and in dependence upon His Grace?" An ill motive will
   poison all!

   Another mode ofjudging is by our spirit and temper. If we live proudly,
   our actions lose weight. If we act from envy and will, we fall short.
   If we are flippant, inconsiderate, prayerless, we spoil all. The odor
   of actions is a great thing--if they are not steeped in Grace they miss
   acceptance. An inch of Grace has more weight in it than a mile of
   nature! To be in

   the fear of the Lord is solid living--all else is froth. Sometimes
   actions may be weighed by the circumstances which surround them. Men
   are not to be considered good if their surroundings forbid their being
   what they would like to be. "As a man thinks in his heart, so he is."
   Yonder man has been strictly truthful. Yes, but he could not have made
   a sixpence by being false, or it may be he would have lied. Another man
   is placed where the whole custom of his trade is trickery, but he takes
   a firm stand and, at great risk, refuses to swerve from strict
   integrity. Now, this second man will bear weighing, but the first will
   not.

   Are not some children so carefully brought up from their childhood,
   happily for them, that their character is never discovered until they
   get out into life and are tempted? And then it is seen that the
   truthful boy was a little hypocrite and the thoughtful girl was as
   frivolous as any of the giddy throng. So you see that the fruit of
   tender culture may not always be what it should be or what it seems to
   be. It is wonderful how amiable we all are until we are irritated! What
   a deal of patience we have when we have no sickness to bear! I had
   enough and to spare till my pains multiplied--and then my stock ran
   very low. I am afraid that most of us have a great quantity of
   fictitious goodness which arises out of our favorable circumstances and
   has no other foundation. Now God judges with this before Him, for He
   places some men into peculiar difficulties and others in positions of
   special advantage. And this He takes into account in the weighing.

   Some men cannot run in the crooked road because they are lame and
   inactive--let them not lay a flattering unction to their souls and
   dream that they excel in goodness! Many a man thinks himself a Joseph,
   but the only reason is that no Potiphar's wife has tried him! Many a
   man has never been tempted because no wedge of gold or goodly
   Babylonian garment has come in his way. Multitudes of men are honest
   because they never had a chance of making a grand haul by setting up a
   bubble company--which is the modern mode of thieving. The lion in the
   Zoological Gardens is very good because he is behind iron bars--and
   many a man's goodness owes more to the iron bars of his position than
   to his own heart and motive.

   Another weight to put in the scale is this--Was there any godliness
   about your life? I may be speaking to men in Exeter Hall whose lives
   are such that they think themselves examples, but their lives are
   spoiled from end to end by a grievous flaw. This point must be enquired
   into. You are to be weighed by God and this will be the main
   matter--Has God been recognized in your life? O Sirs, I fear that many
   of you are fitly described by David--"God is not in all their
   thoughts." You have lived from childhood to manhood, and from manhood
   to old age, but God has not been considered in any of your actions! You
   have had great respect to society and to the law of the land, but if
   there has been no God, you would not have acted otherwise than you have
   done--God has not been an active agent in the influences which have
   moved you conduct! Your life has wandered from its true end which has
   not God for its leading star. If you have not lived for your God, for
   whom have you lived? You are His creature--have you never served your
   Creator? You say that Christ is your Redeemer but how has He redeemed
   you if you live unto yourself--and not as one that is bought with a
   price? This is the enquiry to test us all! Is God the main objective of
   our living? Do we throw ourselves with intensity into the pursuit of
   that which will glorify His blessed name? If not, the scales of the
   sanctuary will soon discover that we are sadly wanting!

   Once more--have we lived by faith? Without faith it is impossible to
   please God! And if there is no faith in our life, then we are worth
   nothing! Hear me, O Man, and answer these questions! Have you believed
   in God and done anything because of believing in Him? Have you trusted
   in Jesus Christ as your Savior and has this faith cleansed your way and
   purged your thoughts? Have you believed the promises of God and His
   Covenant? Has your life been ordered according to this belief? If not,
   you are weighed and rejected! Without faith in Him whom God has sent,
   you cannot be acceptable with God! Thus, you see, in different ways,
   God searches deeply into the life of man, and woe to that man who
   cannot bear the weighing--the greater his pretensions the more terrible
   his dismay when the scales refuse him.

   This weighing of our lives must be exceedingly accurate because it is
   done personally by God, Himself. Notice my text--"The Lord is the God
   of knowledge and by Him actions are weighed." One might not mind the
   text if it said actions are weighed by Gabriel, for he is fallible--an
   angel might make mistakes and he might wink and be partial. But when it
   is written that by God, Himself, actions are weighed, O Man, there is
   no possibility of bribing this great Tester of your life--He will judge
   righteous judgment! He is the God of knowledge and, therefore, He knows
   not only your outward deeds, but your secret designs and desires.

   Moreover, He knows the standard of right--with Him are the weights and
   the scales. Therefore knowing what our actions are and what they ought
   to be, He readily enough discovers our discrepancies and mistakes--and
   there will be no possibility of our escaping His Infallible decision. I
   am amazed we are so ready to deceive ourselves as we are. I marvel that
   so many count it worth their while to deceive their fellow Christians
   and their ministers! It is a poor ambition to live a life of deceit. Be
   what you seem to be and seem to be what you are! But oh, if we could
   cheat ourselves throughout life, and deceive all those who watch us,
   yet we could never once have deceived God, "for by Him actions are
   weighed" so accurately that a mistake is never made!

   Ah me! I fear that many professors live a life of utter lies,
   comforting themselves with them. I once heard a story, (I do not know
   if it is true), of an old banker who said to his son to whom he
   bequeathed the business, "This is the key of our large iron safe--take
   great care of it. The bank depends upon that safe. Let the people see
   that you have such a safe, but never open it unless the bank should be
   in the utmost difficulty." The bank went on all right as long as the
   iron safe was fast closed, but, at last, there came a run upon it. In
   his greatest extremity the young gentleman opened it--and he found
   nothing at all in it! That was the stock of the bank--poverty carefully
   concealed; imaginary wealth winning con-fidence--and living on the
   results.

   Are there not many persons who, all their lives, are doing a spiritual
   banking business and deriving a considerable income of reputation from
   that which will turn out to be nothing? Beware of driving a trade for
   eternity upon fictitious capital, for failure will be the sure result!
   Time tries most things, but eternity tries all. Who among us would care
   to trade without capital? Who would go to sea in a rotten boat painted
   to look seaworthy? How wise it is to invite Divine inspection that we
   may not be deceived! What a dreadful thing it is that so many
   professing Christian people are never willing to open the iron safe!
   They do not want to know whether all is right between God and
   themselves--they prefer to go on saying, "Peace, peace." They love the
   lullaby of, "It is well; it is well." Preach sweetly-comforting sermons
   and they will be well content--and truly they might wisely be content
   if it were not written, "By Him actions are weighed." God will not be
   charmed by our self-approving songs--He will weigh us and our
   actions--and reveal us before the sun.

   Again, I want you to notice that this weighing is carried on at this
   present--"By Him actions are weighed." Not only shall they be weighed
   at the Last Great Day, but every minute they are being weighed. How
   stupid is a hypocrite if he believes that he has never once deceived
   God! He knelt in prayer, but he did not pray. God knew that he did not
   and perceived the insult. At worship he sang with the assembly, but his
   heart was never in communion with God, and the Lord knew it. He never
   established a good reputation within Heaven. His conduct was understood
   at all times and he was always branded as false-hearted. A man has
   joined the Christian Church--he has risen in esteem till he has become
   an officer among his brethren--yet all the while he was never
   converted, Grace was never in his soul. Does he think that God is taken
   in by him? Let him not be deceived! The Lord has gone on weighing all
   his acts as they have happened--and He has put them all aside as of
   short weight.

   As at the bank all moneys are put through a process by which the light
   coins are detected, so our life always passes over the great weighing
   machine of the Lord's Justice and He separates that which is short in
   weight from that which is precious, doing this at the moment as
   Infallibly as at Judgment Day! "By Him actions are weighed." Please
   remember, dear Hearers, that this is true of all of us--not only of
   open sinners, but of those who are considered saints. You are getting
   old I see, my Friend, but not too old to have your actions weighed! Old
   age is venerable, it cannot screen you from inspection. "Oh," said an
   old man the other day, "you can trust me! I am past temptation." Gray
   hairs should not talk such nonsense! You can still be tempted and your
   actions are still weighed as well as those of that silly boy whom you
   blame for his rashness. And you, good Sir, who have been a professor of
   religion for 40 years and who, when you rise up to pray, stand like a
   cedar in the garden of God--your actions are still examined! And if you
   are rotten at heart, it is no matter how green you seem to be with the
   verdure of apparent Grace--you will, in due time, be detected and
   destroyed!

   The preacher, here, is being daily weighed and he knows it! And so are
   all the members of this Church! And however excellent our outward lives
   may be, we must still pass through the testing house. Not one of us
   shall escape from the upright judgment of the Most High. And one day,
   to conclude this point, the King's weighings will be published--set up
   where men and angels shall read them! Oh, can you bear it that the
   whole of the secrets of your soul should be made public in the
   marketplace of the universe? That the actions which seemed so admirable
   should have their secret motives searched out and should be seen to be
   leprous with selfishness? Can you endure to have your secret sins laid
   bare? Your

   private designs, deep intentions and evil purposes set out in the open
   daylight? Can you bear to have your envying, jealousies, plots, lies,
   all held up to public gaze? With what shame will the wicked cover their
   faces when all their hidden things shall be read out and published
   through the streets of the universe! Then shall they be ashamed and
   confounded, while everlasting contempt shall be poured upon them.

   Most of all will men be ashamed who came into the Church of God and
   wore Christ's livery, but all the while were servants of Satan! And of
   these, most of all the ministers who climbed into pulpits, professing
   to preach Christ, and all the while declared their own vain thoughts
   instead of the Gospel of salvation! How will men gaze on the unmasked!
   When the visors are knocked off and all their masquerade shall be over,
   how will men despise the hypocrites! They looked like kings, but,
   behold, the puppets were nothing but beggars! They seemed pure and
   holy, but a ray from the sun of the Truth of God has revealed their
   ulcered inner life and all holy intelligences shrink from them! Oh,
   what discoveries there will be in that day when the record of the
   King's weighings shall be read of men and angels!

   II. It is now time for me to observe THE HUMBLING NATURE OF THIS
   CONSIDERATION. "Talk no more so exceedingly proud; let not arrogance
   come out of your mouth, for the Lord is the God of knowledge and by Him
   actions are weighed." The fact of Divine Judgment on ourselves should
   forever prevent our insulting others. When you see anyone found out in
   wrong-doing, do not act as if you were his executioner. When you pass
   by a person who has lost his or her character, do not straighten your
   back and disdainfully regard him as the mire of the streets. Do not act
   the part of the very superior person. "By Him actions are weighed."

   Your actions are none too good. Perhaps there is not so much difference
   between you and the person whom you condemn, if all were known. You and
   the sinful one are not the least alike as to your outside wrappings and
   labeling, for you are labeled, "saint," and she is labeled, "a fallen
   woman." But if all were known, and all is known by God--the man without
   fault--who would dare to cast the first stone is not sitting in your
   seat! Ah, how the fact that we are, ourselves, to be judged, should
   make us speak with bated breath when we are tempted to judge others!
   Let us not judge one another any more, for the Judge is at the door
   and, "by Him actions are weighed." Let us leave judging to the Judge!
   Let everyone look to himself and let no man despise his neighbor.

   Next, I think we must give up all idea of speaking proudly in the
   Presence of God. Our good works--what are they when weighed? They look
   very pretty, indeed, as we set them out in array--but when God puts
   them into the scales, they look very different. We thought we weighed
   something, but in the scales they seem turned into feathers! Our good
   works are high up in the air and we are disappointed to see that the
   Law of God is not lifted up by all that we have done. I remember a good
   man who said, when he was dying, that he once began to separate his
   good works from his bad works. But he found them so much like one
   another, in the light of eternity, that he ceased separating them and
   threw them all away, determined to float to Heaven on the Cross of
   Christ.

   This was wisely done, for our best things are so stained with sin and
   the whole of a holy life is worth so little in the way of merit, that
   the shortcut of the whole matter is just to cry, "God be merciful to me
   a sinner," and rest ourselves on Jesus Christ alone. Dear Friend, if
   ever you have had the weighing process carried on in your own heart, I
   know you have given up all hope of being saved by your own merit or
   strength! If conscience has been awakened and if the Law of God has
   fulfilled its office upon you, you have given up all idea of appearing
   before God in your own righteousness! The man who boasts that he is
   perfect in the flesh either fails to weigh himself at all, or else he
   is in great need of a visit from the inspector, for his weights and
   scales are sadly out of repair.

   It is very easy to appear perfect if you have an imperfect standard to
   measure by--but when the Lord Himself weighs us by His Law, we cry out,
   "Who can understand his errors?" We have nothing with which to glory
   before God! The perfect Character of our Lord Jesus Christ shuts our
   mouths as to all self-congratulation and compels us to fall at His feet
   in deep humiliation! May the Lord carry on the weighing process in your
   consciences till you glory only in the Lord and every false,
   pretentious thing is banished forever!

   III. In closing, let us briefly consider THE POSITION IN WHICH ALL THIS
   LEAVES US. If God weighs our actions and we are, thereby, found
   wanting, and can only cry, "Guilty" in His sight, what then? Then we
   are in God's hands! That is where I wish every one of my Hearers felt
   himself to be. But who is the Lord? First, according to Hannah, He is a
   God of salvation! "My spirit has rejoiced in Your salvation." Salvation
   for sinners, salvation for the guilty, salvation for those that are
   weighed in the balance and found wanting! Free pardon, full remission,
   gracious acceptance even

   for the worst and vilest--this is the Gospel of the blessed God! How
   sweet to be in the hands of a God who is able to save--and delights to
   save--and makes it His glory to save!

   Next, according to Hannah's song, He is the God who delights in
   reversing the order of things. He throws down those who are high and
   sets up those that are down. "He has filled the hungry with good
   things; and the rich He has sent away empty." Is not that a hint to you
   to be empty, to be hungry, to be poor and needy? If God is going to
   pick men from the dunghill and set them among princes, even the princes
   of His people, then the surest road to princely preferment is
   consciously to take your place on the dunghill! If the shields of the
   mighty are broken, but the weak are girded with strength, then it is
   wise to be weak before the Lord! Down, pride! Down! Down! Humble
   yourselves under the mighty hand of God and He shall exalt you in due
   time!

   Once more, this God is one who delights to carry on strange processes
   in the hearts of His people. "The Lord kills, and makes alive: He
   brings down to the grave, and brings up. The Lord makes poor, and makes
   rich; He brings low, and lifts up." This is God's way of making men
   live--He kills them! This is God's way of giving them resurrection--He
   brings them to the grave! This is God's way of making men rich--He
   first makes them poor! This is God's way of lifting men up--they are
   first brought down! Are you brought down this morning? Be of good
   courage--this is the royal road to comfort in Christ Jesus! Is the Holy
   Spirit making you conscious of sin? He does so that you may be
   conscious of pardon! Do you feel condemned? The Lord condemns you, now,
   that you may not be condemned with the world! Are you evil, foul and
   vile in your own sight? It is that you may wash and be whiter than snow
   through the Lord Jesus!

   Oh how I rejoice to meet with a real sinner! Sham sinners are a
   vexation, but those who are really and truly so are precious in our
   sight! We hear of the bona fide traveler--give me the bona fide
   sinner--

   "A sinner is a sacred thing The Holy Spirit has made him so." He who is
   made to feel that he is truly lost is well-near saved! Christ died for
   such. "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." O you who are really
   a sinner, catch at that word! God grant you may find salvation now, for
   Jesus' sake. Amen.

John's First Doxology

   (No. 1737)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 2, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT EXETER HALL.

   "Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood,
   and has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be
   glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen." Revelation 1:5, 6

   JOHN had hardly begun to deliver his message to the seven Churches. He
   had hardly given his name and stated from whom the message came when he
   felt that he must lift up his heart in a joyful doxology! The very
   mention of the name of the Lord Jesus, "the faithful witness, and the
   first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth,"
   fired his heart. He could not sit down coolly to write even what the
   Spirit of God dictated--he must rise; he must fall upon his knees--he
   must bless and magnify, and adore the Lord Jesus! This text is just the
   upward burst of a great geyser of devotion. John's spirit had been
   quiet for a while, but all of a sudden the stream of his love to Jesus
   leaps forth like a fountain, rising so high that it would seem to bedew
   Heaven, itself, with its sparkling column of crystal love!

   Look at the ascending flood as you read the words, "Unto Him that loved
   us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings
   and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion
   forever and ever. Amen." Now, in the matter of this bursting out of
   devotion at unexpected times, John is one among the rest of the
   Apostles. Their love to their Divine Master was so intense that they
   had only to hear His footsteps and their pulse began to quicken. And if
   they heard His voice, they were they carried clean away--whether in the
   body or out of the body, they could not tell--but they were under
   constraint to magnify the Savior's name! Whatever they were doing, they
   felt compelled to pause at once and to render direct and distinct
   homage unto the Lord Jesus by adoration and doxology.

   Observe how Paul breaks forth into doxologies--"Now unto Him that is
   able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
   according to the power that works in us, unto Him be glory in the
   Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."
   Again--"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
   God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen." The same is true of
   Jude, who cries--"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling,
   and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with
   exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty,
   dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen." The Apostles overflowed
   with praise! This explains to me, I think, those texts which bid us
   "rejoice evermore," "bless the Lord at all times," and "pray without
   ceasing."

   But these do not mean that we are always to be engaged in devotional
   exercises, for that would cause a neglect of other duties. The very
   Apostle who bids us "pray without ceasing," did a great many other
   things beside praying, and we would certainly be very faulty if we shut
   ourselves up in our private chambers and there continued perpetually
   upon our knees. Life has other duties and necessary ones--and in
   attending to these we may render to our God the truest worship--to
   cease to work in our callings in order to spend all our time in prayer
   would be to offer to God one duty stained with the blond of many
   others! Yet we may "pray without ceasing," if our hearts are always in
   such a state that at every opportunity we are ready for prayer and
   praise. Better, still, if we are prepared to make opportunities! If we
   are instant in season and out of season and ready in a moment to adore
   and supplicate. If not always soaring, we may be as birds ready for
   instant flight--always with wings, if not always on the wing.

   Our hearts should be like beacons made ready to be fired. When invasion
   was expected in the days of Queen Elizabeth, piles of wood and
   combustible material were laid ready on the tops of certain hills.
   Watchmen stood prepared to kindle the piles should there be notice
   given that the ships of the enemy were in the offing. Everything was in
   waiting. The heap was not made of damp wood, neither had they to go and
   seek kindling, but the fuel waited for the match. The watch fire was
   not always blazing, but it was always ready to shoot forth its flame.
   Have you ever read, "Praise waits for you, O God, in Sion"? So let our
   hearts be prepared to be fired with adoring praise by one glimpse of
   the Redeemer's

   eyes--to be all on a blaze with delightful worship with one touch from
   those dear, pierced hands. Anywhere, wherever we may be, may we be clad
   in the robes of reverence and be ready, at once, to enter upon the
   angelic work of magnifying the Lord our Savior. We cannot always be
   singing, but we may always be full of gratitude--this is the fabric of
   which true Psalms are made.

   This spontaneous outburst of John's love is what I am going to preach
   upon this morning. First of all, I shall ask you to consider the
   condition of heart out of which such outbursts come. And then we will
   look more closely at the outburst itself, for my great desire is that
   you and I may often be thus transported into praise, carried off into
   ecstatic worship! I long that our hearts may be like harps through
   which each wind, as it sweeps on its way, makes charming music. As
   roses are ready to shed their perfume, so may we be eager to praise
   God--so much delighting in the blessed exercise of adoration that we
   shall plunge into it when colder hearts do not expect us to do so. I
   have read of Mr. Welch, a minister in Suffolk, that he was often seen
   to be weeping, and when asked why, he replied that he wept because he
   did not love Christ more. May not many of us weep that we do not praise
   Him more? Oh that our meditation may be used of the Holy Spirit to help
   us in that direction!

   I. First, let us look at THE CONDITION OF THE HEART OUT OF WHICH BURSTS
   of adoration arise. Who was this man who, when he was beginning to
   address the Churches, must lay down his pen to praise the Savior? We
   will learn the character of the man from his own devout language. We
   shall see his inmost self here, for he is carried off his feet and
   speaks out his very heart in the most unguarded manner. We shall now
   see him as he was and learn what manner of persons we must be if we are
   to be like he was. It would be easy to talk at great length about John
   from what we know of his history from other parts of Scripture, but
   this time I tie myself down to the words of the text, and I notice,
   first, that this man of doxologies, from whom praise flashes forth like
   light from the rising sun, is, first of all, a man who has realized the
   Person of His Lord.

   The first words are, "Unto Him." And then he must, a second time before
   he has finished, say, "To Him be glory and dominion." His Lord is
   evidently before his eyes. He sees the actual Christ upon the Throne of
   God! The great fault of many professors is that Christ is to them a
   character upon paper--certainly more than a myth--but yet a Person of
   the dim past; an historical Person who lived many years ago and did
   most admirable deeds, by which we are saved--but who is far from being
   a living, present, bright reality. Many think of Jesus as gone away.
   They know not where and He is little more actual and present to them
   than Julius Caesar or any other remarkable personage of antiquity. We
   have a way, somehow, a very wicked way it is, of turning the facts of
   Scripture into romances, exchanging solidities for airy notions,
   regarding the august sublimities of faith as dreamy, misty fancies
   rather than substantial matters of fact.

   It is a grand thing, personally, to know the Christ of God as a living
   existence; to speak into His ear; to look into His face and to
   understand that we live in Him and that He is always with us, even to
   the end of the world. Jesus was no abstraction to John! He loved Him
   too much for that. Love has a great vivifying power--it makes our
   impressions of those who are far away from us very lifelike and brings
   them very near. John's great, tender heart could not think of Christ as
   a cloudy conception. He remembered Him as that blessed One with whom he
   had spoken and on whose breast he had leaned. You see that is so, for
   his song rises at once to the Lord, beginning with, "Unto HIM."

   He makes us see Jesus in every act of which he speaks in his doxology.
   It runs thus--"Unto Him that loved us." It is not, "Unto the love of
   God"--or an attribute, or an influence, or an emotion--it is, "Unto Him
   that loved us." I am very grateful for love, but more grateful to Him
   who gives the love. Somehow you may speak of love and eulogize it, but
   if you know it only in the abstract, what is it? It neither warms the
   heart nor inspires the spirit. When love comes to us from a known
   person, then we value it. David had not cared for the love of some
   unknown warrior, but how greatly he prized that of Jonathan, of which
   he sang, "Your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women!"
   Sweet is it to sing of love, but sanctified hearts delight still more
   to sing, "Unto Him that loved us."

   So, too, with the washing from sin. It is enough to make us sing of
   pardoning mercy forever and ever if we have been cleansed from sin--but
   the center of the joy is to adore Him "that washed us from our sins in
   His own blood." Observe that He cleansed us, not by some process
   outside of Himself, but by the shedding of His own blood of
   reconciliation. It brings the blood-washing into the highest estimation
   with the heart when we look into the wounds from where the Atonement
   flowed--when we gaze upon that dear visage so sadly marred, that brow
   so grievously scarred, and even peer

   into the heart which was pierced by the spear for us to furnish a
   double cleansing for our sin. "Unto Him that washed

   us."

   The disciples were bound to love the hands that took the basin and
   poured water on their feet; and the loins which were girt with the
   towel for their washing. And we, Brothers and Sisters, must do the
   same. But as for the washing with His own blood, how shall we ever
   praise Him enough? Well may we sing the new song, saying, "You are
   worthy, for You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood."
   This puts body and weight into our praise when we have realized Him and
   understood how distinctly these precious deeds of love, as well as the
   love, itself, come from Him whose sacred heart is all our own! So, too,
   if we are "kings and priests," it is Jesus who has made us so--

   "Round the altar priests confess If their robes are white as snow,
   'Twas the Sa vior's righteousness And His blood that made them so." Our
   royal dignity and our priestly sanctity are both derived from Him. Let
   us not only behold the streams, but also consider the source. Bow
   before the blessed and only Potentate who crowns and enthrones us!
   Extol the faithful High Priest who robes and anoints us! See the Divine
   Actor in the grand scene and remember that He always lives and,
   therefore, to Him should we render perpetual glory!

   John worships the Lord Himself. His mind is not set upon His garments,
   His crowns, His offices, or His works, but upon Himself, His very Self.
   "I SAW HIM," says the beloved Apostle, and that vision almost blotted
   out the rest! His heart was all for Jesus. The censer must smoke unto
   Him; the song must rise unto Him--unto Himself, unto His very Self! I
   pray that every professor here may have a real Christ, for otherwise he
   will never be a real Christian. I want you to recognize, in this
   realization of Christ by John, this teaching--that we are to regard our
   holy faith as based on facts and realities. We have not followed
   cunningly devised fables! Do you believe in the Divine life of Christ?
   Do you also believe that He who is "very God of very God" actually
   became Incarnate and was born at Bethlehem? Do you put down the union
   of the Godhead with our humanity as an historical fact which has the
   most potent bearing upon all the history of mankind?

   Do you believe that Jesus lived on earth and trod the blessed acres of
   Judea, toiling for our sake, and that He did actually and really die on
   the behalf of sinners? Do you believe that He was buried and, on the
   third day, rose again from the dead? Are these stories in a book, or
   facts in the life of a familiar Friend? To me it is the grandest fact
   in all history, that the Son of God died and rose again from the dead
   and always lives as my Representative! Many statements in history are
   well attested, but no fact in human records is one half as well
   attested us the certain resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead!
   This is no invention, no fable, no parable, but a literal fact--and on
   it all the confidence of the Believer leans. If Christ is not risen,
   then your faith is vain! But as He surely rose again and is now at the
   right hand of God, even the Father, and will shortly come to be our
   judge, your faith is justified and shall, in due season, have its
   reward!

   Get a religion of facts and you will have a religion which will produce
   facts by operating upon your life and character! But a religion of
   fancies is but a fancied religion and nothing practical will come of
   it. To have a real personal Christ is to get a good anchor hold for
   love, faith and hope. Somehow men cannot love that which is not
   tangible. That which they cannot apprehend they do not love. When I was
   about to commence the Orphanage at Stockwell, a gentleman who was very
   experienced in an excellent orphanage said to me, "Begin by never
   expecting to receive the slightest gratitude from the parents of the
   children and you will not be disappointed. For," he said, "I have been
   connected with a certain orphanage," which he mentioned, "for a great
   many years, and except in the rarest case I have never seen any tokens
   of gratitude in any of the mothers whose children have been received."

   Now, my experience is very different. I have had a great many grips of
   the hand which meant warm thanks. And I have often seen tears fall from
   the mothers' eyes. And many a grateful letter have I received because
   of help given to the orphan children. How do I explain the difference?
   Not that our Orphanage has done more than the other, but the other
   Orphanage is conducted by a Committee with no well-known head and,
   therefore, it is somewhat of an abstraction--the poor women do not know
   who is to be thanked and, consequently, thank nobody! In our own case
   the poor people say to themselves, "Here is Mr. Spurgeon and he took
   our children into the Orphanage." They recognize in me the outward and
   visible representative of the many generous hearts that help me! They
   know me, for they can see me and they say, "God bless you," because
   they have someone to say it to!

   There is nothing particular about me, certainly, and there are others
   who deserve far more gratitude than that which comes to me--but it come
   to me, by God's Grace, because the poor people know the name and the
   man--and have not to look at a mere abstraction. Pardon the
   illustration, but it suits my purpose well. If you have a Christ whom
   you cannot realize, you will not love Him with that fervent affection
   which is so much to be desired! If you cannot reach the Lord in your
   mind, you will not embrace Him in your heart! But if you have realized
   the blessed Master. If He has become a true existence to you, One who
   has really loved you and washed you from your sins and made you a king
   and a priest-- then your love must flow out towards Him. You cannot
   resist the impulse to love One who has so truly loved you and is so
   well known to you.

   This also gives a foothold to faith. If you know the Lord Jesus, you
   feel that you can trust Him. "They that know Your name will put their
   trust in You." Those to whom Christ has become a well-known Friend do
   not find it difficult to trust Him in the time of their distress. An
   unknown Christ is untrusted. But when the Holy Spirit reveals Jesus, He
   also breeds faith. By the same means, your hope also becomes vivid, for
   you say, "Oh, yes, I know Jesus and I am sure that He will keep His
   Word. He has said, 'I will come again and receive you unto Myself,' and
   I am sure that He will come, for it is not like He to deceive His own
   chosen." Hope's eyes are brightened as she thinks of Jesus and,
   realizing that He loves to the end those who believe in Him, she
   rejoices with joy unspeakable and full of glory! To love, to trust, to
   hope, are all easy in the Presence of a real living Christ, but if,
   like the disciples at midnight on the Galilean lake, we think Him to be
   a mere specter or apparition, we shall be afraid and cry out in fear!
   Nothing will suffice a real Christian but a real Christ!

   Next, the Apostle John, in whom we note this outburst of devotion, was
   a man firmly assured of his possession of the blessings for which he
   praised the Lord. Doubt has no outbursts; its chill breath freezes all
   things. Nowadays we hear Christian people talk in this way--"Unto Him
   that we hope has loved us, and that we humbly trust has washed us, and
   that we sometimes believe has made us kings, unto Him be glory." Alas!
   The doxology is so feeble that it seems to imply as little glory as you
   like. The fact is, if you do not know that you have a blessing, you do
   not know whether you ought to be grateful for it or not! But when a man
   knows he has Covenant mercies, that Divine assurance which the Holy
   Spirit gives to Christians works in him a sacred enthusiasm of devotion
   to Jesus. He knows what he enjoys and he blesses Him from whom the
   enjoyment comes.

   I would have you, Beloved, know beyond all doubt that Jesus is yours,
   so that you can say without hesitation, "He loved me and gave Himself
   for me." You will never say, "You know all things, You know that I love
   You," unless you are first established upon the point that Jesus loves
   you, for, "we love Him because He first loved us." John was certain
   that he was loved and he was, therefore, most clear that he was washed!
   And therefore he poured forth his soul in praise. Oh to know that you
   are washed from your sins in the blood of Jesus! Some professors seem
   half-afraid to say that they are cleansed, but oh, my Hearer, if you
   are a Believer in Jesus, the case is clear, for, "there is now no
   condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus"!

   "He that believes in Him has everlasting life." "He that believes in
   Him is justified from all things from which he could not be justified
   by the Law of Moses." "You are clean," says Christ. "He that is washed
   needs not wash but his feet, but is clean every whit." And "You are
   clean."--

   "O how sweet to view the flowing Of the Sa vior's precious blood! With
   Divine assurance, knowing He has made my peace with God." This
   well-grounded assurance will throw you into ecstasy and it will not be
   long before the deep of your heart will well up with fresh springs of
   adoring love! Then shall you also praise the Lord with some such words
   as these--"Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His
   own blood, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."

   Once more. I think we have brought out two points which are clear
   enough. John had realized his Master and firmly grasped the blessings
   which his Master brought him. But he had also felt and was feeling very
   strongly his communion with all the saints. Notice the use of the
   plural pronoun. We would not have wondered if he had said, "Unto Him
   that loved me, and washed me from my sins in His own blood." Somehow
   there would have been a loss of sweetness had the doxology been so
   worded and it would have hardly sounded like John. John is the very
   mirror of love and he cannot live alone, or rejoice alone, in sacred
   benefits. John must have all the brotherhood round about him and he
   must speak in their name, or he will be as one who benefits only half
   for himself.

   Beloved, it is well for you and me to use this, "us," often. There are
   times when it is better to say, "me," but in general, let us get away
   to the, "us"--for has not our Lord taught us when we pray to say, Our
   Father which are in Heaven? Give us this day our daily bread forgive us
   our trespasses," and so on? Jesus does not bid us say, "My Father." We
   do say it and it is well to say it, but our usual prayers must run in
   the, "Our Father," style. And our usual praises must be, "Unto Him that
   loved us, and washed us from our sins." Let me ask you, beloved
   Brothers and Sisters, do you not love the Lord Jesus all the better and
   praise Him all the more heartily because His Grace and love are not
   given to you, alone? Why, that blessed love has embraced your children,
   your neighbors, your fellow Church members, myriads who have gone
   before you, multitudes that are round about you and an innumerable
   company who are coming after! And for this we ought to praise the
   gracious Lord with unbounded delight.

   It seems so much more lovely--this salvation--when we think of it,, not
   as a cup of water of which one or two of us may drink, but as a well of
   water opened in the desert, always flowing, always giving life and
   deliverance and restoration to all who pass that way. "Unto Him that
   loved us." Oh, my Lord, I bless You for having loved me; but sometimes
   I think I could adore You for loving my wife, for loving my children
   and all these dear Friends around me, even if I had no personal share
   in Your salvation! Sometimes this seems the greater part of it, not
   that I should share in Your compassion, but that all these poor sheep
   should be gathered into Your fold and kept safe by You. The instinct of
   a Christian minister leads him to love Christ for loving the many--and
   I think the thought of every true worker for the Lord runs much in the
   same way.

   No man will burst out into such joyful adoration as we have now before
   us unless he has a great heart within him which is full of love to all
   the brotherhood. And then, as he looks upon the multitude of the
   redeemed around about him, he will be prompted to cry with enthusiastic
   joy--

   "To Him that loved the souls of men,

   And washed us in His blood,

   To royal honors raised our head,

   And made us priests to God.

   To Him let every tongue be praise,

   And every heart be love!

   All grateful honors paid on earth,

   And nobler songs above!"

   Thus much upon the condition of heart which suggests these doxologies.

   II. Secondly, let us look at THE OUTBURST ITSELF. It is a doxology and,
   as such, does not stand alone--it is one of many. In the Book of
   Revelation doxologies are frequent. In the first few chapters they
   distinctly grow as the book advances. If you have your Bibles with you,
   as you ought to have, you will notice that in this first outburst only
   two things are ascribed to our Lord. "To Him be glory and dominion
   forever and ever." Now turn to the fourth chapter at the ninth verse
   and read, "Those living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to
   Him that sat on the throne." Here we have three words of honor. Run on
   to verse eleven, and read the same. "Saying, you are worthy, O Lord, to
   receive glory and honor and power." The doxology has grown from two to
   three in each of these verses.

   Now turn to chapter 5:13. "And every creature which is in Heaven, and
   on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all
   that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and
   power, be unto Him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever
   and ever." Here we have four notes of praise. Steadily but surely there
   is an advance. By the time we get to chapter 7:12, we have reached the
   number of perfection--and may not look for more. "Blessing, and glory,
   and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power and might, be unto
   our God forever and ever. Amen." If you begin praising God you are
   bound to go on! The work engrosses the heart. It deepens and broadens
   like a rolling river.

   Praise is somewhat like an avalanche, which may begin with a snowflake
   on the mountain moved by the wing of a bird, but that flake binds
   others to itself and becomes a rolling ball. This rolling ball gathers
   more snow about it till it is huge and immense--it crashes through a
   forest; it thunders down into the valley--it buries a village under its
   stupendous mass! Thus praise may begin with the tear of gratitude, but
   soon the bosom swells with love! Then thankfulness rises to a song and
   it breaks forth into a shout! And finally it mounts up to join the
   everlasting hallelujahs which surround the Throne of the Eternal! What
   a mercy it is that God, by His Spirit, will give us greater capacities,
   by-and- by, than we

   have here! For if we continue to learn more and more of the love of
   Christ which passes knowledge, we shall be driven to sore straits if
   confined within the narrow and drowsy framework of this mortal body!
   This poor apparatus of tongue and mouth is already inadequate for our
   zeal--

   "Words are but air and tongues and clay, But His compassions are
   Divine." We need to get out of these fetters and rise into something
   better adapted to the emotions of our spirit! I cannot emulate the
   songsters of Immanuel's chorus though I would gladly do so. But as
   Berridge says--

   "Strip me of this house of clay, And I will sing as loud as they."

   These doxologies occur again and again throughout this book as if to
   remind us to be frequent in praise. And they grow as they proceed, to
   hint to us that we, also, should increase in thankfulness. Now, this
   outburst carried within itself its own justification. Look at it
   closely and you perceive the reasons why, in this enthusiastic manner,
   John adores his Savior. The first is, "Unto Him that loved us." Time
   would fail me to speak long on this charming theme, so I will only
   notice briefly a few things. This love is in the present tense, for the
   passage may be read, "Unto Him that loves us." Our Lord, in Glory,
   still loves us as truly and as fervently as He did in the days of His
   flesh. He loved us before the world was! He loves us, now, with all His
   heart, and He will love us when sun and moon and stars have all expired
   like sparks that die when the fire is quenched upon the hearth and men
   go to their beds. "He loves us."

   He is Himself the same yesterday, today and forever--and His love is
   like Himself. Dwell on the present character of it and be, at this
   moment, moved to holy praise. He loved us first before He washed
   us--"Unto Him that loved us, and washed us." Not, "Unto Him that washed
   us and loved us." This is one of the glories of Christ's love--that it
   comes to us while we are defiled with sin--yes, DEAD in sin! Christ's
   love does not only go out to us as washed, purified and cleansed, but
   it went out towards us while we were yet foul, vile and without
   anything in us that could be worthy of His love at all! He loved us and
   then washed us! Love is the fountainhead, the first source of blessing.
   Think of this as being a recognizable description of our Lord--"Unto
   Him that loved us."

   John wanted to point out the Lord Jesus Christ and all he said was,
   "Unto Him that loved us." He was sure nobody would make any mistake as
   to who was intended, for no one can be said to love us in comparison
   with Jesus. It is interesting to note that as John is spoken of as,
   "that disciple whom Jesus loved," so now the servant describes the
   Master in something like the same terms, "Unto Him that loved us." No
   one fails to recognize John or the Lord Jesus under their several love
   names. When the Apostle mentioned, "Him that loved us," there was no
   fear of men saying, "That is the man's friend, or father, or brother."
   No, there is no love like that of Jesus Christ! He bears the palm for
   love--yes, in the presence of His love all other love is eclipsed--even
   as the sun conceals the stars by his unrivalled brightness!

   Again, the words, "Him that loved us," seems as if it described all
   that Christ did for us, or, at least, it mentions, first, the grandest
   thing He ever did, in which all the rest is wrapped up. It is not,
   "Unto Him that took our nature; unto Him that set us a glorious
   example; unto Him that intercedes for us," but, "Unto Him that loved
   us," as if that one thing comprehended all, as indeed it does! He loves
   us--this is matter for admiration and amazement. Oh, my Brothers and
   Sisters, this is an abyss of wonder to me! I can understand that Jesus
   pities us. I can very well understand that He has compassion on us. But
   that the Lord of Glory loves us is a deep, great, heavenly thought
   which my finite mind can hardly hold. Come, Brothers and Sisters, and
   drink of this wine on the lees, well refined! Jesus loves you! Grasp
   that!

   You know what the word means in some little degree according to human
   measurements, but the infinite Son of God loved you of old and He loves
   you now! His heart is knit with your heart and He cannot be happy
   unless you are happy. Remember He loves you with His own love according
   to His own Nature. Therefore He has for you an infinite love altogether
   immeasurable! It is also like Himself, immutable, and can never know a
   change. The emperor Augustus was noted for his faithfulness to his
   friends whom he was slow in choosing. He used to say, "Late before I
   have, long before I leave." Our blessed Lord loved us early, but He
   never leaves us! Has He not said, "I will never leave you, nor forsake
   you"? The love of Jesus is a pure, perfect and Divine--a love whose
   heights and depths none can measure!

   Jesus' Nature is eternal and undying, and such is His love. He could
   not love you more; He will never love you less. With all His heart and
   soul and mind and strength He loves you! Come, is not that a grand
   excuse, if excuse is needed, for often lifting up our hearts and voices
   in hearty song unto the Lord? Why should we not, seven times a day,
   exult before Him, saying, "Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from
   our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings and priests

   unto God and His Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever.
   Amen"? Oh for new crowns for His blessed brow! Oh for new songs for His
   love--new gifts to always praise Him! Praise Him, all earth and Heaven!

   Then the Apostle passes on to the second reason why he should thus
   magnify the Lord Jesus by saying, "And washed us from our sins in His
   own blood." "Washed us." Then we were foul and He loved us though we
   were unclean! He washed us who had been more defiled than any. How
   could He condescend so far as to wash us? Would He have anything to do
   with such filthiness as ours? Would that sublime holiness of His come
   into contact with the abominable guilt of our nature and our practice?
   Yes, He loved us so much that He washed us from our sins, black as they
   were. He did it effectually, too. He didn't try to wash us, but He
   actually and completely washed us from our sins! The stains were deep
   and damnable; they seemed indelible, but He has "washed us from our
   sins." No spot remains, though we were black as midnight. "Wash me, and
   I shall be whiter than snow," has been realized by every Believer here!

   But think of how He washed us--"with His own blood." Men are cautious
   of their own blood, for it is their life, but brave ones will pour it
   out for their country or for some worthy objective. But Jesus shed His
   blood for such unworthy ones as we are, that He might, by His
   Atonement, forever put away the iniquity of His people! At what a cost
   was this cleansing provided! Too great a cost I had almost said. Have
   you never felt at times as if, had you been there and seen the Lord of
   Glory about to bleed to death for you, you would have said, "No, my
   Lord, the price is too great to pay for such a one as I am"? But He has
   done it, Brothers and Sisters--His sin-atoning work is finished
   forever--Jesus has bled and He has washed us! And we are clean beyond
   fear of future defilement. Shall He not have glory for this? Will we
   not wish Him dominion for this?--

   "Worthy is He that once was slain, The Prince of Peace that groaned and
   died; Worthy to rise, and live, and reign At His Almighty Father's
   side."

   Does not this doxology carry its justification in its own heart? Who
   can refuse to praise at the remembrance of such Grace as this? Nor is
   this all. The Lord that loved us would do nothing by halves and,
   therefore, when He washed us in His own blood, He, "made us kings."
   What? Are we kings this morning? We do not feel our crowns as yet, nor
   perhaps grasp our scepters as we might, but the Lord has made us a
   royal priesthood! We reign over ourselves and that is a dominion which
   is hard to gain! Indeed, it is impossible without Divine Grace! We walk
   like kings among the sons of men, honored before the Lord and His holy
   angels--the peerage of eternity! Our thoughts, our aims, our hopes and
   our longings are all of a nobler kind than those of the mere carnal
   man. Ours is a nature of a higher order than theirs, since we have been
   born, again, of the Spirit!

   Men know us not because they know not our Lord, but we have a heritage
   they have not and we have prepared for us a crown of life which fades
   not away. The Lord has made us kings and endowed us with power before
   His Presence--yes, He has made us rich since all things are ours. We
   read of the peculiar treasures of kings and we have a choice wealth of
   Grace. He has made us, even now, among the sons of men to possess the
   earth and to delight ourselves in the abundance of peace. Furthermore,
   our Lord has made us priests. Certain men impiously set up to be
   priests above the rest of the Lord's people. As Korah, Dathan and
   Abiram are they, and they had need fear lest they and their evil system
   should go down into the Pit. Whoever they may be, all the people of God
   are priests! Every man that believes in Jesus Christ is, from the
   moment he believes, a priest, though he is neither shaven nor shorn,
   nor bedecked in peculiar array. To the true Believer, his common
   garments are vestments; every meal is a sacrament, every act is a
   sacrifice.

   If we live as we should live, our houses are temples, our hearts are
   altars, our lives are an oblation. The bells upon our horses are
   holiness unto the Lord and our common pots are as the bowls before the
   altar. It is the sanctification of the Holy Spirit which gives men a
   special character, so that they are the priesthood of the universe! The
   world is dumb and we must speak for it--the whole universe is as a
   great organ, but it is silent. We place our fingers on the keys and the
   music rises towards Heaven. We are to be priests for all mankind.
   Wherever we go we are to teach men and to intercede with God for them.
   In prayer and praise we are to offer up acceptable oblations--and we
   are to be living sacrifices, acceptable unto God by Jesus Christ our
   Lord. Oh, what dignity is this! How you and I are bound to serve God!

   Peter Martyr told Queen Elizabeth, "Kings and queens are more bound to
   obey God than any other persons. First, as God's creatures, and
   secondly as His servants in office." This applies to us, also. If
   common men are bound to serve God, how much more those whom He has made
   kings and priests unto His name? What does the doxology say? "To Him

   be glory and dominion." First, "To Him be glory." Oh, give Him glory,
   my Beloved, this morning! Do I address any that have never accepted
   Christ's salvation? Accept it now! And thus give your Savior glory.
   Have you never trusted Jesus to save you? The best, the only thing you
   can do to give Him glory is to trust Him now, sinner as you are, that
   He may remove your transgressions. Are you saved? Then, dear Brothers
   and Sisters, give Him glory by speaking well of His name and by
   perpetual adoration. Glorify Him in your songs! Glorify Him in your
   lives! Behave yourselves as His disciples should do and may His Spirit
   help you.

   But the doxology also ascribes dominion to Him. My heart longs for
   Jesus to have dominion! I wish He might get dominion over some poor
   heart this morning which has, up to now, been in rebellion against Him!
   Yield you rebel! Yield to your Sovereign and Savior! "Kiss the Son,
   lest He be angry and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled
   but a little." To Him be dominion over hearts that have never submitted
   to Him and assuredly to Him be fullest dominion over hearts that love
   Him! Reign my Lord! Reign in my bosom more and more! Cast out every
   enemy and every rival! Reign supreme and reign eternally! Set up Your
   Throne more and more conspicuously in the hearts and lives of all who
   call themselves Christians! O my Brothers and Sisters, ought it not to
   be so? Is it not clear to you that since He has loved and washed us, He
   should have dominion over us? Ah, let Him have dominion over the wide,
   wide world till they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before Him
   and His enemies shall lick the dust! Reign forever, King of kings and
   Lord of lords!

   Then it is added, let Him have glory and dominion "forever and ever." I
   suppose we shall have some gentlemen coming up to prove that, "forever
   and ever," only means for a time. They tell us that everlasting
   punishment means only for a time and, of course, everlasting life must
   mean the same and this praise must also have a limit. I do not mean
   that and neither do you, Beloved! I pray that our Lord may have endless
   glory, eternal dominion. I pray that Christ's power and dominion may be
   over this generation, the next and the next until He comes--and then
   that it may be said--"The Lord shall reign forever and ever."
   Hallelujah! As long as there are wings of angels or songs of man; as
   long as God Himself shall live, may the Lord Jesus Christ that loved us
   and washed us have glory and dominion!

   Now we have come to the last word of the text. It finishes up with,
   "Amen." "Forever and ever. Amen." Can you heartily say, "Amen," to
   this? Do you wish Christ to have glory and dominion forever and ever?
   If you know He loved you, I am sure you do! If you know He washed you,
   I am sure you do! Now let our beating hearts in solemn silence say,
   "Amen!" And when we have done that, do you think you could join in one
   voice with me and say it out aloud, like thunder? Now, "Unto Him that
   loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has made us
   kings and priests unto God and His Father, to Him be glory and dominion
   forever and ever. "Amen." And, "Amen!" yet again. (Here the great
   congregation joined aloud with the preacher). The prayers of David, the
   son of Jesse, were ended when he came to that, and so may ours be, and
   so may this morning's service be. God bless you through His adorable
   Son. Amen and Amen!

"Glory Be Unto the Father"

   (No. 1738)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 9 1883, BY C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has
   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenlyplaces in Christ:
   according as He has chosen us in Him before the foundation of the
   world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love."

   Ephesians 1:3, 4.

   LAST Lord's Day I finished the morning services at Exeter Hall with a
   sermon upon John's choice doxology, "Unto Him that loved us and washed
   us from our sins in His own blood, to Him be glory and dominion forever
   and ever. Amen." [Sermon #1737, Volume 29, John's First Doxology.] I
   felt, therefore, that it would be most fitting to open this series of
   services with another doxology. And as the last was in praise of the
   Second Person of the Divine Unity, this is to the honor and glory of
   the adorable Person of the Father. May God, who gave His servants a
   praiseful spirit so that their Epistles abound with doxologies, give
   the same spirit of joyous thankfulness to us at this time, that we may
   all say from the very bottom of our hearts, "Amen," to our text,
   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   Of praise, we may say what was said concerning salt in the Scripture,
   "without prescribing how much." Oh to praise and pray without ceasing!
   May the Holy Spirit work in us perpetual thanksgiving! Observe well
   that the same words are used in reference to our wish towards God and
   God's act towards us--"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who has blessed us." It is a very striking thing that our poor
   pebble stones of wishes should be valued so much that the same words
   should be used in reference to them as in reference to the priceless
   diamonds of Grace which the Lord has bestowed upon us! We bless God
   because He blesses us. "Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all
   His benefits."

   Now, it is easy to understand how the Father of Mercies, from whom
   every good and perfect gift proceeds, really blesses us. But how can we
   be said to bless Him? And what is the distinction between that and
   praising Him? For there is a distinction, since we read, "All Your
   works shall praise You, O Lord, and Your saints shall bless You."
   Praise rises even from lifeless objects, as they display the power and
   wisdom of their Creator. But intelligence, will and intent are
   necessary for blessing God. Praise is the manifestation of our inward
   reverence and esteem--it adores and magnifies--but in blessing God, we
   think well of Him and wish Him well and desire that others may do the
   same!

   In blessing God there is the desire to do good to God even as He does
   to us--if it were possible! We fail in the power with which to
   accomplish such a desire, but it is well that it is in our hearts. God
   cannot actually receive anything from us for His own enrichment or
   increase--for all things that we can do for Him are His, already--and
   they must be done in His strength, so that, when all is done, it must
   be said, "Of Your own have we given You." Neither can we add to His
   splendor or His happiness, for He is, by Nature, inconceivably glorious
   and infinitely blessed! But if such an increase were within our power,
   we would gladly render it. If all things were ours, we would lay them
   at His feet. And such things as we have, though we cannot give them
   directly to Him, yet we give them to His cause and to the poor of His
   people.

   What says the Psalmist? "O Lord, You are my God; my goodness extends
   not to You, but to the saints that are in the earth, and to the
   excellent, in whom is all my delight." We are happy that, in assisting
   needy Believer, we are blessing the Lord. There is also a considerable
   measure of blessing God in such prayers as these--"Hallowed be Your
   name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done in earth, as it is in
   Heaven." When we gladly ascribe unto the Lord, glory, power and
   dominion, we are blessing Him. When we wish other men to love and serve
   the Lord and do Him homage, we are blessing Him. When we desire to love
   Him more, ourselves, and feel our hearts burn with aspirations after
   fellowship with Him, we are blessing Him. When we are zealous to make
   known the Truth of the Gospel which glorifies God, and to make known
   His Son in whom especially He is revealed, we are blessing God!

   In sacred silence, when the heart cannot translate her emotions into
   words, and hardly into thoughts, we can bless the Lord. In rendering
   unto God such things as we can render and in always asking the still
   larger question--"What

   shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me?"--we are
   blessing Him. If we cheerfully await His bidding, and count it a
   delight to stand with girded loins, crying, "What would You have me to
   do? Have You an errand for these willing feet? Here I am! Send me,"
   then we are, in effect, blessing our Lord! Can you sing from your
   soul--

   "There's not a lamb among Your flock

   I would refuse to feed!

   There's not a foe before whose face

   I'd fear Your cause to plead"?

   Then are you in that state of heart in which all that is within you
   blesses God's holy name! Blessed be God! We would make Him better known
   and so increase His manifest glory, wishing all the while that we could
   do a thousand times more!

   May our hearts be, at this time, filled with high ideas of the goodness
   and greatness of the Lord--and so may our souls be ready to burst forth
   in praise, eager for service, and bowed in reverent adoration. "Bless
   the Lord, O house of Israel: bless the Lord, O house of Aaron: bless
   the Lord, O house of Levi: you that fear the Lord, bless the Lord!
   Blessed be the Lord out of Zion which dwells at Jerusalem. Praise the
   Lord." May we be stirred up to bless the Lord by the teaching of our
   text!

   I. Here we have, first of all, GOD THE FATHER VIEWED ARIGHT. "Blessed
   be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." When the Divine Father
   is viewed aright, He becomes the object of our gratitude, not of our
   dread. Instead of trembling before Him as before an austere judge, we
   rejoice in Him as a tender Father. He is no more to us the Thunderer of
   Sinai, but the Father of our spirits. Among the ignorant, it is too
   much the custom to ascribe every mercy to the Lord Jesus Christ and to
   think that He is all kindness and gentleness, while the Father is full
   of stern justice and severity--but it is not so! God is Love and that
   Love dwells equally in each of the sacred Three. Our Lord Jesus Christ
   comes to us by reason of the love of the Father--"thanks be unto God
   for His unspeakable Gift." "God so loved the world, that He gave His
   only-begotten Son."

   In every act of the Lord Jesus, He reveals the tenderness and Grace of
   the Father to us. He says, "He that has seen Me has seen the Father,"
   and, "I say not that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father
   Himself loves you." "Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed
   upon us." The love of the Father is, in all respects, equal to the love
   of the Son! We must never, for a single moment, set one Person of the
   Holy Trinity before another in our minds. We must believe in "the love
   of the Spirit," and speak of, "our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God,
   even our Father which has loved us." Let us never fall into the
   mistaken idea that the atoning Sacrifice of Christ was intended to make
   an angry God willing to be merciful! Far otherwise--Jesus dies not to
   create mercy in God's heart, but to open a way for the exercise of the
   mercy which was there from all eternity!

   To our apprehension, God may seem changed when we realize the great
   reconciliation, but in very deed He was always full of Grace. God's
   love went forth towards His chosen before the Savior died and because
   He loved them, therefore He gave His Son to die for them. Let us see,
   in this death of our Redeemer, not the cause, but the result of God's
   love! And let us magnify the Father who spared not His own Son, but
   freely delivered Him up for us all. "Herein is love, not that we loved
   God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for
   our sins." Is not the Father, from this point of view, the object of
   our love, praise and blessing? "Blessed be the God and Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ." Let us cast out the fear which has torment--let us
   no longer stand afar off, but draw near unto God with childlike
   confidence and hearts aglow with ardent love. May the Lord direct our
   hearts into the love of God!

   Next, if we would view the Father aright we must regard Him as the God
   of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is a wonderful title. We often sing
   --"Praise the God of Abraham"--and truly it is blessed to view God as
   the God of Abraham, but how much more as the God of our Lord Jesus
   Christ! Jesus, after His resurrection, called Him, "My Father, and your
   Father: my God, and your God." And when He was in the act of expiring,
   He cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" To our Lord Jesus
   as Man, the Father was God, and He worshipped Him and served Him. How
   frequently Jesus drew near to God in prayer! How constantly He rendered
   obedience to Him!

   Our Lord also says of Himself in the 22nd Psalm--"I will declare Your
   name unto My brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise
   You." Thus did our Mediator bow before the Throne of God and admit to
   the Truth of God then present, "My Father is greater than I." I delight
   to think that God is now dealing with His people as the God of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, for what blessings are there which God would not give to
   the Son of the Highest, that holy Thing that

   was born of Mary? How greatly must God bless Him, the perfect Man,
   Christ Jesus, of whom it is written in the Psalm: "You loves
   righteousness and hate wickedness: therefore God, Your God, has
   anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows."

   God, I say, is dealing with His own chosen as He deals with the
   perfectly obedient One! By the obedience of Jesus, many are made
   righteous and treated as such--and we are among the many who are
   accepted in the Beloved! It is the God of Jesus Christ who has blessed
   us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places, and to Him Paul
   prayed for the Ephesians, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation
   in the knowledge of Him." You remember how the tribes of Israel were
   blessed by the God of Jacob for their father's sake? Even so are we
   blessed by the God of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to the measure in
   which He would bless His spotless Son, Jesus! Think, then, of the
   infinite Jehovah as the God of our Lord Jesus and, therefore, the God
   of His redeemed people.

   The text title is, "The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," which may
   respect the double affiliation of Christ. First, as to His
   Godhead--there is that mysterious Sonship which we cannot understand,
   but which is, nevertheless, clearly revealed. He is the Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ as Jesus is God. And then there is that second
   Sonship which belongs to Christ as Man, in which, again, He is said to
   be the Son of God. "God sent forth His Son, made of a woman." The
   Father thrice said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased." The great work of expiation is over and, "now is the Son of
   God glorified." And the Father manifests His unbounded love to His
   Son--let it, then, be a matter of great joy to us that the Father loves
   His people even as He loves His Son--and blesses us as He blesses Him!

   Even as Jacob blessed Ephraim and Manasseh because of his love to
   Joseph, even so, the great Father lays His mighty hand in benediction
   upon all His chosen and blesses the very least Believer as He blesses
   His Son Jesus! He who has highly exalted His Son, Jesus, to whom He
   stands in a double sense in the relation of a Father, has also prepared
   a throne in Glory for all who are in Christ. "The Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ!" How endearing and attractive is the name! If we can view
   the Father in that light, we shall be able to approach Him with firmer
   confidence! We shall rejoice in Him with greater joy!

   Note that the text contains a possessive pronoun--it says, not, "The
   God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ," but, "of our Lord Jesus
   Christ," who is ours in this particular sense, that He is our federal
   Head, just as the first Adam, even the Adam who headed up the race and
   in whom we stood or fell. Jesus Christ, the second Adam, headed up and
   comprehended within Himself all the chosen--and we who can claim that
   Christ is ours are, for that reason, able to claim all that belongs to
   Christ, for our heavenly Bridegroom endows us with all His possessions.
   "It pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell; and of
   His fullness have we all received, and Grace for Grace." Jesus says,
   "All things that the Father has are Mine," and the Spirit says, "All
   things are Yours" and, therefore, we may rejoice with joy unspeakable
   and full of glory!

   Believers, are you not one with Christ? Then Christ's God is your God,
   Christ's Father is your Father! "You are members of His body, of His
   flesh and of His bones." For this cause did He leave His Father and
   cleave unto the Church, that He might be one flesh with her. All
   Believers are heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus Christ. This is the
   true view of the Father--He is our Father, our God, our Savior's
   Father, our Savior's God! Let us delight ourselves in Him and magnify
   and bless His name!

   II. We come, secondly, to notice THE BLESSING WHICH COMES FROM THE
   FATHER AS VIEWED BY FAITH. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
   heavenly places in Christ." The blessing of God the Father has fallen
   from all eternity upon all who are in Christ, and that in the most
   copious manner, for the one blessing includes "all spiritual
   blessings." This is a very pleasant thing to me because there can be no
   blessing like that of God. "I know," said one of old, "whom He blesses
   is blessed." Satan may curse you; you may already be suffering the
   curse of the Fall; but, if God blesses you, what of all that? Let the
   Lord say, "I have blessed Him," and who can stop it, or who can reverse
   it?

   The blessing of God makes you rich, safe, happy. When He commands the
   blessing, it is life forevermore. Why, it means an infinite blessing,
   the blessing of one Omnipotent to fulfill His Word; Omniscient to carry
   it out in every place; Immutable, so that it never can be reversed;
   eternal, so that it shall stand forever and ever! The blessing of God!
   What must it be? As is God, such is His blessing! Who that dives
   deepest into it, can fully comprehend all its meaning? The

   blessing of God the Father is a true and real blessing--He speaks not a
   lie nor a vanity. Has He said, and shall He not do it? Has He
   commanded, and shall it not stand fast? The blessing of God! How sure,
   how effectual! Oh, to receive it!

   He that has it, though he is in poverty, he is rich! Though he is in
   sorrow, he is consoled! Though in shame, he has honor! Though he lie
   dying, he shall revive--though he were dead, yet shall he live! Such a
   blessing as this is enough to turn a dungeon into a paradise, a Hell
   into Heaven--and if it falls upon the most desponding and despairing,
   it must make their hearts dance for joy!

   I have already told you this is the blessing of the God and Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, and I would remind you that it was the custom of
   fathers to give blessings to their sons. All through the Old Testament
   we find patriarchs, when about to die, calling their children together,
   and pronouncing a blessing upon them. I should have liked to have
   received the blessing of Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob--but what must be
   the blessing of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ as He lays His hand
   upon each one of our poor unworthy heads and says, "Surely, blessing I
   will bless you"? Jacob could not bless the beloved Joseph after the
   fashion in which the Lord blesses His beloved Son and those who are in
   Him! You could not desire a greater blessing than you have at this day,
   for the text says, "He has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
   heavenly places in Christ."

   I would call your attention very particularly to the fact that it is
   here stated that God has already given the blessing. Strictly speaking,
   I suppose it should be read, "God blessed us with all spiritual
   blessings in Christ Jesus" and He continues to do the same. Do you seek
   a blessing from God? He has pronounced it already upon you! Do you
   require anything? You have it--it is given to you in the Covenant of
   Grace! Like when the Lord blessed Abraham, He gave him the land of
   Canaan, so has He given to you all Covenant blessings. You have only to
   ask of the Lord and He will give you to enjoy each blessing according
   as it will be for your good. No good thing will the Lord withhold from
   you! All you now have to do is, by prayer and faith, to grasp and enjoy
   the mercy, for He has said--"For this good thing will I be enquired of
   by the house of Israel to do it for them."

   "Alas!" says one, "I have some blessings, but need many more." This is
   your unbelief, for all spiritual blessings are pronounced upon you.
   Yours are the precious things of Heaven, the dew and the deep, which
   couches beneath. The chief things of the ancient mountains and the
   precious things of the everlasting hills are yours and no part of your
   inheritance shall be torn away from you. The Eternal Father has
   pronounced a boundless blessing upon you as you are in Christ Jesus! He
   has spoken it and He will make it good! When, therefore, you are in
   need, bow the knee and say, "My Father, You have given me this already
   in Christ. Now, therefore, fulfill this word unto Your servant, whereon
   You have caused me to hope." When Jacob rose up from his father's
   bedside, he knew that Isaac's blessing was upon him, and even so the
   benediction of the Father is on every Believer.

   Rise up, you heir of Heaven! Shake yourself from the dust, for the God
   and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has blessed you out of the fullness
   of His heart and you are blessed, indeed! The benediction is as
   comprehensive as your needs--if you lack all things, behold, all things
   are here! Notice the Apostle, here, dwells mainly upon all spiritual
   blessings. Does he, therefore, exclude temporal mercies? No, Brothers
   and Sisters, the greater secures the lesser! Doubtless Paul thought the
   comforts of time and sense to be so secondary compared with spiritual
   blessings in heavenly places that he thought it no wrong to omit them
   or consider them to be included while he lifted up his praise in this
   verse to the Father for His spiritual gifts--for He that gives us the
   gold of spiritual blessings will never deny us the silver of temporal
   blessings!

   He that gives us Heaven will surely give us all that is necessary on
   the road there. Abraham gave gifts to his sons by Keturah and sent them
   away. But to Isaac, he gave the inheritance which is described as, "all
   that he had." Spirituals are the best gifts--the heritage given to the
   first-born. Delight yourselves in spiritual things, for this will mark
   the distinction between you and the carnal man who has his portion in
   this life, whereas the Believer's motto is, "The Lord is my portion."
   Look at the worldling. If his barns are full of corn and his presses
   bursting with new wine, then he is happy, for he cares not for
   spiritual things and his soul's poverty does not trouble him. You and I
   are of another quality--spirituals are our first demand and without
   them we are undone! Our covetousness is for much of the Spirit's gifts
   and Graces-- much love, much faith, much holiness, much communion with
   the Father and the Son! The temporals we can leave with our heavenly
   Father, who knows that we have need of all these things.

   We shall have enough spending money on the road to Glory, for He who
   has guaranteed to bring us there will not starve us on the way!
   Spiritual blessings are such as concern our spirit, which is our nobler
   part. They have a fullness about them which can never dwell in the
   disappointing riches of earth. And they are of a substantial and
   enduring nature which widely separates them from the shadows of mere
   carnal delight. Every mouth may eat of the bread of the body, but truly
   blessed are they that eat bread in the Kingdom of God! Every dog, as he
   runs, may drink of the Nile, but to drink of the river of the Water of
   Life is another matter! Spiritual blessings are for spiritual men, for
   they only can appreciate or even perceive them--they are a prepared
   portion for a prepared people! They range from the first painful sense
   of sin up to the sinless perfection of eternal Glory--and all these
   blessings are pronounced upon the head of each heir of salvation! Shall
   we not praise and magnify the Father for this?

   These are the good and perfect gifts which are from above--and come
   from the unchanging Father of Lights--to Him be glory in the Church
   throughout all ages forever and ever. These blessings are ours,
   personally, for He has blessed us. It is not upon the clouds that the
   blessing falls, but upon individuals. "He loved me and gave Himself for
   me." The Lord has said to His people, "You are the blessed of the Lord
   and your offspring with you." Personal appropriation is the main thing
   that we need; all else lies ready to our hand. Nothing more could be
   provided, nothing more needs to be desired. We need faith to take to
   ourselves the heavenly provision and, for lack of it, we go hungering
   in the midst of plenty!

   Brothers and Sisters, there is no need for this! We do not do well to
   sit with the lepers at Samaria's gate when we have but to awaken
   ourselves and find abundant provision for ourselves and all the King's
   household. Furthermore, note well that our heavenly Father has blessed
   us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. Spiritual
   blessings are heavenly things--they come from Heaven, they lead to
   Heaven--they are of a heavenly nature and are such as are enjoyed in
   Heaven itself! You may read the text either as heavenly places or
   heavenly things, and be equally correct. It is a wonderful thing that,
   even here on earth, the saints enjoy and experience heavenly blessings,
   for a new nature is a heavenly thing--love, joy in God, rest, safety
   and acceptance in the Beloved are all heavenly things. If you read it,
   "places," it is equally true that Heaven and all its mansions are ours
   and we have already taken possession of them in Christ Jesus, our
   Representative and Forerunner!

   When God made the Covenant with Abraham which gave him the land of
   Canaan, Abraham had not yet a foot of land that he could call his
   own--and when he died, he only possessed a cave for burial! But yet, in
   truth, according to the decrees of Heaven, the land of Canaan belonged
   to Abraham and his seed, for had not the Lord said, "Unto your seed
   have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river,
   the river Euphrates?" They had the title-deeds of it, though, for a
   while, the Canaanites held it as tenants upon lease. Now, all the
   spiritual blessings which belong to the heavenly estate at this moment
   are the property of the heirs of Heaven--and God has said to each one
   of them--"Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are,
   northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land
   which you see, to you will I give it."

   The blessings laid up in reserve for those who love God are secured to
   them in the Covenant made with Christ and we wait only for the time
   when the Lord our God shall surely bring us into the purchased
   possession. All things necessary for the heavenly life are already
   secured to the people of God in Christ Jesus, in whom, also, they have
   obtained an inheritance. My Brothers and Sisters, does not this lift
   you up and make you feel yourself to be a different person? You thought
   you had only a little Divine Grace, but all spiritual and heavenly
   blessings are yours! You never dreamed that you could touch Heaven so
   closely--but Heaven has a wide sweep and is to be found not only in
   Glory above, but in Grace be-low--for God has made us kings even now!
   We are already in the kingdom of Heaven and upon heavenly manna we are
   fed at this day! Where Christ is, there is Heaven, and He is in our
   hearts!

   The sun is above, but inasmuch as his light and heat are here, we say
   that we sit in the sun and bask in the sun. Even so, though the
   Presence of Jesus is in Glory, yet we enjoy on earth that sacred
   Revelation of God which is the center and essence of Heaven! Present
   Grace is Heaven begun in the soul--he that dwells in love, dwells in
   God and God in him-- what more can Heaven be? Even now, "He has raised
   us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ
   Jesus." That which God has given to us is not bounded by the narrow
   horizon of this present visible world, but He has given to us all
   heavenly things most richly to enjoy! The boundless glories of eternity
   even now belong to us by virtue of the Father's benediction which He
   has pronounced on us in Christ Jesus!

   Here let me enquire whether you belong to the company upon whom the
   Divine blessing rests. Are you seeking to be saved by your own works?
   Then you are not saved by Grace through Christ Jesus! Are you without
   faith in Christ? Then the heavenly blessing does not belong to you. The
   inheritance is secured to a seed who are, by faith, the children of
   faithful Abraham, born not after the flesh but after the Spirit. Can
   you say, I believe in Jesus Christ and fix my trust upon the promises
   of a faithful God? Then take possession of the Covenant provision and
   be glad in the Lord. We must not fail to note that the plenitude of
   spiritual and heavenly blessings only comes to us in Christ. It is not
   in ourselves that these gifts are vested--we hold them by virtue of our
   union with the Lord Jesus. He is that golden case in which the
   treasures of the Covenant are enclosed and secured.

   He is our Trustee, holding the heritage for us and this is the form of
   our tenure--"joint-heirs with Christ." How precious, then, is our union
   with Him! Of what vital importance is it to be bound up in the bundle
   of life with Him! As without Him we can do nothing, without Him we can
   possess nothing. In Him we have already received a thousand blessings
   in actual experience and in Him there is laid up a boundless supply for
   future enjoyment. At the thought of this let our hearts sing
   hallelujahs! In the spirit of sonship let us reverence the Father of
   our spirits who is also the Father of mercies and the God of all
   consolation. Blessed, forever blessed, be the Lord God of Heaven and
   earth, for His unutterable goodness to His chosen in the Person of His
   dear Son. Let us sing unto Him--

   "O measureless might!

   Ineffable love!

   While angels delight

   To hymn You above,

   The humbler creation,

   Though feeble their lays,

   With true adoration

   Shall lisp to Your praise."

   III. Thirdly and briefly, let us observe THE FIRST OUTFLOW OF THESE
   HEAVENLY BLESSINGS. The fountain of eternal love bursts forth in our
   election--"According as He has chosen us in Him before the foundation
   of the world." Consider these words, one by one. The first is, He has
   chosen--God has a will and a choice in the matter of salvation! Some
   people do not like this doctrine, but they must have it whether they
   like it or not, or else they must reject the Words of Inspiration! Is
   man's will to be deified? Is the whole result of the scheme of
   salvation to depend upon the creature's choice? God forbid! The Father
   has made a choice of some men unto eternal life--these He has given to
   His Son Jesus--all these the Lord Jesus has redeemed with His own blood
   and pledged Himself to bring them to Glory. Has He not said, "All that
   the Father gives Me shall come to Me?"

   God has made a choice, then, and you who are Believers in Christ may
   rest assured that you are the objects of this choice. The Lord Himself
   gave you your faith and brought you into living union with Jesus! Do
   you not bless Him for this? It seems to me that here is something for
   which to praise and bless the Father world without end! Carefully note
   that election shapes everything--the Father has blessed us with all
   spiritual blessings. "According as He has chosen us in Christ." All the
   Grace of earth and the glory of Heaven come to us in accordance with
   the eternal choice. There is not a single gift that comes from the
   blessed hand of the Divine Redeemer but is stamped with the mark of
   God's electing love! We were chosen to each mercy and each mercy was
   appointed for us. If we will not have the Father's election, we cannot
   have His blessing, for His gifts are plainly stated to be according to
   His choice--they come because of the choice and they prove the
   choice--they should, therefore, remind us of our election and call
   forth our sweetest songs. They should make us ask with David "Why all
   this to me?" A man who is elect of God ought to sing the praises of God
   both day and night, for he is chosen to show forth the praises of
   Jehovah!

   The next words are, "He has chosen us." Herein is Grace, indeed! What
   could there be in us that the Lord should choose us? Some of us feel
   ourselves the most unworthy of the unworthy and we can see no trace of
   a reason for our being chosen. So far from being choice men in our own
   esteem, we feel ourselves, by nature, to be the very reverse. But if
   God has chosen us, then let our hearts love Him, our lips extol Him,
   our hands serve Him and our whole lives adore Him--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again With love intense I burn! Chosen of You
   before time began,

   I choose You in return."

   Then we are told He has chosen us in Christ Jesus. He first chose
   Christ as the Head and then looked through Christ upon us and chose us
   to be members of Christ's mystical body. We are, none of us, chosen
   apart from Jesus Christ, but we are chosen in Christ, loved in Christ,
   given to Christ, united to Christ and accepted in Christ. This is a
   blessed way of being chosen, for none can separate us from Christ and,
   consequently, till the Father changes His choice of Christ, He cannot
   and will not reverse His choice of His people! Until Christ ceases to
   be God's elect, the Father can never cast away those who are chosen in
   Christ Jesus!

   Moreover, we are told the time when this choice was made--"Before the
   foundation of the world." This is the earliest conceivable period. When
   this earth was fitted up for man, we know, for the Scriptures inform
   us, but how many ages elapsed before it was furnished for our race, we
   do not know. Yet long before that period the Father had chosen His
   people! The foundation of the world may mean its first creation, when
   it was spoken out of nothing--that must be ages of ages ago, but before
   that the Father chose us! Remember those Words, "who has saved us, and
   called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but
   according to His own purpose and Grace, which was given us in Christ
   Jesus before the world began." Before sun and moon had been created, or
   any of the visible things were formed, God had set His heart upon His
   people in Christ and ordained them to eternal life in Him!

   God's love is no novelty. His choice is no sudden act. Blessed
   doctrine! I know of none, which, if rightly considered, has a greater
   tendency to draw out the intense affection and reverent admiration of
   human hearts. Did the Lord of Glory choose me from before the
   foundation of the world? Then, by His Grace, I choose Him with all my
   heart to be my Lord, my All! Did He love me from of old? Then, by His
   Grace, I will love Him with all my soul and strength-- and pray that my
   heart may be enlarged to love Him more! This is mentioned here in order
   that you may bless the Father--let there now flow from your hearts a
   mighty stream of gratitude which shall cover your whole being and bear
   your lives along in the channel of obedience. Come, my Heart, bless the
   Father at this moment and never cease from His praise while life and
   being last, or immortality endures!

   IV. Fourthly and lastly, our text reminds us of another cause for
   praise, namely, the DESIGNED RESULT OF ALL THIS BLESSING--"That we
   should be holy and without blame before Him in love." It is God's
   eternal design that His people should be holy--and He has pursued this
   purpose at infinite cost. This is the design of all the blessings which
   the Father has given us in Christ. All these favors are a call to us to
   be holy--and each one has a tendency to promote our sanctification.
   When you grow in Grace, faith, hope, joy--all that growth is towards
   holiness. Always think of that and bless God for your Graces by
   manifesting their influence in your conduct. Bless God for increased
   knowledge and deepened experience, for He has designed, by these, to
   sanctify you more fully to Himself!

   There is something practical in every gift that comes from the Father's
   hands and you should pray to Him that you may, by each one, conquer
   sin, advance in virtue and perfect holiness in His fear. The ultimate
   end of election is the praise of the glory of Divine Grace, but the
   immediate and intermediate end is the personal sanctification of the
   chosen. We are chosen unto holiness! The Father chose us to Himself
   that we might be without blame before Him in love. He would have us
   blameless, so that no man can justly find fault with us. He would have
   us harmless, so that our lives may injure none but bless all. Holiness
   is, however, more than this. We are called to be made whole by being
   healed of the disease of sin and by having all our broken powers
   reunited into one harmonious whole. This restored nature is to be
   wholly consecrated to God and thus to become holy before God. Oh that
   we may realize God's objective in election even at this time and so
   make our calling and election sure! Let us mightily strive after this
   and never rest till we have it.

   But notice where and what kind of holiness this is--holy and blameless
   before Him. I have met with several people who say they are perfectly
   holy, but I believe they are under a delusion! And I feel sure that
   those who watch them will not long think them perfect. This perfection
   of theirs is according to their own vain ideas and conceited
   notions--not according to the judgment of the Lord who searches the
   heart! Perfection in the flesh is a lie! I believe it to be one of the
   grossest falsehoods ever palmed on foolish minds! It would be something
   to be holy and blameless before the devil as Job was. It would be
   something to be perfect before the eyes of men who are so ready to
   criticize us--but to be blameless before Him who reads our thoughts and
   sees our every failure in a moment--this is an attainment of a far
   higher order!

   Oh, to be spotless and faultless! Let us bless God that He is aiming,
   every day, to make us holy and blameless before Himself! And He will do
   it, for His purpose never fails. He has worked it, in a large measure,
   in all His saints, and He will

   perfect that which He has begun! This is the goal towards which we are
   running, that we may attain to the complete likeness of Christ.
   Courage, Brothers and Sisters, it is yet beyond us, but He that has
   begun the good work in us will perform it unto the day of Christ! We
   shall, one day, be without fault before the Throne of God!

   To conclude, we are to be holy and blameless before Him in love. Love
   is the anointing oil which is to be poured on all the Lord's
   priests--when He has robed them in their spotless garments they shall
   partake of the unction of love. When He has delivered us from all sin,
   one choice thing shall be seen in us, and that is love, abounding love.
   "God is Love; and He that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in
   Him." As we love, we live unto God. Perfect life will be perfect love.
   Judge of your sanctification by this--Do you grow in love to God? Do
   you also increase in love to the Brethren? If your heart grows hard
   with the proud notion that you are somebody by reason of your high
   attainments, and that the poor little saints around you are unworthy,
   even, to unloose the laces of your shoes, you are not growing in
   holiness!

   Do you love poor sinners? For if your heart does not grow tender, you
   are not growing holy. What a blessed thing it would be to be saturated
   with love! They said of Basil, that he was a pillar of fire because of
   his zeal. I wish it could be said of us that we were flames of fire
   because of our love. Oh, to love our neighbor as ourselves, thinking no
   evil! "Oh," says one, "we would be taken advantage of!" That would be
   no harm compared with being hardened by selfishness. "But we should be
   ill-treated and defrauded." Suppose we were? It would be better than
   being miserly and cruel. The worst of ills is hate--the best of
   blessings is love. When we become incapable of selfishness and get
   right away from unkindness of heart and uncharitableness of thought,
   Christ will be living in us and we in Him--and then we shall be
   fulfilling the purpose of electing love and the design of the
   innumerable spiritual blessings which are already given us in Christ
   Jesus.

   To this let us all aspire. Let brotherly love continue. Let us love
   each other more than we have ever done and join our hands anew in a
   firm league of concord. Let us love the universal Church of Christ. Let
   our hearts burn with ardent affection towards the perishing multitudes
   of men, that we may bring them to put their whole trust in Jesus and
   live! May the Father deal with us according to His riches in glory by
   Christ Jesus, and to Father, Son and Holy Spirit be glory forever and
   ever. Amen.

Bankrupt Debtors Discharged

   (No. 1739)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 16, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both." Luke
   7:42.

   THE two debtors differed very considerably in the amounts which they
   owed--the one was in arrears 500 pence and the other fifty. There are
   differences in the guilt of sins and in the degrees of men's
   criminality. It would be a very unfair and unrighteous thing to say
   that all men are exactly alike in the extent of their transgression.
   Some are honest and upright, kind and generous, even though they are
   but natural men--while others appear to be of a malicious, envious,
   selfish disposition--and rush into evil, sinning, as it were, with both
   hands greedily. The man who is moral, sober and industrious is only a
   fifty-pence debtor as compared with the vicious, drunken blasphemer
   whose debt is written at 500 pence.

   Our Savior recognizes the distinction because it exists and cannot
   justly be overlooked. There are distinctions among unconverted men,
   very great distinctions. One of them, a young man, came to Jesus, and
   he had so many fine traits in his character that the Lord, looking upon
   him, loved him. But when the Pharisees gathered about Him, our Lord
   looked round upon them with indignation! The soil, which was none of it
   yet sown with the good Seed, yet varied greatly, and some of it was
   honest and good ground before the power of the Holy Spirit came to it.
   Sinners differ from each other.

   But I call your particular notice to the fact that though there was one
   point of difference in the two debtors, there were three points of
   similarity, for they were both debtors--and so all men have sinned, be
   it little or be it much! And, secondly, they were both alike, bankrupt,
   neither of them could meet his debt. The man who owed 50 pence could no
   more pay than he who owed 500 pence, so that they were both insolvent
   debtors. But what a mercy it is that they were alike in a third point,
   for, "when they had nothing to pay," their creditor, "frankly forgave
   them both"! Oh, my dear Hearers, we are all alike in the first two
   things! Oh that we might be, all of us, alike in this last point, that
   the Lord our God may grant to every one of us the free remission of
   sins according to the riches of His Grace through Christ Jesus!

   Why should it not be so, since Jesus is exalted on high to give
   repentance and remission of sins? There is forgiveness with God! He
   delights in mercy! He can cast all our sins into the depths of the sea
   that they may not be mentioned against us any more forever! While we
   are compelled to go together two-thirds of the road, what a pity it
   would be that we should be divided in the third portion of it! That
   first two-thirds of the road is a very muddy, baggy piece of way and we
   sorrowfully wade along it in company--all in debt and all of us unable
   to pay!

   But that next part of the road is well-made, smooth and good for
   travelers--and it leads into the gardens of happiness! Oh that we may
   traverse it and find the free pardon of God! Oh for free remission for
   all of us without exception! Why not? May God send it of His great
   mercy at this good hour! To that end I wish to speak with you, dear
   Friends, for I believe that the Lord Jesus has something to say to you,
   and I pray that your hearts may be open to Him, crying gladly, "Master,
   say on!"

   Our first point for consideration is their bankruptcy--"they had
   nothing to pay." The second is their free discharge--"He frankly
   forgave them both." And the third is the connection between these two
   things, for that little word, "when," marks the connection--"when they
   had nothing to pay, He frankly forgave them both."

   I. First, let us think of THEIR BANKRUPTCY. This was their condition.
   They were unquestionably in debt. If they could have disputed the
   creditor's claim, no doubt they would have done so. If they could have
   pleaded that they were never indebted, or that they had already paid,
   no doubt they would have been glad to have done so. But they could not
   raise a question--their debt could not be denied. Another fact was also
   clear to them, namely, that they had nothing to pay with. No doubt they
   had made a diligent search. They had turned out their pockets, their
   cash boxes, their lockers-- and they had found nothing--they had looked
   for their household goods, but these had vanished, piece by piece.

   They had nothing at home or abroad that they could dispose of. Things
   had come to such a pass with them that they had neither stock nor
   money, nor anything in prospect which they could draw upon--they were
   brought to the last extremity--reduced to absolute beggary. Meanwhile,
   their great creditor was pressing them for settlement. That idea lies
   in the heart of the text. The creditor had evidently brought his
   overdue accounts and had said to them, "These claims must be met. There
   must be an end to this state of affairs; your accounts must be
   discharged." They were brought to this condition--they must confess the
   debt and they must also humbly acknowledge that they had nothing to pay
   it with-- the time for payment had come and it found them without a
   penny. No condition could be more wretched.

   So far I have stated the parable and it most truly sets forth the
   condition of every man who has not come to Jesus Christ and so received
   the frank forgiveness of his sins. Upon this we will enlarge. We are
   all, by nature and by practice, plunged in debt--and this is the way in
   which we came to be so--hear it and mark it well! As God's creatures
   we, from the very first, owed to Him the debt of obedience. We were
   bound to obey our Maker! It is He that made us, not we, ourselves, and
   we were, therefore, bound reverently to recognize our Creator,
   affectionately to worship Him and dutifully to serve Him. This is an
   obligation so natural and reasonable that nobody can dispute it!

   If you are the creatures of God, there is nothing more right than that
   you should honor Him. If you daily receive the breath in your nostrils
   and the food that you eat from Him, then you are bound to Him by the
   ties of gratitude and should do His will. But, dear Friends, we have
   not done His will! We have left undone the things we ought to have done
   and we have done the things we ought not to have done--and so we have
   come, in a second sense, into His debt! We now stand liable to penalty,
   yes, we are already condemned! There is due from us to God, in
   vindication of His broken Law, both suffering and death--and in the
   Word of God we find that the righteous penalty for sin is something
   utterly overwhelming! "Fear Him," says Christ, "who is able to destroy
   both soul and body in Hell."

   Yes, I say unto you, fear Him! Very terrible are the metaphors and
   symbols by which the Holy Spirit sets forth the misery of a soul upon
   which the Lord pours forth His fiery indignation! The pain of loss and
   pain of woe which sin, at last, brings upon guilty men are
   inconceivable--they are called "the terrors of the Lord." There is not
   one among us, apart from the Lord Jesus Christ, but owes to God's Law a
   debt which eternity cannot fully meet, even though it is crowded with
   agonizing regrets! A life of forgetfulness of God and breaking of His
   Law must be recompensed by a future life of punishment! That is where
   we stand--can any man be at rest while this is his condition before
   God? We are debt-ors--the debt is overwhelming--it brings with it
   consequences tremendous to the last degree! And we are utterly unable
   to make any amends for this.

   If He should meet with us and call us to account, we cannot repay Him
   one pence of a thousand. We cannot excuse ourselves and we cannot, by
   any possibility, render to Him His righteous due. If any think they
   can, let me remind them of this, that to cancel the debt which we owe
   to God we must pay it all! God demands, righteously demands from us the
   keeping of His entire Law. He tells us that he that is guilty in one
   point is guilty in all points--for God's Law is like a fair vase of
   alabaster, lovely in its entireness--but if it is chipped in any part,
   it may not be presented in His court. The least flaw in it mars its
   perfection and destroys its value. A perfect obedience to a perfect Law
   is that which is required by the justice of the Most High--and is there
   any one of us who can render it, or who can attempt to pay the penalty
   due for not rendering it?

   Our inability to obey comes of our own fault and is part of our crime.
   Ah me! May none of us ever have to bear the penalty! To be banished
   from His Presence and from the glory of His power! To be cast away from
   all hope and light and joy forever! Why, there are those at this moment
   in the abyss of woe who have for thousands of years endured the heavy
   hand of justice and yet their debt remains unpaid, even now, for they
   have yet to appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ at the Last Day
   and answer for their transgressions! It is certain that to meet the
   whole payment is impossible! Neither in the form of obedience, nor in
   the form of penalty may we ever hope to pay it--it would be all in vain
   to make the attempt.

   Remember, too, that if there is anything that we can do for God in the
   way of obedience, it is already due to Him. All that I can do, if I
   love God with all my heart and soul and strength, and my neighbor as
   myself, throughout the rest of my life, is already due to God--I shall
   but be discharging new duties as they occur--how will this affect old
   disobediences? In what way can I cleanse myself from my former stains
   by the resolve that I will not be defiled with fresh ones? If

   your hands are blood red, can you make them clean by the mere
   resolution that you will not plunge them, again, into the dye? You know
   it is not so--past sin cannot be removed by future carefulness--

   "Could my tears forever flow,

   Could my zeal, no respite know.

   All for sin could not atone,

   Christ must save, and Christ alone." We have nothing with which to meet
   our liabilities because everything that we can possibly earn or obtain
   in the future is already due--so we have nothing left unmortgaged,
   nothing of our own.

   Moreover, the debt is immense and incalculable! Fifty pence is but a
   poor representation of what the most righteous person owes. Five
   hundred pence is but an insignificant sum compared with the
   transgressions of the greater offenders. Oh, Friends, when I think of
   my life, it seems to be like the sea, made up of innumerable waves of
   sin; or like the seashore, constituted of sands that cannot be weighed
   nor counted! My faults are utterly innumerable and each one deserving
   eternal death! Our sins, our heavy sins, sins against light and
   knowledge; our foul sins, our repeated sins, our aggravated sins, our
   sins against our parents, our sins against all our relationships, our
   sins against our God, our sins with the body, our sins with the mind,
   our sins of forgetfulness, our sins of thought, our sins of
   imagination--who can make them right? Who knows the number of his
   trespasses?

   Now, to think that we can ever meet such a debt is, indeed, to bolster
   up ourselves with a notion that is utterly absurd--we have nothing with
   which to pay! Moreover, I go a little further. Even if these sins were
   somewhat within reach to pay back--if we were not indebted for the
   future as to all we can do, yet what is there that we can do? Does not
   Paul say of himself that he was not sufficient to think anything of
   himself? Did not the Lord tell His Israel of old, "From Me is your
   fruit found"? Did not Jesus say to His disciples and even to His
   Apostles, "Without Me you can do nothing"? Then, O bankrupt Sinner,
   what is there good that you can do? You must, first of all, get the
   good work from God before you can perform it!

   It is true you are to "work out your own salvation with fear and
   trembling," but what must come first? Read the passage, "For it is God
   which works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure." If the
   Lord does not work salvation in us, we cannot work it out! Every good
   thing in man is the work of God, the produce of the Spirit of God
   operating upon the heart and mind. Men are dead in trespasses and sins;
   dead to all that is holy and acceptable with God and life, itself, is a
   gift. What, then, can sinners do? Their bankruptcy is utter and
   entire--and this is true of every man that is still out of Christ--he
   is a debtor and he has nothing to pay. This being the case, I want to
   spend a minute in noticing certain temptations to which all bankrupt
   sinners are subject.

   One of these is to try and forget their spiritual estate altogether.
   Some of you here, today, have never given serious thought to your souls
   and to your condition before God. It is an unpleasant subject. You
   suspect that it would be still more unpleasant if you looked into it.
   You want amusement, something to while away the time because you do not
   care to examine the state of your heart before God. Solomon exhorts the
   diligent man to know the state of his flocks and look well to his
   herds. But he that is careless and idle would rather leave such
   enquiries and let things go as they please. The man who is going
   backward in business has no pleasure in taking stock. "Oh," he says,
   "don't bring me my books; I shall not sleep at night if I look into
   them." He knows that he is sinking lower and lower and will soon be a
   ruined man--and the only way in which he can endure his life is to
   drive dull care away by drink, or company, or idle amusement.

   He labors to beguile the hours that he may conceal from himself his
   true condition. But what a fool he is! Would it not be infinitely wiser
   if he would look things in the face and have it out and know his actual
   state? Such ignorance as he chooses is not bliss to a right-hearted
   man, but suspense and misery. I have often prayed this prayer--"Lord,
   let me know the very worst of my case," for I do not wish to entertain
   a hope that will, at last, deceive me. Disappointment will be bitter in
   proportion as false hope was sweet. This is the temptation of the
   bankrupt soul--to shut its eyes to the unwelcome Truths of God. The
   ostrich is fabled, when hunted, to bury its head in the san, and
   conceive that the hunter is gone when he is no longer seen. But he is
   not gone--the unseen danger is quite as real as if it stared us in the
   face. However forgetful you may be, God does not forget your sins!

   Another temptation to a man in this condition is to make as good a show
   as he can. A man who is very near bankruptcy is often noticed for the
   dash he cuts. What a horse he drives as he comes up to business! What
   fashionable parties he gives! Just so. He desires to keep up his credit
   as long as he can. He is going to make a smash of it, by-and-by, but
   for a

   season he assumes the airs of my lord and everybody near him imagines
   that he has money enough and to spare! The governor of a besieged city
   threw loaves of bread over the wall to the besiegers, to make them
   believe that the citizens had such large supplies that they could
   afford to throw them away--yet they were starving all the while! There
   are some men of like manners--they have nothing that they can offer to
   God, but they exhibit a glittering self-righteousness! Oh, they have
   been so good, such superior people, so praiseworthy from their youth
   up!

   They never did anything much amiss--there may be a little speck here
   and there upon their garments--but that will brush off when it is dry.
   They make a fair show in the flesh with morality and formality and a
   smattering of generosity. Besides, they profess to be religious--they
   attend worship services and pay their quota of the expenses. Who could
   find any fault with such good people? Just so, this profession is the
   fine horse and trap with which they, too, are cutting a dash just
   before going through the courts! There is nothing at all in you and
   there never was, if you are as nature has made you--why, then, do you
   try to brazen it out and make yourself to seem something when you are
   nothing? You may, by this means, deceive yourself, but certainly you
   will not deceive God!

   Another temptation which lurks in the way of a bankrupt sinner is that
   of making promises of what he will do. Men in debt are generally very
   promising men--they will pay next week for certain, but when next week
   comes, they meant the next week further on--and then payment shall be
   doubly certain! Yet they put in no appearance, even then, or, if they
   do, they give an IOU. Is not that a precious document? Is it not as
   good as the money itself? They evidently think so, for they feel quite
   as easy as if they had really paid the debt! But when the IOU falls
   due, what then? It falls, never to rise again! Ah me, an IOU is often
   just a lie with a stamp on it! So will debtors go on as long as they
   can. This is what every sinner does before he becomes cleared by the
   Sovereign Grace of God.

   He cries, "I mean to do better." Never mind. Tell us no more what you
   mean to do, but do it! To promise and vow so falsely is only adding to
   your sins! "Oh! But you know I do not intend to go on in this way
   always! It is a long lane that has no turning. I shall pull up short,
   one of these days, and then you will see." What shall we see? What we
   shall see will not be much! We shall see the dew of promise disappear
   and the morning cloud of resolution pass away. Dear Sir, you cannot
   raise our hopes. Neither God nor man will trust you--you have promised
   these 20 years and in no one year have you made a real move in the
   right direction! You have not lied unto men, only, but unto God--and
   how will you answer for it? Know you not that every promise that you
   make to God which you do not keep is a great addition to your
   transgressions and helps to fill up the measure of your iniquities?
   Give up the way of lying, I pray you!

   Another temptation is always to ask for more time--as if this was all
   that was needed. When the debtor, in another parable, was arrested, he
   said to his creditor, "Have patience with me, and I will pay you all."
   We cannot pay any of our debt, today, and dote upon tomorrow. Yes, it
   does seem such a relief to get a little longer time--somehow a vague
   shadowy hope seems to pervade the months to come. The sinner cries, "Go
   your way this time! When I have a convenient season, I will call for
   you." It is not convenient just now, but wait a little bit--a suitable
   hour will come. With this temptation, Satan has destroyed multitudes of
   men, tempting them to ask for more time, instead of coming up to the
   mark at once and asking for immediate pardon.

   What are the fabled virtues of tomorrow? Why do men dote upon the
   unknown future? To an immediate decision I would press you at this
   moment and may God, by His Divine Spirit, deliver you as a bird from
   the hand of the fowler, that you may no longer procrastinate and waste
   your life in disobedient delay! This being the temptation, let me hint
   to those of you who are bankrupt, what your wisdom is. It is your
   wisdom to face the business of your soul. Your soul-matters are the
   most important things you will ever have on hand, for when your wealth
   must be left and your estate shall see you no more--and when your body
   is dead--your soul will still be living in eternal happiness or endless
   woe! Therefore, do not neglect your state in reference to God. It is
   the most important matter! Give it the first place.

   Settle this business before you attend to anything else. Take care that
   you face it like an honest man and not as one who makes the best of a
   bad story! It may be bad, yet the best thing you can do is to go right
   through with it in truth and soberness before the Lord. Hope lies that
   way. Do not let your danger be concealed like a thief who hides in the
   good man's pantry till the hour to rob his house. Suffer not the sparks
   to smolder where they may consume your all! Quench the fire before you
   sleep! When you face the matter, be very true and sincere with yourself
   and with God because you are not dealing with creditors who may be
   cheated, but you are dealing with GOD who knows the secret thoughts and
   intents of your heart.

   Before God nothing but truth can stand! The painted hypocrite is spied
   out immediately. The Lord takes off all masks and men stand before Him
   as they really are--not as they would seem to be--so be true with
   yourself! Do not take your pen and write down 50 if you owe 100, but
   put the fair number down. Tricks and falsehoods had better be put away,
   once and for all, when you deal with God. One thing more--it will be
   your wisdom to give up all attempts to pay--you have nothing to pay
   with! Do not delude yourself into the idea that you will pay, one day,
   for you never will. Do not make the slightest attempt at paying, for
   you cannot do it! But take quite another course--plead absolute poverty
   and appeal to mercy! Say, "Lord, I have nothing, I am nothing, I can do
   nothing. I must throw myself upon Your

   Grace."

   Of this Grace I am now going to speak. May I so speak as to encourage
   you who are bankrupts to come to the Lord, that He may frankly forgive
   you all.

   II. Our second head is THEIR FREE DISCHARGE. "He frankly forgave them
   both." What a blessing they obtained by facing the matter! These two
   poor debtors, when they went into the office, were trembling from head
   to foot, for they had nothing with which to pay and were deeply
   involved. But look! They come out with light hearts, for the debt is
   all disposed of; the bills are receipted; the records are destroyed!
   Even thus the Lord has blotted out the handwriting that was against us
   and has taken it out of the way, nailing it to His Cross. In this free
   discharge I admire, first of all, the goodness of the great Creditor.
   What a gracious heart He had! What kindness He showed! He said, "Poor
   souls, you can never repay Me, but you need not be cast down because of
   it, for I freely cancel your debts." Oh, the goodness of it! Oh, the
   largeness of the heart of God!

   I was reading of Caesar the other day. He had been at fierce war with
   Pompey and, at last, he conquered him. And when he conquered him, he
   found among the spoil Pompey's private cabinet in which were contained
   letters from the various noblemen and senators of Rome who had sided
   with him. In many a letter there was fatal evidence against the most
   eminent Romans. But what did Caesar do? He destroyed every document! He
   would have no knowledge of his enemies, for he freely forgave them and
   wished to know no more. In this, Caesar proved that he was fit to
   govern the nation. But look at the splendor of God when He puts all our
   sins into one cabinet and then destroys the whole! If the sins of His
   people are sought for, they cannot, now, be found! He will never
   mention them against us any more. Oh, the goodness of the infinite God,
   whose mercy endures forever! Bow before that goodness with joy!

   But, then, observe the freeness of it--"He frankly forgave them both."
   They did not stand there and say, "Oh, good Sir, we cannot pay," and
   plead and beg, as for their lives. But he freely said to them, "You
   cannot pay, but I can forgive. You ought never to have got into my debt
   and you ought not to have broken your promises to me; but behold, I
   make an end of all this weary business--I freely blot out all your
   obligations!" Did not this open a fountain in their eyes? Did they not
   hasten home to their wives and children and tell them that they were
   out of debt, for the beloved creditor had forgiven it all most freely?

   This is a fair picture of the Grace of God! When a poor bankrupt sinner
   comes to Him, He says, "I forgive you freely--your offense is all gone.
   I do not want you to earn a pardon by your tears, prayers and anguish
   of soul. You have not to make Me merciful, for I am already merciful
   and My dear Son, Jesus Christ, has made such a propitiation that I can
   be just and yet can forgive you all this debt. Therefore, go in peace."
   Furthermore, this debt was fully discharged. The creditor did not say,
   "Come, my good fellow, I will take 50 percent off the account if you
   find the remainder." As they had nothing with which to pay, they would
   not have been a bit the better if he had reduced them 90 percent! If he
   had reduced the debts by half, the one would have owed 250 and the
   other 25, but their cases would have been hopeless, since they had not
   a farthing of their own.

   Now the Lord, when He blots out His people's sin, leaves no trace of it
   remaining. My own persuasion is that when our Lord Jesus died upon the
   Cross, He made an end of all the sins of all His people and made full
   and effectual atonement for the whole of those who shall believe in
   Him. I can sing with all my heart--

   "Here's pardon for transgressions past, It matters not how black their
   cast! And, Omy Soul, with wonder, view, For sins to come, here's
   pardon, too!" All the sin of Believers has been, once and for all,
   carried into the wilderness of oblivion by our great Scapegoat and none
   shall ever find a sin with which to condemn one soul of the chosen
   band. There is no debt left against a Believer--no, not

   one single pennyworth of debt remains upon the score! Does not the
   Spirit of God Himself ask the question, "Who shall lay anything to the
   charge of God's elect? "The Lord has frankly forgiven their debt and He
   has not done so in part, but as a whole.

   As for our sins, "the depths have covered them." "There is not one of
   them left." Hallelujah! Observe that it was a very effectual
   forgiveness, too. The only person that can forgive a debt is he to whom
   the debt is due. Only God can forgive sin, seeing it is a debt to Him.
   What think you of those who are said to be able to forgive you for a
   shilling? Why, I say that to pay them their fee would be eleven-penny,
   three farthings and another farthing thrown away! When you have got
   their forgiveness what is the good of it? Suppose I were to forgive you
   for injuries done by you to the Queen--of what value would my
   forgiveness be? He against whom I have transgressed is the only one
   that can pronounce my pardon! And if he absolves me, how effectual is
   the sentence!

   When the creditor said, "I freely forgive you both," why, the deed was
   done! His lips had power! He had finished the debt by his word. And so
   when the Lord Jesus Christ is looked unto by the eye of faith, there
   comes a voice from His dear wounds which cries to the poor trembling
   bankrupt sinner, "Your sins, which are many, are all forgiven. I have
   blotted out your sins like a cloud, and like a thick cloud your
   iniquities." What an effectual pardon it is! How it charms the heart
   and lulls every fear to rest! He frankly, He fully, He freely, He
   effectually forgives! And I believe that when this is done, I may add
   another adjective--it is an eternal discharge!

   That creditor could never summon those debtors again for debts which he
   had remitted. He could never think of such a thing with any show
   ofjustice. He had frankly forgiven them and they were forgiven. God
   does not play fast and loose with His creatures--forgive them and then
   punish them. I never shall believe in God's loving a man, today, and
   casting Him away tomorrow! The gifts and calling of God are without
   repentance on His part. Justification is not an act which can be
   reversed and followed with damnation. No! No! "Whom He justified, them
   He also glorified."--

   "If sin is pardoned I'm secure, Death has no sting beside The Law ga ve
   sin its damning power, But Christ, my Ransom, died."

   By His death, our Redeemer effectually swept away sin once and for all,
   and He removed all the curse of the Law. In the offering of bullocks
   and lambs there was a continual remembrance made of sin, for the blood
   of bulls and of goats could not take away sin. But the Apostle writes,
   "This Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat
   down by the right hand of God," because His work was effectually and
   eternally done.

   Only one more remark on this point--this frank forgiveness applied to
   both the debtors--"He frankly forgave them both." The man that owed
   only 50 pence needed a free discharge as truly as the debtor who owed
   500, for though he was not so deep in the mire, yet he was as truly in
   the slough. If a man was lying in prison for debt, as men used to do
   under our old laws, if he only owed 50 pounds, he was shut within walls
   just as closely as the greater debtor who owed 50,000--and he could no
   more get out without the payment or forgiveness of his smaller
   liability than the bigger debtor could. A bird held by a string is as
   much a prisoner as a bull that is tied by a rope!

   Now, you good people who have always tried to do your duty and are
   numbered with the 50-pence debtors, you must confess that you have
   become somewhat indebted to God by committing a measure of sins. Take
   note that you cannot be saved except by the free forgiveness of God
   through the precious blood of Christ. The 50-pence debtor must obtain
   his discharge by Grace alone. It is also a most blessed thing to
   perceive that he forgave the 500-pence debtor with equal freeness.
   Perhaps I have some here, men and women, who have never made any
   pretense of being good--who from their childhood have gone from bad to
   worse. There is a possibility of free and instantaneous forgiveness for
   you at this moment. You that are over head and ears in debt to God can
   be freely forgiven by the same Lord who forgives the smaller debtors!

   When a man has his pen in his hand and is writing receipts, it takes
   him no more trouble to write a receipt for 500 pounds than it does for
   a bill of 50--the same signature will suffice! And when the Lord has
   the pen of His Spirit in His hand and He is about to write upon a
   conscience the peace which comes of reconciliation, He can write upon
   one as well as upon another. You with a little bill, bring it here,
   that infinite Grace may write upon it, "CANCELLED!" You with a more
   weighty account, come and place it near that gracious right hand, for
   though your bill is long and heavy, the hand

   of Infinite Love can write, "CANCELLED," in a moment! My joy overflows
   at having such a Gospel to preach to you-- whatever your guilt, my
   gracious God is ready to forgive you for Jesus' sake, because He
   delights in mercy!

   III. I now beg your very special attention to the last point which
   is--THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS

   BANKRUPTCY AND THIS FREE DISCHARGE. It is said, "When they had nothing
   to pay, he frankly forgave them both." There is a time when pardon
   comes and that time is when self-sufficiency goes! If any person in
   this place has, in his own conscience, come to this point--that he
   feels he has nothing to pay--he has come to the point at which God is
   ready to forgive him! He that will acknowledge his debt and confess his
   own incapacity to meet it, shall find that God frankly blots it out!
   The Lord will never forgive us until we are brought to the starvation
   of pride and the death of boasting. A sense of spiritual bankruptcy
   shows that a man has become thoughtful--and this is essential to
   salvation.

   How can we believe a thoughtless person to be a saved man? If we so
   think about our state as to mourn our sin and feel its wickedness--and
   if we have made a close search into our hearts and lives and find that
   we have no merit and no might--then we are prepared in all
   thoughtfulness to say, "In the Lord I have righteousness and strength."
   Must there not be serious thought before we can hope for mercy? Would
   you have God save us while we are asleep, while we are giddy,
   frivolous, trifling and without concern about our sin? Surely that
   would be giving a premium to folly! God acts not so. He will have us
   know the seriousness of our danger, otherwise we would treat the whole
   matter with lightness and miss the moral effect of pardon--and He would
   be robbed of His Glory.

   Next, when we come to feel our bankruptcy, we then make an honest
   confession. And to that confession a promise is given--"He that
   confesses his sin shall find mercy." The two debtors had acknowledged
   their debts and they had also openly confessed, though it must have
   gone against the grain a bit, that they could not pay. They humbled
   themselves before their creditor and then he said, "I frankly forgive
   you." If one of these debtors had bounced and bragged, "Oh, we can
   pay," in all probability he would have been sent to prison. As for you,
   poor Trembler, I do not know where you are this morning, but here is
   comfort for you--when you go to God in your chamber and cry, "Lord,
   have mercy upon me, for I am guilty, and I cannot justify myself before
   You, nor offer any excuse to You"--then it is that He will say, "Be of
   good cheer! I have put away your sin; you shall not die."

   When you have nothing to pay and confess your insolvency, the debt
   shall be wiped out. When you are brought to your worst, you shall see
   the Lord at His best! It is in their utter destitution that men value a
   discharge. If God were to give His mercy to every man at once, without
   his ever having had any sense of sin at all, why, men would count it
   cheap and think nothing of it! "God is merciful," is a common saying
   everywhere. And it is such a bit of valueless talk with them that they
   let it roll glibly out as if it were no matter. They do not worship Him
   for His mercy or serve Him for His Grace. They say, "Oh, God is
   merciful," and then they go on to sin worse than ever! The idea has no
   effect upon their hearts or lives. They have no esteem for that mercy
   of which they speak so freely. So the Lord takes care that the sinner
   shall know his need of mercy by feeling the pinch of conscience and the
   terror of the Law.

   If I may so speak, He dispatches the sheriff and makes the soul suffer
   stress by convincing the man of sin, of righteousness and of judgment.
   The Lord puts the thought of execution into the heart and then it is,
   when the poor creature cries, "I have nothing to pay with," that free
   discharge is given by the Lord and heartily prized by him to whom it
   comes! When our account is long and heavy, it is a blessed thing to see
   the Lord write, "Cancelled," and to behold the whole mountain of debt
   swallowed up in the sea of love! Christ is precious when sin is bitter.
   Is it not wise on God's part that the canceling of the debt shall come
   just when we have nothing to pay and, therefore, are prepared to prize
   a free forgiveness? Under conviction, a poor soul sees the reality of
   sin and of pardon!

   My dear Hearer, you will never believe in the reality of forgiveness
   till you have felt the reality of sin! I remember when I felt the
   burden of sin and though, but a child, my heart failed me for anguish
   and I was brought very low. Sin was no bugbear to scare me--it was a
   grim reality--as a lion, it tore me in pieces. And now, today, I know
   the reality of pardon--it is no fancy, no dream--for my inmost soul
   feels its power! I know that my sins are forgiven and I rejoice because
   of that belief, but I should never have known the real truth of this
   happy condition if I had not felt the oppressive load of sin upon the
   conscience. I could not afford to play at conversion, for sin was an
   awful fact in my soul. Our heavenly Father does not wish us to use
   lightness in a matter concerning which Jesus shed His blood--and so He
   brings us into trouble of soul--and afterwards into a vivid realization
   of Free Grace.

   He lets the whip fall on our shoulders until we bleed--and this makes
   us weary of the slavery of sin. He sets Conscience and the Law upon
   us--and these two thrust us into the inner dungeon and make our feet
   fast in the stocks. All this prepares us for the delivering power which
   shakes the prison walls and loosens our bonds--and for the tender love
   which washes our stripes and sets meat before us! I believe that the
   Lord will give us our freedom when we have got to our last farthing and
   not till then, because only then do we look to the Lord Jesus Christ.
   Ah, my dear Friends, as long as we have anything else to look to, we
   will never look to Christ! That blessed port into which no ship did
   ever run in a storm without finding a sure haven is shunned by all your
   gallant vessels--they would rather put into any port along the coast of
   self-deceit than make for the harbor which is marked out by the two
   lighthouses of Free Grace and dying love!

   As long as a man can scrape the meal barrel and find a little in it; as
   long as he can hold up the oil cruse and it drips, if it only yields a
   drop in a week, he will never come to Christ for heavenly provision! As
   long as he has one rusty counterfeit farthing hidden away in the corner
   of his till, the sinner will never accept the riches of redeeming love!
   But when it is all up over him--when he has nothing in the parlor,
   nothing in the kitchen, nothing in the cellar--when there is neither
   stick nor stock left, then he prizes Jesus and His salvation! We break
   to make! We are emptied to be filled! When we cannot give, God can
   forgive! If any of you have any goodness of your own, you will perish
   forever! If you have anything you can trust to of your own, you will be
   lost as sure as you are living men and women!

   But if you are reduced to sore extremity and God's fierce wrath seems
   to burn against you--then, not only may you have mercy, but mercy is
   yours already!--

   "'Tis perfect po verty alone

   That sets the soul at large.

   While we can call one mite our own

   We get no full discharge.

   But let our debts be what they may,

   However great or small,

   As soon as we have naught to pay

   Our Lord forgives us all."

   Blessed are you poor, for you shall be rich! Blessed are you hungry,
   for you shall be fed! Blessed are you that are empty, for you shall be
   filled! But woe unto you that are rich and are increased in goods, and
   have need of nothing, and boast of your own goodness! Christ has
   nothing to do with you and we have nothing to preach to you except
   this--"They that are whole need not a physician." The heavenly Surgeon
   did not come to save those who have no need of saving. Let those who
   are sick prick up their ears and hear with delight, for the Physician
   is come with a special eye to them. Are you a sinner? Then Christ is
   the Savior of sinners! Join hands with Him by faith and the work is
   done--you are saved forever! God bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Exeter-Hall Sermon to Young Men

   (No. 1740)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER 2, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT EXETER HALL.

   "O Lord, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, and the son of
   Your handmaid; You have loosed my bonds." Psalm 116:16.

   I HAVE been wondering whether I might correctly say that I would
   preach, tonight, as a young man to young men. It is precisely what I
   should like to do, but can I do it? You are young men, I see, to a very
   large extent, but I wonder whether I am a young man myself. I have two
   opinions upon it in my own mind. Sometimes I feel very old. When I look
   in the mirror and see the hairs that have turned white upon my head, I
   suspect that I cannot be a young man! When I feel weary with my work
   and worn with sickness, I am persuaded that years are having their
   effect upon me! Yet, when I recover from sickness I feel young
   again--and when cheerful spirits and vivacity return, I half hope that
   I may still be a young man. I must not, however, deceive myself, for
   when I come to calculate and tally all up, I confess that if youth is
   essential to membership with the Young Men's Christian Association, I
   could not expect to be voted in.

   I am a little under 50 and I am a grandfather--and so I do not think
   that I can call myself a young man. Very well! I will not take upon
   myself airs and pretend to be what I am not, nor will I claim to be
   quite in your position upon the life-chart. I am not old, however! I
   suppose that I am just in the middle passage and, as a man in the
   center of life, I may venture, tonight, to give some little instruction
   and advice to you who are at its beginning. I have received a lot of
   advice, myself, in former years, and have borne it pretty patiently.
   Everybody has advised me! I must honestly admit that I have not
   followed all their advice, or else I had not been here!

   But now I think that I shall take my turn and see whether I may not
   give a little advice. And the advice, such as it is, shall come out of
   my own experience. I do not expect you to follow it blindly, for I have
   confessed that I have not always accepted everybody's counsel, myself.
   Only give me a hearing! Gather the good of what I say into vessels and
   throw the bad away. Before I get quite away from being a young man, I
   will try to talk with those who so lately were my com-rades--before I
   shake hands with the old men and ask for a seat among them--I would
   have a word with those who are coming upon the scene of action to fill
   our places!

   I may honestly say, at the very beginning, that I want so to preach,
   tonight, that every man here who is not yet a servant of the Lord may,
   at least, desire to become one--and that very many may actually enlist
   in the service of our great Lord and Master on this very spot! Why not?
   I shall be thrice happy and they will be thrice happy, too, if such
   should be the case! I have taken a text which I can repeat on my own
   behalf as sincerely as the Psalmist could for himself--"O Lord, truly I
   am Your servant; I am Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid; You
   have loosed my bonds."

   I. I begin, then, dear young men, by COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF GOD TO
   YOU. I want you to enter it and, therefore, I commend it! When a young
   man starts in life, he is apt to enquire of an older person in this
   fashion--"I should like to get into such-and-such a business, but is it
   a good one? You have been in it for years, how do you find it?" He
   seeks the advice of a friend who will tell him all about it. Some will
   have to warn him that their trade is decaying and that there is nothing
   to be done in it. Others will say that their business is very trying
   and that if they could get out of it, they would! While another will
   answer for his work, "Well, I have found it all right. I must speak
   well of the bridge which has carried me over. I have been able to earn
   a living and I recommend you try it."

   I come here at this time on purpose to give my own experience and,
   therefore, I wish to say, concerning the service of the Lord, that I
   have never regretted that I entered it. Surely, at some time or other,
   in these 33 years since I put on Christ's livery and became His
   servant, I would have found out the evil if there had been anything
   wrong in the religion of Jesus! At some time or other I would have
   discovered that there was a mistake and that I was under a delusion!
   But it

   has never been so. I have regretted many things which I have done, but
   I have never regretted that I gave my heart to Christ and became a
   servant of the Lord.

   In times of deep depression--and I have had plenty of them--I have
   feared this and feared the other, but I have never had any suspicion of
   the goodness of my Master, the truth of His teaching, or the excellence
   of His service! Neither have I wished to go back to the service of
   Satan and sin. Mark you, if we had been mindful of the country from
   where we came, we have had many an opportunity to return. All sorts of
   enticements have assailed me and siren voices have often tried to lure
   me upon the rocks--but never, never, by God's Grace, since the day in
   which I enlisted in Christ's service have I said to myself, "I am sorry
   that I am a Christian. I am sorry that I serve the Lord."

   I think that I may, therefore, honestly, heartily and experimentally
   recommend to you the service which I have found so good. I have been a
   bad enough servant, but never had a servant so lovable a Master or so
   blessed a service! There is one thing, too, which will convince you
   that, in my judgment, the service of God is most desirable--I have
   great delight in seeing my children in the same service. When a man
   finds that a business is a bad one, you will not find him bringing up
   his boys to it. Now, the greatest desire of my heart for my sons was
   that they might become the servants of God. I never wished for them
   that they might be great or rich, but, oh, if they would but give their
   young hearts to Jesus! This I prayed for most heartily.

   It was one of the happiest nights of my life when I baptized them into
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit, upon
   profession of their faith! And now, while I am speaking to you, one is
   preaching in New Zealand and another at Greenwich--and my heart is glad
   that the Gospel which the father preaches, the sons are preaching, too!
   If my Lord's service had been a hard one, I should have said to these
   lads, "Don't you consider it. God is a hard Master, reaping where He
   has not sowed--I went into the service blindly--and I warn you to avoid
   it." My conduct has been the reverse of this and thus I have given you
   hostages in the persons of my sons for my honest love to my Master and
   Lord!

   I do, without reserve, commend to you the service of the Lord Jesus
   Christ! If you enter it, you will wish your sons and daughters to enter
   it--and it will be your ambition that to the latest generation all your
   house may fear and serve God. I would add this more of a personal
   testimony--so blessed is the service of God, that I would like to die
   in it! When I have been unable to preach through physical pain, I have
   taken my pen to write--and found much joy in making books for
   Jesus--and when my hand has been unable to wield the pen, I have wanted
   to talk about my Master to somebody or other, and I have tried to do
   so. I remember that David Brainerd, when he was very ill and could not
   preach to the Indians, was found sitting up in bed, teaching a little
   Indian boy his letters, that he might read the Bible. And so he said,
   "If I cannot serve God one way, I will, another. I will never leave off
   this blessed service."

   This is my personal resolve, and verily, there is no merit in it, for
   my Lord's service is a delight. It is a great pleasure to have anything
   to do for our great Father and Friend. And, therefore, most
   affectionately, for your own good, I commend the service of God to you.
   I think of it now in the following lights and, therefore, I commend it
   to you for four reasons. To serve God is the most reasonable thing in
   the world! It was He that made you--should not your Creator have your
   service? It is He that supports you in being--should not that being be
   spent to His Glory? Oh, Sirs, if you had a cow or a dog, how long would
   you keep either of them if it were of no service to you?

   Suppose it were a dog and it never fawned upon you, but followed at
   everybody else's heel and never took notice of you--never acknowledged
   you as its master at all? Would you not soon tire of such a creature?
   Which of you would make an engine or devise any piece of machinery if
   you did not hope that it would be of some service to you? Now, God has
   made you--and a wonderful piece of mechanism is the body and a wondrous
   thing is the soul--and will you never obey Him with the body or think
   of Him with the mind? This is Jehovah's own lament--"Hear, O heavens,
   and give ear, O earth: for the Lord has spoken, I have nourished and
   brought up children, and they have rebelled against Me. The ox knows
   his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know. My
   people do not consider."

   To have lived to be 21 without God is a terrible robbery! How have you
   managed it? To have lived to be 30 or 40 and never to have paid any
   reverence to Him who has kept the breath in your nostrils--without
   which you would have been a loathsome carcass in the grave long ago--is
   a base injustice! How dare you continue in it? To have lived so long
   and, in addition to that, to have often insulted God; to have spoken
   against Him; to have profaned His day; to have neglected His Book; to
   have turned your back on the Son of His love--is not this enough? Will
   you not cease from such an evil course? Why, there are some men who
   cannot bear five minutes provocation, no, nor five seconds! It is "a
   word and a

   blow" with them--only the blow frequently comes first! But here is God
   provoked by the 20 years at a stretch--the 30, the 40, the 50 years
   right on--and yet He bears patiently with us! Is it not time that we
   render to Him our reasonable service? If He has made us; if He has
   redeemed us; if He has preserved us in being, it is but His due that we
   should be His servants!

   And let me point out, next, that this is the most honorable service
   that ever was. Did you say, "Lord, I am Your servant"? I see, coming
   like a flash of light from Heaven, a bright spirit, and my imagination
   realizes his presence. There he stands, a living flame! It is a seraph,
   fresh from the Throne of God, and what does he say? "O Lord, I am Your
   servant!" Are you not glad to enter into such company as this? When
   cherubim and seraphim count it their glory to be the servants of God,
   what man among us will think it to be a mean office? A prince, an
   emperor--if he is a sinner against God--is but a dishwasher in the
   kitchen compared with the true nobleman who serves the Lord in poverty
   and toil! This is the highest style of service under Heaven--no
   courtier's honor can rival it! Knights of the Garter or whatever else
   you like, lose their glories in comparison with the man whom God will
   call servant in the day of the appearing of our Lord and Savior Jesus
   Christ! You are in grand company, young Friend, if you are a servant of
   God!

   And let me note, again, that this service is full of benefits. If I had
   to engage in a trade, I would like to spend my time and strength in a
   pursuit which did no hurt to anybody and did good to many. Somehow, I
   do not think that I would like to deal in deadly weapons--certainly not
   in the accursed drink! I would sooner starve than earn my bread by
   selling that or anything else that would debase my fellow men and
   degrade them below the level of brute beasts! It is a grand thing, I
   think, if a young man can follow a calling in which he may do well for
   himself and be doing well to others at the same time. It is a fine
   thing to act as some have done who have not grown rich by grinding the
   faces of poor needle women, or by the wage of the servant behind the
   counter, but have lifted others up with them and, as they have
   advanced, those in their employment have advanced, also. That is a
   something worth living for in the lower sphere of things!

   But he that becomes a servant of God is doing good all along, for there
   is no part of the service of God which can do any harm to anybody! The
   service of the Lord is all goodness. It is good for yourself and it is
   good for your fellow men-- for what does God ask in His service but
   that we should love Him with all our heart--and that we love our
   neighbor as ourselves? He who does this, is truly serving God, by the
   help of His Spirit, and he is also greatly blessing men! I say, it is a
   most charitable work to engage in and, therefore, it is that I commend
   it to you--for its reasonableness, its honorable-ness and its goodness.

   And there is another thought. It is the most remunerative work under
   Heaven. "Not always, today," someone may say. Yet I venture to say,
   "Always today!" To serve God is remunerative now! How so? Certainly not
   in hard cash, as misers rightly call their gold, but in better
   material. A quiet conscience is better than gold! To know that you are
   doing good is something more sweet in life than to know that you are
   getting rich or famous! Have not some of us lived long enough to know
   that the greater part of the things of this world are so much froth
   upon the top of the cup, far better blown away, than preserved? The
   chief joy of life is to be right with yourself, your neighbor, your
   God. And he that gets right with God--what more does he need? He is
   paid for anything that he may suffer in the cause of God by his own
   peace of mind!

   There was a martyr, once, in Switzerland, standing barefoot on the
   firewood and about to be burnt to death--no pleasant prospect for him.
   He accosted the magistrate who was superintending his execution and
   asked him to come near him. He said, "Will you please lay your hand
   upon my heart. I am about to die by fire. Lay your hand on my heart. If
   it beats any faster than it ordinarily beats, do not believe my
   religion." The magistrate, with a palpitating heart, himself, and all
   in a tremble, laid his hand upon the martyr's bosom and found that he
   was just as calm as if he were going to his bed rather than to the
   flames. That is a grand thing! To wear in your buttonhole that little
   flower called, "heart's-ease," and to have the jewel of contentment in
   your bosom--this is Heaven begun below--godliness is great gain to him
   that has it!

   But, listen. I think that all that we can get in this world is paltry
   because we must leave it, or it must leave us in a very short time. I
   am now addressing a congregation of young men. Young men--but in how
   very short a time, if you all live--will your hair be powdered with the
   gray of age! In how brief an interval will the whole company now
   gathered in Exeter Hall be gathered in the grave! How short life is!
   How swift is time! The older we get, the faster years fly. Only that

   is worth my having which I can have forever! Only that is worth my
   grasping which death cannot tear out of my hands! The supreme reward of
   being a servant of God is hereafter!

   And if, young man, you should serve God and you should meet with
   losses, here, for Christ's sake, you may count these "light afflictions
   which are but for a moment," and think them quite unworthy to be
   compared with the glory that shall be revealed--for there is a
   resurrection of the dead! There is a judgment to come! There is a life
   eternal! There is a Heaven of unutterable splendor! There is a place in
   that Heaven for everyone of us who become true servants of the living
   God. I think that I hear somebody saying, "Well, I do not want to be a
   servant." You cannot help it, my Friend--you cannot help it. You must
   be a servant of somebody! "Then I will serve myself," says one. Pardon
   me, brave Sir, if I whisper in your ear that if you serve yourself you
   will serve a fool!

   The man who is the servant of himself--listen to this sentence--the man
   who is the servant of himself is the slave of a slave--and I cannot
   imagine a more degrading position for a man to be in than to be the
   slave of a slave! You will assuredly serve somebody. You will wear
   fetters, too, if you serve the master that most men choose. Oh, but
   look at this city-- this city full of free men--do the most of them
   know real liberty? Look at this city full of "freethinkers!" Is there
   any man that thinks in chains like the man who calls himself a
   freethinker? Is there any man so credulous as the man that will not
   believe the Bible? He swallows a ton of difficulties and yet complains
   that we have swallowed an ounce of them! He has much more need of faith
   of a certain sort than we have, for skepticism has far harder problems
   than faith!

   And look at the free-liver, what a bondage is his life! "Who has woe?
   Who has redness of eyes" but the slave of strong drink? Who has
   rottenness in the bones but the slave of his passions? Is there any
   wretch that ever tugged in the Spanish galley, or any bondsman beneath
   the sun that is half such a slave as he who will be led, tonight, by
   his lusts like a bull to the slaughter, going to his own damnation and
   even to the ruin of his body while he makes himself the victim of his
   own passions? If I must be a slave, I will be a slave to Turks or
   savages--but never to myself--for that were the nethermost abyss of
   degradation! You must be a servant to somebody--there is no getting
   through the world without it. And if you are the servant of yourself,
   your bondage will be terrible.

   "Choose this day whom you will serve," for serve you must. Every man
   must get to his task, whether he is peer or pauper, millionaire or
   beggar. Kings and queens are usually the most wearied servants of all.
   The higher men climb, the more they have to serve their fellow men. You
   must serve! Oh, that you would enter the service of your God! There is
   room in it. Other places are crowded. Hundreds of young men go from
   shop to shop and beg for the opportunity to earn a livelihood. I lament
   that in many instances they beg in vain. Some of you wear the boots off
   your feet in trying to get something to do--how anxiously do I desire
   that you may find the employment you seek! But there is room in the
   service of God--and He is willing to receive you.

   And let me tell you, that if you enter His service, it will help you in
   everything that you have to do in this life. They say that a Christian
   man is a fool. Ah, proud opposers, though we say not the same to you,
   we might, perhaps, with truth, think so! I have seen many Believers in
   Jesus whom it would have been very dangerous to deal with as with
   fools, for very soon he that dealt with them in that fashion would have
   found that he made a great mistake. They are not always fools who are
   called so--they are such, sometimes, who use those names. I like a
   Christian man to be all the better in every respect for being a
   Christian. He should be a better servant and a better master. He should
   be a better tradesman and a better artisan. Surely, there is no poet
   whose masterly excels that of the poet of the sanctuary--Milton still
   sits alone.

   There is no painter that should paint so well as he who tries with his
   brush to make immortal the memorable scenes in which great deeds were
   done. That which you can now do well you might do better by becoming a
   servant of God. Thus would I commend my Master's service with all my
   heart. Are there any here who will enlist in it? If so, I have a second
   point to dwell on very briefly. I lift the flag and bid you rally to
   it, but first hear me patiently.

   II. My second point is A WORD OF CAUTION. Did you notice that David
   said, "O Lord, truly I am Your servant." "Truly." The word of caution!
   If you become the servant of God, truly become the servant of God. God
   is not mocked. It is the curse of our Churches that we have so many
   merely nominal Christians in them. It is the plague of this age that so
   many put on Christ's livery and yet never do Him a hand's turn. Oh, if
   you serve God, mean it! If a man serves the devil, let him serve the
   devil! But if he serves God, let him serve God!

   Some people serve their business very actively, but not their God.
   There was, years ago, a Brother who used to occasionally pray at the
   Prayer Meeting in a low tone, as if he had no lungs left. Seldom could
   you hear what he said and if you listened and strained your ears there
   was still nothing to hear. I thought that the Brother had a bad voice
   and so I never called on him to pray any more. But, stepping one day
   into his shop, I heard him say in a commanding voice, "John, fetch that
   half-hundred!" "Oh, dear!" I thought, "that is the kind of voice he has
   in his business, but when he comes into the service of God, that little
   squeak is all he can give."

   Laugh again, Sirs! Laugh again! It deserves to be laughed at! But is
   there not much of this hypocrisy abroad? God is to have the
   cheese-parings of a man's life--and he flings these down as if they
   were all that God was worth? But as for the world, that is to have the
   vigor of his life and the cream of his being. God does not want nominal
   servants--nor do I invite them, in His name, tonight. "O Lord, truly I
   am Your servant," said David. And he that does not mean to truly be
   God's servant, let him not pretend to be one at all! If you would be
   God's servant, then count the cost! You must leave all others. "You
   cannot serve God and mammon." You cannot serve Christ and Belial. He is
   not God's who is not God's only.

   You must also enter upon God's service for life--not to be, off and on,
   sometimes God's servant and sometimes not. Have you ever heard of the
   child who was asked by the district visitor, "Is your father a
   Christian?" The child replied, "Yes, Sir, Father is a Christian, but he
   is not doing much at it, just now." Oh, how many Christians there are
   of that sort! They profess to be Christians, but they are not doing
   much at it. If you become the servant of God, you must be His servant
   every day and all day forever and ever--

   "'Tis done, the great transaction's done: I am my Lord's, and He is
   mine," must be a covenant declaration which must stand true throughout
   your entire life!

   And if you become the servant of God, you must cease from every known
   sin. You cannot give one hand to Christ and another to Satan. You must
   give up your dearest sins. Sweet sin must become bitter. If sins are
   like right hands or right eyes, they must be cut off or plucked out!
   And you must follow Christ fully, giving Him all your heart, soul and
   strength. For if it is not so, you cannot be His disciple.

   So much by way of caution. I was very brief on that, but take it as
   though it were said at length.

   III. I want, now, to OFFER COUNSEL IN THE MATTER OF DISTINCT CONFESSION
   IF YOU BECOME THE

   SERVANT OF CHRIST. "I am Your servant," says David. And then he says it
   again, "I am Your servant." Now, I want every young man here who is a
   Christian to make it known by an open avowal of his discipleship. I
   mean that there should not be one among us who follows the Lord Jesus
   Christ in a mean, sneaking, indistinct, questionable way. It has become
   the custom of many to try to be Christians and never say anything about
   it. This is beneath contempt!

   I urge you true servants of Christ to "out with it," and never be
   ashamed! If ever a bold profession was required, it is required now.
   You may not be burned at the stake for saying that you are a Christian,
   but I believe that the old enmity to Christ is not removed and a true
   Believer will still be called upon to take up his cross. In many a
   house in London a young man will have to run the gauntlet if he is
   known to be a Christian. Run the gauntlet, then! You have an honorable
   opportunity. It is a grand thing to be permitted to endure reproach for
   Christ's sake--you should look at it as a choice privilege that you are
   counted worthy, not only to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, but also
   to suffer for His sake!

   Nowadays the world needs decided men. Everywhere it seems to be
   imagined that you may believe what you like or believe nothing--and do
   as you like or do nothing--and the result will be all the same, both to
   the unbeliever and the man of faith. But it is not so! It is time for
   the out-and-out servant of the Lord to put down his foot and say, "I
   have believed, therefore have I spoken. I am a Christian and while I
   leave you to your individual liberty, I mean to have mine! And I mean
   to exercise that liberty by being openly and unquestionably on the side
   of Christ and on the side of that which is pure, sober, right, true and
   good." Is not this well deserved by Christ?

   Oh, if He never was ashamed of us, we ought never to be ashamed of Him!
   If the Lord of Life and Glory stooped to die for us, could we ever
   stoop at all, even if we rolled into the mire or dropped into the grave
   for Him? Surely, our blessed Lord deserves to be followed by heroes!
   Every man in the Presence of the Cross-bearing Jesus should feel that
   to take up his cross and follow Christ is the simplest and most natural
   thing that can be--and he should resolve, in God's

   strength, that he will do it--and continue to obey the Lord, though all
   the world should ridicule him! Let me tell you that it is the easiest
   thing to do, after all! Compared with compromise, it is simplicity,
   itself.

   I have known many young Christians who have come up to London and they
   have determined that they would serve God if they could--but that they
   would keep it very quiet--and so they have attempted to be Christians
   on the sly. And they have failed! If you are a genuine Christian, it
   will be found out as surely as you are living! If you go down to
   Mit-cham when the lavender is ripe, you may shut all your windows, but
   you will find that the perfume of the lavender will somehow get into
   your house! Christianity has a perfume about it which will spread
   abroad so that all in the house enquire, "What is all this?" The wicked
   wags will whisper that you are "a Christian young man"--and if you have
   not come out at the first, it will be very hard for you afterwards.

   Begin as you mean to go on, young man! Do not hide your flag and try to
   sail under false colors, for both good and bad will be against you in
   that case. You will be hunted from place to place if the dogs find that
   you will run--you will make rare sport for the hunters if you take to
   your heels! Come straight out and let them do their best or their
   worst. Live a most consistent life and the other young fellows will
   know where you are. They will soon reckon you up and if you are
   sincere, before long they will leave you alone--but if they do not,
   forbearance is still yours! If they continue to persecute you, so much
   the worse for them--for you, by your quiet, holy life, will make them
   feel that it is hard for them to kick against the pricks! But, anyhow,
   do come out bravely.

   Some of you young fellows are like rats behind the wainscot--you do not
   mind going out at night to eat the crumbs on the floor--but there you
   are, back again directly. I mean that you will join in religious
   exercises if it is not known to the shop, but you would not, for the
   world, become suspected of real religion! Is that how true Christians
   should act? No! Put on your livery! "But I do not care about joining a
   Church," says one. Very likely. But do you not know that it is found to
   be a convenient and proper thing in warfare that a soldier should wear
   a uniform? At first, Oliver Cromwell's Ironsides were dressed anyway
   and everyway. But in the melee with the Cavaliers it sometimes happened
   that an Ironsides was struck down by mistake by the sword of one of his
   own brethren and so the general said, "You wear red coats, all of you.
   We must know our own men from the enemy." What Cromwell said, he meant,
   and they had to come in their red coats, for it is found essential in
   warfare that men should be known by some kind of uniform.

   Now, you that are Christ's, do not go about as if you were ashamed of
   His Majesty's service! Put on your red coats-- I mean come out as
   acknowledged Christians! Unite with a body of Christian people and be
   distinctly known to be Christ's. How are the ordinances of the Lord's
   house to be sustained if every man is to go to Heaven, alone, by the
   back way? Come out boldly! If any man wants to laugh at a Christian,
   step out and say, "Laugh at me! If anybody wants to abuse a fellow and
   call him a hypocrite, a Presbyterian, a Methodist, come on! I am ready
   for you." If you have once done that and come right out on the
   straight, you shall find it the easiest thing in life to bear the
   reproach of Christ! And oh, remember, young men, that if you should
   meet with any reproach for Christ, a reward awaits you.

   Shall I tell you a parable? There was once a king's son who went upon a
   journey, incognito, and he journeyed into a far country. And there he
   was ill-treated and, because of his language and his appearance, the
   people of the land set him in the pillory, which was, of old, the place
   of scorn. They set him there and the mob gathered round him and threw
   all kinds of filth and garbage upon him. This unknown prince was thus
   pelted and made as the offscouring of all things. But there was, among
   them, one man who loved the prince and who recognized him--and
   determined to bear him company. He mounted the pillory and stood by his
   side! He wiped his face with his handkerchief and whenever he could, he
   put himself in the way of the mire and dirt, that he might catch it and
   screen the prince from it.

   Years went on and it came to pass that the prince was back in his
   kingdom in all his glory. And the courtiers were standing round about
   the throne. This man who had been a poor man in his own country was
   summoned to the court and when he arrived at the palace, the prince saw
   him and said to the peers of the realm, "Stand aside and make way for
   this man. He was with me when I was ill-treated and scorned--and now he
   shall be with me in my glory, chief among you here." Do you not know
   the story of how our sweet Lord Jesus came down to earth and suffered
   many things, and how He was despised and rejected of men?

   Young man, are you the man who would wipe His blessed face, share His
   shame and take half turns with the Man of Nazareth in all His disgrace
   and scorn? Are you that man? Then there shall come a day when the great
   Father, on His Throne, shall spy you out and say, "Make a lane, you
   angels! Stand back, seraphim and cherubim! Make way for this

   man! He was with My Son in His humiliation, and now he shall be with
   Him in His Glory." Will you receive that mark of honor? Not unless you
   are prepared to put on the badge of Christ and say, "I am His servant
   and His follower from this day to life's end." God help you to do it! O
   Holy Spirit, lead scores of young men to shoulder the Cross!

   IV. And so, lest I weary you, I CLOSE BY CONGRATULATING SOME OF YOU who
   are God's servants, UPON YOUR FREEDOM, for that is the last part of the
   text. "Truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, and the son of Your
   handmaid; You have loosed my bonds." Oh, but this is a grand
   thing--this loosing of the bonds! Were you ever in bonds? Did you ever
   feel the bonds of guilt? Are you believing in Christ? Then those bonds
   are loosed, for your sin is forgiven you for Christ's sake and you are
   delivered from all condemnation! Oh, will you not love Him who has
   loosed your bonds? Were you, dear Friend, ever in the bonds of
   despondency and despair on account of sin? Did you ever sit and sigh
   because you thought that there was no salvation for you? And did the
   Lord Jesus Christ appear to you as your crucified Savior? And did you
   trust in Him and feel the bond of despondency broken? Happy day for
   you!

   I remember it well, myself! Oh, then, will you not follow Him that has
   loosed your bonds? You are now delivered from the bonds of guilt and
   despair! You are also saved from the power of sin! The habits that were
   your masters are now destroyed! The lusts that lorded over you are now
   slain and you are free! Will you not wish to be bound to Christ from
   now on because He has loosed your bonds? I know some men in this world
   who talk a great deal about being free, but they are always in chains.
   There is a man I know for whom the devil makes a nauseous mixture--at
   least to me it is very nauseous--and he says, "Drink a quart of it,"
   and he drinks. "Drink another," says the devil, and he does so. "Drink
   another," says the devil, and his brain begins to reel and he is all on
   fire. "Drink it," says the devil, and he lets it run down his
   throat--he is in chains!

   I know another who, against his better self, will go into sin which he
   knows to be sin--and knows to be injurious to him. Yet he goes in a
   silly manner and harms himself more and more. He is led by the nose by
   the devil! He says that he cannot resist--he is a slave in the worst
   sense! Oh, blessed is the man who can say, "You have loosed my bonds:
   no evil habit now enslaves me! No passion controls me, no lust enchains
   me!" Young Friend, if you can stand up and say, "I am free from
   myself--I am no longer the slave of sin!"--you are a blessed man and
   you may well be God's servant forever! What a mercy it is to be
   delivered from the bonds of the fear of man! Some young men dare not
   call their souls their own for fear of their employers. A great many
   more are dreadfully in fear of the young man who sleeps in the next
   bed. Oh, dear, they dare not do what is right!

   Poor babies that they are, they must ask permission to keep a
   conscience! When they are about to do anything, they are always saying,
   "What will So-and-So think of it?" Does it matter to any true man what
   all the world thinks about him? Has he not risen out of that? Is he
   still a serf? "Go," says the brave man, "think what you will, and say
   what you will. If I serve God, I am no servant of yours! By your
   censures I shall not fail, as by your praises I shall not rise." Be
   afraid of such a thing as this and ask the leave of another man what I
   shall think, what I shall believe, what I shall do! I will die first!
   When God brings a man to know Him, and to be His servant, He sets him
   free from this cowardly crime of being afraid of a man that shall die!
   So, too, He sets him free from all the maxims and customs of the world.

   Young man, when you go into business, they will tell you that you must
   do such-and-such because it is "the custom of the trade." "Why," you
   say, "it is lying!" You will be told that it is not exactly lying
   because your customer is used to your tricks and quite understands that
   a hundred means 80, and the best quality means a second-class article.
   I am told that half the business in London is robbery in some form or
   another if the customs of the trade are not understood. If it is so
   that it is all understood, it might just as well be done honestly--and
   it would pay as well! Yet, somehow, men feel as if they must do what
   others have done, or else they will be out of the race. Slaves! Serfs!
   Be honest! He is not free that dares not be honest! Shall I not speak
   my mind? Shall I not act out my integrity? If I cannot, then I cannot
   say with David, "You have loosed my bonds."

   Lastly, what a blessing it is when God frees us from the fear of death!
   "You have loosed my bonds." What will it matter to you, young man, if
   you become the servant of God by faith in Jesus Christ, whether you
   live or die? If you die early, so much the sooner in Heaven! If you
   live long, so much the longer in which to serve your God on earth! Give
   your heart to Christ! Trust your salvation in those dear hands that
   were pierced for sinners and thus become the servant of God--and you
   shall be provided for--for His children shall not lack. You shall be
   led, guided, taught, educated, pre-

   pared for Heaven! And one of these bright days a convoy of celestial
   spirits shall think it an honor to be permitted to bear your joyful
   spirit up to the Throne of God!

   Who will be the servant of the Most High, then? I always wish, when I
   have done with sermons, that I could preach them over again because I
   have not done well enough. But all I care to preach for is that I may
   touch your hearts. I would not care a snap of the fingers to be an
   orator, or to speak pretty sentences. I want to put forward the Truth
   of God so that some young man will say, "I will serve God." I remember
   young men that began life when I began, that are now--I will not say
   what. Ah! I remember hearing their names mentioned as models! They were
   such fine young men and had just gone up to London. Yes, and they are,
   tonight, if not in jail, in the workhouse!

   It all came about in this way--the young man sent word home to his
   mother what the text was on Sunday, yet he had not been to hear a
   sermon at all. He had been to some amusement to spend a happy
   day--wherever he went, he had neglected the House of God and,
   by-and-by, there was a little wrong in his small accounts--just a
   little matter. But that man could not pick himself up, again, having
   once lost his character. There was another. There was nothing wrong in
   his accounts, but his habits were loose. By-and-by he was ill. Who
   could wonder? When a man plays with edged tools, he is very likely to
   cut himself. It was not long before he was so sickly that he could not
   attend to business and, before long, he died. And they said--I fear it
   was true--that he killed himself by vice. And that is how thousands do
   in London.

   Oh, if you become the servant of God, this will not happen to you! You
   may not be rich; you may not be famous; you may not be great--you need
   not desire these things--full often they are gilded vanities. But to be
   a man to the fullness of your manhood; to be free and dare to look
   every other man in the world in the face and speak the truth and do the
   right. To be a man that can look God in the face because Christ has
   covered him with His glorious righteousness--this is the ambition with
   which I would fire the spirit of every young man before me! And I pray
   God that the flame may burn in his life by the power of the Divine
   Spirit.

   Come then, Brothers, bow your heads and say, "We will be servants of
   the living God henceforth and forever." God grant it, for Jesus
   Christ's sake. Amen and Amen!

"Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled"

   (No. 1741)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 23, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in
   Me. In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would
   have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare
   a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that
   where I am, there you may be also. And where I go you know, and the way
   you know." John 14:1-4.

   WE may well feel glad that God's people, whose lives are recorded in
   the Old and New Testaments, were men of like passions with ourselves. I
   have known many a poor sinner pluck up hope as he has observed the sins
   and struggles of those who were saved by Grace. And I have known many
   of the heirs of Heaven find consolation as they have observed how
   imperfect beings like themselves have prevailed with God in prayer and
   have been delivered in their time of distress. I am very glad that the
   Apostles were not perfect men--they would then have understood all that
   Jesus said at once--and we would have lost our Lord's instructive
   explanations. They would also have lived above all trouble of mind--and
   then the Master would not have said to them these golden words, "Let
   not your heart be troubled."

   It is, however, most evident from our text that it is not according to
   our Lord's mind that any of His servants should be troubled in heart.
   He takes no delight in the doubt and disquietude of His people. When He
   saw that because of what He had said to them, sorrow had filled the
   hearts of His Apostles, He pleaded with them in great love and besought
   them to be comforted. As when a mother comforts her child, He cried,
   "Let not your heart be troubled." Jesus says the same to you, my
   Friend, if you are one of His downcast ones. He would not have you sad.
   "Comfort you, comfort you My people; speak you comfortably to
   Jerusalem," is a command even of the old dispensation, and I am quite
   sure that under this clearer revelation, the Lord would have His people
   free from heartbreak.

   Has not the Holy Spirit especially undertaken the work of comfort in
   order that it may be effectually done? Trials depress the hearts of
   God's children, for which the most tender ministry fails to afford
   consolation--and then it is most sweet for the failing comforter to
   remember the unfailing Comforter--and to commit the case of the
   sorrowful spirit into Divine hands. Seeing that one Person of the
   blessed Trinity has undertaken to be the Comforter, we see how
   important it is that our hearts should be filled with consolation.
   Happy religion in which it is our duty to be glad! Blessed Gospel by
   which we are forbidden to be troubled in heart! Is it not a thing
   greatly to be admired that the Lord Jesus should think so carefully of
   His friends at such a time?

   Great personal sorrows may well be an excuse if the griefs of others
   are somewhat overlooked. Jesus was going to His last bitter agony and
   to death, itself, and yet He overflowed with sympathy for His
   followers. Had it been you or I, we would have asked for sympathy for
   ourselves. Our cry would have been, "Have pity upon me, O my Friends,
   for the hand of God has touched me!" But, instead of that, our Lord
   cast His own crushing sorrows into the background and bent His mind to
   the work of sustaining His chosen under their far inferior griefs. He
   knew that He was about to be "exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death."
   He knew that He would soon be in an agony through bearing "the
   chastisement of our peace." But before He plunged into the deep, He
   must dry the tears of those He loved so well and, therefore, He said
   most touchingly, "Let not your heart be troubled."

   While I admire this condescending tenderness of love, at the same time
   I cannot help adoring the marvelous confidence of our blessed Lord,
   who, though He knows that He is to be put to a shameful death, yet
   feels no fear, but bids His disciples to trust Him implicitly. The
   black darkness of the awful midnight was beginning to surround Him, yet
   how brave His Words--"Believe also in Me." He knew, in that threatening
   hour, that He had come forth from the Father and that He was in the
   Father and the Father in Him--and so He says, "You believe in God,
   believe also in Me." The calm bearing of their Master must have greatly
   tended to confirm His servants in their faith. While we see here His
   confi-

   dence as Man, we also feel that this is not a speech which a mere man
   would have uttered, even had he been a good man-- for no mere creature
   would thus match Himself with God.

   That Jesus is a good Man, few question. That He must be God is,
   therefore, proven by these words. Would Jesus bid us trust in an arm of
   flesh? Is it not written--"Cursed is the man that trusts in man, and
   makes flesh his arm"? Yet the Holy Jesus says, "You believe in God,
   believe also in Me." This association of Himself with God, as the
   object of human confidence in the time of trouble, betokens a
   consciousness of His own Divine power and Godhead--and it is a mystery
   in whose difficulties faith takes pleasure--to see in our Lord Jesus,
   the faith of a Man for Himself--and the faithfulness of God for others.

   Come then, dear Friends, close up to the text and may the Spirit of God
   be with us! I will read the text again very distinctly. Pray that you
   may feel the words even more powerfully than the Apostles felt them,
   for they had not yet received the Comforter, and so they were not yet
   led into all the Truth of God--in this we excel them as they were that
   night--let us, therefore, hopefully pray that we may know the Glory of
   our Lord's Words, and hear them spoken into our very soul by the Holy
   Spirit. "Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe
   also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so,
   I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and
   prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to Myself;
   that where I am, there you may be also. And where I go you know, and
   the way you know."

   These Words are, in themselves, much better than any sermon. What can
   our discourse be but a dilution of the essential spirit of consolation
   which is contained in the Words of the Lord Jesus? Now let us, first,
   taste of the bitter waters of heart-trouble and, secondly, let us drink
   deep of the sweet waters of Divine consolation!

   I. First, then, LET US TASTE OF THE BITTER WATERS. "Because I have said
   these things unto you, sorrow has filled your heart." I would not
   confine the comfort to any one form of affliction, for it is a balm for
   every wound. But still, it will be well to enquire what was the
   particular trouble of the disciples? It may be that some of us are
   passing through it, now, or we may be plunged in it before long. It was
   this--Jesus was to die--their Lord, whom they sincerely loved, was
   about to go from them by a shameful, painful death. What tender heart
   could bear to think of that? Yet He had told them that it would be
   so--and they began to remember His former Words in which He had said
   that the Son of Man would be betrayed into the hands of wicked men and
   would be scourged and put to death.

   They were now to pass through all the bitterness of seeing Him accused,
   condemned and crucified. In a short time He was actually seized, bound,
   carried to the High Priest's house, hurried to Pilate, then to Herod,
   back to Pilate, stripped, scourged, mocked, insulted. They saw Him
   conducted through the streets of Jerusalem bearing His Cross. They
   beheld Him hanging on the tree between two thieves and heard Him cry,
   "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" A bitter drink was this! In
   proportion as they loved their Lord, they must have deeply grieved for
   Him--and they needed that He should say, "Let not your heart be
   troubled."

   Today, those who love the Lord Jesus have to behold a spiritual
   repetition of His shameful treatment at the hands of men, for even now
   He is crucified afresh by those who account His Cross a stumbling block
   and the preaching of it foolishness. Ah me! How is Christ still
   misunderstood, misrepresented, despised, mocked and rejected of men!
   They cannot touch Him, really, for there He sits, enthroned in the
   Heaven of heavens! But as far as they can, they slay Him over again and
   again! A malignant spirit is manifested to the Gospel as once it was to
   Christ in Person. Some with coarse blasphemies and not a few with
   cunning assaults upon this part of Scripture, and on that, are doing
   their best to bruise the heel of the Seed of the woman. It is a huge
   grief to see the mass of mankind pass by the Cross with averted eyes as
   if the Savior's death was nothing--nothing, at least, to them. In
   proportion as you feel a zeal for the Crucified and for His saving
   Truth, it is wormwood and gall to give in this age of unbelief. Christ
   Jesus is nailed up between the two thieves of superstition and
   unbelief, while around Him still gathers the fierce opposition of the
   rude and the polished, the ignorant and the wise.

   In addition to this, the Apostles had for an outlook the expectation
   that their Lord would be away from them. They did not, at first,
   understand His saying, "A little while and you shall not see Me: and
   again, a little while, and you shall see Me, because I go to the
   Father." Now it dawned upon them that they were to be left as sheep
   without a shepherd, for their Master and Head was to be taken from
   them. This was, to them, a source of dread and dismay, for they said to
   themselves, "What shall we do without Him? We are a little flock; how
   shall we be defended when He is gone, and the wolf is

   prowling? When the Scribes and Pharisees gather about us, how shall we
   answer them? As for our Lord's cause and kingdom, how can it be safe in
   such trembling hands as ours? Alas for the Gospel of salvation when
   Jesus is not with us!"

   This was a bitter sorrow--and something of this kind of feeling often
   crosses our own hearts as we tremble for the ark of the Lord. My heart
   is sad when I see the state of religion among us! Oh for an hour of the
   Son of Man in these darkening days! It is written there shall come, in
   the last days, scoffers--and they have come, but, oh, that the Lord
   Himself were here in Person! Oh, that the Lord would pluck His right
   hand out of His bosom and show us, once again, the wonders of
   Pentecost, to the confusion of His adversaries and to the delight of
   all His friends!

   He has not come as yet. Nearly 2,000 years have rolled away since He
   departed--the night is dark and there is no sign of dawn! The ship of
   the Church is tossed with tempest and Jesus has not come to us! We know
   that He is with us in a spiritual sense, but, oh, that we had Him in
   the Glory of His power! Surely He knows our need and the urgency of the
   times and we are apt to cry, "It is time for You, Lord, to work, for
   they make void Your Law." But they felt a third grief, and it was
   this--that He was to be betrayed by one of them! The 12 were chosen
   men, but one of them was a devil and sold his Lord. This pierced the
   hearts of the faithful--"the Son of Man is betrayed."

   He is not taken by open seizure, but He is sold for 30 pieces of silver
   by one whom He entrusted with His little store. He that dipped with Him
   in the dish had sold Him for paltry gain. This cut them to the heart,
   even as it did the Master, Himself, for our Lord felt the treachery of
   His friend. Of this water the faithful at this hour are made to
   drink--for what do we see at this day? What do we see in various places
   but persons that are reputed to be ministers of the Gospel whose main
   business seems to be to undermine our holy faith and batter down the
   Truths of God which are commonly received in the Christian Church?
   Certain of them preach as if they were ordained, not of God, but of the
   devil! And anointed, not by the Holy Spirit, but by the spirit of
   infidelity!

   Under the banner of "advanced thought," they make war upon those
   eternal Truths for which confessors contended and martyrs bled--and by
   which the saints of past ages have been sustained in their dying hours!
   It is not an enemy-- then we could have borne and answered it. If the
   outward and avowed infidel attacks Inspiration, let him do so. It is a
   free country, let him speak! But when a man enters our pulpits, opens
   the Sacred Volume, and denies that it is inspired, what is he doing
   there? How does his conscience allow him to assume an office which he
   perverts? To make him a shepherd who is a wolf--to make him a dresser
   of the vineyard who, with his axe, cuts up the very roots of the
   vines--this is an incomprehensible folly on the part of the churches!
   It is a dagger to every believing heart that Judas should be
   represented in the Christian Church by so many of the professed
   ministers of Christ! They betray their Master with a kiss.

   Then there came another pang at the back of this, for one of them,
   though true-hearted and loyal, would that night deny his Lord. Peter,
   in many respects the leader of the little company, had been warned that
   he would act the coward and vehemently deny his Lord. This is
   bitterness, indeed, of which those that love the Church of God are
   compelled full often to drink--to see men whom we cannot but believe to
   be the disciples of Jesus Christ carried away by temptation, by fear of
   man or by the fashion of the times--so that Christ and His Gospel are
   virtually denied by them!

   The fear of being thought dogmatic or labeled a Puritan closes many a
   mouth which ought to be declaring Him to be the Son of God with power
   and extolling His glorious majesty in defiance of all that dare oppose
   Him! The hearts of some who best love Jesus grow heavy at the sight of
   the worldliness and lukewarmness of many of His professed followers.
   Hence it seems to me to be a most seasonable hour for introducing you
   to the sweet waters of our text, of which I bid you drink till every
   trace of bitterness is gone from your mouth--for the Master says to
   you, even to you--"Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God,
   believe also in Me."

   II. Under our second head LET US DRINK OF THE SWEET WATERS and refresh
   our souls. First, in this wonderful text our Master indicates to us the
   true means of comfort under every sort of disquietude. How does He put
   it? "Let not your heart be troubled"--believe! Kindly look down your
   Bibles and you will see that this direction is repeated. He says, in
   the opening of the 11th verse, "Believe Me." And then, again, in the
   second clause, "Believe Me." I thought, as I tried to enter into the
   meaning of this sacred utterance, that I heard Jesus at my side saying
   thrice to me, "Believe Me! Believe Me! Believe Me!"

   Could any one of the 11 that were with Him have disbelieved their
   present Lord? He says, "Believe Me! Believe Me! Believe Me!" as if
   there was great need to urge them to faith in Him. Is there no other
   cure, then, for a troubled heart? No other is required! This is all
   sufficient through God. If believing in Jesus, you are still troubled,
   believe in Him

   again--yet more thoroughly and heartily. If even that should not take
   away the disquiet of your mind, believe in Him to a third degree--and
   continue to do so with increasing simplicity and force. Regard this as
   the one and only medicine for the disease of fear and trouble! Jesus
   prescribes, "Believe, believe, believe in Me!" Believe not only in
   certain doctrines, but in Jesus Himself--in Him as able to carry out
   every promise that He has made! Believe in Him as you believe in God!

   One has been, at times, apt to think it easier to believe in Jesus than
   in God, but this is a thought of spiritual infancy--more advanced
   Believers find it not so. To a Jew, this was certainly the right way of
   putting it, and I think to us Gentiles it is, also, when we have been
   long in the faith, for we get to believe in God as a matter of
   course--but faith in Jesus requires a further confidence. I believe in
   God's power in creation in that He can make what He wills, and shape
   what He has made. I believe in His power in Providence, that He can
   bring to pass His eternal purposes, and do as He wills among the armies
   in Heaven and among the inhabitants of this lower world. I believe,
   concerning God, that all things are possible with Him. Just in that way
   I am called upon to believe in Jesus, that He is as Omnipotent in power
   and as sure in His working as the Lord from whom come all the forces of
   nature--and just as certain to accomplish His purposes as God is to
   achieve His design in the works of Providence.

   Relying upon the Savior with the implicit faith which every
   right-minded man renders towards God, we shall only give our Lord the
   faith which He justly claims. He is faithful and true and His power can
   effect His promise--let us depend trustfully upon Him--and perfect
   peace shall come into our hearts. These disciples knew that the Savior
   was to be away from them, so that they could not see Him nor hear His
   voice. What of that? Is it not so with God, in whom we believe? "No man
   has seen God at any time"--yet you believe in the invisible God working
   all things, sustaining all things! In the same manner believe in the
   absent and invisible Christ, that He is still as mighty as though you
   could see Him walking the waves, or multiplying the loaves, or healing
   the sick, or raising the dead! Believe Him--and sorrow and sighs will
   flee away!

   Believe in Him as always living, even as you believe in the eternity of
   God. You believe in the eternal existence of the Most High whom you
   have not seen! Even so, believe in the everlasting life of the Son of
   God. Yes, though you see Him die, though you see Him laid in the grave,
   yet believe in Him that He has not ceased to be. Look for His
   reappearance, even as you believe in God. Yes, and when He is gone from
   you, and a cloud has received Him out of your sight, believe that He
   lives, even as God lives--and because He lives, you shall live, also!
   You believe in the wisdom of God; you believe in the faithfulness of
   God; you believe in the goodness of God--"Even as you believe in God,"
   says Jesus, "believe also in Me." Faith in Jesus Christ, Himself, as an
   ever-living and Divine Person, is the best quietus for every kind of
   fear! He is the "King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible," "The Wonderful,
   Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of
   Peace!" And therefore you may safely rest in Him. This is the first
   ingredient of this priceless comfort.

   But now our Lord proceeded to say that though He was going from them,
   He was only going to His Father's house. "In My Father's house are many
   mansions." Yes, and this was sweet comfort. "I am going," He said, "and
   on My way you will see Me scourged, bleeding, mocked and buffeted. But
   I shall pass through all this to the joy, rest and honor of My Father's
   house." God is everywhere present, and yet as on earth He had a
   tabernacle in which He specially manifested Himself, so there is a
   place where He, in a peculiar manner, is revealed. The Temple was a
   type of that matchless abode of God which eye has not seen--we call it
   Heaven, the pavilion of God, the home of holy angels and of those pure
   spirits who dwell in His immediate Presence.

   In Heaven God may be said to have His habitation and Jesus was going
   there to be received on His return to all the honor which awaited His
   finished service. He was, in fact, going home--as a son who is
   returning to his father's house from which he had gone upon his
   father's business. He was going where He would be with the Father,
   where He would be perfectly at rest, where He would be above the
   assaults of the wicked--where He would never suffer or die again--He
   was going to reassume the Glory which He had with the Father before the
   world was! Oh, if they had perfectly understood this, they would have
   understood the Savior's words, "If you loved Me, you would rejoice,
   because I said, I go unto the Father."

   Imagination fails to picture the Glory of our Lord's return; the
   honorable escort which heralded His approach to the Eternal City; the
   heartiness of the welcome of the Conqueror to the skies! I think the
   Psalmist gives us liberty to believe that when our Lord ascended, the
   bright ones of the sky came to meet Him and cried, "Lift up your heads,
   O you gates;

   and be you lift up, you everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall
   come in." May we not believe of bright seraphs and ministering angels
   that--

   "They brought His chariot from on high To bear Him to His throne;
   Clapped their triumphant wings and cried, The glorious work is done!"?

   "He was seen of angels." They beheld that "joyous re-entry," the
   opening of the eternal doors to the King of Glory and the triumph
   through the celestial streets of Him who led captivity captive and
   scattered gifts among men! They saw the enthronement of Jesus who was
   made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, but was
   then and there crowned with glory and honor!

   These are not things of which these stammering lips of mine can speak,
   but they are things for you to consider when the Spirit of the Lord is
   upon you. Muse upon them for your delight! Jesus has gone by the way of
   Calvary up to His Father's house! All His work and warfare done, He is
   rewarded for His sojourn among men as Man. All the shame which His work
   necessitated is now lost in the splendor of His mediatorial reign! You
   people of God, be no more troubled, for your Lord is King, your Savior
   reigns! Men may still scoff at Him, but they cannot rob Him of a ray of
   Glory! They may reject Him, but the Lord God Omnipotent has crowned
   Him! They may deny His existence, but He lives! They may rebel-liously
   cry, "Let us break His bands asunder, and cast His cords from us," but
   the Lord has set His King upon His holy hill of Zion and none can
   thrust Him from His Throne! Hallelujah!

   "God has highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every
   name: that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow." Let not your
   hearts be troubled by the noise of controversy and the blasphemy and
   rebuke of an evil age! Though there is confusion as when the sea roars
   and the fullness thereof, and the wicked foam in their rage against the
   Lord and against His Anointed, yet the Lord sits upon the flood! The
   Lord sits King forever. Again, let us say, "Hallelujah!" The Prince has
   come unto His own again! He has entered into His Father's palace! The
   heavens have received Him! Why should we be troubled?

   Thirdly, our Lord gave His servants comfort in another way--He gave
   them to understand by implication that a great many would follow Him to
   His Father's house. He did not only assure them that He was going to
   His Father's house, but He said, "in My Father's house are many
   mansions." These mansions are not built to stand empty! God does
   nothing in vain and, therefore, it is natural to conclude that a
   multitude of spirits, innumerable beyond all count, will rise in due
   time to occupy those many mansions in the Father's house! Now, I see in
   this great comfort to them because they doubtless feared that if their
   Lord was absent, His Kingdom might fail. How would there be converts if
   He were crucified? How could they expect, poor creatures as they were,
   to set up a kingdom of righteousness on the earth? How could they turn
   the world upside down and bring multitudes to His feet whom He had
   purchased with His blood, if His conquering right arm was not seen at
   their head?

   The Lord Jesus in effect said, "I am going, but I shall lead the way
   for a vast host who will come to the prepared abodes. Like the corn of
   wheat which is cast into the ground to die, I shall bring forth much
   fruit which shall be housed in the abiding resting places." This is one
   part of our comfort at this hour. It matters little how men fight
   against the Gospel, for the Lord knows them that are His--and He will
   ransom, by power, those redeemed by His blood! He has a multitude
   according to the Election of Grace whom He will bring in. Though they
   seem, today, to be a small remnant, yet He will fill the many mansions!
   This stands fast as a rock--"All that the Father gives Me shall come to
   Me; and him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out."

   They boast that "they will not come unto Christ," but the Spirit of God
   foresaw that they would reject the salvation of the Lord. What said
   Jesus to those like they? "You believe not, because you are not of My
   sheep, as I said unto you. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and
   they follow Me: and I give unto them eternal life." The wicked unbelief
   of men is their own condemnation! But Jesus loses not the reward of His
   passion. We fling back into the faces of the despis-ers of Christ the
   scorn which they pour upon Him and remind them that those who despise
   Him shall be lightly es-teemed--their names shall be written in the
   earth. What if they come not to Him? It is their own loss, and well did
   He say of them, "No man can come to Me except the Father which has sent
   Me draw Him." Their wickedness is their inability and their
   destruction! They betray, by their opposition, the fact that they are
   not the chosen of the Most High.

   But "the redeemed of the Lord shall come to Zion with songs and
   everlasting joy upon their heads." "He shall see of the travail of His
   soul and shall be satisfied." This matter is not left to the free will
   of man, so that Jesus may be disappointed! Oh no, "they will not come
   unto Him, that they may have life"--but they shall yet know that the
   eternal Spirit has power over the human conscience and will, and can
   make men willing in the day of His power! If Jesus is lifted up, He
   will draw all men to Him. There shall be no failure as to the Lord's
   redeeming work, even though the froward reject the counsel of God
   against themselves. What Jesus has bought with His blood, He will not
   lose! What He died to accomplish shall surely be performed! And what He
   rose again to carry out shall be effected though all the devils in Hell
   and unbelievers upon earth should join in league against Him! Oh, you
   enemy, rejoice not over the cause of the Messiah, for though it seems
   to fall, it shall arise again!

   But our Lord went much further, for He said, "I go to prepare a place
   for you." I think He did not only refer to the many mansions for our
   spirits, but to the ultimate place of our risen bodies, of which I will
   speak before long. In our Lord's going away, as well as in His
   continuance in His Father's Presence, He would be engaged in preparing
   a place for His own. He was going that He might clear all impediment
   out of the way. Their sins blocked the road--like mountains, their
   iniquities opposed all passage--but now that He is gone, it may be
   said, "The breaker is come up before them, and the Lord on the head of
   them." He has broken down every wall of partition and He has opened
   every iron gate. The way into the kingdom is opened for all Believers.
   He passed through death to Resurrection and Ascension to remove every
   obstacle from our path.

   He went from us, also, to fulfill every condition, for it was
   absolutely necessary that all who entered Heaven should wear a perfect
   righteousness and should be made perfect in character--no sin can enter
   the Holy City! The saints could not be perfected without being washed
   in His precious blood and renewed by the Holy Spirit. And so the Savior
   endured the death of the Cross--and when He arose, He sent us the
   sanctifying Spirit that we might be fitted for His rest. Thus He may be
   said to have prepared the place of our rest by removing from its
   gateway the sin which blocked all entrance. He went away, also, that He
   might be in a position to secure that place for all His people. He
   entered Heaven as our Forerunner, to occupy the place in our name; to
   take possession of Heaven as the Representative of all His people.

   He was going that He might, in Heaven itself, act as Intercessor,
   pleading before the Throne of God and, therefore, be able to save to
   the uttermost all that come to God by Him. He was going there to assume
   the reins of Providence, having all things put under His feet, and
   having all power given to Him in Heaven and in earth so He might bless
   His people abundantly. By being in Heaven, our Lord occupies a
   vantage-ground for the sure accomplishing of His purposes of love. As
   Joseph went down into Egypt to store the granaries, to prepare for
   Israel a home in Goshen, and to sit upon the throne for their
   protection, so has our Lord gone away into Glory for our good--and He
   is doing for us, upon His Throne, what could not so advantageously have
   been done for us here.

   At the same time, I am inclined to think that there is a special sense
   in these words over and above the preparing of Heaven for us. I think
   our Lord Jesus meant to say, "I go to prepare a place for you" in this
   sense--that there would, in the end, be a place found for their entire
   manhood. Mark that word, "a place." We are too apt to entertain cloudy
   ideas of the ultimate inheritance of those who attain unto the
   resurrection of the dead. "Heaven is a state," says somebody. Yes,
   certainly it is a state--but it is a place, too--and in the future it
   will be more distinctly a place. Observe that our blessed Lord went
   away in body--not as a disembodied spirit--but as One who had eaten
   with His disciples, and whose body had been handled by them. His body
   needed a "place." And He is gone to prepare a place for us--not only as
   we shall be for a while, pure spirits, but as we are to be
   ultimately--body, soul and spirit.

   When a child of God dies, where does his spirit go? There is no
   question about that matter--we are informed by the inspired
   Apostle--"absent from the body, present with the Lord." But matter and
   something yet remains. My spirit is not the whole of myself, for I am
   taught so to respect my body as to regard it as a precious portion of
   my complete self-- the temple of God. The Lord Jesus Christ did not
   redeem only my spirit, but my body, too, and consequently He means to
   have a "place" where I--this person who is here, in the wholeness of my
   individuality--may rest forever. Jesus means to have a place made for
   the entire manhood of His chosen that they may be where He is and as He
   is. Our ultimate abode will be a state of blessedness, but it must also
   be a place suited for our risen bodies!

   Heaven is not, therefore, a cloud-land--an airy something, impalpable
   and dreamy. Oh, no, it will be as really a place as this earth is a
   place! Our glorious Lord has gone for the ultimate purpose of preparing
   a suitable place for His

   people. There will be a place for their spirits, if spirits need a
   place, but He has gone to prepare a place for them as body, soul and
   spirit. I delight to remember that Jesus did not go as a spirit, but in
   His risen body, bearing the scars of His wounds. Come, you that think
   you will never rise again! You who imagine that the scattering of our
   dust forbids all hope of the restoration of our bodies! We shall go
   where Christ has gone and as He has gone. He leads the way in His body
   and we shall follow in ours. Ultimately there shall be the complete
   redemption of the purchased possession--not a bone shall be left in the
   regions of death--not a relic for the devil to glory over!

   Jesus said to Mary, "Your brother shall rise again." He did not need to
   say your brother's spirit shall live immortally, but your brother shall
   "rise again." His body shall come forth out of the tomb. Well might the
   Apostles' hearts be comforted when they learned the blessed errand upon
   which their Lord was going!

   The next consolation was the promise of His sure return--"If I go away
   to prepare a place for you, I will come again." Listen, then! Jesus is
   coming again! In the same manner as He ascended, He will return--that
   is, really, literally and in bodily form! He meant no play upon words
   when He so plainly said, without proverb, "I will come again," or more
   sweetly, still, "I go away and come again unto you." This is our
   loudest note of joy, "Behold, He comes!" This is our never-failing
   comfort! Observe that the Savior, in this place, says nothing about
   death; nothing about the peace and rest of Believers till He is come,
   for He looks on to the end. It is not necessary to put every Truth of
   God into one sen-tence--and so our Lord is content to mention the
   brightest of our hopes--and leave other blessings for mention at other
   times. Here the consolation is that He will come--come personally to
   gather us in!

   He will not send an angel, nor even a host of cherubim to fetch us up
   into our eternal state, but the Lord, Himself, will descend from
   Heaven. It is to be our marriage day and the glorious Bridegroom will
   come in person! When the Bride is prepared for her Husband, will He not
   come to fetch her to His home? O Beloved, do you not see where our
   Lord's thoughts were? He was dwelling upon the happy day of His
   ultimate victory when He shall come to be admired in all them that
   believe! That is where He would have His people's thoughts be. But
   alas, they forget His Advent. The Lord shall come--let your hearts
   anticipate that day of days! His enemies cannot stop His coming!

   "Let not your heart be troubled." His enemies may hate Him, but they
   cannot hinder Him. They cannot impede His glorious return, not by the
   twinkling of an eye! What an answer will His coming be to every
   adversary! How will they weep and wail because of Him! As surely as He
   lives, He will come, and what confusion this will bring upon the wise
   men who at this hour are reasoning against His Deity and ridiculing His
   Atonement! Again I say, "Let not your heart be troubled" as to the
   present state of religion--it will not last long. Do not worry
   yourselves into unbelief though this man may have turned traitor, or
   the other may have become a backslider, for the wheels of time are
   hurrying on the day of the glorious manifestation of the Lord from
   Heaven!

   What will be the astonishment of the whole world when, with all the
   holy angels, He shall descend from Heaven and shall glorify His people?
   For that is the next comfort--He will receive us! When He comes, He
   will receive His followers with a courtly reception. It will be their
   marriage reception! It shall be the marriage supper of the Son of God!
   Then shall descend out of Heaven the new Jerusalem prepared as a bride
   for her husband. Then shall come the day of the Resurrection and the
   dead in Christ shall rise. Then all His people who are alive at the
   time of His coming shall be suddenly transformed so as to be delivered
   from all the frailties and imperfections of their mortal bodies--"The
   dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed." Then we
   shall be presented spirit, soul and body "without spot, or wrinkle, or
   any such thing"--in the clear and absolute perfection of our sanctified
   manhood--presented unto Christ Himself.

   This is the sweetest idea of Heaven that can be, that we shall be with
   Christ, that we shall see Him, that we shall speak to Him, that we
   shall commune with Him most intimately, that we shall glorify Him, that
   He will glorify us and that we shall never be separated from Him
   forever and ever! "Let not your heart be troubled"--all this is near at
   hand and our Lord's going away has secured it for us. For this was the
   last point of the consolation, that when He came and received His
   people to Himself, He would place them eternally where He is, that they
   may be with Him.

   Oh, joy! Joy! Joy! Unutterable joy! Can we not, now, once and for all,
   dismiss every fear in the prospect of the endless bliss reserved for
   us?--

   "See that Glory how resplendent! Brighter far than fancy paints! There
   in majesty transcendent, Jesus reigns, the King of saints!

   Spread your wings, my Soul, and fly

   Straight to yonder world of joy!

   Joyful crowds, His throne surrounding,

   Sing with rapture of His love!

   Through the heavens His praises sounding,

   Filling all the courts above.

   Spread your wings, my Soul, and fly

   Straight to yonder world of joy!" The Lord talks to us as if we now
   knew all about His goings and doings--and so we do as far as all
   practical purposes are concerned. He says, "Where I go you know." He is
   not gone to a place unknown, remote, dangerous. He has only gone home.
   "Where I go you know." When a mother sends her boy to Australia, she is
   usually troubled because she may never see him again, but he replies,
   "Dear Mother, the distance is nothing, now--we cross the ocean in a
   very few weeks--and I shall speedily come back again."

   Then the mother is cheered. She thinks of the ocean as a little bit of
   blue between her and her son--and looks for him to return if necessary.
   So the Savior says, "Where I go you know." As much as to say--"I told
   you, I am going to your own Father's house, to the mansions where your
   spirits will soon come. And I am going for the blessed purpose of
   making it ready to receive you in the entirety of your nature. You are
   thus made to know all about My departure and My business. I am going to
   a glorious place which eye has not seen, but My Spirit will reveal it
   to you. You know where I am going and you know, also, the way by which
   I am going--I am going through suffering and death, through Atonement
   and righteousness--this is the way to Heaven for you, also, and you
   will find it all in Me. You shall, in due time, enter Heaven by My
   Atonement, by My death, by My sacrifice, for 'I am the way.' You know
   the way, but remember, it is only the way and not the end. Do not
   imagine that the wicked can make an end of Me! Believe that Christ on
   the Cross, Christ in the sepulcher is not the end, but the way."

   This, Beloved, is the way for us as well as for our Lord. He could not
   reach His crown except by the Cross, nor His mediatorial Glory except
   by death! And that way once made in His own Person is open for all who
   believe in Him. Thus you know where the Lord has gone and you know the
   road--therefore, be encouraged, for He is not far away--He is not
   inaccessible! You shall soon be with Him. "Let not your heart be
   troubled." Oh, brave Master, shall You be followed by a tribe of
   cowards? No, we will not lose heart through the trials of the day. Oh,
   holy Master, You did meet Your death with song, for, "after supper they
   sang a hymn!" Shall not we go through our griefs with joyful trust? Oh,
   confident Lord, bidding us believe in You as in God, Himself, we do
   believe in You, by Your Grace, and we also grow confident!

   O, my Master, Your undisturbed serenity of faith infuses itself into
   our souls and we are made strong! When we hear You bravely talking of
   Your death which You had to accomplish at Jerusalem, and then of Your
   after-Glory, we, also, think hopefully of all the opposition of ungodly
   men and, waiting for Your appearing, we solace ourselves with that
   blessed hope! Make no tarrying, O our Lord! Come quickly! Amen.

Spiritual Knowledge and Its Practical Results

   (No. 1742)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 30 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For this cause we, also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
   pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge
   of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that you might
   walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good
   work, and increasing in the knowledge of God." Colossians 1:9,10.

   FOR the Church that was at Colosse, Paul gave hearty thanks to God for
   many most important blessings, especially for their faith, their love
   and their hope. It would be a very useful exercise to our hearts if we
   would often give thanks to God for the gifts and Graces which we
   discover in our Christian Brothers and Sisters. I am afraid we are more
   inclined to spy out their faults and to suppose that we deplore them,
   than we are to discern the work of the Holy Spirit in them and, from
   the bottom of our hearts, give thanks to God for them. Paul felt
   encouraged by what he saw in the Colossian Believers to pray to God to
   enrich them yet farther. It should be our desire that our best Brethren
   should be better and that those who are most like Jesus should be still
   more completely conformed to His image.

   We cannot more wisely show our love to our friends than by, first,
   acknowledging the Grace which is in them--and then by praying that God
   may give them more! Paul, as with an eagle eye, surveyed the Church at
   Colosse, which he loved so well, and he noted that it was somewhat
   lacking in knowledge. The Colossian brotherhood differed considerably
   from the Church at Corinth which abounded in talent and was enriched
   with all knowledge. The Colossians had fewer gifted Brethren among them
   who could act as teachers and, though this was no fault of theirs, it
   impoverished them in the matter of knowledge--and as Paul would not
   have them be behind in any desirable attainment--he, therefore, prayed
   for them that they might be filled with knowledge in all wisdom and
   spiritual understanding.

   If you read this Epistle through, you will observe that Paul frequently
   alludes to knowledge and wisdom. To the point in which he judged the
   Church to be deficient, he turned his prayerful attention. He would not
   have them ignorant. He knew that spiritual ignorance is the constant
   source of error, instability and sorrow--and, therefore, he desired
   that they might be soundly taught in the things of God. Not that they
   were destitute of saving knowledge, for he says in the 6th verse that
   they "knew the Grace of God in truth," and that they had brought forth
   fruits meet for salvation. But saving knowledge, though it is the most
   essential attainment, is not the only knowledge which a Christian
   should seek after. He should long to be useful as well as to be safe.

   Being himself delivered out of darkness, Paul strives to bring others
   into the marvelous light of Grace. Paul would have his Brethren
   thoroughly furnished for sacred service, knowing the will of the Lord,
   themselves, and able to teach others. He desired for them that they
   might possess comforting knowledge, strengthening knowledge, edifying
   knowledge, sanctifying knowledge, directing knowledge--so that they
   might be ready for all the trials, duties and labors of life. Upon this
   subject I am led to make four observations and to enlarge upon each of
   them. May the Holy Spirit, by this discourse, build us up in the
   knowledge of God.

   I. My first subject is THE GREAT VALUE OF INTERCESSORY PRAYER, for as
   soon as Paul felt his heart burning with love to the saints at Colosse
   and had heard of the work of the Spirit among them, he began to show
   His love by lifting up His heart in prayer for them. He did that for
   them which He knew would bless them. Notice that intercessory prayer is
   a very important part of the work of Christians for one another. We are
   not sent into the world to live unto ourselves, but we are members of
   one body--and each member is expected to contribute to the health and
   the comfort of the whole. It is true we cannot all preach, but we can
   all pray! We cannot all distribute alms from our substance, but we can
   all offer prayer from our hearts!

   In temporal things we may not be able to enrich the Church for lack of
   substance, but if we fail to bless the Church by our prayers, it will
   be for lack of Divine Grace. Whatever you fail in, dearly Beloved--and
   I pray that you may in nothing fall behind--yet do not fail in prayer
   for all the saints, that every blessing may abound towards them!
   Intercessory prayer is to be esteemed as an invaluable proof of love
   and as the creator of more love. The man who will truly pray for me
   will certainly readily forgive me if I offend him. He will relieve me
   if I am in need and He will be prepared to assist me if I am engaged in
   a service too hard for me. Give us your earnest prayers and we know
   that we live in your hearts! How sweet it is to be permitted thus to
   manifest our love to one another!

   When our hands are palsied, we can still pray! When our eyes grow dim,
   we can still see to pray! When, by sickness, we are altogether laid
   aside, we can still pray! And when we meet with cases in which we are
   unable to help, and yet are moved with sympathy for a Brother or
   Sister, our sympathy can always find one open channel, for we can
   pray--and by prayer call in the aid of One whose help is effectual.
   Therefore, by your love to your Lord and to all those who are in Him, I
   beseech you abound in intercessory prayer as the Apostle did.

   Intercessory prayer, again, is most valuable because it is an
   infallible means of obtaining the blessings which we desire for our
   friends. It is not in vain that we ask, for it is written, "Everyone
   that asks receives." It is not in vain that we intercede for others,
   for the Lord delights to answer such petitions. The unselfish devotion
   which pleads as eagerly for others as for itself is so pleasing to the
   Lord that He puts great honor upon it. If we desire any blessing for
   our friends, our best course is to pray--even if we would have them to
   be filled with knowledge in all wisdom, our safest course is to pray
   that it may be so.

   Of course, we must not forget to instruct them and to aid them in their
   studies as far as lies in our power, for every honest prayer supposes
   the use of all proper means. But the instruction which we offer will be
   of no service unless we first bring down the blessing of God upon it,
   that thereby our friends may be made willing to learn and may receive
   the Truth of God not as the word of man, but as from the Lord, Himself.
   None but spiritual teaching will nourish spiritual life. The Holy
   Spirit must teach Divine Truth to the heart, or it will never be truly
   known. Whatever you wisely desire for your friend, strive to get it for
   him, but hasten, first, to the Throne of Grace. If you would have your
   friend converted; if you would have him strengthened; if you would have
   him taught of God; if you would have him quickened to a nobler life and
   elevated to a higher consecration, do him this great service--take his
   case before the Lord in prayer--and in so doing you have gone the
   wisest way to work to enrich him.

   Note, Brothers and Sisters, for I am keeping to my text closely, that
   such intercessory prayer will be all the more valuable if it is our
   immediate resort. The Apostle says, "Since the day we heard it, we do
   not cease to pray for you." He began to pray at once! Whenever you
   perceive the work of the Spirit in any heart, pray at once that the
   holy change may proceed with power. Whenever you discover any need in a
   Brother, begin on the day you hear of it to pray that his need may be
   supplied. There should be no delaying of prayer! "He gives twice who
   gives quickly" is a human proverb, but I believe that when we pray
   speedily we shall often find that God, in answering quickly, gives us a
   double blessing. Usually he who is the most diligent in the pursuit of
   them shall win worldly riches--and assuredly he shall be richest
   towards God who is most diligent in supplication. Linger not a minute!
   Speed on to the Mercy Seat. Now is the accepted time; the Lord waits to
   be gracious to you! The Lord indicates to you what your prayer shall be
   by the news, which you have just heard of your friend. Therefore, bring
   his case at once before the Throne of Grace. Divine Providence has
   brought the necessary subject for prayer under your notice; therefore
   begin to pray about it at once!

   Our prayers will be all the more valuable if they are incessant as well
   as immediate. "We cease not," said Paul, "to pray for you since the day
   we heard it." "Oh," says one, "was Paul always praying for the
   Colossians from the day he heard of their welfare? It may have been
   months and years! Did he never cease to pray?" I answer, he was always
   praying for them in the sense which he explains--he adds, "and to
   desire." Now, desire is the essence of prayer. In fact, desire is the
   kernel of prayer. The vocal expressions which we call by the name of
   prayer are often but its shell--inward desire is the life, the heart,
   the reality of prayer! Though you cannot always be speaking in prayer,
   you can always be desiring in prayer. The miser is always desiring
   riches, though he is not always talking about his gold and silver. And
   the man who loves his fellow men and desires their profit is really
   always praying for their benefit, though he is not always lifting up
   his voice in supplication. "Since the day we heard it," says Paul, "we
   do not cease to pray for you."

   The act of prayer is blessed, but the habit of prayer is more
   blessed--and the spirit of prayer is the most blessed of all--and it is
   this that we can continue for months and years. The act of prayer must,
   from force of circumstances, be sometimes stopped, but the habit of
   prayer should be fixed and unvarying. And the spirit of prayer, which
   is fervent desire, should be perpetual and abiding. We can hardly
   realize the value to the Church and to the world of that intercessory
   prayer which ceases not, day or night, but without fail ascends before
   the Lord from the whole company of the faithful, as the incense
   ascended from the altar!

   Dear Friends, our intercessory prayer will be all the more precious if
   it is an intense expression unto God. I suppose that by the use of the
   word, "desire," here, the Apostle not only explains how he continued to
   pray, but in what manner he prayed--with "desire." Remember how our
   Lord puts it--"with desire have I desired to eat this Passover with you
   before I suffer." I wish we could always say, "with desire have I
   desired in prayer. I did not repeat a merely complimentary benediction
   upon my friends, but I pleaded for them as for my life. I importuned
   with God; I offered an effectual inwrought prayer which rose from the
   depths of my heart to the heights of Heaven and obtained an audience
   with God." Fervency is a great essential for victorious prayer. God
   grant us to be importunate, for then we shall be invincible!

   One more observation and I have done with this point. Intercessory
   prayer is increased in value when it is not from one person, alone, but
   is offered in intimate union with other saints. Paul says, "We, also,"
   not, "I, only," but, "we, also, since the day we heard it, cease not."
   If two of you agree as touching anything concerning the Kingdom of God,
   you have the blessing secured to you by a special promise of God.
   Remember how Abraham prayed for the cities of the plain, but succeeded
   not until Lot also added his supplication for Zoar? Then the little
   city was spared. I compare Abraham's intercession to a ton weight of
   prayer, and poor Lot's I can hardly reckon to have been more than half
   an ounce, but still that half-ounce turned the scale!

   So here is Paul--and with him is youthful Timothy, who, compared with
   Paul, is meaningless! Yet Paul's prayer is all the more effectual
   because Timothy's prayer is joined with it. Our Lord sent out His
   servants by two and two, and it is well when they come back to Him in
   prayer two and two. I commend to you, Brothers and Sisters, the habit
   of frequent prayer together. When a Christian friend drops in, his
   visit will, perhaps, end in mere talk unless you secure its spiritual
   profit by at least a few minutes spent in united prayer. I frequently,
   during the day, when a friend comes in upon the Master's business, say,
   "Let us pray before you go," and I always find the request is welcomed.
   Such prayers do not occupy much time, but if they did, it might be well
   spent--such united supplications oil the wheels of life's heavy wagon
   and cause it to move with less of that creaking which we too often
   hear. "I, alone" is certainly a good word in prayer, but, "we, also" is
   a better one! Let us link hands and intercede for our Brethren and the
   whole Church of God.

   Thus have I expatiated upon the excellencies which increase the value
   of intercessory prayer. Use much this heavenly art. It is effectual for
   10,000 ends. It turns every way to bless the Church. Brothers and
   Sisters, pray for us, pray for all saints, pray for all sinners and, by
   doing so you will be the benefactors of your age.

   II. Our second observation from the text is this--we learn, here, THE
   PRECIOUSNESS OF SPIRITUAL KNOWL-EDGE--for all this earnest, ceaseless
   prayer is offered for this end, "That you might be filled with the
   knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding." Here
   let us speak of the usefulness and blessedness of that spiritual
   knowledge for which the Apostle and his friend cried incessantly unto
   the Lord. First, consider the men for whom this knowledge is desired.
   They are saints and faithful Brethren, of whom we read that they "knew
   the Grace of God in truth," and were, "bringing forth fruit" unto God.
   For those who already know the Lord we must not cease to pray. They are
   not beyond the need of our prayers while they are in this life.

   We may pray for those who know nothing of the Lord, that He would open
   their blind eyes--but even those who have already been taught of God
   are in need of our supplications that they may learn yet more. We have
   great encouragement to pray that they may be filled with all knowledge,
   since the Lord has already done so much for them. We dare not say in
   this case that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, for a little
   knowledge of the things of God may suffice to save the soul, but more
   knowledge is a most desirable thing for those who have that little
   knowledge! Pray, therefore, for them. Let not your prayers plead only
   and altogether for the unconverted, but entreat for our young converts,
   that they may be further edified. It will be an ill day when we are so
   engaged in seeking lost sheep that we forget the lambs! It would be
   very mischievous for us to neglect our work at home in order to carry
   on warfare with the adversary abroad.

   No, let us daily cry to God in prayer that the stones lately quarried
   may be built up upon the one Foundation and embedded in the walls of
   the Church of God unto eternal glory! We desire life for the dead,
   health for the living and maturity for the healthy. For the deeper
   instruction of our younger Brothers and Sisters let us pray. Of this
   desirable knowledge, what is the measure? We desire for them, "that
   they may be filled with the knowledge of His will." Filled-- this is
   grand scholarship, to have the mind, heart and the whole of our manhood
   filled with knowledge! Paul would not have a Believer ignorant upon any
   point--he would have him filled with knowledge, for when a measure is
   full of wheat there is no room for chaff. True knowledge excludes
   error.

   The men that go after false doctrine are usually those who know little
   of the Word of God. Being untaught, they are unstable, ready to be
   blown about with every wind of doctrine. It you leave empty spots in
   your minds unsaturated with holy teaching, they will be an invitation
   to the devil to enter in and dwell there. Fill up the soul and so shut
   out the enemy! Paul desired the Colossian saints to be filled--filled
   up to the brim with the knowledge of God's will! Brethren, we would
   have you know all that you can know of God's Truth! Rome flourishes by
   man's ignorance, but the New Jerusalem rejoices in the Light of God! No
   knowledge of the revealed will of God can ever do you any harm if it is
   sanctified. Do not be afraid of what they call, "high doctrines," or
   the, "deep things of God." They tell us that those things are secrets
   and, therefore, we ought not to pry into them.

   If they are secrets, there is no fear that anybody can pry into them!
   But the Truths of God revealed in the Word of God are no longer
   secrets, seeing that they are revealed to us by the Spirit of God--and
   as far as they are revealed, it should be our desire to understand
   them--so as to be filled with the knowledge of them. Let us try to know
   the Divine Truths of God more and more intimately. You know a man, for
   you pass him in the streets with a nod. You know another man far
   better, for you lodge in the same house with him. You know him best of
   all when you have shared his trouble, partaken in his joy and have, in
   fact, had fellowship with him by blending your two lives in one common
   stream of friendship. When you learn a spiritual Truth, endeavor to
   know it inside out--to know its foundation and building--to know it by
   the application of the Spirit to your own soul so that you are filled
   with it.

   You may have knowledge in the brain, but it may not run into your
   spirit, so as to penetrate, permeate and saturate your spirit, till you
   are filled with it. Oh, to get the Gospel into one's entire nature and
   to be like the water pots of Cana, filled up to the brim! Lord, fill
   Your poor children with the knowledge of Your will! This makes me
   notice what the matter of this knowledge is--"filled with the knowledge
   of His will." What is that? It means the revealed will of God! Paul
   would have the Colossians know what the Lord has revealed, as far as
   human mind could grasp it, whether it were doctrine, precept,
   experience, or prophecy. How well it is to know the perceptive will of
   God! Our prayer should daily be, "Lord, what will You have me do?"
   Lord, teach me what is sin and what is righteousness, that I may
   discern things which are excellent. Whereas there are questions in the
   Church of God, itself, upon what the will of the Lord is, Lord help me
   not to care to know what is the will of this learned doctor, or what is
   the will of a certain assembly, but what is YOUR will!

   "To the law and to the testimony"--this is our touchstone. Our desire
   is to be filled with the knowledge of the Lord's will so as to do it
   without fail. Especially would we know the will of God as it
   constitutes the Gospel, for Jesus says, "This is the will of Him that
   sent me, that everyone which sees the Son, and believes on Him, may
   have everlasting life." Oh, to know His will in that respect most
   clearly, so as to go and tell it out on all sides, that men may know
   the way of life and may be led into it by our word! Once more we read
   in 1 Thessalonians 4:3--"This is the will of God, even your
   sanctification." Oh, to be filled with the knowledge of the Lord's will
   till you know what sanctification means and exhibit it in your daily
   life! It is yours to teach men what God means by holiness! Your mission
   is not fulfilled and the will of God is not accomplished unless you are
   sanctified! This it is with which we need to be filled! Know anything,
   know everything that is worth knowing! "That the soul is without
   knowledge is not good."

   Never attempt to run side by side with the agnostic whose glory it is
   that he knows nothing. But let it be your delight to know all that can
   be learned out of the Book of the Lord, by the teaching of the Holy
   Spirit. Concentrate your faculties upon the will of God. Here dive into
   the deeps and climb up to the heights and be afraid of nothing! Ask the
   Holy Spirit to saturate you with His Truth, as Gideon's fleece was wet
   with the dew of Heaven, as the golden pot was filled with manna, or as
   Jordan is filled in the time of harvest when it overflows all its
   banks!

   Still we have not done, for we must now notice the manner as well as
   the matter of this knowledge--"in all wisdom and spiritual
   understanding." Wisdom is better than knowledge, for wisdom is
   knowledge rightly used. Knowledge may find room for folly, but wisdom
   casts it out. Knowledge may be the horse, but wisdom is the driver.
   When a man has knowledge, it is like the corn which is laid in the
   barn. But wisdom is the fine flour prepared for food. We need Christian
   people not only to know, but to use what they know! Happy is he who
   knows what to do at the right time! Many people are very knowing half
   an hour after it is too late--but to be filled with wisdom is to be
   able, at once, to apply knowledge rightly in difficult cases. Wisdom
   enables you to bring your knowledge practically to bear upon life, to
   separate between the precious and the vile, to deal with your fellow
   Christians in their different conditions--and to deal with sinners and
   those that are in need.

   You need wisdom so to conduct your affairs that nothing therein shall
   scandalize the weak, or bring dishonor upon the name of Christ--mere
   knowledge will not suffice for this. Knowledge is the blade, wisdom is
   the full corn in the ear. Knowledge is the cloth, but wisdom is the
   garment. Knowledge is the timber, but wisdom has built her house. May
   all our knowledge be sanctified by Grace and attended with the guidance
   of the Spirit that we may become wise to know what the will of the Lord
   is. "All wisdom," says the Apostle--many-handed wisdom, wisdom of all
   sorts, wisdom that will serve you in the shop, wisdom that will be
   useful in the counting-house, wisdom that will aid the Church of God
   and wisdom that will guide you if you are cast among the vilest of
   mankind. May you "be filled with knowledge in all wisdom."

   But that wisdom which operates on the outside must be attended by a
   spiritual understanding which is powerful within. I hardly know how to
   explain this--it is an inward knowledge of truth--the knowledge of the
   inward parts of things. It is a spiritual discernment, taste,
   experience and reception of the Truths of God, whereby the soul feeds
   upon them and takes them into herself. We know many men who know much
   but understand nothing. They accept implicitly what they are taught,
   but they have never considered it, weighed it, estimated it, found out
   the roots of it, or seen the heart of it. Oh, to have in the Church men
   full of spiritual understanding! These can say that they have tasted
   and handled the good Word of Life and have proved and tested the Truth
   as it is in Jesus! You know how it was with the sacrifices of old--a
   man who was poor brought turtle-doves or pigeons--and of these we read
   of each bird, "The priest shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but
   shall not divide it asunder."

   But a man who was rich in Israel brought a bullock or a sheep--and this
   offering was not only cleft down the middle, but further divided--the
   fat and the "inwards" are mentioned in detail. The poorer sacrifice
   represents the offering of the uninstructed--they have never rightly
   divided the Word of God and know not its fullness of meaning. But the
   man who is rich in Grace is comparable to him who brought his bullock,
   for he can enter into detail and see the secret meanings of the Word.
   There is a deep, which lies under, and he that is taught of the Lord
   shall find it. "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and
   He will show them His Covenant." And blessed are they that are taught
   of the Lord so as to read the mystery of His Grace! Here, then, is a
   grand petition for us.

   To go back to our first head, let our intercessory prayers go up for
   all our Brothers and Sisters. Lord, teach them Your Word! Let them know
   Your Book from cover to cover, and let Your Truths revealed therein
   enter into them until they are filled to the brim! Then Lord, grant
   them the skill to use in daily life the knowledge which Your Spirit has
   imparted and may they more and more, in their inmost souls, be guided
   into all Your Truth, that they may comprehend with all saints what are
   the heights, and depths, and know the love of Christ which passes
   knowledge.

   III. Now, thirdly, let us see in the text a lesson concerning THE
   PRACTICAL RESULT OF SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE. Paul prays for his friends
   "that you might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom
   and spiritual understanding; that you might walk worthy of the Lord
   unto all pleasing." See, see the drift of his prayer?--"That you may
   walk." Not that you might talk; not that you might sit down and
   meditate and enjoy yourselves, but, "that you might walk." He aims at
   practical results! He desires that the saints may be instructed so that
   they may walk according to the best model. By walking worthy of the
   Lord Jesus, we do not understand in any sense that he expected them to
   possess such worthiness as to deserve to walk with the Lord--but he
   would have them live in a manner that should be in accordance with
   their communion with Christ.

   You would not have a man walk with Christ through the streets, today,
   clothed in motley garments, or loathsome with filth--would you? No, if
   a man is a leper, Christ will heal him before He will walk with him!
   Let not a disciple walk

   so as to bring disgrace upon his Lord! When you walk with a king, you
   should be, yourself, royal in gait. When you commune with a prince, you
   should not act the clown. Dear Friends, may you know so much of Jesus
   that your lives shall become Christ-like, fit to be put side by side
   with the Character of Jesus, worthy of your perfect Lord! This is a
   high standard, is it not? It is always better to have a high standard
   than a low one, for you will never go beyond that which you set up as
   your model. If you set a low standard, you will fall below even that!
   It is an old proverb, "He that aims at the moon will shoot higher than
   he that aims at a bush." It is well to have no lower standard than the
   desire to live, over again, the life of the Lord Jesus--a life of
   tenderness, a life of self-sacrifice, a life of generosity, a life of
   love, a life of honesty, a life of holy service--a life of close
   communion with God. Mix all virtues in due proportion and that is the
   life of Jesus towards which you must press forward with all your heart.

   Next, the Apostle would have us get knowledge in order that we may so
   live as to be pleasing to our best Friend-- "worthy of the Lord unto
   all pleasing." Is not that beautiful? To live so as to please God in
   all respects! Some live to please themselves, while others to please
   their neighbors. Some live to please their wives; some to please their
   children, and some live as if they wished to please the devil! But our
   business is to please Him in all things whose servants we are. Without
   faith it is impossible to please Him--so away with unbelief! Without
   holiness no man shall see Him, much less please Him--therefore let us
   follow after holiness and may the Lord work it in us! "Unto all
   pleasing"--so that we may please God from the moment we rise in the
   morning to the time when we lie down! Yes, and please Him even when we
   are asleep! That we may eat and drink so as to please Him; that we may
   speak and think so as to please Him; that we may go or stay so as to
   please Him; that we may rejoice or suffer so as to please Him--"walking
   worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing."

   Oh, blessed is the man whose life is pleasing to God in all respects!
   The Apostle Paul desires that we may be filled with knowledge to this
   very end. If I do not know the will of God, how can I do the will of
   God? At least, how can there be anything pleasing to God which is
   ignorantly done without an intent to do His will? I fear that many
   children of God grieve their heavenly Father through sins of
   ignorance--an ignorance in which they ought not to remain a single day!
   Be it clearly understood that sins of ignorance are truly sins. They
   have not about them the venom and the aggravation which are found in
   sins against the Light and knowledge of God, but they are still sins,
   for the measure of our duty is not our light, but the Law of God
   itself. If a man pleads that he follows his conscience, yet this will
   not excuse his wrongdoing if his conscience is an unenlightened
   conscience and he is content to keep it in the dark. You are to obey
   the will of the Lord--that will is the standard of the sanctuary.

   Our conscience is often like a deficient weight and deceives us. It is
   ours to gather a clear knowledge of the Word of God, that we may prove
   what is that perfect and acceptable will of God. The law makes no
   allowance for errors committed through false weights. When a man says,
   "I thought my weights and measures were all right," he is not,
   therefore, excused. The law deals with facts, not with men's
   imaginations! The weights must actually be correct, or the penalty is
   exacted. So is it with conscience--it ought to be instructed in the
   knowledge of the Divine will--and if it is not, its faultiness affords
   no justification for evil. Hence the absolute necessity of knowledge in
   order to true holiness. God grant us Grace to know His will and then to
   obey it "unto all pleasing."

   Look at the text again--"That you might walk worthy of the Lord unto
   all pleasing, being fruitful." Paul would have us producing the best
   fruit. Without knowledge, we cannot be fruitful--at least in the points
   where we are ignorant we must fail to bring forth fruit. Therefore he
   would have us to be taught well, that we may abundantly produce fruit
   unto God's Glory. He says, "fruitful in every good work," and this
   means much. He desires us to be as full of good works as we can be.
   Some are hindered in this because they do not know how to set about
   holy service. How can a man be fruitful as a preacher if he does not
   know what to preach? True, he may preach the elementary doctrine of the
   Cross, but even that he will be apt to set forth in a blundering
   manner. For certain, a man cannot teach what he does not know. The
   zealous, but untaught man, would be much more fruitful if he had a
   clearer understanding of Divine things.

   In daily life, if in knowledge you are ignorant as to the things of
   God, you will be ready to become the prey of any false teacher who may
   chance to pick you up. In hundreds of ways, ignorance will make you run
   risks, lose opportunities of usefulness and fall into dangerous
   mistakes. Knowledge is food to the true heart and strengthens it for
   the Lord's work. Oh, to have knowledge placed like good soil around the
   roots of the soul, to fertilize the mind that thus the clus-

   ters of usefulness may be as large as those of Eschol--beautiful,
   plentiful, sweet and full. May our Lord, the King of Israel, to whom
   the vineyard belongs, receive an abundant reward for all His labor for
   the vines which He has planted!

   There is another note in this verse, which I beg you to notice. Paul
   would have them cultivate a comprehensive variety of the best things.
   He says--"Fruitful in every good work." Here is room and range
   enough--"in every good work." Have you the ability to preach the
   Gospel? Preach it! Does a little child need comforting? Comfort it! Can
   you stand up and vindicate a glorious Truth of God before thousands? Do
   it! Does a poor saint need a bit of dinner from your table? Send it to
   her! Let works of obedience, testimony, zeal, charity, piety and
   philanthropy all be found in your life. Do not select only big things
   as your specialty, but also glorify the Lord in the littles--"fruitful
   in every good work." You never saw in nature a tree which yielded all
   sorts of fruit and you never will.

   I have seen a tree so grafted that it produced four kinds of fruit at
   one time, but I remarked that it was a poor business in reference to
   two of the varieties, for one of the grafts, more natural than the
   others to the parent stem, drew off most of the sap and flourished
   well, but robbed the other branches! The second sort of fruit managed
   to live pretty fairly, but not so well as it would have done on its own
   stem. As for the third and fourth, they were mere attempts at fruit of
   the smallest size. This tree was shown to me as a great curiosity--it
   is not likely that practical gardeners will be encouraged by the
   experiment! But what would you think of a tree upon which you saw
   grapes, figs, olives, apples and all other good fruits growing at one
   time? This is the type of what instructed Believers will become--they
   will produce all sorts of goodness and graciousness to the honor of
   their heavenly Father!

   I have no doubt that you will naturally abound most in certain good
   works for which you have the largest capacity, but still, nothing ought
   to come amiss to you. In the great house of the Church we need servants
   who will not be simply cooks or housemaids, but general servants, maids
   of all work, prepared to do anything and everything! I have known
   persons in household employment in England who would not do a turn
   beyond their special work to save their masters' lives! These are a
   sort of servants of whom the fewer the better! In India this is carried
   out to a ridiculous extreme. The Hindu water-bearer will not sweep the
   house, nor light a fire, nor brush your clothes--he will fetch water
   and nothing else! You must, therefore, have a servant for each separate
   thing, and then each man will do his own little bit--he will not go an
   inch beyond!

   When we enter into Christ's Church, we should come prepared to wash the
   saints' feet, or bear their burdens, or bind up their wounds, or fight
   their foes, or act as steward, or shepherd, or nurse. It has been well
   said that if two angels in Heaven were summoned to serve the Lord and
   there were two works to be done, an empire to be ruled, or a crossing
   to be swept, neither angel would have a choice as to which should be
   appointed to him, but would gladly abide the will of the Lord. Let us
   be equally prepared for anything, for everything by which fruit can be
   produced for the Well-Beloved. Why is it that some are not fruitful in
   this comprehensive way? Because they are not filled with knowledge in
   all wisdom! When a man says, "You asked me to do the lowest work! Don't
   you know that I am a man of remarkable ability who should have higher
   work to do?" I venture to assert that he is an ignorant man!
   Self-assertion is ignorance on horseback!

   You have probably rand of a certain renowned corporal in the American
   service a century ago. A general, as he rode along, saw a body of men
   endeavoring to lift timber. They were shorthanded and the work lagged,
   but their famous corporal stood by ordering them about at a magnificent
   rate. The general passed and said, "Why don't you lend them help and
   put your shoulder to it? "Why, Sir," said the great little officer,
   "how can you think of such a thing? Do you know who I am? I am a
   corporal!" The general got off his horse, took off his coat, and helped
   move the timber--and by his judicious help the soldiers achieved their
   task. Then he turned to the high and mighty gentleman and said, "Mr.
   Corporal, next time you need a man to do such work as this, you can
   send for me--I am General Washington."

   Just so the Lord Jesus Christ, if He were here, would gladly do a
   thousand things which His poor little servants are too great to touch!
   I know you, dear Brother--you are too experienced, too old, too learned
   to help in the Sunday school! I know you are too respectable to give
   away a tract! Pray get out of such ignorant ways of thinking and ask to
   be useful in all possible ways! If you have done a little, do much! If
   you have done much, do more! And when you have done more, ask for Grace
   to proceed to the highest possible degree of usefulness for your Lord.

   IV. And now, fourthly, notice THE REFLEX ACTION OF HOLINESS UPON
   KNOWLEDGE. We have only a few moments left--let my few words sink into
   your hearts. "Fruitful in every good work"--what then? "Increasing in
   the knowledge of God." Look at that! It seems, then, that holiness is
   the road to knowledge! God has made it so. If any man

   will do His will, he shall know of His doctrine. If you read and study,
   and cannot make out the meaning of Scripture, get up and do
   something--and it may be, in the doing of it, you shall discover the
   secret. Holiness of heart shall increase the illumination of your mind!

   Will you kindly observe that this knowledge rises in tone? Paul first
   prayed that they "might be filled with the knowledge of God's will."
   But now he implores for them an increase in the knowledge of God,
   Himself! Oh, blessed growth! First to know the Law and then to know the
   Lawgiver! First to know the precept, and then to know the mouth from
   which it comes! This is the height of knowledge--to see Christ and know
   the Father, and learn how to say from the heart--"Truly our fellowship
   is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ." I would call your
   willing attention to another thought. The Apostle, if he is to be
   judged according to his outward language, often utters impossible
   things, and yet his every sentence is not only full of deep meaning,
   but is strictly correct!

   Notice his language here--in the 9th verse he says, "that you might be
   filled with the knowledge of His will." Can anything go beyond this?
   The vessel is filled right up to the brim! What more can it have? Yet
   the Apostle says, "increasing in the knowledge of God." What can that
   mean? If the mind is full to the brim, how can it receive more? If the
   man is full of knowledge, how can his knowledge increase? Can there be
   any increase after that? I propose to you the riddle. Here is the
   answer--make the vessel larger--and then there can be an increase. This
   solution of the difficulty requires no great wit to discover. So Paul
   plainly teaches us here, that if we have so increased in knowledge as
   to be full, he would have us increased in capacity to know yet more!

   He would have our manhood enlarged and our powers of reception
   increased so that we might grow from being children to be young
   men--and from young men to be fathers, and so may be filled--filled
   always! Filled with all the fullness of God! The Lord grant unto us to
   perceive with humility that if we are already full of knowledge, we can
   still advance, for we "have not yet attained." Let no man think that he
   can go no further! "There is," says Augustine, "a certain perfection
   according to the measure of this life. And it belongs to that
   perfection that such a perfect man should know that he is not yet
   perfect." To that I heartily subscribe! There is a certain fullness to
   be found in this life according to the measure of a man. And it belongs
   to that fullness that the man should know that he can yet increase in
   knowledge!

   Holy Bernard says, "He is not good at all who does not desire to be
   better." I also subscribe to that saying! Some might become good if
   they were not puffed up with the fancy of their own perfection. Others
   are somewhat commendable, but will never grow because they judge
   themselves to be already full-grown. I would have you filled and yet
   have room for more--filled with all knowledge, filled with all
   holiness, filled with the indwelling Spirit, filled with God-- and yet
   increasing in knowledge, in holiness, in likeness to God and in all
   good things forevermore to His Glory! The Lord add His blessing for
   Jesus' sake. Amen.

A Loving Entreaty

   (No. 1743)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 7, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Put Me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare you, that you
   may bejustified.'" Isaiah 43:26.

   We shall mainly dwell upon the first invitation of the text--"Put Me in
   remembrance." If you will cast your eyes upon the Scripture, itself,
   you will be struck with its singular position--it makes a paradox of
   the most striking kind if you read it in connection with the preceding
   clause--"I, even I, am He that blots out your transgressions for My own
   sake, and will not remember your sins. Put Me in remembrance." [Remind
   Me.] This looks like a contradiction, but, as a wise teacher will win
   attention by dark sayings, so does the Word of God abound in
   expressions by which thought is excited and the lesson is more deeply
   impressed upon the mind. Many are the paradoxes of the Prophets and of
   the Lord and Leader of all the Prophets. Who can read without attention
   two such sentences as these in succession--"I will not remember your
   sins," and, "Put me in remembrance"?

   The use of such paradoxes in Scripture needs no sort of apology. Man is
   a living riddle. Does any man understand himself? He may think he does,
   but by this conceit he betrays his ignorance! The sinner is a paradox,
   but the saint is a double paradox! I say it is meet and right that the
   Holy Spirit should thus use paradoxical expressions because those whom
   He addresses have paradoxes lying deep in their nature and so the
   speech is congruous to the listener. In this verse man is invited to
   draw near to God. Those same men, of whom God says that He was weary of
   them, are bid to plead with Him. "You have burdened Me with your sins,
   you have wearied Me with your iniquities." And yet it is evident that
   in another sense the Lord was not weary of them, for He calls upon them
   to come to a conference with Him, saying, "Put Me in remembrance: let
   us plead together."

   This approach to God is the way of our salvation! The first thing that
   must be done with some men is to make them think of God at all--and the
   best thing that can be done with any man is to draw him nearer and yet
   nearer to the great Father of spirits. "It is good for me to draw near
   to God," said one who knew right well what he was speaking of--and
   every man who does not yet understand such an utterance will find it to
   be true if he will test it! Here is a commandment with promise--"Draw
   near to God and He will draw near to you." Here is another--"Seek you
   the Lord while He may be found, call you upon Him while He is near: let
   the wicked forsake His ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and
   let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to
   our God, for He will abundantly pardon."

   Nearness to God is evidently the hope of the seeker! For the prodigal
   in the distant country, the most essential thing was that he should
   arise and go to his father. It would have been of little use for him to
   have washed himself from the filth of the swine trough, or to have
   broken off his acquaintance with the citizens of that country. He could
   never be right while he dwelt so far from his father's house. The most
   sober and secluded life in the far country would not have satisfied the
   cravings of his heart any more than the husks would have filled his
   belly! True, it would have been some improvement upon spending his
   living riotously, but it would have worked no change in his soul and
   given no rest to his heart. The remedy is the father's kiss, the
   father's bosom, the father's house, the father's love!

   Understand my text, then, however paradoxical it may seem, as being a
   genuine invitation on the part of a gracious God to the most provoking
   of men. Though they have acted so wickedly that He may well be tired of
   them, He presses them to hold conversation with Him! If anything has
   been charged upon them in error, He is willing to hear their
   complaints--He only longs that they will not keep at a sullen distance
   from Him. God grant that the invitation may be accepted by those of you
   to whom it will, this morning, be addressed!

   We shall regard our text thus. First, it is a humbling challenge--"Put
   Me in remembrance: let us plead together." Secondly, as we cannot
   answer the challenge, we will put another sense upon the words and
   accept them in an amended

   version--such as penitence can carry out. And, thirdly, we shall see in
   it a practical suggestion--perhaps more than one. May the Holy Spirit
   enable us to learn the lessons and carry out the suggestions!

   I. First, then, our text appears before us as A HUMBLING CHALLENGE. God
   had punished Israel on account of sin. Israel was not penitent and in
   self-righteousness judged that the Lord was harsh and severe. "Come,
   then," says God, "come and plead your case with Me. Put Me in
   remembrance of any virtues on your part which I may have overlooked. If
   I have misjudged you; if you have not really been neglectful of My
   service and worship, let the matter be rectified. If you really have a
   righteousness of your own, put Me in remembrance of it."

   On looking back we find that the Lord had charged His people with
   neglect of prayer--"But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob." This is
   the charge which we are compelled to bring against all unconverted men
   and women--you do not call upon God--you live without sincere and
   fervent prayer. Perhaps you offer a form of prayer, but that is nothing
   if your heart does not go with the words. This is rather to mock God
   than truly to call upon Him! But come now, if there is any mistake in
   this charge, disprove it. If you have earnestly called upon the Lord
   through Christ Jesus. If you have been diligent in seeking His face and
   yet He has turned His back upon you--testify against Him! It will be a
   new thing under the sun to find a praying heart rejected at the Throne
   of Grace. I know you cannot deny the accusation of prayerlessness. If
   you are Christless, you are prayerless! If you have received no mercy
   it is because you have not sought it at the Mercy Seat.

   Next the Lord charged Israel that they had not delighted in Him--"You
   have been weary of Me, O Israel." Is not this a charge which cannot be
   denied? You men and women who are not regenerate and have never
   received the pardon of your sin--is it not true that you are weary of
   God? You readily enough grow tired of a sermon in which we try to speak
   of Him, though you would listen for hours to a silly tale. You become
   tired of the Lord's Day. What a weariness it is! You are weary of the
   Bible--how little you read it! A foolish novel suits you better. If you
   hear Christians talking wisely and seriously of the things of Christ,
   you have no liking for their words--you would rather listen to a comic
   song! To you, the House of God is the temple of dullness and the
   worship of God is bondage! As for God, Himself, you will not allow
   yourself to remember Him--He is not in all your thoughts. You sometimes
   think that even Heaven, itself, would be a weary place for you if it is
   the praising and adoring of God and communion with Him. Can you deny
   this? If you can, you are invited to state your innocence before the
   Lord.

   But I know that in truth you cannot raise the question, for there is
   within your mind an unquestionable aversion to the service of God. In
   fact, you would feel happier if there were no God and if thoughts of
   eternity never intruded themselves! Take heed lest your aversion become
   mutual and God should say, "My soul loathed them, and their soul also
   abhorred Me." The Lord had also said that these people did not honor
   Him--"You have not brought Me the small cattle of your burnt offerings;
   neither have you honored Me with your sacrifices." It may be you have
   presented no tokens of love to the Lord at all. Or, on the other hand,
   you may have brought sacrifices, but you have not honored God with
   them. You have given that you might be known to give, or because others
   gave--but not with the view of honoring God.

   You come and sit with His people and join in their songs, but you do
   not seek the Glory of God! Nor is this the main objective of your daily
   life--you know it is not! Yet if it is so--if any unconverted man can
   say that whether he eats or drinks, or whatever he does, he seeks to do
   all to the glory of God, this ought to be known! It would be a new
   thing under the sun! In truth, it would prove that the man was
   converted and had been renewed in the spirit of his mind by the Grace
   of God! But it is not so--you have not honored the name of your Creator
   and Benefactor! You have robbed Him of the Glory due His name!

   Moreover, the Lord charged Israel that they did not love Him--"You have
   bought me no sweet cane with money, neither have you filled me with the
   fat of your sacrifices." No token of love had been presented, but they
   had made idols to serve with their sins. The purchase of oil with money
   had not come into their thoughts. They could not afford it, they
   said--but when they were worshipping their false gods they could find
   money enough--"They lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the
   balance." And so there are men who cannot afford to give anything to
   the cause of God or Christian charity, but for their sinful pleasures
   they can waste their substance! No sacrifice is too expensive for a
   man's lusts--he will do anything that he may live a merry life--which
   merry life consists in rebellion against God! This proves that man has
   no love in his heart for God! O Sinner, did you ever feel a tear start
   in your eyes at the thought of God's being dishonored? Did you ever
   humble yourself before God because you have, yourself, dishonored Him?
   Is His Word

   dear to you? Is there music in the sweet name of Jesus to your ears?
   No, it is not so! You know you are dead to all this. He challenges you
   to plead your innocence if you can! Dare you take up the glove? Prove
   that you have loved Him! Remind Him of your kindly deeds and zealous
   acts! You have none to bring to remembrance! Your heart has had no
   delight in the Lord your God!

   The Lord again challenges them upon the charge that they had not obeyed
   Him--"You have burdened Me with your sins"--you have burdened Me with
   your waywardness. "You have wearied Me with your iniquities"--God's
   patience was tried to the utmost with their wanton wickedness! Is not
   this charge true--sadly true, of many? Oh, you that have never accepted
   Christ, nor cast yourselves at His dear feet--you have, by this willful
   refusal of love, insulted the mercy of the Lord! You have had no
   respect of His Law! You have not checked yourself because you were
   likely to offend! You have not stirred yourself up to please the Lord!
   Ah no, on the contrary, you have lived as if you were your own masters!
   If it is not so, you are now challenged to vindicate your characters.
   Do not set up a lying defense, but speak the truth. "Put Me in
   remembrance," God says. If you have abounded in prayer; if you have
   delighted in God; if you have sought His honor; if you have loved Him;
   if you have obeyed Him, then set out your righteousness before the sun
   and be not afraid!

   But you are not innocent before the Lord. Therefore humble yourselves,
   confess your guilt and cover your face before the Lord. The Lord would
   thus humble you that you may repent--and that He may fulfill His Word
   to you--"I, even I, am He that blots out your transgressions for My own
   sake, and will not remember your sins." The challenge before us is
   occupied not only with the ways of man, but with the ways of God, for
   the Lord, here, asserts of Himself, "I have not caused you to serve
   with an offering, nor wearied you with incense." That is to say, God is
   no hard taskmaster. He is not an austere man, gathering where He has
   not sown. The Commandments of God are essential justice--you could not
   improve upon them! No law could be more for our benefit than that which
   He has given us. The service of God is not bondage!

   Ask His children how they find it. When they take His yoke upon them
   and learn of Him, they find rest for their souls. His ways are ways of
   pleasantness and all His paths are peace. Perfect obedience is Heaven!
   If God has treated you like slaves. If He has exacted of you more than
   His right. If He has made your heart heavy with endless labors, then
   say so, and state your grievance in solemn conversation with God! Only
   speak with Him! But who in his right senses will say that the service
   of God is anything but liberty? O Beloved! When God forbids us
   anything, it is because He knows it would be for our harm! And when God
   commands us to do anything, it is because He knows that it is for our
   soul's welfare and eternal good. The moral law is the mirror of
   right--the will of the Lord as therein revealed, commends itself so
   thoroughly to the conscience of man that he cannot wage an honest
   warfare with it--it is "true and righteous altogether."

   If we are upright in our judgments, our desire will be, "Oh that my
   ways were directed to keep Your statutes!" If we offend against the Law
   of God it is not because it is unreasonable, unjust, or unkind. His
   yoke is easy and His burden is light. It is so, most surely so. Though
   I feel myself quite unable to plead the cause of God worthily as I
   would desire, I could stand here and weep because of the manner in
   which His creatures treat Him! I feel ashamed of myself that I can so
   coldly vindicate His cause which deserves a far better advocate than I.
   But have you not, you that are ungodly, have you not treated the Lord
   shamefully? Have you not forgotten Him who never forgets you? Have you
   not turned your backs on your Benefactor and your Friend? Have you not
   refused the service which would have afforded your souls a deep
   delight? Have you not quarreled with your mercies and fought against
   Heaven, itself?

   It is surely so. If you have anything to plead to the contrary, argue
   it with your Maker! Only do not continue to keep away from Him. Turn
   unto Him and answer His appeal, "Put Me in remembrance: let us plead
   together: declare you, that you may be justified."

   II. I hope you will be prepared to follow me while our penitence
   suggests AN AMENDED VERSION. I do not mean an alteration of the words,
   but of the sense. Let us take the text as our consciousness of guilt
   desires to read it. There are certain things which God, in great love,
   invites us to bring before His memory. What are these? Let me tell you.
   If you cannot take up His challenge and prove your personal
   righteousness, let the charges stand with your silence as an assent to
   them! And now plead with Him and remind Him of matters which may serve
   your turn and lead to your forgiveness.

   First, remind the Lord of that glorious act of amnesty and oblivion
   which, in Sovereign Grace, He has proclaimed to the sons of men in the
   preceding verse. Come, now, all guilty and defiled, and say to Him,
   "Lord, though my iniquities testify against me, I rest upon Your
   forgiving word, 'I, even I, am He that blots out your iniquities for My
   own sake, and

   will not remember your sins.'" Remember that God has not forgotten to
   be gracious; neither has He changed a single declaration of His mercy.
   Still, He would have you remind Him of them as earnestly as if He had
   forgotten them! It is not for the refreshment of His memory, but for
   yours, that He wishes you to remind Him!

   Never will you find a safer position as a sinner than kneeling at the
   Mercy Seat, pleading such words as these-- "Come now, and let us reason
   together, says the Lord: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be
   as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as
   wool." "I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and
   their iniquities will I remember no more." "If we confess our sins, He
   is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
   unrighteousness." At once and with broken language remind the Lord of
   His gracious promises and say, "Remember Your Words unto Your servant,
   upon which You have caused me to hope." Cry to Him after this fashion,
   "Lord, do as You have said! Here is one who is full of iniquity. I pray
   You cleanse me! If I had no transgressions You could not blot them
   out--but here they are--I beseech You, blot them out according to Your
   Words! Behold, I remind You of Your Words. "O Lord, let me hear You
   say--'Your sins, which are many, are forgiven.'

   That done, proceed to remind the Lord of your sins. Make an open
   unreserved acknowledgment unto the Lord. Tell Him that you have
   transgressed. Say with the returning prodigal, "I have sinned against
   Heaven and before You, and am no more worthy to be called Your son."
   Hide nothing, for nothing can be hidden--conceal nothing, for it cannot
   be concealed. You can be sure your sin will find you out! Therefore,
   find out your sin and surrender it into the hands of the great God,
   that He may deal with it! Especially put the Lord in remembrance of
   this--that you have sinned against One who has continued to pardon you
   and, therefore, you have sinned in a most cruel and ungrateful manner.
   It puts an exceedingly heinousness into sin, that it is an offense
   against One who so freely forgives it!

   The Lord might long ago have cast us into Hell, and yet He spares
   us--shall we find in this a liberty to offend yet more? "He has not
   dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our
   iniquities." And this fact makes perseverance in rebellion a scarlet
   sin! Confess this, also, that you have continued by your sins to go
   away from Him who invites you to return and promises you a welcome
   reception. Remember, if you are still out of Christ, it is not because
   God has made you so. He takes an oath, "As I live, says the Lord God, I
   have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn
   from his way and live." He will not have your damnation laid at His
   door! He expressly says, "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself!" And
   the tender Savior cries, "You will not come to Me that you might have
   life."

   Acknowledge the truth of this. Though you may have foolishly boasted of
   your free will, before, now be humbled about that wicked will of yours
   which threatens to be your destruction! On your knees cry to the Lord
   for the pardon of offenses against His mercy and the forgiveness of
   provocations against His long-suffering! He invites you to do it and,
   therefore, He says, "Put me in remembrance." When you have done this,
   if your spirit is much depressed and your heart is driven to despair by
   a sense of your guilt, then I would advise you to remind the Lord of
   the extraordinary reason which He gives for pardoning sin--"I, even I,
   am He that blots out your transgressions for My own sake." Say unto
   Him-- "Lord, there is no reason in me why You should spare me, but do
   it for Your own sake--for Your love's sake, for Your mercy's sake. You
   have said that You delight in mercy! Lord, delight Yourself in having
   mercy upon me! It is to Your glory to pass by transgression--it greatly
   honors the Lord Jesus Christ when He puts away the guilt of men! Lord,
   I pray You, now for Your own sake, for Your Son's sake, to cast a veil
   over all my former iniquities and let me be reconciled to You by the
   death of Your Son."

   I fear dear Hearers, that I do not speak this as I ought to speak it. I
   wish I could weep over you while I plead with you! I implore you at
   once to honestly and affectionately obey the exhortation of the text.
   Come, I beseech you, hear your Father say, "Put me in remembrance: let
   us plead together." Remind the Lord of His sovereign Grace and of His
   all-sufficient power to bless! Remind Him that He has taken the vilest
   of the vile and washed them in the blood of Jesus; that He has taken
   the hardest and most obdurate hearts and softened them to the praise of
   the glory of His Grace! And then add, "Lord, do all this in me, that I,
   too, may magnify Your gracious name!" When you have gone as far as that
   in putting God in remembrance, I would, with much affection, advise you
   to plead the Lord's purpose and intent revealed in the 21st
   verse--"This people have I formed for Myself; they shall show forth My
   praise."

   Say, "Lord, I am Your poor creature. You have made me; even my very
   body is fearfully and wonderfully made; and the mysterious thing which
   dwells within me, which I call my soul, is also the creature of Your
   power. Have You not made me for Yourself? Will You not have a desire to
   the work of Your own hands? Lord, come and bless me! Sinner as I

   am, and utterly undeserving, yet I am Your creature! Do not fling me
   upon the dunghill. If You will forgive me, Lord, might I not praise
   You? Is there not room, somewhere, for me to give You thanks? In earth,
   or in Heaven, may I not yet render to You some little service and
   magnify Your name? Now, Lord, I dishonor You while I live in sin, but I
   shall glorify You if You make me holy. I am as a worthless vessel, only
   fit to be cast with the broken potsherds--of no use to You or man, and
   scarcely of use even to myself. But in my person I beseech You, fulfill
   Your Words, 'This people have I formed for Myself; they shall show
   forth My praise.'"

   This is good arguing! After this fashion obey the word--"Put Me in
   remembrance: let us plead together." If that does not ease you, go a
   little further back in the chapter till you come to the 19th
   verse--"Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall
   you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers
   in the desert. The beasts of the field shall honor Me, the dragons and
   the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the
   deserts to give drink to My people, My chosen." Plead that published
   declaration! Say, "Lord, You have said, 'I will do a new thing.' It
   will indeed be a new thing if I am saved! I am driven to such
   self-abhorrence, that if ever I am saved I shall be a leading wonder
   among your miracles of Grace."--

   "Saved!--The deed shall spread new glory Through the shining realms
   above! Angels sing the pleasing story, All enraptured with Your love!"

   It may be you can say--"Lord, I have been sighing, crying and groaning,
   now, by the months together, and I can find no peace. Oh, if You will
   but put a new song into my mouth, the dragons and the owls that saw me
   in my gloom shall open their eyes and be astonished and honor the Lord
   God of Israel!" You have come to be familiar in your gloom with strange
   company, comparable to the dragons and the owls--therefore cry unto
   your Redeemer, "Lord, save me, and the owls will hoot no longer, or if
   they do, they will hoot to Your praise and the very dragons that all
   men dread shall become comfortable things and begin to magnify Your
   name, as said the Psalmist, 'Praise Him you dragons, and all deeps.'" I
   know some who might say, "Lord, it will fill all the workshop with
   wonder if I shall rejoice in Jesus. All my friends and companions will
   be amazed that I should become happy and holy through Sovereign Grace.
   I am the very last person they would have thought to see converted!
   Then will they know what Your arm can do and confess that this is the
   finger of God! Men that could not open their mouths except to blaspheme
   You, Lord, shall stand awe-struck and astonished as they see what a
   brand is plucked from the burning."

   You see I have tried to help you in obeying this Word of God--"Put me
   in remembrance." But I cannot do the work for you. Dear unconverted
   Hearers, you must, yourselves, make confession and plead for your
   lives. This pleading must be worked in you by the Spirit of God--and if
   it is, I could almost wish to be a mouse in your chamber, that I might
   listen to you while you are reminding the gracious Father of His
   promises and of the Glory which will come to His name if He will save
   you! Especially would I like to hear you begin thus--"Lord, remember
   Your only-begotten Son. Have You not declared that it is a faithful
   saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the
   world to save sinners? I am a sinner, Lord, save me! Oh, remember
   Gethsemane! Remember Calvary! Remember the bloody sweat! Remember the
   wounds of your Well-Beloved! Remember the cry, 'It is finished!' and
   give Him to see of the travail of His soul in me! Give me as a spoil to
   the Risen One, that in me He may see the reward for His pains!"

   That is the style of pleading! This will, before long, bring you rest
   and ease. God help you not only to hear me now with attention, but to
   go and see to the doing of it! I fear and tremble lest my labor should
   be lost through your failing to come to the mark. In vain do you listen
   if you do not obey!

   III. So this brings me to the last point, which is this--our text
   affords us some PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS. If the Lord says to us, "Put Me
   in remembrance," then, in the first place, it is very clear that we
   ought to remember these things ourselves. We cannot remind another of a
   thing which we, ourselves, forget! Come, then, let us, for a time,
   remind ourselves of certain matters which we are prone to cast behind
   us. Going over the same ground which I have traversed before, I shall
   make no apology, since my desire is that God's Spirit may impress it
   upon your hearts.

   Oh, you that are not saved, remember the years in which you have lived
   without prayer! What a wonder that you have been permitted to live at
   all! Morning light and evening shade--and yet no prayer! Mercies on the
   table, mercies in the family, mercies to your body, mercies to your
   soul--and yet no prayer! Sermons heard, exhortations given, gentle
   entreaties all thrown away--but still there has been no prayer! "You
   have not called upon Me, O Jacob." It is not good

   to take our sins in the whole, but to set them out, in detail, one
   after the other. Here is God ready to pardon and we would not even ask
   for forgiveness! Here is God waiting to be gracious and we have kept
   Him waiting these 40 years! Here is mercy's door before us and we will
   not knock, though there is a promise that it shall be opened to every
   knocker! Here is Jesus, Himself, knocking at our door till His head is
   wet with dew and His locks with the drops of the night--and yet we will
   not open! Remember that! Let this transgression come before us and
   cause us deep repentance and self-humiliation.

   Remember, next, for your own humbling, how weary you have been of God.
   I went over that just now, but think of it! Here is a creature that
   cannot endure to think of its Creator! Here is one that has daily fed
   at the table of a Friend and yet he never gives that Friend a good
   word. Living where God's works are all around you so that you cannot
   help but see them, when even the night does but unveil a new scene of
   wonder as it shows you the stars that were hidden by day, yet you can
   look upon all that wondrous scene and refuse to see your God! You were
   tired of God! You did not want to hear about Him, wished there were no
   God and no eternity, and that you could just enjoy yourself like the
   beasts do who live only in the present! Ah me! Think of this, and so
   let your sin come to remembrance--you have been willing to be a beast
   rather than serve God and be as the angels.

   Some I would earnestly urge to remember long years of neglect of God's
   service and all their neglect to the cause of God; all their lack of
   love to God; all the many times in which they have hardened their
   hearts, stopped their ears and refused the warnings and invitations of
   their Savior. Such memories might be used of the Holy Spirit for their
   conviction. Oh, dear, unconverted Hearers, am I speaking the truth
   about you or not? God forbid I should bring a false accusation against
   any man! I am not charging you, now, with the blacker and more open
   sins, for perhaps you are innocent of them, but yet this is the sin of
   some--forgetfulness of God, weariness of His service, refusal to
   receive the salvation of His Son. "This is the condemnation, that Light
   is come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light." You
   think of your business--salvation causes you no concern. Think of that!
   You put your dying body before your immortal soul!

   You are full of care and anxiety about matters which relate only to a
   span of time--yet you care not for your eternal interests! Can you
   justify this? Are you in your senses? Why do you act so foolishly?
   There is a God whose smile is Heaven and whose frown is Hell--and yet
   you ignore His existence and neither seek Him nor serve Him! I know I
   plead badly, but my cause is a good one, and if you are right at heart
   you will feel its force. Ought not the wrongs done to God be admitted
   and forsaken? Say, dear Hearer, "I remember my faults this day and
   remembering them I will arise and go unto my Father, and remind Him,
   that I may be forgiven."

   My faith sees the Lord standing here blotting out the debts of all who
   will bring them to His remembrance! Come, bring your bills! Hand in the
   record of your debts to Justice! Spread them, now, before the face of
   the Lord, not that He may condemn you for them, but that He may stamp
   them with the atoning blood and say, "I have blotted out your sins." Do
   not hesitate to remind the Lord of them, for then He promises to forget
   them! I am sure if I could stand here tomorrow and exercise the power
   to remit all debts by giving a receipt in full for them all--and if the
   one condition were that each debtor would produce his schedule of
   debts--I say I am sure no one would be backward in doing so!

   You who owe anything would search your files, rake out your drawers and
   look in every place to find every unpaid account--as to have them all
   blotted out! I pray you do so in this spiritual business! Bring your
   sins to remembrance by humble acknowledgment and penitent confession,
   for, "if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins." O Spirit of God, support this appeal to these, my Hearers, and
   send it home to the hearts of Your chosen, that they may confess their
   iniquities unto You and be saved this very day!

   A second practical suggestion is this--since the text says, "Put Me in
   remembrance: let us plead together," it is time that we should now
   begin our pleading with God. He says, "Come now, and let us reason
   together." Let us not be so unreasonable as to refuse! I am once more
   going over the same ground, just as schoolmasters do with their pupils,
   teaching the same lesson over, again, that it may be thoroughly
   learned. I do so long for the troubled sinner to find the way of peace
   at once that I would beseech him to begin pleading with God at this
   moment. Plead thus--"Lord, there stand Your Words, 'I am He that blots
   out your transgressions'--I entreat You make those Words true for me!"
   Appealing to the faithfulness of God is a grand argument. To lay hold
   of God by His promise is the main part of the art of wrestling in
   prayer. No grip of the Covenant Angel is half so sure as that which
   faith gets when she seizes a promise. This is, as it were, the hem of
   Jehovah's robe! Blessed is he that can hold it, for it will never tear
   away!

   He that holds a promise holds the God who gave it, and he shall not
   trust the promise in vain. "Has the Lord said, and will He not do it?"
   Plead it, then! "Lord, You have said that You forgive sin. I pray You,
   forgive mine! Had You never promised pardon, I could never have dreamed
   of gaining it. But since You have promised it, I dare not doubt Your
   Word. My blackest, foulest, filthiest sins can be washed away, for You
   tell me that all manner of sin and of blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
   men. I urge Your Words as my only claim. I implore You to carry out
   Your Words." We read that out of Christ's mouth there goes a two-edged
   sword--may not His Word of promise be to us as a sword with which we
   may overcome even mercy itself--conquering Heaven by Heaven's own
   weapons? Oh that you may have faith enough to try this at once! Be sure
   you do not forget to use in your pleading that verse about God being
   honored by the dragons and the owls.

   Say, "Lord, this very room in which I have cried to You, of late, for
   mercy beams witness to my sighs and groans and deep sorrows. But if You
   will grant me Grace, it shall ring with Your praises. I have dwelt
   spiritually with owls and dragons, but if You will forgive me, these
   shall honor You! Lord, if You do but set me free, You will have won a
   new singer for the choirs of earth and for the orchestra of Heaven! Oh,
   my Savior, I know my poor praises cannot make You more glorious, for
   You are Divinely great, but still, such as they are, they shall be laid
   at Your feet." Next, plead with the Lord that He will have won your
   heart by His Grace. He evidently desires it, for He complains, "You
   have bought Me no sweet came with money, neither have you filled Me
   with the fat of your sacrifices."

   Does God care for sweet cane? Does He delight in burning fat? Ah no!
   But He does care to see His people making a self-sacrifice--to prove
   their love by presenting something to their Lord which cost them
   dearly. He condescends to accept at their hands their love tokens and
   He takes much pleasure in them. Now tell Him, "Lord, I am not worthy of
   Your acceptance, but still, if You will but save me, I will be all
   Yours, and all that I have shall be laid upon the altar. Lord, I must
   love You! I have nothing whereof to glory in that love, for how can I
   help it? I am under constraint to love You because You first loved me!
   I am a captive to Grace! I am bound hand and foot by the cords of Your
   love! When I have dared to entertain a hope that You would look upon me
   in mercy, I have felt my stony heart dissolve and my soul has gone out
   after You with strong desires. If Your great love will, indeed, stoop
   to me, and to the putting away of all my sin, then my whole heart shall
   be bound to You forever and I will magnify Your name as long as I have
   any being."

   This is good pleading! Be sure you use it with deep sincerity and true
   humility. Then plead the argument which lies in the words, "for My own
   sake." Cry, "Lord, save me for the glory of Your own name, that men may
   know how gracious You are! There is room in me for the display of all
   the wonders of Your love, for I have been one of the chief sinners. O
   Lord, prove the power of the cleansing blood of Jesus by washing me,
   that I may be whiter than snow. I have shown a harder heart than most
   of my fellows. Oh that Your Spirit would display the energy of His
   operations by turning this stone to flesh! Lord, I have been
   unbelieving, yes, desperately full of doubt and unbelief. Oh,
   demonstrate in me the truth that faith is the gift of God! If you save
   all the world besides me and save not me, there will be a note lacking
   in the music of Your mercy, for in some respects I stand alone, a
   special sinner!

   "But, Lord, if You save me, You will put Your finger on a string that
   will give forth a note such as can come from no other string in all the
   universe! You will have saved the most worthless of all--the one who
   can do least for You in return. You will have shown how gratuitous is
   Your mercy by bestowing it upon one who has no past merit, no present
   worth, no future hope of doing great things for You." Thus plead with
   God and may the Wonderful, the Counselor, direct your pleading till you
   prevail!

   Finish all pleadings with the argument of the precious blood, for that
   shall prevail where all else is driven back. "I believe in the
   forgiveness of sins"--thousands say this when they repeat the creed!
   But they do not feel that they are sinners and, therefore, they find it
   very easy to believe in forgiveness. But, believe me, when a man knows
   and feels that he is, in very deed, a sinner before God, it is a
   miracle for him to believe in the forgiveness of sins! Nothing but the
   Omnipotence of the Holy Spirit can work this faith in him! When you
   really know what it is to be lost and condemned, so that you receive
   the sentence of death in your own conscience, then it is a brave thing
   to believe in pardoning Grace! Some of us remember when it seemed like
   mocking us for people to say, "Believe, Believe!" for we felt that it
   was one thing to say, "I believe," and quite another thing to possess
   the faith of God's elect! When God the Holy Spirit comes to reveal
   Jesus to us--and the poor empty sinner is plunged into Christ's
   fullness--then there is glory to God both from the sinner's faith and
   from the Object of that faith.

   God is magnified in the work of Grace, for it is His from top to
   bottom! In the heart of the saved one is heard the voice, "I, even I,
   am the Lord; and besides Me there is no Savior." Lofty looks are laid
   low and boasting is excluded. Humility rules the mind and obedience
   walks hand in hand with it. Then do renewed hearts cry, "O Lord our
   God, other lords beside You have had dominion over us: but by You only
   will we make mention of Your name."

   Thus have I tried to plead with you for the Lord, wishing only your
   good and His Glory! I am very conscious of my own weakness, much more
   so, perhaps, than ever I was in my life--but yet I expect to succeed
   with many of you! What am I apart from the Spirit of all Grace? What am
   I but as a sounding brass and as a tinkling cymbal? And yet I am not
   feebler than other servants of God in this respect, for we are all
   nothing apart from the Spirit--

   "Till God diffuse His Graces down,

   Like showers of heavenly rain,

   In vain Apollos sows the ground,

   And Paul may plant in vain."

   Blessed be God we shall not plant in vain, for He is with us! Some of
   you have received the message and I shall hear from you soon. Let it
   sink into the spirits of all of you. Do you feel any degree of softness
   creeping over you? Yield to it! It is the blessed Spirit now inclining
   you to repent, making you feel serious and thoughtful--anxious and
   desirous. Bow before His heavenly breath as the rush by the river
   yields to the wind! Yours shall be the benefit, but to the sweet Spirit
   of Love, together with the Father and the Son, shall be Glory forever
   and ever! Amen and Amen!

Where The "If" Lies

   (No. 1744)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, October 14th, 1883, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [3]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to
   him that believeth." Mark 9:23.

   I  BELIEVE THAT OUR OWN Authorized Version conveys to the mind of the
   reader the sense intended by the Evangelist; it is, however,
   exceedingly probable that in exact words the Revised Version is nearer
   to the original. It runs thus"And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst!
   All things are possible to him that believeth." Our own Version better
   expresses the sense to the general reader, and the main object of a
   translation is to give the meaning. The father of the lunatic child had
   said to our Lord, "If thou canst do anything, have compassion on us,
   and help us;" and our divine Master virtually replies, "If thou canst
   lies not with me, but with thee. It is not if I can, but if thou
   canst." Thus you see the word "believe" is implied if not actually
   expressed. Jesus would certainly go as far as ever the man's faith
   could go; but as the rule of the kingdom is, "According to thy faith,
   so be it unto thee," the man's unbelief would hamper the Lord in his
   working. If the suppliant could be rid of unbelief, Jesus would get rid
   of the devil from his child. The difficulty of casting out the demon
   lay mainly in the want of faith in the father. Let it, then, be
   understood as the teaching of this text, that the difficulties in the
   way of souls that would be saved do not lie with Jesus Christ, but with
   themselves. They need never ask the question, "Can Jesus forgive?" or
   "Can he renew?" there is a prior questionCanst thou believe that he
   can forgive, and that he can renew? If God's grace enables thee to say,
   "I can and do believe that Jesus can work in me according to the full
   measure of my need," then all difficulty has vanished. Thy faith is the
   shadow of the coming blessing, the token of the Lord's favor towards
   thee. When thy faith believes in Christ's omnipotence, he is omnipotent
   to thee, for "all things are possible to him that believeth."

   I long at this time to get at some here who cannot get at Christ. I
   would to God that by his Spirit I may deal with their difficulties, so
   as to remove them once for all, so that they may come just as they are,
   and put their trust in Jesus, and find eternal life this day.

   I. The first subject we shall speak about is the vital questionWHAT IS
   BELIEVING? After all these hundreds of years of gospel preaching, is
   this question necessary? I believe it is so necessary that, if faith
   were explained in every sermon, it would not be too often spoken of. It
   is a good rule that every tract ought to contain the gospel; and it
   ought to be put in the plainest way, for still, despite all the gospel
   teaching which is around us, nothing is so little known or so little
   understood as faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. I am also bound to admit
   that many explanations of faith are all explanation, but tend to make
   the subject darker than it was before; and I am fearful lest my own
   explanation should be of the like order. Certainly, I will do my best
   to avoid such a catastrophe, for I will speak very plainly.

   Let us take the man before us as an example, and from him let us see
   what faith is. This man evidently believed that Jesus was a healer, for
   he says, " I brought my son unto thee." He would not have brought his
   son to Jesus if he had not felt some measure of confidence in him. It
   is a good beginning of faith to know that if I am saved it must be
   through Jesus Christ alone; it is well to be aware that the salvation
   of the soul must come from the work of Jesus, and from no one else,
   since no other name is given among men whereby we must be saved. This
   man had also some slight faith in Christ's willingness to help him. It
   may not have been very strong, but still it was there, or else he would
   not have laid the stress of his prayer upon the Lord's power; he did
   not say "if thou wilt thou canst," but "if thou canst do anything, have
   compassion on us, and help us." Looking up into that blessed face so
   full of singular tenderness, the man felt that he might say, "Have
   compassion on us." From some persons we could not ask compassion or
   fellow-feeling, because they do not appear to have any; they wear a
   harsh look, and a chill air surrounds them; but the Savior was not so;
   the man felt that Jesus was full of compassion his suit was that this
   compassion would show itself to him and his son. It is a good beginning
   to saving faith if thou believest that Jesus is witting to save thee. I
   trust that many of you have advanced as far as this.

   What is it really and savingly to believe in Jesus? The suppliant
   father had not yet reached that point of faith which would secure the
   miracle. More was needed; what was it? He needed to believe in Christ's
   power in reference to his own case. The point in which his faith failed
   was our Lord's power as to the special case now before him, for he
   said"If thou canst do anything." Before you condemn the anxious father
   for his doubt, let me remind you that his son was in a very evil
   plight, and our Lord had just caused him to remember and review the sad
   features of the case. The father had sorrowfully dilated upon the fact
   that "wheresoever the spirit taketh him, he teareth him: and he
   foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away;" and then he had
   further told the Lord that the youth had suffered thus ever since he
   was a child; and he had gone still more into detail, saying, "Ofttimes
   it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him."
   After that painful detail he added his pitiful "If thou canst." Do you
   wonder at it? Jesus seems to tell him, "If thou canst believe in the
   teeth of all this, then thou shalt see the salvation of God." It is
   very easy to say, "I believe" when you have no sense of your sin, and
   no consciousness of your danger. It is the easiest thing in the world
   to say, "Yes, Christ can save me," when you do not really believe that
   you need saving. Faith, where there is no present sense of need, is but
   the image of faith, and not the grace, which saves the soul. This is
   the question: can you, my dear hearer, at this moment trust Jesus to
   save you, though you feel that you are full of sin? Can you say, "Lord,
   I am possessed with the spirit of evil: I am under bondage to him, and
   have been so since I was a child? I have been driven to one sin and so
   cast into the fire, and then I have been hurled into the opposite sin,
   and so thrown into the water: I have been rent with passion, and torn
   with evil desires; I have sinned against light and knowledge, I have
   sinned against love and mercy; I have sinned in thought, and word, and
   deed; I have sinned grievously and continually, and yet I believe that
   thou canst pardon me, and that thou canst make me a new creature.
   Wicked as I am, I believe that thou canst drive sin from the throne of
   my heart and cause me to love thee and to serve thee all my days." If
   thou canst believe in Jesus after this fashion he will save thee, yea
   he has saved thee. If thou, as an undeserving sinner, canst so honor
   the mercy of God as to believe that through Christ Jesus he can blot
   out thy sin, it shall be done unto thee: only remember that this
   confidence must not come unto thee because of thy forgetfulness of thy
   sin, but whilst thou art conscious of it and humbled on its account. If
   I persuade myself that I am merely a sinner in name, then I shall only
   find Jesus to be a Savior in name. If I am not such a sinner as to deny
   that I am a sinner, but pay the Lord the compliment of saying, "Oh,
   yes, I am a sinner; we are all sinners," then 1 am a sham sinner, and I
   shall become a sham believer, and the true Savior will have nothing to
   do with me. Jesus came to save that which is really and truly lost. The
   downright sinner, who dares not deny his guilt, is the object of the
   Lord's saving search. In the teeth of thy conscious guilt, canst thou
   believe that Jesus can wash thee and renew thee? Then thou hast one
   main element of the faith which saves.

   Yet, mark you, if this man could by any possibility have believed in
   Christ's power to save his son and yet had refused to bring him to
   Jesus for healing, he would have missed one of the essentials of true
   faith. For, hark. If thou wouldst get to the very heart and bowels of
   faith, thou hast it here: it is to trust the Lord. Trust! trust! that
   is the word. To believe that Christ is able to save thee is an
   essential, but to put thyself into his hands that he may save thee, is
   the saving act. Believe Christ's word to be true; then appropriate that
   word unto thyself as spoken to thee: believe that it is true to thee,
   and rest in the truth of itthat is saving faith. To see Christ as such
   a Savior as thou needest, able and willing to save thee, is a right
   good sight, but thou must also take this Savior to be thine. Say
   heartily, "Into that hand which was nailed to the cross I commit my
   guilty soul, hoping and believing that Jesus will forgive all my
   trespasses, and cause me to love all that is true and holy henceforth
   and for ever."

   "Thou canst, thou wilt (I dare not doubt),
   The indwelling demons chase
   I trust thy power to cast them out,
   I trust thy pardoning grace."

   He that trusts in Jesus is saved. I said not, "he shall be saved," but
   he is saved. "He that believeth in him hath everlasting life." "He that
   believeth in him is justified from all things, from which he could not
   be justified by the law of Moses."

   Will you please to notice about this man's faith that it was not
   perfect faith. Though it obtained for him the healing of his son, it
   "as weak faith, and for its weakness he was blamable; but the
   faultiness of his faith was not the destruction of his faith. A feeble
   faith can receive a mighty Savior, even as a beggar with a palsied hand
   can receive a golden gilt. An heir to an estate has as good a title to.
   it when he is a child as he will have when he is grown up, and even so
   little faith possesses the inheritance, though as yet it be a babe. The
   anxious father had to cry, "Lord, help my unbelief," but that unbelief,
   confessed and lamented, did not shut him out of the blessing. The
   unbelief which lingers around our faith is a thing to be got rid of by
   the help of Christ, but still it will not destroy the virtue of the
   faith which we possess. So, dear friend, if thy faith in Jesus Christ
   amounts to this, that thou believest him able to save, and thou dost
   therefore trust him, thou art a saved man, even though thou mayest he
   staggered with a host of fears, and troubled with a multitude of sins.
   Thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace; for that faith of thine shall
   grow from a mustard-seed into a far-spreading tree. I would that thou
   couldst take Jesus up into thine arms as Simeon did, for then wouldst
   thou say with full assurance, "Mine eyes have seen thy salvation." But
   if thou canst not do so much as that, at least stretch out thy finger
   and touch the hem of the Lord's garment; for if thou dost but touch his
   clothes thou shalt be magic whole. The faintest contact with the
   ever-blessed Christ will open up a way by which saving power will flow
   out of him into thee. Oh, how blessed it is to think that God hath
   ordained this plain way of faith for poor sinners! It is of faith that
   it might be of grace, to the end that the promise might be sure to all
   the chosen seed.

   This faith in the Lord Jesus ought to be to each one of us the easiest
   thing in all the world. If we were what we ought to be it would never
   occur to us to doubt our Lord Jesus; and our shameful unbelief of him
   is the most conclusive evidence of our need of him, for we must have
   become grievously wrong in heart to be forced to admit that we find it
   difficult to believe in Jesus. What an insult to him! What a crime on
   our part Remember the whole story of grace and blush for your wicked
   unbelief. God, the ever-blessed, whom we had offended sent his dear Son
   to be made in the likeness of sinful flesh, and he dwelt here among us
   as our brother, friend, and helper. In the fullness of time he took
   upon himself our sin and sorrow, and went up to the cross with the
   awful load of our guilt. Though still the well-beloved Son of the
   Father, he suffered even unto death in the room and stead of his
   people, and God's record concerning him is that he has set him forth as
   the propitiation for sin. God has accepted his atonement; will not
   sinners accept it? This is the Savior; God has ordained him such: will
   not the sinner agree that Jesus should save him? If not, why not? If we
   were not fallen to the uttermost degree of depravity we should cry out
   with delight, "Lord, we believe. Blessed be the dear name of Jesus, our
   Substitute, we can and do trust him. We are quite sure if the Lord God
   has made Jesus to be his salvation to the ends of the earth he must be
   a perfect salvation; therefore we accept him with joy and delight." But
   this is the curse of our nature, the inmate vice of our hearts, that we
   cannot believe our God, thus making him a liar. Oh, the horror of
   suspecting his truth whom angels adore with veiled faces! Oh, the
   daring presumption of questioning the promise of a faithful God! It is
   horrible, horrible, horrible to the last degree to mistrust the
   Almighty Father, to doubt his bleeding Son! There ought to be no room
   for an "if" when we know that in the Lord Jesus all fullness dwells. I
   am not at this moment speaking to those who reject the word of God, and
   deny the Deity of Christ: I can understand their position, and deal
   with them another time; but I am now speaking to you who accept this
   Bible as Gods word, and unquestioningly believe that Jesus Christ is
   divine: to you I say that your refusal to put your trust in him is
   without excuse; at least, I cannot find an excuse for you. Remember
   those telling words of the Lord Jesus"if I tell you the truth, why do
   you not believe me?" If you believe Jesus to be the Son of God and the
   Savior of men, why do you not trust your own soul with him? Why not at
   this moment confide in him whom you admit to be worthy of your trust.

   II. I have tried thus to explain the nature of faith. I will now, in
   the second place deal with the startling question, HOW IS IT THAT FAITH
   CAN BE DIFFICULT? It certainly is difficult to some. It cannot be so in
   itself; yet many in trouble of heart find it to be so, and those that
   labor to bring them to Christ, find themselves sore put to it.

   Why, first, it is difficult to get the very idea of faith into some
   men's mindsnot only difficult for them to believe, but even to know
   what it is to believe. I have met with persons who have attended a
   place of worship regularly twenty or thirty years, and yet they have
   never made the discovery that faith is a childlike trust in Jesus. I,
   as a lad, was taught this blessed secret by the Spirit of God; but it
   was at the first a great wonder to me that I should have attended
   evangelical ministries for years, and yet should not have known what
   was meant by believing in Christ. That simple truth broke in upon my
   mind like a new revelation. I had read the Bible; there was no part of
   it with which I was not acquainted, and yet even from that blessed book
   I had not learned what believing in Christ meant. Is not this singular?
   It is remarkable, and yet it is a general fact. We try by
   illustrations, by anecdotes, by parables, to drill the notion of faith
   into men; but we cannot even get it unto their heads, much less into
   their hearts. Martin Luther complained that he thought he must take the
   Bible and bang it about his hearers' heads because he could not get
   them to see its clear teaching as to justification by faith. This idea
   of believing is alien to men's minds, and it can only dwell there by
   forcing its way against the tendency of human nature. Again, I say,
   that this is a sad proof of human depravity, since in itself it is no
   difficult idea: it is the simplest thought that can be uttered or
   accepted. Trust thou thy salvation with Christ, and Christ will save
   thee, is a lesson, which a babe may learn. Still, the unregenerate do
   not think so: they muddle it all up, and stick to their belief that
   faith is something to be felt, or seem, or done, or suffered. To trust
   their God, to rely upon the atonement of his Sonthis is not to their
   mind, and so their foolish heart is darkened, and they cannot see the
   way which lies straight before them.

   When we get that thought into our hearers' heads, then there comes the
   next difficulty, to make them believe that faith can save them. It
   seems so difficult to believe this because the way is so easy. They
   sayWhat! am I, after thirty, forty, fifty years of sin, to be
   delivered from all the punishment of my transgressions by simply
   trusting to the Lord Jesus Christ? If you were to tell them that they
   must go to a desert and live there as hermits on berries and cold water
   for the rest of their natural lives, they would believe the message. If
   they were bidden to scourge themselves with whips of wire, they could
   expect some good result from such suffering, but not from mere
   believing. If they were to hook at the idea of propitiating God by
   their personal suffering, it would soon become impossible of belief;
   yet for a time they incline to it rather than to the doctrine of
   salvation by trust in the great Substitute. Hideous imaginings,
   despairings, and dreads are also looked upon hopefully by many; they
   hope that by deep feelings they may arrive at forgiveness, and may
   force their way to heaven by the gates of hell; but to trust Christ,
   and to believe the promise of God, is a thing too simple for them; they
   fear that safety is not to be found so soon! Ah! poor soul, if the
   prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldst thou not have done
   it? How much rather then when he saith to thee, "Believe and live?"

   I wish you would change your opinion as to what faith really is, for it
   is by no means so insignificant a matter as you suppose. Simple as it
   is there lies within it great excellence and value. Faith in God is the
   divinest exercise of the mind. To believe in God and his Christ is to
   be reconciled to God and restored from enmity. We are in unison of
   heart with those we trust. To believe your God is to worship him: the
   essence of worship is faith. For a poor sinner to trust the Lord gives
   him more honor than the cherubin can bring him with their loftiest
   notes of praise. In the teeth of all my sin and sinfulness, with a
   thorough sense of my guilt, I believe that the blood of Jesus has saved
   meis not this true praise? To confess scarlet sins, and yet to say,
   "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow," gives unto the Lord great
   glory for his mercy and his power. Yet the doctrine of "Believe and
   live" startles poor sinners because it is too easy.

   When they get over the idea of its extreme ease, they say to
   themselves, "This news is certainty too good to be true. Do I really
   understand you, sir, that if I trust the Lord Jesus now I am at once
   delivered from sin and am made a new creature in Christ?" Yes, you
   understand my teaching if that is the sense you find in my words. Yet
   you say it is too good to be true. Do you not see how poorly you think
   of your God? I know that pardoning grace is infinitely above your
   deservings or thoughts; but then does not the Lord say of himself, "As
   the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your
   ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts?" Grace may be too good for
   you to expect, but it is not too good for God to bestow. Oh that you
   would think better of God than you have done, and say of his amazing
   grace, "It is just like him!" Sing with me these words

   "Who is a pardoning God like thee?
   Or who hath grace so rich and free?"

   Salvation pitched in such a key as this, given freely to whosoever
   believeth in Jesus! Why, that is like the Lord, and we will accept it
   as having the divine stamp and impress upon it. He forgives like a God,
   and this does not stagger our faith, but confirms it.

   Then, again, men are astounded by the rapidity justification. Shall
   fifty years sinning be forgiven in a moment? Shall an instant's
   believing end the guilty past, and commence a holy future? It is even
   so; in one instant a man begins a course of believing which introduces
   him into a new world. What is strange about this? Is it not God's way
   to do wonders in a short time? he took but a week to fit up the earth
   for man; nay, six days sufficed, and on the seventh he rested. To make
   the light in which we rejoice, only needed for the Lord to say, "Let
   there be light." In the case before us our Lord only said to the demon,
   "I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him," and the
   deed was done. If we had all time at our disposal, we could not work
   such wonders, but to God there are no limits as to length or brevity of
   time. A thousand years are to him as one day, and one day as a thousand
   years. He speaks, and it is done. Think of itsalvation in a moment!
   The moment a sinner believes he hives unto God, and his trespasses are
   forgiven. Oh sinner! why shouldest thou doubt it? Yet we cannot get the
   conscience-stricken one to believe it.

   If we lead our friends out of this difficulty, they plunge into
   another. They cannot be satisfied with the word of God atone as the
   ground for their faith. Why do I believe that I am saved? I know that I
   am saved because the word of God says, "He that believeth in him hath
   everlasting life;" and I do believe in Jesus, and therefore I have
   everlasting life. "But," saith one, "if I had that word applied to me
   with power, then I could and would believe it." Just so; but until then
   you refuse to believe the promise of God, and treat him as a liar! God
   must, needs give you some pledge or bond beyond his promise, because
   his word is not good enough for you, though you admit that even with a
   good man his word is his bond. You cannot trust your God. "Oh, but if I
   had a dream." Just so. You would have more faith in a silly dream,
   perhaps caused by indigestion, than you have in the solemn word and
   written promise of God. "Oh, sir, but if an angel were to speak to me,
   I could believe." Just so; and if God does not choose to send the
   angels, what then? Then he is not to be believed, but treated as a
   liar. What is this but saying "Lord, thou shalt bow to my whims, or
   else I will not believe a word thou sayest?" Is it come to this? Dare
   you demand signs of God? Then let me ask youIs this Book God's word?
   Say "No," and I can understand your conduct; but if you believe, as I
   know you do, that this is the very word of God, how dare you
   disbelieve? If all the angels in heaven were to march by me in a file,
   and assure me that God would keep his word, I should say, "I did not
   require you to tell me that, for the Lord never fails to be as good as
   his word." God is so true that the witness of angels would be a
   superfluity. If my father were to make a statement, I certainly should
   not call in his servant to confirm it. If this book be dictated by the
   Holy Spirit, it is ours to believe it without demanding confirmations
   or applications. Let us say, "That word is true, for God hath said it.
   Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners: I am a sinner, and I
   trust him to save me. Inasmuch as the word says, 'To as many as
   received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
   them that believe on his name;' I do believe on his name, and therefore
   I have the power and privilege to become a child of God, and a child of
   God I am. God says so: that is enough for me." We cannot get men to see
   that the word of the Lord is surer than all signs and wondersthey want
   something in addition.

   If we compel them to own that the word of God is the only and
   sufficient basis of faith, they straightway begin to took at their own
   believing as if it were the Savior. They cry, "My faith is so weak; my
   faith is so variable; my faith is so shaken," and so forth. It is as if
   those who were bidden to look to the brazen serpent had, instead
   thereof, tried to see their own eyes. Here is a child thirsty, and
   there is a flowing fountain; you give the child a cup that it may drink
   of the water. The child does not go to the fountain, but is so pleased
   with its empty cup that it tries to satisfy its thirst out of it. What
   a foolish child! Or suppose it should refuse to go to the fountain
   because the cup was of earthenware, or of tin, would not that be a
   strange way for a thirsty child to act? A child needs the cup to drink
   out of, but it cannot drink out of an empty cup. Faith is the cup, but
   Christ is the fountain. Faith is a secondary thing compared with
   Christ. We must have faith to be as the finger with which we touch the
   hem of the Master's garment, but the finger does not work the cure.
   Shall I refuse to touch because perhaps I have not washed my finger
   clean, or it has no gold ring upon it; or there are traces of
   rheumatism upon it? To attach so much importance to the finger as to
   refuse to touch Christ's garment with it would be insanity. Do not mind
   your finger: touch the garment's hem. Sinner, get you to Christ
   somehow, anyhow; for if you get to him you will live. It is not, after
   all, the greatness nor the perfection of your faith, it is his
   greatness and his perfection, which is to be depended on.

   Then the next trial is, that we cannot get troubled sinners to see the
   difference between their faith and its fruits. "I would believe in
   Christ," says one, "if I were as holy as So-and-So, who is a believer,
   but then you see I am a sinner." Now mark, dear friend, that the person
   of whom you speak in that fashion does not think himself to be one
   particle more deserving than you are. If you talk to that good man he
   will tell you that whatever holiness you can see in him is the work of
   grace, and that at the first he came to Jesus just as you must come,
   that is, as a sinner. Faith produces holiness; but when we come to
   Jesus, at the first we come as unholy persons, and as such he receives
   us. Suppose that I have a number of bulbs which I am told will produce
   most remarkable flowers; if I believe the statement I shall take care
   to have them properly planted. The gardeners are beginning to put such
   things into pots, that they may have hyacinths and other fair flowers
   in the winter and early spring. Suppose that I resolve not to plant my
   bulbs, because I use my own eyesight, and come to the conclusion that
   as I cannot see a hyacinth or even the beginnings of one in any of the
   bulbs, therefore there can be no use in planting them. Why, everyone
   would tell me that in this matter I must go by faith, and plant my
   hyacinth in order that I may in due time see it bloom. "That bulb will
   yield a beautiful blue flower," says one. I answer that it is a brown,
   dried-up sort of onion, and that I shall throw it on the dunghill, for
   I can see no bud or flower in it. What a simpleton I should be if I
   talked so! Though I cannot see it, yet there is, closely compacted and
   quietly hidden away within that bulb, a slumbering thing of beauty
   which will wake up at the call of spring. Even so, if thou believest in
   Christ, there is a holy life packed away within thy faith, and it will
   gradually develop itself. Even within a feeble faith there are the
   elements of ultimate perfection. If thou dost truly trust Christ, thy
   preparation for glory has begun. As the king was hidden in the oak so
   is Christ hidden in true faith. Do not, however, expect to see all this
   at the first: look to the root now and the growth will follow. You are
   not to come to Christ because you are healed, but to get healing; your
   faith must be a sinner's faith before it can be a saint's faith. Trust
   Christ while yet you are foul, lost, and undone, and he will wash,
   save, and restore you.

   Still we find the awakened ones clinging to the idea that they must be
   something or feel something before they may trust Jesus. We cannot get
   them to see that the whole of their salvation lies in Jesus Christ and
   in Jesus Christ alone. We cannot wean them from some sort of reliance
   upon their own feelings, or weepings, or prayers, or Bible-readings, or
   some other form of working. Why, they will even look to their own faith
   rather than to Jesus Christ alone. Know ye not that our Lord has
   offered a full atonement for sin, and brought in a perfect
   righteousness for his people? His propitiation is to be accepted as
   full and complete, and his righteousness we are to wear as our own. Our
   whole trust must go to the perfect work of our Lord, it must not even
   rest on our faith. To trust in our own trusting would be absurd. A
   wounded man has healing ointment given him and a piece of linen with
   which to bind on the ointment; now, if he were to wrap the linen around
   the wound and leave out the healing agent, he could not expect a cure.
   Faith is the linen whereon the ointment of Christ is spread, and we
   must not put it out of its due place and order, or we shall be making
   it a rival to Christ. Oh, that I could clear up some of the
   difficulties with which men surround themselves, so that they would
   consent to look out of themselves to Jesus only!

   III. We must now speak to the last point. Oh, you that are seeking
   rest, dwell upon each word as it is now lovingly delivered to you. WHAT
   IS IT THAT CAN MAKE FAITH EASY? The Holy Spirit alone can do that; but
   he does so by bringing certain truths to remembrance. Faith is rendered
   easy to a man by the Holy Spirit when, first of all, he sees clearly
   the infallible certainty of the sacred record; and this is the record
   that God gave concerning his Son, that he that believeth in him hath
   everlasting life. Is this Bible true or not? I believe in every letter
   of it: I accept it as God's word in the most unreserved sense, and so
   do you to whom I now speak. Well, if that be so, then it remains no
   longer difficult to believe what is plainly taught in this book. If God
   hath spoken then questions are ended. It may be a hard saying, it may
   be a dark saying; it may seem to be too good to be true; but what of
   that? Do we dare to question the Lord? He is not a man that he should
   he, nor the Son of man that he should repent. He has said that
   whosoever believeth in Jesus shall not perish, but have everlasting
   life; and if we have so believed, eternal life is ours.

   The next thing that the Spirit of God helps us to see is the
   applicability of that record to ourselves: that is to say, we read, "
   Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners," and we conclude that
   as we are just such, we may look to him to save us. We read, "Come unto
   me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
   We labor and are heavy laden, and therefore we come, and he gives us
   rest. We read that "in due time Christ died for the ungodly"; and
   knowing that we are ungodly, we yet take heart and come to him who
   justifies the guilty through his righteousness. We read again,
   "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." We feel that
   to will is present with us, and therefore we freely take the living
   water. We read once more, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the
   gospel to every creature;" and as we are creatures, we conclude that
   the gospel has something to say to us. On one or other of these
   accounts we see that the gospel is directed to us, and so we receive
   it. It is better for us that the promise should be directed to us in
   terms of character than that it should mention our actual names. Is
   your name John Brown? "Well, if the gospel came in a letter to you,
   directed to John Brown, what might you not say if you were tempted to
   doubt? You would think to yourself that there are many more John Browns
   besides yourself, and therefore the message might not be for you. If it
   was directed to your address, you might then fear that another John
   Brown once lived at that house, before you were born, and so you would
   fear to appropriate the message lest it should prove to be out of date.
   Even supposing that your name was there, and the address, and the date,
   you might be mistrustful enough to fancy that there was a mistake, or
   that some other person of your name had used your address for the day.
   If you mean to ride on the back of unbelief any fancy will do for a
   saddle. But when the promise comes "to him that believeth in Jesus,"
   there can be no question that it is ours if we believe. We read, "If we
   confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins;" is
   it not clear that if we have confessed our sins, mercy is ours? It is a
   blessed thing for us when the Spirit of God leads us to see that the
   gospel is free to all who are made willing to receive it.

   Another thing that makes faith easy is when the Spirit of God shows us
   the glory of Christ's person. Our Savior is truly God, and this fact
   helps us to believe in him. It strikes me that the poor anxious father
   may have been much helped to believe in our Lord by that peculiar
   majesty which shone about him through his having just come down from
   the mount of transfiguration. It was a very hard case which exercised
   the poor man's mind, and therefore our Lord appeared to him with an
   unusual splendora splendor of which we read"when they saw him they
   were amazed." A sight of our Savior's face helped the trembler to cry,
   "Lord, I believe." Oh, if the Spirit of God will lead you to read the
   Scriptures till you get a clear idea of the Godhead and perfect manhood
   of the Lord Jesus, you will feel that everything is possible with an
   Almighty Savior. "Is anything too hard for the Lord?" Our Lord is gone
   up unto his glory, and he is able to save unto the uttermost them that
   come unto God by him. Oh, could you but grasp the idea that he who asks
   your trust is the Son of the Highest, who has all power in heaven and
   in earth, you could not, you would not withhold your confidence! As for
   myself, knowing beyond all doubt my Lord's divinity it seems easy
   enough to rely upon him. I have told you before what John Hyatt said on
   his dying bed, when his deacons said, "Mr. Hyatt, can you trust your
   soul with Christ now?" "One soul!" said he, "I could trust a million
   souls with him if I had them." Even so could I trust the Lord Jesus not
   only with my soul, but with all the destinies of earth and heaven, time
   and eternity. Every child of God may safely say that. I could trust
   Jesus with all the souls that ever lived or shall live, if they were
   all mine. Surely, he is able to keep that which we have committed to
   him.

   Another great help to faith is to perceive the completeness of the
   divine work and sacrifice of the Lord Jesus. He took our sin upon
   himself, and in his own body on the tree was made sin for us, that we
   might be made the righteousness of God in him. Only let your eyes
   behold the Son of God suffering the death-agony for guilty man, and you
   must believe in his power to redeem. I have thought that if men had
   been more sinful than they are, and if they were a million times as
   numerous as they are, and if every star that studs the midnight sky
   were a world, and all crowded full of sinners, yet the sacrifice of God
   himself must from the glory of his nature be such a vindication of the
   law that it might well suffice as a reason for forgiving a rebel
   universe! Shall the infinitely holy suffer for the guilty? Shall the
   Eternal take upon himself humanity, and bow his head to death? Then the
   sacrifice must possess such boundless efficacy that none may fear that
   it will fall short of their need. No limit can be set to the power,
   which lies in the divine expiation. My God, I see that thou hast given
   thine own Son to die, and surely in his precious blood there is more
   than sufficient reason for my faith in thee.

   If that does not lead you to believe perhaps the Spirit of God will go
   to work in another way. Some have been helped to believe in Jesus by
   the sight of others converted, justified and made happy. When someone
   like yourself is saved you take courage. "I have been a thief," says
   one.

   "The dying thief rejoiced to see
   That fountain in his day
   And there may you, though vile as he,
   Wash all your sins away."

   "I have been an adulterer," saith one. Alas! so was David, but he said,
   "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." "I have been a murderer,"
   sobs a third. So was Manasseh, who shed innocent blood very much. "But
   I have been a persecutor and a blasphemer." So was Saul of Tarsus, yet
   he obtained mercy. "But I seem to have far more of the devil in me than
   anybody else." So had Mary Magdalene, out of whom Christ cast seven
   devils. You think you are a sinner all by yourself, but there have been
   others like you, and the door through which others have passed into
   mercy is open for you. If I had been a little rabbit in the day when
   Noah brought the living creatures into the ark, I do not think I should
   have been troubled about whether there was room for me to enter the
   ark; but if I had been so timid I should have forgotten all my fears
   when I saw the elephant come up and his mate with him, and had seen
   them go tramping through the doer. Then I should have known assuredly
   that there was room for me. Oh, you who have been kept moral and
   upright, and therefore are not outwardly great sinners, surely you may
   enter where the chief of sinners have found ready admission. The
   salvation of others is often a sweet encouragement to sinners to trust
   in Christ.

   Lastly, I will tell you one thing, which will make you trust him, and
   that is, desperation as to all other hopes. It is a singular thing that
   despair is often the mother of faith, but the mother dies when the
   child is born. We were many of us led to believe in Jesus because we
   had nothing else to trust in. When we are driven to the last extremity,
   then it is we come to Jesus, and take him to be our all in all. A boy
   was awakened in a house, which had taken fire. He could be seen from
   the street, poor child, and his danger was great indeed, He rushed to
   the window: his father stood below and called to him to drop into his
   arms; but it was a long way down, and the child was afraid. He clung to
   the window, but dared not drop. Do you know what made him let go his
   hold and fall into his father's arms? There came a burst of fire out of
   the window and scorched him and then he dropped directly. I wish that
   some of you would get just such a touch of the fires of despair as to
   compel you to say:

   "I can but perish if I go;
   I am resolved to try,
   For if I stay away I know
   I must for ever die."

   Years ago one of our students was greatly emaciated with what seemed to
   be consumption. He had heard of a certain medicine, which was said to
   be useful in such cases, but he had no faith in it. When he was growing
   worse and worse I said, "Brother, you are at death's door; try that
   man's stuff. There may he something in it. At any rate, nothing else
   does you any good." He took the medicine through sheer despair, of all
   other prescriptions, and God blessed it to him so that he is alive at
   this day. He would never have tried the remedy if he had not felt that
   there was no other hope. Even so, it will be well for you to be driven
   into a corner as to your soul's estate, that you may believe in Christ
   Jesus and say within his disciples in old time, "To whom shall we go?
   Thou hast the words of eternal life." Here is a closing verse for you
   to sing at home by yourself

   "A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,
   On Christ's kind arms I fall
   He is my strength and righteousness,
   My Jesus and my all."

Abijah, or Some Good Thing Towards the Lord

   (No. 1745)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, October 21st, 1883, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [4]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him for he only of
   Jeroboam shell come to the grave, because in him there is found some
   good thing toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam." 1
   Kings 14:13.

   JEROBOAM HAD PROVED FALSE to the Lord who had placed him upon the
   throne of Israel, and the time was come for his overthrow. The Lord,
   who usually brings forth the rod before he lifts the axe, sent sickness
   into his house: his son Abijah was sore sick. Then the parents
   bethought them of an old prophet of God, and desired to know through
   him what would happen to the child. Fearful lest the prophet should
   denounce plagues upon him and his child if he knew that the enquirer
   was the wife of Jeroboam, the king begged the Egyptian princess whom he
   had married to disguise herself as a farmer's wife, and so get from the
   man of God a more favorable answer. Poor foolish king to imagine that a
   prophet who could see into futurity could not also see through any
   disguise with which his queen might surround herself! So anxious was
   the mother to know the fate of her son, that she left his sick-chamber
   to go to Shiloh to hear the sentence of the prophet. Vain was her
   clever disguise! the blind prophet was still a seer, and not only
   discerned her before she entered the house, but saw the future of her
   family. She came full of superstition to be told her fortune, but she
   went away heavy, having been told her faults and her doom.

   In the terrible tidings which the prophet Ahijab delivered to this wife
   of Jeroboam, there was only one bright spot, only one word of solace;
   and I am greatly afraid that it gave no kind of comfort to the heathen
   queen. Her child was mercifully appointed to die, for in him there was
   "found some good thing toward Jehovah, God of Israel." As an Egyptian,
   it is not likely that she appreciated the meaning of that sentence;
   probably she thought it of very small importance that her child should
   have regard towards the God of his people. She saw not the light, which
   was full of joy. In what an unhappy condition is that person who cannot
   derive comfort from the salvation of his own child! Yet there are many
   men and women in such a state. They care nothing for the souls of their
   own offspring. It would bring no joy to them if they saw all their
   children walking in the truth nor does it cause them any concern to see
   them otherwise. To see them sharp in business, or fair in countenance,
   is their main ambition; but to have them beloved of the Lord is no
   matter of desire. Poor souls, their own carnality overflows and
   saturates their family! To some it would even cause anger and wrath to
   see their children turning to the Lord; they so despise true religion
   that, if their sons and daughters were converted, they would rather
   hate them than love them the more. Such is the alienation which sin
   works in the human mind, that it will in some instances curdle human
   affection into enmity, at the sight of the grace of God. That which
   should increase love has even created loathing. As Saul sought to slay
   Jonathan because he loved David, so do some hate their children because
   they love Jesus. Such persons make curses out of their blessings. They
   put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter, darkness for light and light
   for darkness; and therefore that which ought to be their comfort and
   joy becomes a source of disquietude. But, beloved, I think I could say
   of the most of us here present, that if we did but know of a surety
   that there was in our child some good thing toward Jehovah, God of
   Israel, we would be perfectly content to leave all the rest of his case
   at the absolute disposal of the Lord. If such a child should die, it
   would be well; for it is much better to have a child in heaven than to
   have one on earth breaking our heart by his wicked ways: and if such a
   child shall live, what happy prospects open up before us, that as his
   years advance, he will grow in knowledge, and in favor both with God
   and man! Certify us of this, that there is in the young mind some good
   thing toward the Lord God of Israel, and we reckon that the grand
   matter is secured, and all else is regarded by us as a mere matter of
   detail. We will bless the Lord let him send what he will to our
   children, so long as he has chosen them to be his own, and has put his
   fear in their hearts. This wretched wife of Jeroboam went her way in
   utter misery; for that sentence which would have been a sweet solace to
   us, had little or no charm for her. Oh the sinfulness of that heart
   which finds no comfort in the salvation of the soul of a dying child!

   This morning we are going to look into the little that we know of the
   young prince Abijah. We know nothing more of him than the text tells
   us. His name was a suitable one. A good name may belong to a very bad
   man; but in this case a gracious name was worthily worn. He called God
   his Father, and his name signifies that fact. "Ah," you know, is the
   word for "Father," and "Jah" is "Jehovah,"Jehovah was his father. I
   would not have mentioned the name had not his life made it true. Oh,
   you who bear good Bible names, see that you do not dishonor them!

   I. I shall ask you first of all to follow me in studying the character
   of this prince while I say, LET US HERE ADMIRE WHAT WE CANNOT PRECISSLY
   DESCRIBE.

   And I mean, first, by that, that there was in this child "some good
   thing toward the Lord God of Israel;" but what was it? Who shall define
   it? A boundless field for conjecture opens before us. We know there was
   in him some good thing, but what form that good thing took we do not
   know. Tradition has made assertions, but as these are mere inventions
   to fill up a gap, they are scarcely worth mentioning here. Our own
   reflections will, probably, be as near the mark as these improbable
   traditions Perhaps the obscurity was intentional. We may learn much
   from the silence of Scripture: we are not told precisely what the good
   thing was, because any good thing towards the Lord is a sufficient sign
   of grace. Where there is some good thing towards the Lord God, every
   good thing is present in seed and essence. The "some good thing" which
   is so fully developed as to be seen and noted is an index of the
   presence of all the rest, since the grace of God is not divided, but is
   present as a whole. God's blessings come in groups; and if some good
   thing be apparent, all others which are really vital and essential are
   there. Though the child's faith is not mentioned, we are sure that he
   had faith in the living God, since without it nothing in him would have
   been good towards God; for "without faith it is impossible to please
   God." He was a child believer in Jehovah, the God of Israel: perhaps
   his mother left him at his own request to go to the Lord's prophet
   about him. Many false prophets were around the palace: his father might
   not have sent to Shiloh, had not the boy pleaded for it. The child
   believed in the great invisible God, who made the heavens and the
   earth, and he worshipped him in faith. I should not wonder, however, if
   in that child his love was more apparent than his faith; for converted
   children more usually talk of loving Christ than they do of trusting in
   him: not because faith is not in them, but because the emotion of love
   is more congenial to the child's nature than the more intellectual act
   of faith. The heart is large in the child, and therefore love becomes
   his most conspicuous fruit. I have no doubt this child showed an early
   affection towards the unseen Jehovah, and a distaste for the idols of
   his father's court. Possibly he displayed a holy horror of the worship
   of God under the figure of a calf. Even a child would have intelligence
   enough to perceive that it must be wrong to liken the great and
   glorious God to a bullock, which hath horns and hoofs. Perhaps the
   child's refined nature also started back from those base priests of the
   lowest of the land whom his father had raked together. We do not know
   exactly the form it took, but there it was: "some good thing" was in
   the child's heart towards Jehovah, God of Israel.

   Carefully note that it was not merely a good inclination which was in
   him, nor a good desire, but a really good, substantial virtue. There
   was in him a true and substantial existence of grace, and this is far
   more than a transient desire. What child is there that has not at some
   time or other, if it has been trained in the fear of God, felt
   tremblings of heart and desires towards God? Such goodness is as common
   as the early dew; but alas! it passeth away quite as speedily. The
   young Abijah possessed something within him sufficiently real and
   substantial to be called a "good thing;" the Spirit of God had wrought
   a sure work upon him, and left within him a priceless jewel of grace.
   Let us admire this good thing, though we cannot precisely describe it.

   Let us admire, also, that this "some good thing" should have been in
   the child's heart, for its entrance is unknown. We cannot tell how
   grace entered the palace of Tirzah and gained this youthful hearts. God
   saw the good thing, for he sees the least good thing in any of us,
   since he has a quick eye to perceive anything that looks toward himself
   But how did this gracious work come to the child? We are not cold and
   this silence is a lesson to us. It is not essential to us to know how a
   child receives grace. We need not be painfully anxious to know when, or
   where, or how a child is converted; it may even be impossible to tell,
   for the work may have been so gradual that day and hour cannot be
   known. Even those who are converted in riper years cannot all describe
   their conversion in detail, much less can we expect to map out the
   experience of children who have never gone into outward sin, but under
   the restraints of godly education have kept the commandments from their
   youth up, like the young man in the gospel narrative. How came this
   child to have this good thing in his heart? So far we know: we are sore
   that God placed it there; but by what means? The child, in all
   probability, did not hear the teaching of the prophets of God; he was
   never, like young Samuel, taken up to the house of the Lord. His mother
   was an idolatrous princess, his father was among the most wicked of
   men, and yet the grace of God reached their child. Did the Spirit of
   the Lord operate upon his heart through his own thoughts? Did he think
   over the matter, and did he come to the conclusion that God was God,
   and that he must not be worshipped as his father worshipped him, under
   the image of a calf? Even a child might see this. Had some hymn to
   Jehovah been sung under the palace wall by some lone worshipper? Had
   the child seen his father on that day when he lifted up his hand
   against the prophet of Jehovah at the altar of Bethel, when suddenly
   his right hand withered at his side? Did the tears start from the boy's
   eye when he saw his father thus paralyzed in the arm of his strength?
   and did he laugh for very joy of heart when by the prophet's prayer his
   father was restored again? Did that great miracle of mercy cause him to
   love the God of Israel? Is it a mere fancy that this may have been so?
   A withered right hand in a father, and that father a king, is a thing a
   child is pretty sure to be told of, and if it be restored by prayer the
   wonder would naturally fill the palace, and be spoken of by everybody,
   and the prince would hear of it. Or what if this little child had a
   godly nurse? What if some girl like her that waited upon Naaman's wife
   was the messenger of love to him? As she carried him to and fro, did
   his nurse sing him one of the songs of Zion, and tell him of Joseph and
   Samuel? Israel had not yet so long forsaken her God as to be without
   many a faithful follower of the God of Abraham, and by some one of
   these sufficient knowledge was conveyed to the child to become the
   means of conveying the love of God to his soul. We may conjecture with
   considerable probability, but we may not pretend to be sure that it was
   so, nor is there any need that we should be. If the sun be risen it
   matters little when the day first dawned. Be it ours when we see in
   children some good thing to rest content with that truth, even if we
   cannot tell how it came there. God's electing love is never short of
   means to carry out its purpose: he can send his effectual grace into
   the heart of Jeroboam's family, and while the father is prostrate
   before his idols the Lord can find a true worshipper for himself in the
   king's own child. "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou
   ordained strength because of thine enemies." Thy footsteps are not
   always seen, O God of grace, but we have learned to adore thee in thy
   work, even when we discern not thy way.

   This "good thing" is described to us in the text in a certain measure.
   It was a "good thing towards Jehovah, the God of Israel." The good
   thing looked towards the living God. In children there often will he
   found good things towards their parents: let these be cultivatedbut
   these are not sufficient evidences of grace. In children there will
   sometimes be found good things towards amiability and moral excellence:
   let all good things be commended and fostered, but they are not sure
   fruits of grace. It is towards God that the good thing must be that
   saves the soul. Remember how we read in the New Testament of repentance
   towards God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. The way the face of
   the good thing looks is a main point about it. There is life in a look.
   It a man be travelling away from God every step he takes increases his
   distance from him; but if his face be toward the Lord he may be only
   capable of a child's tottering step, but yet he is moving nearer and
   nearer every moment. There was some good thing in this child towards
   God, and that is the most distinguishing mark of a truly good thing.
   The child had love, and there was in it love to Jehovah. He had faith,
   but it was faith in Jehovah. His religious fear was the fear of the
   living God; his childlike thoughts and desires, and prayers, and hymns
   went towards the true God. This is what we desire to see not only in
   children, but in adults: we wish to see their hearts turned to the
   Lord, and their minds and wills moving towards the Most High. Strange
   that it should be wonderful for the creature man to look towards his
   Creator! and yet it is so. Indeed there is no surer sign of a renewed
   heart than when a man exclaims, "I will arise and go to my Father."

   In this dear child that "good thing" wrought such an outward character
   that he became exceedingly well beloved. We are sure of that, because
   it is said, "All Israel shall mourn for him." He was probably the heir
   to his father's crown, and there were godly but grieved hearts in
   Israel that hoped to see times of reform when that youth should come to
   the throne; and perhaps even those who did not care about religion, yet
   somehow had marked the youth, and observed his going in and out before
   them, and had said, "He is Israel's hope; there will be better days
   when that boy becomes a man"; so that when Abijah died he alone of all
   his race received both tears and a tomb; he died lamented, and was
   buried with respect, whereas all the rest of Jeroboam's house were
   devoured of dogs and vultures. It is a very blessed thing when there is
   such a good thing in our children that they come to be beloved in their
   little spheres. They have not all the range, which this young prince
   enjoyed so as to secure universal admiration; but still the grace of
   God in a child is a very lovely thing, and it draws forth general
   approbation. I do not know how it is with you, but youthful piety is a
   very touching thing to me; I see the grace of God in men and women with
   much thankfulness, but I cannot perceive it in children without
   shedding tears of delight. There is an exceeding beauty about these
   rosebuds of the Lord's garden; they have a fragrance, which we find not
   in the fairest of earth's lilies. Love is won for the Lord Jesus in
   many a heart by these tiny arrows of the Lord, whose very smallness is
   a part of their power to penetrate the heart. The ungodly may not love
   the grace which is in the children, but since they love the children in
   whom that grace is found, they are no longer able to speak against
   religion as they otherwise would have done. Yea more, the Holy Spirit
   uses these children for yet higher ends, and those who see them are
   often impressed with desires for better things. Once again, let us
   admire what we cannot precisely describe; for I have not ventured upon
   any precise description, but I have closely followed the words of the
   text.

   The piety of this young child was every way, of the right kind. It was
   inward and sincere, for the "good thing" that is spoken of was not
   found about him, but "in him." He did not wear the broad phylactery,
   but he had a meek and quiet spirit. He may not have been much of a
   speaker, else it might have been said "He has spoken good things
   concerning the God of Israel;" he may have been a timid, retiring,
   almost silent boy, but the good thing was "in him." And this is the
   kind of thing, which we desire for every one of our friends, a work of
   grace within. The grand point is not to wear the garb, nor use the
   brogue of religion, but to possess the life of God within, and feel and
   think as Jesus would have done because of that inner life. Small is the
   value of external religion unless it be the outcome of a life within.
   True grace is not as a garment, to be put on and taken off; but it is
   an integral part of the person who possesses it. This child's piety was
   of the true, personal, inward kind: may all our children have some good
   thing in them!

   We are told by our text that this good thing "was found" in him: this
   means that it was discernible in him, discernible without much
   difficulty, for the expression "found's is used even when it does not
   imply any great search. Does not the Lord say, "I am found of them that
   sought me not?" Zealous, child-like piety soon shows itself; a child is
   usually far less reticent than a man; the little lip is not frozen by
   cold prudence, but reveals the heart. Godliness in a child appears even
   upon the surface, so that persons who come into the house as visitors
   are surprised by the artless statements, which betray the young
   Christian. There were many in Tirzah who could not help knowing that
   this child had in him some good thing towards Jehovah. They may not
   have cared to see it, they may have hoped that it would be crushed out
   of him by the example of the court around him, but still they knew that
   there it was, they had found it without difficulty.

   Still, the expression does bear another shade of meaning: it implies
   that when God, the strict heart-searcher, who trieth the reins of the
   children of men, visited this child he found in him somewhat unto
   praise and glory: "some good thing" was discovered in him by those eyes
   which cannot be deceived. It is not all gold that glitters, but that
   which was in this child was genuine metal. Oh that the like may be true
   of each of as when we are tried as by fire! It may be that his father
   was angry with him for serving Jehovah; but whatever his trial may have
   been, he came out of it unharmed.

   The expression suggests to me somewhat of the idea of surprise. How did
   this good thing get into the child? "In him there is found some good
   thing,"as when a man findeth a treasure in a field. The farmer was
   thinking of nothing but his oxen, and his acres, and his harvest, when
   on a sudden his plough laid bare a hidden treasure: he found it where
   it was, but how it came to be there he could not tell. So in this
   child, so disadvantageously placed, to the surprise of everybody there
   was found some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel. His
   conversion, you see, is veiled in mystery. We are not told of the grace
   in his heart what it was, nor whence it came, nor what special actions
   it produced, but there it was, found where none expected it. I believe
   that this case is typical of many of the elect children whom God calls
   by his grace in the courts and alleys of London. You must not expect
   that you shall jot down their experience, and their feelings, and their
   lives, and total them all up; you must not reckon to know dates and
   means specifically, but you must take the child as we have to take
   Abijah, rejoicing to find in him a little wonder of grace with God's
   own seal upon him. The old prophet in the name of the Lord attested the
   young prince as a true-hearted follower of the Most High; and in like
   manner the Lord sets his attesting mark of grace on regenerated
   children, and we must be content to see it, even if some other things
   be wanting. Let us welcome with delight those works of the Holy Spirit
   which we cannot precisely describe.

   II. Now, changing the line of our thought a little, I come to a second
   remark: in this case LET US HEARTILY PRIZE WHAT WE ARE TOO APT TO
   OVERLOOK.

   First, let us heartily prize "some good thing "towards the Lord God of
   Israel whenever we perceive it. All that is said of this ease was that
   there was in him "some good thing;" and this reads as if the divine
   work was as yet only a spark of grace, the beginning of spiritual life.
   There was nothing very striking in him, or it would have been more
   definitely mentioned. He was not an heroic follower of Jehovah, and is
   deeds of loyalty to God are not written, because by reason of his ender
   years he had neither power nor opportunity to do much which could be
   written. Inasmuch as we read that in him was "some good thing," it is
   implied that it was not a perfect thing, and that it was not attended
   with all the good things one might wish for. Many good things were
   missing, but "some good thing" was manifest, and therefore the child
   was accepted and by divine love rescued from an ignoble death. Do you
   not think that there is a tendency with many Christian people when they
   are talking with enquirers to look for every good thing in them,
   instead of looking for some good thing a them? Here is a person
   professing to be converted; he is evidently sincere and honest, and
   therefore he is very cautious not to say more than he feels, and this
   makes him say little, and that little tremblingly. You put him a
   question which everybody ought to be able to answer; but this nervous
   one fails to answer it, and therefore by a severe judgment it is
   thought that he is ignorant and unenlightened. Cold prudence decrees
   that a person who cannot answer such a question cannot be a child of
   God, and little allowance is made for timidity and flutter of mind.
   Suppose the enquirer could answer the question and a dozen others,
   might he not still be a deceiver? Is it not sufficient for you that
   there is some good thing in him, even though he has no great stock of
   knowledge and very slender power of expression. Grace grows; the grain
   of mustard seed becomes a tree, the little heaven leavens the whole
   lump. "Some good thing" will by-and-by breed every good thing; the life
   of God is sure to conquer the whole nature. And ought we not to be much
   more hopefu1 than we are, and t the same time more tender, more gentle,
   more considerate? Does God bid his prophet say that this child shall
   escape the judgment that was to come upon Jeroboam's family because
   there was some good thing in him? Ought we not to conclude that if we
   see some god thing in any towards God, towards his Christ, towards
   eternal things, it is a token to us not to condemn but to commend, not
   to judge with severity but to treat with kindness and care? I fear that
   in many a ease harshness has wrought serious mischief to those who were
   with all their hearts coming to Jesus. That harshness may have been
   thought to be fidelity by him ho exercised it, and perhaps it was; but
   there is such a thing as mistaken fidelity, and faithfulness is not the
   only virtue needed by a Soul-winner. I would not have you err, brethren
   and sisters beloved, when you are talking with seekers by whispering in
   their ears, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace; but on the other
   hand I would not have you sin against the child by a hard, suspicious
   manner, and by demanding more of a youthful heart than the Lord Jesus
   would have looked for. There is a happy medium; may God help us to
   follow it,hoping but not flattering, examining with care but not
   chilling with suspicion. Again I say, let us prize anything we see of
   Christ, anything we see of the Spirit's work in anyone who comes before
   us, being satisfied that all is well so long as we can see some good
   thing toward the Lord God of Israel."

   Further, I am afraid we are too apt to overlook "some good thing" a
   child. "Oh, only a child!" Pray, what are you? You are a man; well, I
   suppose that a man is a child who has grown older, and has lost many of
   his best points of character. A child is at no disadvantage in the
   things of God from being a child, for "of such are the kingdom of
   heaven." Men have to grow back into children before they enter the
   kingdom at all. If there be some good thing, it ought not to be doubted
   and thought to be questionable because it is in a child for in Holy
   Scripture it is very common to find good things in children. Do we not
   find some good things in Joseph while he was still a youth? in Samuel,
   with whom God spake while he was yet a young child? in David, who, as a
   boy, slew the giant Goliath? in Obadiah, the governor of the house of
   Ahab, who said to Elijah, "I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth"?
   in King Josiah, who wrought so great a reformation in Judah? in young
   Timothy, who knew the Scriptures from his youth? Was there not also
   early piety in John? of whom Jerome says that one reason why our Lord
   loved John better than the other apostles was because he was younger
   than the rest. I am not sure of that, but there is a peculiar
   child-likeness about John, which might well attract the closest
   fellowship of the holy child Jesus. Do not, therefore, be surprised to
   find grace in children, but look for it cagily. Why should we not have
   Samuel's and Timothy's among us? Do not let us trample pearls under our
   feet by refusing to see the Lord's work of grace in children. Watch for
   grace in them as sometimes watch for the first gleams of the morning; I
   say watch for it more than they that watch for the morning.

   Another thing we are apt to overlook, and that is, "some good thing" in
   a bad house. This was the most wonderful thing of all, that there
   should be a gracious child in Jeroboam's palace. The mother usually
   sways the house, but the queen was a princess of Egypt and an idolater.
   A father has great influence, but in this case Jeroboam sinned and made
   Israel to sin. It strikes me as a wonder that he should make Israel to
   sin but could not make his child to sin. All the land feels the
   pestilent influence of Jeroboam, and yet close at his feet there is a
   bright spot which sovereign grace has kept from the plague; his
   firstborn child, who naturally would imitate his lather, is the very
   reverse of himthere is found in Jeroboam's heir "some good thing
   toward Jehovah, God of Israel." In such a place we do not look for
   grace, and are apt to pass it by. If you go to the courts of our great
   cities, which ate an thing but palatial, you will see that they swarm
   with the children of the poor, and you hardly expect to see grace where
   sin evidently abounds. In the fever-dens and pestilent alleys of the
   great city you hear blasphemy and see drunkenness on all sides, but do
   not therefore conclude that no child of God is there; do not say within
   yourself, "The electing love of God has never pitched upon any of
   these." How do you know? One of those poor little ragged children
   playing on a dust heap may have found Christ in the Ragged-school, and
   may be destined to a place at Christ's right hand. Precious is that
   gem, though cast amidst these pebbles. Bright is that diamond, though
   it he upon a dunghill. If in the child there is some good thing toward
   the Lord God of Israel," he is none the less to be valued because his
   father is a thief and his mother is a gin-drinker. Never despise the
   most ragged child. A clergyman in Ireland, ministering to a little
   Protestant congregation, noticed for several Sundays, standing in the
   aisle near the d or, a very ragged boy, who listened to the sermon most
   eagerly. He wished to know who the boy could be, but he always vanished
   as soon as the sermon was over. He asked a friend or two to watch, but
   somehow the boy always escaped, and could not be discovered. It came to
   pass one Sunday that the minister preached a sermon fiom this text,
   "His own right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory," and
   alter that time he missed the boy altogether. Six weeks elapsed, and
   the child did not come any more, but a man appeared from the hills, and
   begged the minister to come and see his boy, who was dying. He lived in
   a miserable hovel up in the mountains. A six-mile walk in the rain,
   through hogs and over hills, and the minister came to the door of the
   lint. As he entered, the poor lad was sitting up in bed, and as soon as
   he caught sight of the preacher he waved his arm and cried out, "His
   own right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory." That woos
   his closing speech on earth, his dying shout of triumph. Who knows but
   in many and many a case the Lord's right hand and holy arm have gotten
   him the victory, despite the poverty and the sin and the ignorance that
   may have surrounded the young convert? Let us not therefore despise
   grace wherever it is, but heartily prize what we are apt to overlook.

   III. Lastly, LET US CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHAT WE CANNOT FULLY UNDERSTAND.
   I want you first to consider the very singular fact which you cannot
   understand, that holy children should be often placed in ungodly
   families. God's providence has arranged it so, yet the consequences are
   painful to the young believer. You would think that if God loved a
   child he would not suffer it to be born unto Jeroboam's court, and that
   he would not send his own chosen down into a back slain to be
   surrounded by everything that will grieve its tender heart; and yet God
   does send his dear children into such places. Why is this?

   Well first they are God's protest against sin where no other protest
   would be hearda tender touching message from God to let the ungodly
   know that there is something better than the sin in which they wallow.
   Holy children are as angels and demons, by their innocence rebuking
   sin. Does not God send children there also to make a display of his
   divine grace, that we may see that he chooses whom he wills and takes
   one of a family according to his good pleasure? Does he not also show
   us that he can keep grace alive in the most unlikely places where all
   things war against the soul? The grace of God can live where you and I
   would die. The life of grace can continue under conditions, which
   threaten death. Some of the brightest and most gracious people have
   been found where there was nothing to keep them, but everything to
   hinder them. Does not the Lord permit this to show what his grace can
   do? and is it not intended to be an encouragement to each of us to be
   faithful? for if this dear child could be faithful to God with such a
   father and mother, and in such a court, ought you and I to be afraid?
   Oh, you big man, let a child shame youyou were afraid to speak out
   before your work-mates the other day! What a coward you must be, when
   this child displayed his love to the Lord God of Israel where all
   opposed!

   Is it not remarkable how God distributes his people, as we scatter
   salt? He sets one of them down in each den of evil. Saul the king is a
   great rebel against God; but close at his side is Jonathan: thus the
   sweetest flower that ever bloomed is found growing near the roughest
   bramble that could be found. What a sty of filthiness was the court or
   Ahab! and yet he had for his chamberlain Obadiah, who hid the servants
   of God by fifties in a cave, and fed them from Jezebel's table;
   Nebuchadnezzar must not be left without three holy champions who can go
   into the fire for God. Look at Belshazzar drinking wine out of the cups
   of the sanctuary, and yet a Daniel is employed in his court. Even in
   the court of Ahasuerus, Esther is placed to confront that wicked Haman.
   Oh, I think there is never an Uz without a Job, nor a Chaldea without
   an Abraham, nor a Sodom without a Lot, nor an Egypt without a Moses,
   nor a house of Eli that has gone astray without some little Samuel sent
   of God to bear his protest. Think over the ways of God to man and
   admire what you cannot understand.

   The next thing that we cannot understand is this, that God's dear
   little children who love him should often be called to suffer. We say,
   "Well, if it was my child I should heal him and ease his sufferings at
   once." Yet the Almighty Father allows his dear ones to be afflicted.
   The godly child of Jeroboam lies sick, and yet his wicked father is not
   sick, and his mother is not sick; we could almost wish they were, that
   they might do the less evil. Only one godly one is in the family, and
   he lies sick! Why was it so? Why is it so in other cases? You shall see
   a gracious child a cripple, you shall see a heavenly-minded girl a
   consumptive: you shall often see the heavy hand of God resting where
   his eternal love has fixed its choice. There is a meaning in all this,
   and we know somewhat of it; and if we knew nothing we would believe all
   the same in the goodness of the Lord. Jerohoam's son was like the fig
   of the sycamore tree, which does not ripen till it is bruised: by his
   sickness he was speedily ripened for glory. Besides, it was for his
   fathers good and his mother's good that he was sick; if they had been
   willing to learn from the sorrow, it might have greatly blessed them.
   It did drive them to the prophet of God. Oh, that it had driven them to
   God himself! A sick child has led many a blinded parent to the Savior,
   and eyes have thereby been opened.

   There is something more remarkable still, and that is that some of
   God's dearest children should die white they are yet young. I should
   have said let Jeroboam die and his wife too, but spare the child. Ay,
   but the child must go he is the fittest. His departure was intended to
   give glory to God's grace in saving such a child, and making him so
   soon perfect. It was to be the reward of grace, for the child was taken
   from the evil to come; he was to die in peace and be buried, whereas
   the rest of the family would be slain with the sword and given to the
   jackals and the vultures to tear in pieces. In this child's case his
   early death was a proof of grace. If any say that converted children
   ought not to be taken into the church, I answer, how is it the Lord
   takes so many of them into heaven? If they are fit for the one, they
   surely are fit for the other? The Lord, in infinite mercy, often takes
   children home to himself, and saves them from the trials of long life
   and temptation; because not only is there grace in them, but there is
   so much more grace than usual that there is no need for delay, they are
   ripe already for the harvest. It is wonderful what great grace may
   dwell in a boy's heart: child piety is by no means of an inferior kind,
   it is sometimes ripe for heaven.

   Once more, it does strike me as a very singular thing that such a child
   as this should die and yet produce no effect whatever on his parents;
   for neither Jeroboam nor his wife repented of their sins because their
   child was taken home to God. I may be addressing some here who have
   lost a darling in whom the grace of God was from his youth. Do you mean
   to lose the benefit of such a costly experiment upon your heart? Shall
   such bitter medicine be given to you in vain? Why, there is a great
   power for good about a living child, much more ought there to be about
   a dying one. A sailor landed in New York one day, and he said to
   himself; "I'll have a fine time of it before I go to sea again." It was
   Sunday morning, and in the madness of his wickedness he went up to a
   girl who was going to her class, and he spoke to her mocking and wicked
   words. She turned round and looked at him with her beautiful, sad eyes,
   and said, "Sir, you will have to meet me at the bar of God!" The sailor
   started back, turned on his heel, and made the best of his way to his
   vessel that he might get out of temptation. He said afterwards, "I
   never had such a broadside in my life as that girl gave me; she raked
   me before and after, and swept by the board every sail and spar with
   which I had got ready for a wicked cruise." He went on his knees,
   repented of his sins, and found the Savior. Shall a strange child have
   such power by its look and word, and shall not your own child impress
   you by its death? A father was swearing dreadfully one day: he had
   often been rebuked for it but never felt the rebuke; but on that
   occasion using a most horrible expression to his wife, his little
   daughter in fright ran behind the door and began to cry. She sobbed
   aloud until her father heard her. He said to her, "What are you crying
   for?" "Please, father," she said, and kept on crying. He cried out
   roughly, "I will know what you are crying about;" and the child
   replied, "Dear father, I was crying because I am so afraid you will go
   to hell, for teacher says that swearers must go there." "There," said
   the man. "Dry your eyes, childI will never swear any more." He kept
   his word, and soon he went to see where his daughter had learned her
   holy lesson. Now, if children living among the roughest can by their
   tears win the victory, your dear child, with whose curls you used to
   play, but who has now been taken home to heaven, ought to touch your
   heart if you are not following in the way to glory! Your child beckons
   you from above and bids you "come up hither." Will you turn away? There
   is but one way: it is by faith in Jesus that men are saved. May Christ
   the Lord lead you to it now if you are unconverted, and may there this
   day be found in you "some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel."
   Amen.

The Devil's Last Throw

   (No. 1746)

   Delivered on Lord's-day Evening, June 10th, 1883, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [5]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington,

   On an evening when the regular hearers left their seats to be occupied
   by strangers.

   "And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him."
   Luke 9:42.

   OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST taught the people much by his words, but he
   taught them even more by his actions. He was always preaching, his
   whole life was a heavenly discourse on divine truth; and the miracles
   which he wrought were not only the proofs of his deity, but the
   illustrations of his teaching his wonders of mercy were, in fact, acted
   sermons, truths embodied, pictorial illustrations appealing to the eye,
   and thus setting forth gospel teaching quite as clearly as vocal speech
   could have done. When we read of the miracles of our Lord, we should
   not only accept them as proofs of his Deity, and seals of his
   commission, but as instructions as to the manner of his gracious
   working. What he did of old to the bodies of men should be received as
   a prophecy of what he is to-day prepared to do to the souls of men. I
   am sure I shall not be straining the meaning of the text, or the
   intention of the miracle, if, instead of preaching about the youth
   possessed of the devil, and dwelling only upon that wonderful display
   of power, I endeavor to show that there are parallel cases at this time
   in the world of mind. Jesus is able to work in the unseen spirit-world
   miracles such as were foreshadowed by those, which he wrought in the
   visible natural world.

   I suppose that we have never seen Satanic possession, although I am not
   quite sure about it; for some men exhibit symptoms which are very like
   it. The present existence of demons within the bodies of men I shall
   neither assert nor deny; but certainly, in our Savior's day it was very
   common for devils to take possession of men and torment them greatly.
   It would seem that Satan was let loose while Christ was here below that
   the serpent might come into personal conflict with the appointed seed
   of the woman, that the two champions might stand foot to foot in solemn
   duel, and that the Lord Jesus might win a glorious victory over him.
   Since his defeat by our Lord, and by his apostles, it would seem that
   Satan's power over human bodies has been greatly limited; but we have
   still among us the same thing in another and worse shape, namely, the
   power of sin over men's minds. That this is akin to the power of the
   devil over the body is clear from holy Scripture. "The God of this
   world hath blinded the eyes of them that believe not." "The spirit that
   now worketh in the children of disobedience," says the apostle Paul
   Satan works in all ungodly men, as a smith at his forge; do you wonder
   that they sometimes curse and swear? These are only the sparks from the
   forge below, flying out of the chimney. The evil one is found
   co-operating with evil natures, finding fire for their tinder, blowing
   up the flame that is within them, and in every way assisting them, and
   exciting them to do evil; so that, albeit men are not possessed of
   devils in the sense in which they were so in Christ's day, yet the evil
   one still has power over them and leads them whithersoever he desires.
   Do we not constantly meet with persons of this kind? I do. I know
   passionate men in whom the fiercest of devils appear to rave and rage;
   and I could point out others whose love of lying betrays the presence
   of the father of lies. One blasphemes and uses such filthy language
   that we are sure his tongue is set on fire of hell, even if the prince
   of devils is not ruling it. A man says, "Drink is ruining me, body and
   soul. I know that it is shortening my life. I have had delirium
   tremens, and I know that I shall have it again if I continue as I am;
   but I cannot leave the drink. Sometimes the craving comes over me, and
   I seem as if I must swallow the intoxicating draught, whether I will or
   no." Whether this is the devil, or whether it is altogether the man
   himself, I am not going to argue; but the drink-devil, whose name is
   legion, is certainly among us to this day, and we hear persons tell us
   that they are anxious to escape from its power, and yet they return to
   it, rushing to intoxication as the swine rushed into the sea when the
   demons had entered into them.

   Need I mention another form of this evil in the shape of unchastity?
   How many a man there isalas, it is true of women too!struggling
   against a fierce passion, and yet that passion conquers them; the
   unclean desire comes upon them like a hurricane bearing all before it,
   and they yield to it as the sere leaf yields to the blast. Nay more,
   they rush into a sin, which they themselves condemn, of which already
   they have tasted the bitter fruit: they could not be more eager for it
   if it were the purest of all enjoyments. As the moth dashes again into
   the candle, which has burned its wings, so do men hurry into the vice
   which has filled them with misery. They are possessed and domineered
   over by the spirit of lust, and return to their crimes as the oxen
   return to the stream.

   I need not go further into details, for one man falls into sin in one
   way, and another falls after quite a different fashion. All devils are
   not alikethough they are alike evil. Anger differs from lust, and
   profligacy laughs at covetousness, yet are they all of one brood,
   privates in the same dreadful legion. Men practice differing sins, but
   their sins all manifests the same evil power. Unless Christ has set us
   free we are all in some shape or other under the dominion of the prince
   of darkness, the master of the forces of evil.

   This poor young man of whom we are to talk to night was brought into a
   most horrible condition through the influence of a Satanic spirit. He
   was a lunatic: reason had been dethroned. He was an epileptic, so that
   if left alone he would fall into the fire or into the water. You have
   yourself seen persons in fits of epilepsy, and you know how dreadful
   would be their danger if they were taken in a fit in the middle of a
   street, or by the side of a river. In this youth's case the epilepsy
   was only the means by which the demon exercised his power, and this
   made his condition seven-fold worse than if it had been simply a
   disease. This afflicted one had become deaf and dumb besides, and very
   violent, so that he was capable of doing a great deal of mischief. In
   all the Holy Land there was only one who could do anything for him
   there was one name by which he could be cured, and only one. It was the
   name of Jesus. The Lord Jesus had disciples who had wrought miracles in
   his name, but they were baffled by this extraordinary case. They tried
   what they could do, but they were utterly defeated, and gave up the
   task in despair; and now there remained only one person beneath the
   canopy of heaven that could touch this child's case and drive out the
   devil. Only one person could now answer the poor father's prayers:
   every other hope was dead. That is just the state in which we are:
   there is bat one name under heaven whereby we must be saved. Many are
   the pretended salvations, but only one is real.

   "There is a name high over all,
   In hell, and earth, and sky.
   Angels and men before it fall,
   And devils fear and fly."

   That one name is the name of Jesus, the Son of God, to whom all power
   is given. He is God, and can deliver any man from the dominion of evil,
   whatever form it may have assumed, and however long established the
   dominion may be. Cure besides there is none. Nothing else can rescue a
   man from the thralldom of his sin but the word of Jesus. When the word
   of power is spoken from his divine mouth all things obey; but none out
   of the ten thousand voices of earth can deliver us from evil. We are
   shut up to heavens unique remedy: God grants that, being so shut up, we
   may avail ourselves of it.

   This poor lad, although nobody could cure him save Jesus, had a father
   that loved him, and nobody could tell the sorrow of that father's heart
   because of his poor son. The father had a sharp struggle to get his son
   to the disciples, for epileptic persons who are also insane are hard to
   manage. I cannot tell how many round about assisted to hold him, all
   pitying the poor creature. Alas, the Lord Jesus Christ was away! The
   parent's heart was heavy when he found that the great healer to whom he
   looked was for a while absent. But when Jesus came down from the
   mountaintop the poor demoniac had this one great advantagethat he had
   friends to aid in bringing him to Christ. I hope that all here who are
   not saved are privileged with relationship to some friend who seeks
   their salvation. Perhaps it is a wife who cannot bear that her husband
   should remain out of Christ, or a husband who pines till his spouse is
   turned unto the Lord, and in either case it is a great help. How often
   a mother bears a secret anguish in her breast for her unconverted sons
   and daughters! I have known a sister in the family to be the only one
   who knew the Lord, and she has pleaded with the Lord day and night,
   entreating him to bless the whole of her household. Frequently a
   servant in the house becomes its best helper, or it may he a neighbor
   who has seen the ungodly conduct of his neighbors never ceases to pry
   for them. When some few get together to bring a especially hard case
   before Jesus, it is blessed work: for desperate cases grow hopeful
   under the influence of prayer. Come, ye saved ones, pray with me now
   for these unrenewed sinners, that at this moment they may feel the
   power of our Lord Jesus.

   I. So, then, my first point shall be, that OUR HOPES ARE ALL AWAKENED.
   Here is a poor youth, but bad as he is terribly possessed us he is, he
   is coming to Christ! Prayer has been offered for him by his father, and
   Jesus is near. All looks well! We will take the ease of a sinner who is
   in a similar condition: prayer has been offered for him, and that
   prayer has, in some measure, been heard. We have in this congregation,
   I trust, some who are coming to Christ, and I am right glad of it.
   Coming to Christ is not the best possible condition, for the best
   condition is to have already come to him. For a hungry man to be coming
   to a dinner is not enough: he must actually reach the table and eat.
   For a sick man to be coming to an eminent physician is hopeful, but it
   is not enough; he must get to that physician, take his medicine, and be
   restored. That is the point. To be coming to Christ is not enough: you
   must actually come to him, and really receive him; for to such only
   does he give power to become the sons of God.

   This poor child was coming, and so are some here: that is to say, they
   have begun to hear the gospel with attention. They did not aforetime go
   anywhere on the Sabbath nor did they get up very early on a Sunday
   morning. I can see a man who seldom rose on a Sunday morning, and when
   he did, he read his newspaper. You might see him any time before one
   o'clock in his shirtsleeves. Half this city of London is in that
   condition every Sunday morning, because they look upon the day as
   simply their own day, and not the Lord's-day. They have very short
   memories, and do not "remember the sabbath-day to keep it holy:" they
   forget all about its being the Lord's-day, and do not reverence it.
   This is shameful conduct towards God. If a man on the road were to meet
   with a poor beggar, and give him six out of seven shillings, which he
   had with him, the beggar would be a wicked wretch if he afterwards
   knocked the man down and stole the other shilling. Yet there are
   multitudes of people to whom God gives six days out of seven, and
   nothing will satisfy them but they must have the seventh all to
   themselves, and rob God of it. The man I refer to is repenting of this
   wrong, and so you see him coming upon the Sunday morning to hear the
   gospel. He hears it very attentively; he leans forward to catch every
   word, and he treasures up what he hears.

   We are sure that he is coming to Christ, for when he gets home he
   reaches down his Bible. He has begun to read the Word of God in an
   earnest way. He thought at one time that it was about the dullest book
   in the world. He even dared to turn it into a jest, and all because he
   never read it; for those who deny the inspiration of Scripture are
   almost always people who have never read it for themselves. It is a
   book, which carries conviction within itself to candid minds when they
   carefully peruse it. Assuredly this man is coming to Christ, for he
   searches the Scriptures.

   I feel sure he is coming to Christ, for he has begun to mend in many
   respects. He has dropped his frequent attendance at his usual place of
   worship, namely, the public house. He keeps more at home, and is
   therefore sober. Plenty of people in London need no bell to fetch them
   into the temples of their gods. We see in some of our churches and
   chapels persons going in twenty minutes or half-an-hour after service
   begins; but look at the temples of Bacehus at one o'clock, and at six
   in the evening, and see how punctual are his votaries! The worshippers
   of liquid fire stand outside till the shrine is opened; they are afraid
   of being late; they are so thirsty that they long for the time of the
   deadly libation. Drink seems to be the water of life to them, poor
   creatures that they are! But now our friend of whom we are so hopeful
   is not seen waiting at the posts of the doorsthe "Blue Posts," I mean.
   Thank God, he is looking to another fountain for comfort.

   Note also that he has dropped his blasphemy and his unchastity. He is a
   purer man in mouth and body than he used to be. He is coming to Christ.
   But, as I said, coming is not enough. The thing is really to reach the
   Lord Jesus and to be healed by him. I pray you, do not rest short of
   this.

   Still, this is all hopeful, very hopeful. The man is a hearer; he is
   also a reader of the Scriptures; he has begun to mend a bit; and now he
   is a thinker, too, and begins to be a little careful about his soul.
   While he is at his labor, you can see that there is something working
   in his brain, though once it was filled with vanity and wickedness. He
   has a weight, too, at his heart, a burden on his mind; he is evidently
   in earnest; so far as he knows the teaching of Scripture he is deeply
   affected by it. He has learned that he will not cease to exist when he
   dies; but that he will continue to be when yonder sun becomes black as
   a burnt-out coal. He knows that there will he a day of judgment, when
   throngs upon throngs, yea, all the dead, shall stand before the
   judgment-seat of Christ to give an account of the things which they
   have done in the body; he thinks this over, and he is alarmed. He chews
   the cud upon divine truth, and finds time for solitary meditation. That
   man is coming to Christ, for there is no better evidence of the face
   being set towards Christ and heaven than a thoughtful state of mind.
   And I have heardof course, I cannot tell, for I was not there to seeI
   have heard, I say, that the other night he began to pray. If so, I know
   that he is coming to Christ, for prayer is a sure token. He has not vet
   cast himself fully at the feet of Jesus, but he cries, "Lord, save me."
   He is coming, and I am as glad as the birds on a spring morning. The
   angels are watching; they are leaning from the battlements of heaven to
   see whether it will end rightly, and you and I are very hopeful,
   especially those of us who have been praying for this man; for since we
   see that there is some change in him, and he begins to think and pray,
   we look for his salvation, as men look for flowers when April showers
   are falling. So, you see, our hopes are excited.

   II. And now I will read the text again,"As he was yet a coming, the
   devil threw him down, and tare him." By this OUR FEARS ARE AROUSED.
   What a sight it must have been! Here is the poor father bringing his
   lunatic son, and friends are helping him; they are getting him near the
   Savior, and he is just coining to him who can cure him, when, on a
   sudden, he is taken in a fearful fit, worse than he shall ever suffered
   before. He is cast down, thrown about, dashed to and fro; he wallows on
   the ground: he seems to be flung up and down as by an unseen hand, we
   fear that he will be torn to pieces. See! he falls down like a dead
   man, and there he lies. As the crowd gathers around him, people cry,
   "He is dead." Does it not seem a dreadful thing that when hope was at
   its brightest all should he dashed aside?

   I have observed this thing scores of times: I might say, I think
   without exaggeration, hundreds of times. I have seen men, just when
   they were beginning to hear and beginning to think, taken on a sudden
   with such violence of sin, and so fearfully carried away by it, that if
   I had not seen the same thing before I should have despaired of them;
   but, having often seen it, I know what it means, and I am not so
   dismayed as a raw observer might be; though I must confess that it half
   breaks my heart when it happens to some hopeful convert whom I hoped to
   receive into the church, and to rejoice over. We mourn when we hear
   that the man who was somewhat impressed has become worse than
   aforetime, and has gone back to the very vice from which we had rescued
   him. The case runs on the same lines as our text"As he was a coming,
   the devil threw him down, and tare him."

   How does the devil do this? Well, we have seen it done in this
   way:When the man had almost believed in Christ, but not quite, Satan
   seemed to multiply his temptations around him, and to bring his whole
   force to bear upon him. There is a wicked man in the shop, and the
   devil says to him, "Your mate is beginning to be serious: ridicule him.
   Tempt him all you can. Treat him to strong drink. Get him away to the
   theater, the music-hall, or the brothel." It is wonderful how the
   ungodly will lay all kinds of traps for one who is escaping from his
   sins. They are fearfully set on keeping him from Christ. This is a free
   country, is it not? A wonderfully free country when a Christian man in
   the workshop has to run the gauntlet for his very life to this day. A
   man may swear, and drink, and do what he likes that is detestable, and
   never is there a word of rebuke for him; but the moment he begins to be
   serious and thoughtful the wicked are down upon him like so many dogs
   on a rat. The devil finds willing servants, and they worry the poor
   awakened one; is there any wonder that, as he has not yet found Christ
   and is not yet saved, he should for the time be carried away by these
   assaults, and feel as if he could not go further in the right road?

   I have known in addition to all this that Satan has stirred up the
   anxious one's bad passions. Passions that lay asleep have suddenly been
   aroused. Moreover, the man has become thoughtful, and from that very
   fact doubts which he never knew before have come upon him. He begins to
   mend, and now he finds a difficulty in getting his needle through where
   the rent was made. He finds that tearing is easier work than mending,
   and that running into sin is a much more easy thing than rising out of
   the black ditch into which he has fallen. So now, what with those about
   him tempting him, his bad passions responding to the temptation and his
   doubts overclouding everything, it is not a marvelous thing that the
   poor creature grows worse before he gets better. The disease, which
   before had been concealed in more hidden and vital parts, seems to be
   thrown out upon the surface, and the sight is sickening. This, however,
   is not always a bad sign. Doctors rather prefer it to an inward
   festering.

   So have I seen it when men have been corning to Christ; their boat has
   been tossed with tempest, and they have been driven far out upon a
   raging sea.

   Yes, and I will tell you what I have seen. I have seen a man almost
   convertedwell-nigh a believer in Christ, on a sudden become more
   obstinate in his opposition to the gospel than ever he was before. A
   man that was quiet and harmless and inoffensive before has, under the
   influence of Satan, just when we hoped the best things of him, turned
   round in a rage against the people who sought to do him good, and he
   has spoken of the gospel which a little while before he seemed anxious
   to understand. Sometimes such persons act as if they were reckless and
   profane; just as boys, when they go through a graveyard, whistle to
   keep their courage up. Many a man says big things against the gospel
   when he is pretty nearly caving in, and he does not like anybody to
   know that he is beaten. He is coming to Jesus; but still he does not
   want anybody to see that he is so, and therefore he pretends to an
   opposition which is not sincere. Have you not discovered that a man is
   never so violent against a thing as when he is unwillingly convinced of
   the truth of it? He has to try and demonstrate to himself that he does
   not believe it by being very loud in his declarations: a secret
   something in his soul makes him believe, and he is mad because he
   cannot resist the inward conviction.

   Do not be astonishedyou that are trying to bring men to Christif it
   should often happen that these lunatics break loosethat these
   epileptics have a worse fit just before Christ cures them than ever you
   knew them to have had before.

   I will describe the usual way in which the devil throws men down and
   tears them. You need not listen to this unless you like, because it
   does not relate to all of you here; but it is true of a sufficient
   number to render it needful for me to speak of it. It is a very curious
   thing that if there is a poor soul in London that is well nigh insane
   through despair of heart he wants to talk to me. I am often sore
   burdened by the attempt to sympathize with the distracted. I do not
   know why they should be attracted to me, but they come to tell me of
   their evil state of mindpeople who have never seen me before. This
   fact gives me a wide field of actual practice and careful observation.
   I frequently meet with persons who are tempted with blasphemous
   thoughts. They have not yet laid hold on Christ, but they are trying to
   do so; and at this stage of their experience most horrible thoughts
   pass through their minds. They cannot prevent it they hate the
   thoughts, and yet they come, till they are ready to lose their reason.
   I will tell you what happened to me. I was engaged in prayer alone in a
   quiet place one day when I had just found the Savior, and while I was
   in prayer a most horrible stream of blasphemies came into my mind, till
   I clapped my hand to my mouth for fear that I should utter any one of
   them. I was so brought up that I do not remember ever hearing a man
   swear while I was a child; yet at that moment I seemed to know all the
   swearing and blasphemy that ever was in hell itself; and I wondered at
   myself. I could not understand whence this foul stream proceeded. I
   wrote to my venerable grandfather who was fur sixty years a minister of
   the gospel, and he said to me,"Do not trouble about it. These are no
   thoughts of yours; they are injected into your mind by Satan. The
   thoughts of man follow one another like the links of a chain, one link
   draws on another; but when a man is in prayer the next natural thought
   to prayer is not blasphemy; it is not, therefore, a natural secession
   of our own thoughts. An evil spirit casts those thoughts into the
   mind." I read also in an old book what they used to do years ago in our
   parishes in the "good old times" when nobody had any sense of humanity.
   If a poor wretch came to a parish begging, they whipped him through the
   place and sent him on to his own parish. Thus should we treat these
   diabolical thoughts. Whip them by hearty penitence and send them off to
   where they came from, back to their own parish, which is far down in
   the deeps. Thoughts of this sort, seeing you loathe them, are none of
   yours. Do not let Satan lay his brats at your door, but send them
   packing. Perhaps when you know this, it may help to break the chain;
   for the devil may not think it worth his while to worry you in this way
   any more, when he cannot by this means lead you to despair: he seldom
   wastes his time in spreading nets when the bird can see them.
   Therefore, tell Satan to begone, for you can see him, and you are not
   going to let him deceive you. It may be he will take the hint and
   begone.

   When this does not answer, I have known Satan to throw the coming
   sinner down and tear him in another way. "There," says he, "did you not
   hear the preacher speaking about election? You are not one of the
   elect. "Perhaps I am not," says one. Perhaps you are, say I, and I
   think that whether you are one of the elect or not, you had better
   come, on the ground that Jesus says"Him that cometh to me I will in no
   wise cast out. If you come, he will not cast you out, and then you will
   find that you are one of the elect. You need not trouble about
   predestination you will see that clearly enough very soon. If any man
   had a ticket to go to a meeting, and he said, "I do not know whether I
   am ordained to get in or not," I should think it very probable that he
   was not ordained to eater if he sat at home in the chimney-corner and
   did not make the attempt to go; but if, having his ticket, he walked to
   the place and went in, I should feel sure that he was ordained to go
   in. You will know your election when you have obeyed your calling. Go
   you to Christ because you are commanded and invited, and leave the
   deeper question to be answered by the facts.

   Satan will throw men down and tear them in another way. "Ah!" says he,
   "you are too big a sinner." I make short work of that. No man is too
   big a sinner. "All manner of sin and of blasphemy shall be forgiven
   unto men."

   "Oh but," says Satan, "it is too late." Another lie of his. It is never
   too late so long as we are in this world, and come to Jesus for pardon.
   Generally in the case of young people he puts the clock back, and says
   "It is too soon"; and then when they get old he puts the clock on, and
   says "It is too late." It is never too late as long as Jesus lives, and
   the sinner repents. If a sinner were as old as Methuselah, if he came
   to Christ and trusted him he would be saved.

   "Oh but," the devil says, "it is no use your trying at all. The gospel
   is not true." Ay, but it is true, for some of us have proved it. I
   could bring before you to night, if it were necessary, men and women
   who lived in sin and wallowed in it, and yet the Lord Christ has saved
   them by his precious blood. They would rejoice to tell you how they
   have been delivered from the reign of sin by faith in Jesus, though
   they could never have delivered themselves. The gospel is true. Our
   converts prove it. Conversion is the standing miracle of the church;
   and while we see what it works every day in the week, we are confident
   and sure. When men that were passionate, dishonest, unchaste, covetous,
   become holy, gracious, loving, pure, generous, then we know that the
   gospel is true by the effect, which it produces. A lie would never
   produce holiness and love. Out of the way, devil! It is all in vain for
   you to come here with your falsehoods; we know the truth about you, and
   about the gospel, and you shall not deceive us.

   And then the devil will come with this"It is of no use. Give it up;
   give it up." Many and many a man who has been on the brink of eternal
   life, has been thrown down and torn with this," It is of no use; give
   it up. You have prayed, and you have not been answered: never pray
   again. You have attended the house of God, and you have become more
   miserable than ever: never go again. Ever since you have been a
   thinking man and a sober man, you have had more trouble than ever you
   had. See, says the devil, "what comes of your religion." Thus he tries
   to induce the newly awakened to give it up. But oh, in God's name let
   me implore you do not turn from it, for you are on the brink of the
   grand discovery. Another turf turned, and there is the golden treasure.
   After all your strivingyour long strivingnever give up the search
   until you have found your Savior; for your Savior is to be found. Trust
   in him this night, and he is yours forever.

   III. I shall not detain you much longer. But as our hopes have been
   awakened and our fears have been aroused, let us look on the scene till
   OUR WONDER IS EXCITED. Did you notice when I was reading in the ninth
   chapter of Mark, how Jesus healed this poor child? He did heal him, he
   healed him of all that complication, healed him of the devil's
   domination, healed him of the epilepsy, healed him of being deaf and
   dumb, healed him of being a lunatic, healed him of pining away; and in
   one moment that young man was completely saved from all his ills. He
   could speak; he could hear; he was cured of his epilepsy, and was no
   more a lunatic, but a happy rational being. The whole thing was done at
   once. Wonder, and never leave off wondering!

   "Can a man be changed all at once? It must take a long time," says one.
   I admit there are certain qualities, which come only by education and
   patient watchfulness. There are certain parts of the Christian
   character that come of culture, and must be watered with tears and
   prayer. But let me assure you, not as a matter of theory, but as a
   matter which I have seen for thirty years, that a man's character may
   be totally changed in less time than it takes me to tell you of it.
   There is such power in the name of Christ that, if that name be
   preached and the Spirit of God applies it, men can be turned right
   round. There can be a total reversal of all their conduct, and, what is
   more than that, of all their inclinations, and desires and wishes, and
   delights and hates; for God can take away the heart of stone and give a
   heart of flesh. The child of darkness can be translated into the
   kingdom of light. The dead heart can be quickened into a spiritual
   existence, and that in a single moment, by faith in Jesus Christ. When
   that poor epileptic child was healed, it is said that the people were
   amazed. But how much greater will be our amazement if we see the Lord
   Jesus work such a miracle upon you, have struggled to get better, you
   have prayed to get better, and all seems to be unavailing. Now, just
   trust Christ, the blessed Son of God who reigns in heaven, who died for
   sinners, and now lives for sinners. Only trust him, and this blessed
   deed is done, you become a new creature in Christ Jesus, and commence a
   holy life, which shall never end. This wonder can be performed now.

   This cure was perfected at once, and it remained with the youth. The
   most charming point about it was that the Lord Jesus said, "Thou dumb
   and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into
   him." Enter no more into himthere is the glory of it! Though the
   epileptic fit was ended, yet the young man would not have been cured if
   the devil had returned to take possession of him again, The Savior's
   cures endure the test of years. "Enter no more into him" preserved the
   young man by a life-long word of power.

   I never dare to preach to anybody a temporary salvation. "Believe in
   the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved," not for to night
   merely, but for ever. When God saves a man he is saved: not for weeks
   and years, but eternally. If Christ turns the devil out of him he shall
   enter into that man no more for ever. Now, this is a salvation that is
   worth your having, and worth my preaching. A temporary, I had almost
   said, a trumpery salvation, that saves a man for a few months and then
   lets him perish, is not worth preaching or having; but that which so
   makes a man new as to put into him "a well of water springing up into
   everlasting life"that is worth worlds. I will tell you a story of
   Christmas Evans which I like to tell on this point. Christmas Evans was
   once describing the prodigal's coming back to his father's house, and
   he said that when the prodigal sat at the father's table his father put
   upon his plate all the daintiest bits of meat that he could find; but
   the son sat there and did not eat, and every now and then the tears
   began to flow. His father turned to him and said, "My dear son, why are
   you unhappy? You spoil the feasting. Do you not know that I love you?
   Have I not joyfully received you?" "Yes," he said, "dear father, you
   are very kind, but have you really forgiven me? Have you forgiven me
   altogether, so that you will never be angry with me for all I have
   done?" His father looked on him with ineffable love and said, "I have
   blotted out thy sins and thy iniquities, and will remember them no more
   for ever. Eat, my dear son." The father turned round and waited on the
   guests, but by-and-by his eyes were on his boy, they could not be long
   removed. There was the son weeping again, but not eating. "Come, dear
   child," said his father, "come, why are you still mourning? What is it
   that you want?" Bursting into a flood of tears a second time, the son
   said, "Father, am I always to stop here? Will you never turn me out of
   doors?" The father replied, "No, my child, thou shalt go no more out
   for ever, for a son abides for ever." Still the son did not enjoy the
   banquet; there was still something rankling within, and again he wept.
   Then his father said, "Now, tell me, tell me, my dear son, all that is
   in thy heart. What do you desire more?" The son answered, "Father, will
   you make me stop here? Father, I am afraid lest, if I were left to
   myself, I might play the prodigal again. Oh, constrain me to stay here
   for ever!" The father said, "I will put my fear in thy heart, and thou
   shalt not depart from me." "Ah! then," the son replied, "it is enough,"
   and merrily he feasted with the rest. So I preach to you just thisthat
   the great Father when he takes you to himself will never let you go
   away from him again.

   Whatever your condition, if you trust your soul to Jesus, you shall be
   saved, and saved forever.

   "Once in Christ, in Christ for ever:
   Nothing from his love can sever."

   "But what if we fall into great sin?" says one. You shall not abide in
   great sin. You shall be kept and preserved by that same power which has
   begun the good work, for it will surely carry it on even to the end.

   Just two or three sentences and I have finished. I have been speaking
   about the devil throwing some down and tearing them when they are
   coming to Christ. Are there any of you who do not know anything about
   it? Well, I am glad that you do not. If you come to Christ without
   being thrown down and torn I am glad of it. I have endeavored to help
   those that are terribly tormented; but if you are not so tried, do not
   wish to be. There were here this morning two or three of the good
   fish-people from Newhaven, and when I saw them in their picturesque
   costumes they reminded me of a story that I heard about an old fishwife
   who used to live near Edinburgh. A young man visited her, and began
   speaking to her about her soul. She was going out, and she took up her
   great load of fish to carry on her back, much more than most men would
   like to carry. The young man said to her, "Well, you have got a great
   burden there, good woman. Did you ever feel a spiritual burden?" She
   put down her load and said, "You mean that harden which John Bunyan
   speaks about in the Pilgrim's Progress, do you not?" "Yes," he said.
   "Well," she said, "I felt that burden before you were born, and I got
   rid of it, too; but I did not go exactly the same way to work that John
   Bunyan's pilgrim did." Our young friend thought that she could not be
   up to the mark to talk so, for he fancied that John Bunyan could not
   make a mistake. "Well," she said, "John Bunyan says that Evangelist
   pointed the man with the burden on his back to the wicket-gate, and
   when he could not see the gate, Evangelist said, 'Do you see that
   light?' And he looked till he thought he saw something like it. 'You
   are to run that waythe way of that light and that wicket gate.' Why,
   she said, "that was not the right direction to give a poor burdened
   soul. Much good he got out of it; for he had not gone far before he
   fell into the Slough of Despond, up to his neck in the mire, and had
   like to have been swallowed up. Evangelist ought to have said, 'Do you
   see that cross? Do not run an inch, but stand where you are, and look
   to that; and as you look your burden will be gone. I looked to the
   cross at once and lost my load. "What!" said the young man, "did you
   never go through the Slough of Despond?" "Yes," she said, "I have been
   through it far too many times; but let me tell you, young friend, that
   it is a deal easier to go through the Slough of Despond with your
   burden off than it is with your burden on." There is much blessed truth
   in this story. Do not any of you be saying to yourselves, "How I wish I
   could get into the Slough of Despond!" If you say that, you will get
   in, and then you will say, "How I wish I could get out of the Slough of
   Despond!" I have met with persons who fear that they never were saved
   because they have not experienced much terror. I meet with others who
   say that they cannot be saved because they experience too much terror.
   There is no pleasing people. Oh that they would look to Jesus whether
   or no! After I was preaching Jesus Christ from this platform once,
   there came a man into the vestry who said to me," Blessed be God that I
   entered this Tabernacle. I come from Canada, sir. My father, before he
   found true religion had to be locked up in a lunatic asylum, and I
   always thought that I must undergo a similar terror before I could be
   saved." I said, "No, no, my dear friend, you are to believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and if you do that, despond or not despond, you are a
   saved man." This gospel I preach to you. Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ. Trust him quietly, humbly, simply, immediately. Trust him to
   make you a holy manto deliver you from the power of the devil and the
   power of sin, and he will do it: I will be bound for him that he will
   keep his word. Jesus is truth itself, and never breaks his word. He
   never boasts that he can do what he cannot do. He has gone into heaven,
   and he is therefore "able to save them to the uttermost that come unto
   God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them." Only
   trust him. Trust him to overcome the evil you have to fight with. You
   will conquer it, man, if you will only trust Jesus. Woman, there is
   hope for you if you will trust the wounded, bleeding, dying, risen,
   living Savior. He will battle for you, and you shall get the victory.

   God bless you, everyone, and may we all meet in heaven to praise the
   Son of God forever and ever.

Marvelous! Marvelous!

   (No. 1747)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 28, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Thus says the LORD of Hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the
   remnant of this people in these days, will it also be marvelous in My
   eyes? says the LORD of Hosts." Zechariah 8:6.

   GOD sent His servant Zechariah with a promise that Jerusalem should be
   rebuilt and that it should enjoy a time of great peace and prosperity.
   Instead of men being slain in battle in the prime of their days, old
   men and old women were to dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, "every man
   with his staff in his hand for very age." And whereas war had often cut
   off the women and the children, the promise further added, "the streets
   of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets."
   Everything was to be prosperous in the land around, so as to bring
   plenty into the city--"For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall
   give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens
   shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to
   possess all these things."

   It was a sweet assurance and it ought to have made them very happy, but
   it did not. When this gracious promise came, it startled the people,
   for it seemed past belief! The unbelievers did not say, point blank,
   "This promise is not true," but deep in their brains they thought as
   much. It is not the general habit of unbelief among God's people to
   give a flat contradiction to His promises--we are hardly honest enough
   to our own thoughts to express them with deliberate plainness of
   speech--even unbelief loves to wear some cobweb covering or other so
   that its naked deformity may not appear. Our reverence for the Lord
   will not permit us to distinctly call Him a liar, but it comes to much
   the same thing, for in our heart of hearts we deny the truthfulness of
   His Word.

   The remnant of Israel said, "How can this thing be? In these days, in
   these troublous days, in these threatening days, how can Jerusalem be
   made to prosper? Former hopes have been disappointed. We see no better
   signs of the times and no doubt, if our hopes are now raised, they will
   again be disappointed. How can the city rise from its ashes? We can
   hardly think it possible! At any rate, it will be marvelous, extremely
   difficult, exceedingly unlikely, indeed, impossible!" They did not say
   dogmatically, "It will not be," but they said, "It will be a marvelous
   thing"--by which they meant that it was not in the least likely. You
   who carry Bibles with you which have the marginal readings, will notice
   that in the margin there is the word, "difficult," and the text may be
   read thus, "Thus says the Lord of Hosts: If it is difficult in your
   eyes, will it also be difficult in My eyes?"

   This is the only instance in which the word, "difficult," occurs in our
   version of the Bible, and in this case it is only to be found in the
   margin. There is too much of God in the Bible for difficulties to live
   in it! I would be very glad if I could always put the word,
   "difficult," into the margin of my life and never let it stand in the
   substance of it. I wish my faith would banish it. Difficulty does crop
   up, now and then, through unbelief, but where God manifests Himself,
   difficulty vanishes! Leave it in the margin, Brothers and Sisters!
   Leave it in the margin! Let it not be read in the annals of your actual
   life. A brave self-reliance blots the word, "difficult," out of its
   dictionary and a full God-reliance may much more safely do so. If God
   is for us, all things can be accomplished. Things impossible with men
   are possible with God!

   The remnant of Israel said, "It will be difficult," but then they
   softened the words a little, and said, "It will be marvelous in our
   eyes." Still, it came to this--they did not believe the Word of the
   Lord. They could not conceive how the promise could be fulfilled and,
   therefore, because it surpassed their conception, they supposed that
   the Lord was equally non-pleased and perplexed. Because the restored
   prosperity of Jerusalem would be a great wonder, they doubted if it
   could ever be accomplished! Yet, blessed be the name of the Lord, it
   was accomplished, for, "though we believe not, He abides faithful; He
   cannot deny Himself." It certainly was a marvelous thing that
   Jerusalem, after having been so dreadfully destroyed, should again lift
   up its head and enjoy a little period of sunlight--but we are called
   upon to believe in even greater wonders--wonders of a spiritual kind
   which are more difficult to believe than material miracles!

   I am going to talk about what to every intelligent and awakened mind
   will be the greatest wonder of all, namely, the possibility of our
   salvation by faith which is in Christ Jesus. Satan will assail you who
   are saved and you who are seeking to be saved. And he will aim a blow
   at your faith. If he does not dare to tell you in his own native tongue
   of point-blank lying, that the promise which the Gospel makes to the
   Believer is false, yet he will lead you to think it highly
   improb-able--too good to be true, too wonderful ever to happen--in a
   word, he will make it appear marvelous in your eyes and he will hint
   that it is incredible. So this morning I am going, first, to speak upon
   carnal reasoning, how it runs. Secondly, to offer a correction to that
   reasoning by pointing out an untruth which lies at the bottom of it.
   And, thirdly, I will try, in conclusion, to dwell upon the truth of the
   matter and see if we cannot enjoy some right reasoning.

   O blessed Spirit of Grace, teach our reason right reason at this hour
   and make us to perceive all things in the light of the Truth of God!

   I. Here we have before us a specimen of CARNAL REASONING. The Jews of
   those days said, "It is difficult; it will never be performed. It is
   marvelous in our eyes; it will never happen." This kind of speech comes
   from men as soon as they begin to think about their souls and to desire
   the salvation of the Lord. We inform them, in God's name, that whoever
   repents of sin and confesses it, and believes in Jesus Christ, shall
   receive immediate pardon. This good news surprises them, as well it
   may. Straightway the old serpent begins to hiss out a doubt and they
   ask, "How can it be? Can a man receive, in one moment, forgiveness for
   50 years of sin? How can his conscience be cleared by the simple act of
   believing in Christ? How can the record of a life of evil be blotted
   out at once?"

   Assuredly, it does not seem possible to a troubled mind! Reason decides
   that it must be very difficult. Common sense assents that it is a
   marvelous affair altogether--and the poor awakened hearts conclude that
   the promise of full, free forgiveness cannot be true. Thus they push
   the promise of God concerning pardon to one side as a good thing which
   is quite past belief. Then comes the blessing of renewal of heart, such
   as God speaks of in the Covenant promise, "A new heart, also, will I
   give them, and a right spirit will I put within them." Our hearer
   understands that upon his believing in Jesus he is born again and
   becomes a new creature with new likes and new hates--an entirely
   altered being! But understanding the promise is one thing and believing
   it is another!

   A new heart the awakened one desires, but he considers it too great a
   marvel. He asks, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his
   spots? Can I, who have been accustomed to do evil, learn to do well? It
   will be marvelous, indeed, if such a sinner as I should be turned into
   a saint--if such a rebel as I should become a loyal subject of King
   Jesus! Such a conversion will be most extraordinary. I do not think it
   can be carried out." He knows that he cannot subdue his own stubborn
   will, nor conquer his own unruly passions and, therefore, he concludes
   that the thing is impossible and not to be looked for. Thus another
   choice Covenant promise is thrown to one side by unbelief and the man
   sits down in self-created despair, under the persuasion that a new
   birth for him would be too marvelous a thing to expect!

   Even if the awakened soul proceeds as far as believing in the first two
   blessings, unbelief comes to him in another way, for this thief is sure
   to meet the traveler to Zion again and again! The Lord has promised
   that the righteous shall hold onto His way and he that has clean hands
   shall wax stronger and stronger. And Christ has declared that the
   living water which He gives shall be no transient gift, but shall be in
   a man a well of water springing up into everlasting life. "Oh, but,"
   says the tempted one, "how can I hope to persevere to the end? I shall
   be, one of these days, tempted so strongly that I shall be carried off
   my feet! What with indwelling sin and a cunning tempter and a world
   full of evil, I cannot hope to endure to the end! I shall, one day,
   fall by the hand of the enemy. Do you assure me that the righteous
   shall hold onto their way? Then it will be marvelous--it must be so
   difficult that I fear it is improbable, if not impossible." Thus
   unbelief pushes to one side another Covenant blessing.

   Further on there comes to the man who has been helped to persevere for
   a while, the promise that he shall ultimately be presented faultless
   before the Presence of God with exceeding joy--this promise is assailed
   in the same manner. The serpent of unbelief leaves its slimy trail upon
   everything! We are told that a day shall come when the Believer shall
   be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, made meet to dwell with
   the angels in light, yes, and to dwell with God Himself forever! And
   straightway the soul is tempted to think this wonderful effect of Grace
   to be impossible! When we remember how often we have been worsted by
   the enemy, how frail, how fallible we are--and how fierce and subtle is
   our adversary--we dare not hope that we shall see him utterly defeated
   and his power broken to pieces. We dwell upon the fact that it will be
   very marvelous--indeed, the more we think of it, the more marvelous it
   becomes in our eyes!

   And, alas, unbelief leaps upon the back of our wonder and we judge that
   the blessing can never be ours. Thus another promised blessing is
   thrown under the table. In fact, each mercy of God's Covenant is looked
   at, wondered at and then renounced--not because it is undesirable--but
   because it is so good, so rich, so full! O wretched unbelief which
   makes the excellence of the favor into a reason for refusing it! Help
   us, O Holy Spirit, to believe our Lord and to reason no more in this
   evil fashion! I have known children of God, in the time of their great
   trial when they have been surrounded with afflictions, oppressed with
   poverty and depressed in spirit, to become quite incredulous as to the
   possibility of deliverance. They ask, "How can God cause our bread to
   be given us and our water to be sure, now? Can He bring us out of such
   sore trouble as this? We know that He has been gracious to His people
   in other instances, but our case is one of peculiar difficulty! Surely
   our Lord has forsaken us--our God will be gracious no more."

   This comes of reasoning, falsely called. When we see no passage through
   our straits, we are sadly apt to conclude that God sees none! He has
   promised that with every trial He will make us a way of escape, but we
   doubt His Word. Like the unbelieving lord in the Book of Kings, we say,
   "If God would make windows in Heaven, might such a thing be?" Have you
   ever said that, my Brother, in your spirit? Dear Sister, has not the
   Evil One whispered such a word in your ears in dark times? Have you not
   fancied that you have passed beyond the reach of Divine help and will
   surely perish? In this way carnal reason is sure to argue and rob God
   of His Glory and our souls of consolation! It has been so from the
   beginning, that while doubting God we cover our unbelief with an evil
   sophistry--and this sophistry does not avail to remove the mischievous
   tendencies of our mistrust.

   Unbelievers, by this wicked reasoning, are left in their spiritual
   death, while Believers are hampered and sorely wounded. O accursed
   Unbelief, this is your false argument, "It is marvelous and, therefore,
   it cannot be true!" We answer you that because it is marvelous it is
   all the more likely to be true!

   II. Secondly, we will now aim our arrows at the dark spot in this
   carnal argument which makes it all to be false, or, in other words, we
   will CORRECT THIS REASONING. First, let us note that when because the
   blessing promised is marvelous we, therefore, doubt the promise of God
   concerning it, we must have forgotten God. "If it is marvelous in your
   eyes, says the Lord of Hosts, is it therefore marvelous in My eyes?"
   God Himself puts it so and there is but one answer to the question. My
   text is a very singular one, for it is hedged in with the name of the
   Lord and with a double, "thus says the Lord of Hosts."

   It begins with, "Thus says the Lord of Hosts," and it finishes up with,
   "says the Lord of Hosts," as if twice to bring to our memory that God
   is and that God has made a promise--and that this Promiser is Jehovah
   the great and powerful, the Lord of all who has countless armies at His
   beck and call! This unbelief forgets and, hence, her error. To come to
   our one subject, that of your own salvation, you hear the promise of
   eternal life in Christ Jesus and your mind replies, "It is marvelous,
   it is difficult." Do you not see that you are looking at it as if you
   had made the promise? From that standpoint it would be, indeed,
   difficult, even impossible! But whose promise is it? It is not yours
   but God's! If you were to promise to give yourself eternal life, to
   keep yourself to the end and sanctify yourself perfectly, what a
   foolish person you would be to undertake what you could not possibly
   perform! But it is not your promise--it is God's promise. Is anything
   too hard for the Lord?

   Look at it in that light. It is a marvelous promise for you to receive,
   but the God who spoke it knew what He was saying and He knew that He
   had power to perform it! It is the promise of God, "who alone does
   great wonders." Remember that! And remember, next, that God does not
   look to you to fulfill His promises. Do not fall into such a foolish
   thought! If you make a promise, it is your own business to carry it
   out, is it not? And if God makes a promise that He will save a
   sinner--whose work is it to save that sinner? Why, it is the work of
   the God who made the promise! It is written, "He that believes in Him
   has everlasting life." "Marvelous," you say, but who said it? Why, God!
   Then it is God's department to make it true. If you would but remember
   this--that the pardon of sin is God's business, that the renewing of
   the heart is God's business, that the keeping of the saint to the end
   is God's business, that the sanctifying and perfecting of all Believers
   is God's business--then you would find it more easy to believe.

   Can anything surpass the power of God? Did you ever hear of the Lord
   being baffled in His designs? Can it be possible that He has promised
   what He is not able to perform? The false reasoning which cries, "It is
   marvelous and, therefore, impossible," ignores altogether the fact that
   God is a marvelous Being and that if His promise is marvelous, it is
   like Himself! He is a great God and His power and wisdom are
   infinite--can anything surpass His ability? Would you have

   the infinite God confine His promises and gifts to common-place
   matters? Would it be seemly that the Lord, who is infinite in
   resources, should do nothing but what you can understand? O Sirs, you
   forget the Eternal and, therefore, doubt the promise--do so no more!

   And, further, the error which vitiates the argument of carnal reason
   takes another shape. There is here, as far as the Lord is thought of at
   all, an underestimate of God. The Lord puts this very plainly in our
   text--"If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in
   these days, should it also be marvelous in My eyes?" You are judging
   God as if He were like yourself! You have been calculating Divine
   possibilities by the scale of your own capacity! You have lowered God
   to the limit ofyour understanding! You have narrowed Him to your notion
   of what He can do and thus you degrade His greatness to your
   littleness--His wisdom to your folly, His power to your weakness! The
   deed of salvation is marvelous with you, but it is not strange with
   God, to whom it has been the great thought of eternity, towards which
   He causes all things to move.

   Everything in wonder depends upon the person affected by it--a trader
   goes to Africa. He takes with him a looking-glass and you see the
   chiefs gather around. And with wonder they gaze upon their own pleasing
   countenances in the mirror. It is marvelous to them! It becomes the
   talk of the tribe! But that mirror is not marvelous to the trader who
   brought it there. A musical box is set playing and a whole village of
   Negroes gather about it, unanimously believing that it must be at least
   a spirit, if not a god. To them it is a great marvel and they expect
   the white man to marvel, too, for they measure his capacity by their
   own. Yet their wonderful thing is, to an Englishman, a mere simplicity.
   Shall we set it down for certain that what is a wonder to us is a
   wonder to God? This would be absurd! The Lord can do exceeding
   abundantly above all that we ask or even think--there is no bounding
   His power, no searching of His understanding.

   "But my sin," you say, "who is to subdue it?" Not you, certainly! But
   the Lord of Hosts is able to overcome the power of sin! Do not measure
   God by yourself. "But my trouble, who can bring me through it?" Nobody
   can except the everlasting God who faints not, neither is He weary. The
   end of the creature is the starting place of the Creator! The limit of
   our power is soon reached, but the wings of the morning could not bear
   us beyond the Divine power. Whatever the Lord wills, is
   accomplished--you can be sure of that! When we begin to doubt whether
   God will love us to the end, is it not measuring God's patience by our
   impatience? Is there not a calculating of God's Immutability by our
   mutability? Because we change and grow weary, shall we fancy that the
   Lord also changes? Is there variableness and turning with the great
   Father of Lights? Has not the Lord declared, "I am God; I change not;
   therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed"?

   When we doubt God's wisdom by questioning whether He can find a way of
   keeping His Word and helping us, is it not because our little knowledge
   is exhausted and our plans broken down and, therefore, we conclude that
   God's plans will break down, too, and His invention will fail to
   contrive our deliverance? Beloved, it is not so! The Lord's way is in
   the whirlwind and the clouds are the dust of His feet! His footsteps
   are not seen, but He walks on the sea! He rides on the wings of the
   wind! He has sway everywhere and all things answer to His purpose and
   accomplish His designs! Leave off doubting and believe that the Lord's
   thoughts are as high above your thoughts as the heavens are above the
   earth! It is at bottom our pride which makes us judge the Lord to be
   like ourselves. If you degrade God to be like to man, it is because you
   idolize man and make him to be God!

   Who are you, you creature of an hour? Who are you, you creeping insect
   upon the bay leaf of existence? Who are you, poor mortal, that today is
   and tomorrow is shoveled back into mother earth, that you should begin
   to measure God? Go, measure Heaven with your span, weigh the Alps in
   scales and the Andes in balances! Go and hold the Atlantic in the
   hollow of your hand and when you have done these things know that you
   are not at the beginning of the measurement of the wisdom, the power,
   the truth and the goodness of the Lord! This, however, is the fault of
   carnal reasoning, that it judges the Lord of Hosts by the miserable
   standard of human weakness. Do you not see, dear Friends, that if we
   begin to say that God's promise is so marvelous that it cannot be
   performed, we do the infinite God high dishonor? You dishonor His power
   by imagining that a difficulty has arisen which He cannot meet. You
   suppose a power greater than God, since it baffles and defeats Him.
   What is this but to set up another god? It is a fault charged upon
   Israel of old as a very provoking crime, that they limited the Holy One
   of Israel. Oh that we may never be guilty of this offense!

   But you do worse than that, for I can suppose God to bear the dishonor
   of His power being limited, but it is far worse, practically, to
   insinuate that He boasts beyond His capabilities! I tremble as I say
   that unbelief accuses the Lord of

   vain boasting! When a man promises you what he knows he cannot perform,
   what opinion do you form of him? You say at once, "Why, the man is a
   boaster! He is big at talking, but small at performing." Will you
   insinuate that of the Lord God? Has it come to this, that you dare
   criticize your Maker? Do you dare insinuate that the Infinite Jehovah
   has promised to a sinner what He is incapable of giving him? God says,
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved"--and dare
   you say, "No, I could not be saved." Does God, then, speak beyond His
   ability? Does He promise what He is not able to perform?

   This is a form of blasphemy from which, I pray, we may be cleansed
   through the blood of our Lord Jesus! Or is it that you dream that God
   does not know His own strength? What? Is the Almighty ignorant? Is the
   only wise God unaware of His own power? Does He not know what He can
   do? I will not say that a man brags when he promises what he cannot
   perform, provided that he is unaware of his inability, for in such a
   case he blunders through ignorance or conceit. Do you dare charge
   either of these upon God? Far from me to have such an evil thought! I
   feel, this morning, that if all your sins were mine, yet since the Lord
   has promised pardon to him that believes, I could and would believe
   over the head of all that mass of sin! Yes, if all the iniquities of
   all the men that ever lived were laid upon my soul, yet upon that
   assurance, "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all
   sin," I would even venture my soul's hope of salvation and be sure of
   success!

   If the Lord has given a promise to His people that He will keep them to
   the end and that they shall not perish, then He will keep them to the
   end without fail. Why, Brothers and Sisters, if our road to Heaven were
   thick with devils, so that they stood like blades of wheat in a corn
   field, yet we should be able to force a lane right through the serried
   host, the Lord Jehovah being our Helper! If all the powers that are, or
   were, or can be, were to raise themselves up against the promise of
   God, in the name of God would we defy and defeat them! The Word of the
   Lord makes us more than conquerors. David said of old, "They compassed
   me about like bees; yes, they compassed me about, but in the name of
   the Lord I will destroy them." What can stand against the feeblest man
   that lives if he has God's promise to back him? The Lord can do just
   what He wills, whoever may oppose!

   Therefore let us fling away this folly of ours in supposing that
   because a work of Grace is marvelous or difficult in our eyes, it is,
   therefore, marvelous or difficult in the eyes of the Lord! That which
   is difficult with us is easy with Him! There is a radical mistake at
   the bottom of all this wicked, unbelieving reasoning--it leaves out the
   Lord altogether, or degrades Him below the Glory of His Godhead.

   III. We have reached the third division of our discourse and here let
   us practice a little RIGHT REASONING. I invite any here who are
   troubled with doubts about the promise of God to follow me in a few
   simple considerations. First, it is quite clear that for our salvation,
   marvels must be worked. It will be a wonder in all of us for any one of
   us to attain Heaven--it will need the Omnipotence of God to renew,
   preserve and perfect us. It is a rule with regard to miracles that God
   is very economical with them. In the Romish Church you have miracles in
   abundance, such as they are, but they are, for the most part, needless
   parades of power.

   When St. Denis, after his head was cut off, picked it up in his hands
   and walked a thousand miles with it, the dear man might as well have
   saved himself and his head the unsightly pilgrimage! When the blood of
   St. Januarius liquefies, or a Madonna winks, it may be interesting, but
   one does not see the necessity for either performance! The God of the
   Scriptures has no hand in such miracles--they are not of the same order
   as those which are worked by His right hand. Our Lord never uses a
   miracle where the same thing could be done by the ordinary processes of
   Nature. But whenever a miracle is requisite, a miracle is
   forthcoming--there is no stint of power though there is no wasteful
   display of it, either.

   I argue, then, that if it is necessary for you to be saved in order
   that God's promise may be kept, you shall be saved! And if, in order to
   this, marvels are needed, marvels will happen. The Lord reserves no
   strength when it is necessary to expend it for the fulfillment of His
   promises. If Omnipotence must make bare His arm, it shall be bared. The
   Lord led His people Israel to the Red Sea--perhaps if the Egyptians had
   not come up, it might have been possible to make rafts to ferry them
   across the water and we are sure it would have been done if it had been
   the best way of achieving the Lord's design. But when the Egyptians
   were so close behind that you could hear the neighing of their horses
   and almost feel the hot breath of their vengeful masters, then there
   remained no ordinary way for the people of God to escape, and lo, the
   mighty depths yawned before the tribes and a road was opened through
   the heart of the sea that the people of God might pass through!

   So it shall be with you. If to forgive your sin needs a miracle of
   Grace, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and the miracle of Grace is
   done! If to change your nature needs the miraculous power of the Holy
   Spirit--if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Spirit waits to
   work that great change. No, He has worked the change, and your faith is
   the evidence of it! If it shall need all the power of God to keep one
   of His children to the end, all that power shall be, for though God
   works not miracles till they are needed, He is not slow to do so when
   the case demands them. He will shake Heaven and earth to complete the
   salvation of His chosen! Therefore, if a deed of Grace is marvelous in
   your eyes, say to yourself, "Marvelous as it is, nothing short of it
   will do and, therefore, it shall be done."

   It was marvelous that God should become Man, but as there was no
   salvation for His apart from Immanuel, "God With Us," Jesus was born of
   a woman! It is marvelous that the Son of God should die, but as there
   was no salvation apart from His death, He died upon the Cross. If the
   Lord has given a promise, it must be carried out, cost what it may, for
   His name is, "God That Cannot Lie." If there is no way of bringing a
   saint to God except by the Holy Spirit's dwelling in him, which is a
   great wonder, then the Holy Spirit shall dwell in him, for the many
   sons must be brought unto Glory, and if marvels as many as the hairs on
   their heads are needed, so many marvels there shall be!

   A second little bit of reasoning may tend to comfort some of you,
   namely, that, after all, marvelous things are the rule with God. I say
   not miracles, although it is difficult to draw the line between the
   ordinary processes of God's working and the extraordinary ones, for the
   ordinary are extraordinary and His extraordinary deeds can hardly be
   more marvelous than His daily operations! All the works of God in
   creation are marvels. Take the telescope and search out the stars.
   Assuredly an "undevout astronomer is mad." When we perceive somewhat of
   the multitudes of worlds that God has made--their vast distances, the
   proportions of their bulk, the regularity of their orbits and the
   rapidity of their mo-tions--we discover that the great machinery of
   Nature is ordered by infinite skill! "It is the Lord's doing" and it is
   marvelous in our eyes!

   Surely that God who flings the stars about with both His hands can give
   us our daily bread! if He makes worlds to fly off like sparks from the
   anvil of His Omnipotence, He can make new creatures in Christ Jesus! If
   He keeps all those heavenly lamps shining so brightly for centuries, He
   can sustain Grace in the hearts of His people without difficulty! But
   now if you have done with the telescope, please put it away and let me
   lend you a microscope. Look at a butterfly from your garden. No, you
   need not trouble to examine the whole creature, a portion of a broken
   wing will suffice for your astonishment. Here is a spider's eye! Are
   you not surprised? This is the petal of a flower--what amazing beauty!
   Take but a single portion of a minute blood vessel and study it awhile.
   I hear you say, "I never could have believed it! This glass reveals to
   me such wonders that I am utterly astounded!"

   God is as great in the little as in the great--He is God everywhere! If
   a man carefully fashions a needle it appears to be exquisitely smooth
   and polished. Ah, it is only bright because your eyes are weak. Put it
   under the microscope. It is transformed into a rough bar of iron! No
   works of man will bear to be examined with a microscope--but you may
   search the Lord's work with the utmost care--the most common, plain,
   simple--the most ordinary creation of God is perfect! Since, then, all
   Nature teems with marvels, why put aside a promise of God because it
   involves a marvel? Is such conduct reasonable? However, if you have
   read through all the pages of Nature, which I am sure you have not, I
   would invite you to peruse the Book of Providence and see what marvels
   are there! I will give you no illustrations, because your own life will
   probably furnish you with many.

   If not, look at the history of any country--see how wondrously God has
   worked out His everlasting purposes of justice or of mercy in each
   land. The story of Providence contains a world of wonders! Why, then,
   should you doubt the promise of God because it involves a marvel? You
   should, rather, believe it for that very reason! I think there is good
   reasoning in all this. Follow me yet a little further, when I say that
   you must be prepared to abandon altogether the religion of our Lord
   Jesus Christ if you make it a rule to disbelieve the marvelous. The
   greatest marvel that I ever heard of is this--"Great is the mystery of
   godliness; God was manifest in the finite." How the Infinite could
   become one with the finite, so that the Baby at Bethlehem should be the
   Mighty God, I cannot explain and I think you cannot, either. Are you
   prepared to forego the Incarnation of Christ? For if you are not, you
   must not refuse to believe in any act of God because it is
   marvelous--for it cannot be more marvelous than God in human flesh!

   Think again--it is a cardinal doctrine of Christianity that the dead
   will rise again--that at the sounding of the trumpet of God they that
   are in their graves will rise to be judged in their bodies. Is not this
   a marvel? Stand in a ceme-

   tery and ask the question, "Can these dry bones live?" Do you believe
   in the Resurrection? Then you must never set aside any promise of God
   because it involves a marvel. You also believe, according to the Word
   of the Lord, that this world will one day be the home of God's Glory,
   for there shall be new heavens and a new earth in which dwells
   righteousness and the travail of the groaning creation shall come to an
   end--and this world shall be made anew a temple for the Lord. What an
   extraordinary thing this will be! Yet you believe it. Do not,
   therefore, ever doubt a single promise that God makes either to saint
   or sinner because it contains a marvel.

   Yet, again, I want you to follow me in another thought, namely, that
   greater marvels have been already worked than any which your salvation
   and mine will involve! Brothers and Sisters, if it had been whispered
   to any of us that God would take upon Himself human form and dwell
   among men, we should have looked much astonished! But if the Prophet
   had added, "In that form He will be despised and spit upon, and hung up
   to die a felon's death because He will bear the sin of man which will
   be laid upon His perfect Person, so that He will be made a curse for
   us," we should have said, "No, that cannot be!" Beloved, it has been!
   Atonement has been accomplished! Christ has borne the load of His
   people's sins up to the Cross and He has hurled that weight from His
   shoulders into His own sepulcher and left them there, buried forever!

   No wonder like this remains to be done--the greatest deed is finished!
   The renewal of our nature and the forgiveness of our sin are but little
   things compared with what Christ has already done! That He should now
   save His people seems, to me, not at all extraordinary--it would be
   more extraordinary that He should die and not save those for whom He
   died! Having paid the ransom price for His heritage, it is but a
   natural consequence that it should be set free. The greater wonder has
   already amazed angels, principalities and powers! Oh, think not, though
   I, for lack of time, have passed lightly over this miracle of
   miracles--the death of our blessed Lord--that there is not much more to
   be said of this great wonder! Why, in dying, our Lord destroyed death,
   and cried, "Where is your sting?"

   In rising again, He burst the bands of the sepulcher and opened a way
   to life to all Believers! In ascending the starry road, He led
   captivity captive and took possession of Heaven in the name of all His
   redeemed! And now, this day, He that was despised and rejected has all
   power given to Him in Heaven and in earth on our behalf! These great
   wonders have been finished and registered in Heaven! It only remains
   for us simply to receive the result of them by believing in Christ
   Jesus our Lord! To deliver us from the wrath to come is but now a
   comparatively small marvel. Compared with the griefs and death of the
   Son of God, nothing great remains! Think of that and let your faith be
   encouraged.

   I will not detain you except to remind you of the sweet thought that
   the more marvels there may be in our salvation the more glorifying it
   will be to God. Think of that. The more difficult it will be to save
   you, the more glory to God when He has achieved it. Your sin washed
   away will only demonstrate the power of the precious blood of Jesus!
   Your hard, stubborn will subdued will only prove the might of the love
   of Christ upon your soul! Your trials, temptations, weaknesses and
   infirmities will only glorify that almighty strength which is working
   in you to produce your ultimate perfection! Believe the promise all the
   more because it is so wonderful and, therefore, so honoring to the
   Lord. Do not let the marvel stagger you--let it encourage you! Say, "If
   this involved nothing wonderful, I could not think it came from God,
   but inasmuch as it is great and high, it is all the more worthy of
   God." Make the difficulties of the Bible a help to your faith and let
   the greatness of Grace render you the more hopeful of receiving it.

   Lastly, let me say, whenever you have any doubts and fears, turn your
   mind away from the thing that is promised to the faithful Promiser. We
   need altogether larger ideas of God! If we had them, we would find it
   easy to believe His Word. I remember when I was a boy, being taken to
   see the residence of one of our nobility, and the good friend who took
   me noticed my astonishment at the largeness of the house. I was amazed
   at it, having never seen anything like it, and so I said, "What a house
   for a man to live in!" "Bless you, boy," he said, "this is only the
   kitchen!" I was only looking at the servants' apartments and was
   astonished at the grandeur! The mansion itself was a far nobler affair!
   Oftentimes when you see what the Lord has done, you are ready to cry
   out, "How can all this be? His goodness, His mercy, is it as great as
   this?" Rest assured that you have only seen a little of His goodness,
   as if it were the kitchen of His great house--you have not seen the
   palace of the Most High where He reveals His full power and splendor!

   You know the story of the general, who, having led his men into a
   difficult position, went round at night to their tents. He said to
   himself, "If they are all in good heart we shall fight well tomorrow,
   for certainly this battle needs all our valor. I need to know the
   spirit of my men." Going round the camp, secretly, he heard in a tent
   some half-dozen soldiers

   conversing, and one of them above the rest was saying, "I think our
   general has made a great mistake this time. Look at the enemy--they
   have so many cavalry, so many infantry and guns," and so forth. He
   added up all the force of the enemy and another soldier chimed in,
   "What do you suppose our strength to be?" So the other calculated--so
   many footmen, so many horsemen, so many artillerymen, and so on. He was
   just going to total it up and make a very small concern of the whole,
   when the general drew aside the canvas of the tent and said, "And pray,
   my man, how many do you count me for?" Did all the general's skill,
   valor and renown count for nothing? He who had won so many
   fights--could he not win again?

   Just so, the Lord Jesus Christ, whenever we begin summing up our
   strength, or rather, our weakness, seems to appear and ask, "How many
   do you count Me for?" O Sirs! You have not counted the Lord Jesus at
   the millionth part of what He is! No, the firmest Believer here has not
   yet reached the trailing skirts of the garments of Divine Omnipotence!
   Let us enlarge our minds! Come, Blessed Spirit, reveal Christ in us and
   let us know more of God and trust Him better! And let nothing be
   unbelievingly marvelous in our eyes, since nothing can be too hard for
   the Lord! God bless all of you. Amen.

Jehovah Has Spoken--will You Not Hear?

   (No. 1748)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 4, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Hear you, and give ear; be not proud: for the Lord has spoken. Give
   glory to the Lord your God, before He causes darkness and before your
   feet stumble upon the dark mountains and, while you look for light, He
   turns it into the shadow of death and makes it gross darkness. But if
   you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your
   pride; and my eyes shall weep bitterly and run down with tears, because
   the Lord's flock is carried away captive." Jeremiah 13:15-17.

   IN this chapter Jeremiah had proclaimed the judgment of God against His
   sinful people under two very striking figures. Israel had been to God
   what a sash is to a man--the people had been bound closely about Him in
   His great love and favor. But on account of their sin, the Lord would
   put them away and they should be hidden by the Euphrates till their
   beauty was marred--until, in fact, like a rotten sash, their whole
   state had become decayed. "Thus says the Lord, After this manner will I
   mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem."

   Then He spoke to them by a second parable--"Every bottle shall be
   filled with wine"--and he showed how God's wrath would come upon the
   people to fill them with a judicial drunkenness, so that they should
   become drunk, and in their delirium should strive, one with another, to
   their mutual undoing. The Lord declared that thus He would "dash them
   one against another, even the fathers and the sons together." Thus,
   under two homely but exceedingly terrible figures, Jeremiah preached
   the Law of God to the people, that they might be humbled under a sense
   of sin.

   Had they but felt the force of this teaching, they would have begun to
   mourn for their sin and, under dread of wrath, they would have cried
   for mercy. Taking it for granted that this might be the case, though,
   alas, it did not so happen, the Lord gave to His Prophet an interval
   for proclaiming mercy. After those two great thunderclaps of judgment
   came a gracious shower of Grace. The Prophet, in what we may venture to
   call an evangelistic style, exhorts the people and addresses to them
   the characteristic Gospel precept--"Hear you, and give ear; for Jehovah
   has spoken."

   His words remind us of Isaiah's exhortation--"Incline your ears and
   come unto Me: hear, and your soul shall live." And again--"Hearken
   diligently unto Me, and eat you that which is good." Under the Gospel,
   faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God--and so Jeremiah
   does, as it were, in these verses preach the Gospel to the backsliding
   house of Judah. This is always God's design in threatening judgment--He
   desires to prepare the people for His Grace.

   I would take up the Prophet's strain, by the help of the Lord, praying
   to be a partaker of his earnest and tender Spirit. Oh, that today those
   who have never heard the voice of the Lord in the inward parts of their
   being may hear it and live! O Holy Spirit, work to that end!

   I. We will enter upon our subject at once, for there is much to speak
   of. The first head will be this--listen, O my Hearers, with deep
   attention, for THERE IS A REVELATION. Read the text--"Hear you, and
   give ear; be not proud: for the Lord has spoken." If the Lord had not
   spoken, the silence would have deepened and established your natural
   darkness. And if you had been inquiring after God, your heart would
   have cried, "Oh, that He would break this dreadful silence!" How sad
   would have been our state if the only way to find God depended upon our
   seeking Him! Shall man, by searching, find God? Who among us could
   reason ourselves into the knowledge of the Lord? Or imagine the
   thoughts of His mind?

   But here you have the great source of comfort and instruction--"Jehovah
   has spoken." Is not this a just call for the attention of all His
   creatures? The voice which we are bid to hear is a Divine voice! It is
   the voice of Him that made the heavens and the earth, whose creatures
   we are! Jehovah has spoken! If it were but the voice of Prophets apart
   from their Master, it might be but a slight sin to refuse what they
   say. But since Jehovah has spoken, shall men dare to be deaf to

   Him? Shall they turn away from Him that speaks from Heaven? He that
   spoke us into being has spoken to our being! He by whose Word the
   heavens stand and at whose word both Heaven and earth shall pass away,
   has spoken, and His voice is to the sons of men! It is God who says, "I
   have written to him the great things of My Law." The sacred Scriptures
   are the record of what God has spoken--receive them with the reverence
   which they deserve as coming from God, and as being, therefore, pure
   truth, fixed certainty, and unerring right.

   It is a Word most clear and plain, for Jehovah has spoken. He might
   have taught us only by the works of His hands, in which the invisible
   things of God, even His eternal power and Godhead are clearly seen.
   What is all creation but a hieroglyphic scroll in which the Lord has
   written out His Character as Creator and Provider? But since He knew
   that we were dim of sight and dull of comprehension, the Lord has gone
   beyond the symbols and hieroglyphs and used articulate speech such as a
   man uses with his fellows--Jehovah has spoken! A man may act before us
   his mind in symbols and we may fail to perceive his meaning. But when
   he speaks, we understand his communications by language, since such
   modes of expression are suitable to the human intellect.

   Speech is the fit manner of commerce between mind and mind and it is,
   therefore, most delightful that the all-glorious Jehovah should stoop
   from writing in starry letters across the sky--and from mirroring His
   form in tempests on the sea--and speak with us as a man speaks with his
   friends! Jehovah is no dumb Deity--He has spoken to us in sweet and
   chosen words by His Spirit. Oh, when there is a testimony so clear and
   plain that he who runs may read, well may the Prophet exhort us,
   saying, "Hear you, and give ear; for Jehovah has spoken." Let it not be
   said of us, as of the sinners long ago, "I spoke unto you, rising up
   early and speaking, but you heard not; and I called you, but you
   answered not."

   Moreover, I gather from the expression in the text that the Revelation
   made to us by the Lord is an unchangeable and abiding word. It is not
   today that Jehovah is speaking, but Jehovah has spoken--His voice by
   the Prophets and Apostles is now silent, for He has revealed all His
   Truth which is necessary for salvation. The Lord might fitly say to us
   this day, "What I have written I have written." He changes not His
   Word, and though Heaven and earth pass away, His Word abides. We are
   not living in a period of gradual Revelation, as some imagine--Jehovah
   has spoken and He opens not His mouth a second time. He has closed the
   canon of Scripture with a curse upon him that shall add to or take from
   the Words of the Book of this prophecy.

   Jehovah has spoken! You have not to go on making discoveries of new
   Truth outside of Scripture. Your duty lies in diligently receiving the
   completed testimony of the Lord God, for the Word of the Lord is
   perfect, converting the soul. He has fully told you your relation to
   your God and the way by which you may be reconciled to Him and be at
   peace. "Add not unto His words, lest He reprove you, and you be found a
   liar." Jehovah has spoken! And it is written in His Law, "You shall not
   add unto the word which I command you." Beloved, this Revelation is
   pre-eminently a condescending and cheering word. The Lord might have
   trodden us down to destruction without a word when we sinned against
   Him! He might have left us to that natural testimony which is borne
   upon the face of creation and which is also reflected in the conscience
   of all men--and when we rejected those testimonies He might have
   allowed us to travel on in tenfold night.

   But instead thereof, in the plenitude of His Grace, Jehovah has
   spoken--and be it always remembered that while of old He spoke in
   sundry times and different manners by the Prophets, He has in these
   last times spoken unto us by His Son. The very fact that the great God
   speaks to us by His Son indicates that mercy, tenderness, love and hope
   are the burden of His utterance! His Son Jesus is full of Grace and
   Truth and, therefore, that which He now speaks to us is not only Truth,
   but Grace. It is truthful Grace and gracious Truth which God speaks to
   us by Jesus Christ. Oh, the richness of that message--the height and
   depth of love which it contains! Who can refuse to listen to the
   heavenly music of mercy?

   The Lord's voice on the first day of creation said, "Let there be
   light," and there was light. And now this second voice, this voice to
   the spiritual world, gives us light, life, love and every necessary,
   conceivable, desirable gift! The words of God, as they are recorded in
   this Book, have a unfathomable fullness about them--they are spirit and
   life! In Christ, by whom He speaks, there is hid all the treasures of
   wisdom and knowledge! The Prophet asked no more than was perfectly
   reasonable when he said, "Hear, and give ear; for Jehovah has spoken."
   When the kings who dwell at the utmost ends of the earth hear that
   Jehovah has spoken, they would do well to quit their thrones and make a
   journey, like the Queen of Sheba, to hear of the Divine wisdom!

   If all workmen should throw down their tools and say, "We will hear
   what God the Lord shall speak," and if merchants should close their
   shops and counting-houses for a while and come together without delay
   crying, "Everything must stop till we have heard what the Lord has
   spoken," would it be any more than right reason would suggest to
   thoughtful and right-minded men? O Sirs, if God has spoken, every ear
   should surrender itself to attention, for surely never could the sense
   of hearing be more honorably and profitably employed! Jehovah has
   spoken and His Word is true--"The grass withers and the flower thereof
   falls away: but the Word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the
   Word which by the Gospel is preached unto you." There is a way of
   salvation arranged and determined by the Lord! It is not to be guessed
   at, but we are to learn it from Infallible Wisdom--Jehovah has spoken!

   There is an atonement prepared, provided, designated and set forth. We
   have not to search for it, or add to it-- Jehovah has spoken! There is
   no point of necessity, nor even of real interest to the heart of man
   but what Jehovah has spoken to it--and if there is any Truth of God
   upon which He has not spoken, it is because it is to His Glory to
   conceal the thing--and for our profit that we do not pry into it! Upon
   all that is essential to our full preparation for our eternal
   destination, Jehovah has spoken! He has said it and here it is
   recorded--in the volume of the Book it is written--and blessed are they
   that read and keep the Words of the Book of this prophecy!

   II. Secondly--and I have already anticipated it--since there is a
   Revelation, IT SHOULD BE SUITABLY RECEIVED. If Jehovah has spoken, then
   all attention should be given. Yes, double attention! Incline your
   ears; listen diligently; surrender your soul to the teaching of the
   Lord God and be not satisfied till you have heard His teaching--have
   heard it with your whole being and have felt the force of its every
   truth! "Hear you," because the Word of God comes with power. "Give
   ear," because you willingly receive it. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, I
   fear that we give far more attention to the distracting voices of the
   world than to the soul-satisfying voice of the God of All Grace!

   How eager men are after the treasure which melts before their eyes--how
   they will drink in every syllable by which they may learn how to be
   rich! But when God speaks, who brings in both His hands eternal and
   abiding riches, men are deaf as the adder, careless as the beasts of
   the field! He says, "I have called and you refused; I have stretched
   out My hand and no man regarded." Is this right or wise? Surely, if
   Jehovah speaks, we are bound by all that is just, good and grateful to
   wait in reverent silence till we know His mind! Let a general hush go
   through the universe and let all ears, with solemn reverence, await the
   sound of the voice of the Lord!

   Then it is added, as if by way of directing us how suitably to hear
   this Revelation--"Give glory to Jehovah your God." There ought to be in
   hearing and reading the Revelation of God a constant giving of glory to
   the Lord. His speaking is a manifestation of His Glory as when the sun
   rises his light is spread abroad. You and I are to reflect that light
   even as the valleys rejoice in his brightness of the noontide. Let us
   stand, as it were, this morning, to be shone upon by the Lord--ready,
   each one of us--to reflect that light which comes from on high! Give
   glory to God at once by worthily hearing His Gospel. How is that to be
   done? Stand still and hear the Word of the Lord! Glorify the Lord by
   accepting whatever He says to you as being infallibly true! Believe in
   the Lord your God, so shall you be established; believe His Prophets,
   so shall you prosper. Know what the Lord has said and let it stand to
   you as sure and steadfast truth. Seek for no further reasons to sustain
   your faith, but let, "Thus says the Lord" stand to you in the place of
   all arguments.

   To me, a sentence of Scripture is the essence of logic, the proof
   positive, the Word of God which may not be questioned. Eyes and ears
   may be doubted, but not the written Word, inspired of the Holy Spirit!
   Blessed are those who sit at Jesus' feet and receive His Words. It is
   our wisdom to know nothing of ourselves, but to be taught of the Holy
   Spirit--to think nothing of ourselves, but to have the mind of God--and
   think after Him whose thoughts are as high above our thoughts as the
   heavens are above the earth! We give glory to God in reference to
   Revelation when we receive it, every jot and tittle of it, and bow our
   minds before it.

   In these days this virtue is lightly esteemed, for the Savior's Words
   are still true--"He that loves Me not keeps not My sayings." In all its
   length and breadth, whatever the Lord says, we believe, and we desire
   to know neither less nor more than He has spoken. We must receive the
   Word of God, however, in a hearty and honest manner so as to act upon
   it. We must therefore repent of the sin which the Lord condemns and
   turn from the way which He abhors. We must loathe the vice which He
   forbids and seek after the virtue which He commands. We give glory to
   God when we penitently confess that we have broken His holy Law and
   grieve because we have done so. Did not Joshua bid Achan give glory to
   God by confession of his sin? And so must we.

   By confession we glorify God's Justice, Omniscience and Truth--and yet
   further we glorify His mercy when, confessing sin, we ask for pardon
   through Jesus Christ our Lord. Thus should every human being receive
   the Revelation of God bringing forth fruits necessary for repentance.
   Your light has shone upon me, O my God, and therefore I see my
   darkness! O remove it! You have lit a candle, and by its light I
   discover my spots and stains. I acknowledge them in Your sight--
   "Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done this evil in Your
   sight: that You might be justified when You speak and be clear when You
   judge." Thus humbling ourselves on account of sin, we receive the Word
   of God aright, and give God glory.

   But we must go further than repentance and the acceptance of the Truth
   of God as Truth. We must further reverence the gracious voice of God
   when He bids us believe on Christ and live. He has couched that message
   of love in so blessed a form that he who does not accept it must be
   wantonly malicious against God and against his own soul. For the Lord
   does not demand that by penances, acts of mortification and feelings of
   misery and despair we are to purge ourselves from sin--He has
   graciously declared--"He that believes on Him is not condemned."
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." If Jehovah
   has spoken in such a manner; if the sum and substance of what He has
   spoken is that, "God has set forth His Son Jesus Christ to be a
   propitiation through faith in His blood," then we must and will listen
   to Him! He says, "Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord:
   though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though
   they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool."

   If this is the heavenly Word of God, how can we refuse to hear it with
   our whole hearts? Give glory to the Lord by answering, "Lord, I
   joyfully obey Your call! I am glad of a Savior, glad of the atoning
   blood, glad to cast myself at those dear feet that were nailed to the
   Cross for me--and to find, in the Lord Jesus my salvation and my all."
   This is the way in which we ought to receive this Revelation and we
   ought to go on to complete obedience. We should humbly inquire, "Lord,
   what further would You have me know; what further would You have me do?
   Is there still left in me a part of my nature unsubdued? I would humble
   myself under Your mighty hand. Is there in me anything unrenewed, of
   pride revolting, or of the flesh rebelling? Then conquer it in me, for
   I desire Your Word to be my rule, my law, my guide. O that my ways were
   directed to keep Your statutes! I wish in all things to be obedient to
   Your gracious will."

   There is no part of God's Word at which the human mind should kick. If
   our hearts were in a right state we would fling open all the doors of
   our mind and say, "Come in, O sacred Truth, come in! You are welcome to
   my heart of hearts since you come from my God." If Jehovah speaks,
   ought we not, instead of quibbling, questioning, disputing and raising
   difficulties, just say, "Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears"? When the
   Lord says to us, "Seek you My face," our heart should at once reply,"
   Your face, Lord, will I seek."

   I think that point is clear. There is a Revelation and that Revelation
   ought to be suitably received.

   III. But thirdly, PRIDE IN THE HUMAN HEART PREVENTS SUCH A RECEPTION.
   The text runs, "Hear you, and give ear; be not proud: for the Lord has
   spoken." And further on the Prophet says, "If you will not hear it, my
   soul shall weep in secret places for your pride." The Prophet, here,
   puts his finger upon the blot. Why is it, my dear Hearers, that there
   are any among you this day who have heard God's Word, year after year,
   and yet have not received it? The secret reason is your pride! Perhaps
   pride prompts you indignantly to deny the accusation. In some, it is
   the pride of intellect. They do not wish to be treated like
   children--they are not content to receive the Kingdom of God as a
   little child-- and so, when Jesus says, "Except you are converted and
   become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of
   Heaven," they reply that they intend to think out a Gospel for
   themselves.

   To lay the inventiveness of thought on one side and simply to believe
   what Jesus teaches is not to their mind--they will not humble
   themselves to a fact so little self-exalting. Well, Sirs, if you shut
   the door of the Kingdom against yourselves because you are too wise to
   enter--be this known to you--that the poor have the Gospel preached to
   them and they receive it! God has hid these things from the wise and
   prudent and has revealed them unto babes. God has chosen things that
   are despised and things that are not, to bring to nothing the things
   that are--that no flesh may glory in His Presence! If your wisdom is
   greater than the wisdom of God, it were better for you to be foolish!
   If you will destroy yourself to indulge your own conceit, well, so it
   must be, but the day shall come in which your regret shall know neither
   measure nor end! Oh, let none of us be so proud as to lift up ourselves
   in opposition to that which Jehovah has spoken!

   In some others it is the pride of self-esteem. "No," they say, "this
   Gospel which we have heard so often is too simple! We are capable of
   something more elaborate. It humbles us; it represents us as fallen; as
   depraved. It says that we can do

   nothing; it lays us in the very dust; it makes nothing of us--it
   excludes all hope of boasting and glorying--we cannot stoop so low!
   Salvation by Divine Grace, is it? Then Free Grace, Sovereign Grace is
   not to our mind! We care not to be saved like paupers! We care not to
   be freely forgiven as those who have nothing to pay. That no
   composition will be accepted, not even a farthing in the pound of our
   own merit--it is a doctrine too lowering to our dignity!" They set the
   Gospel on one side because it sets them on one side. They are too great
   to be saved!

   O Sirs, if you must be proud, at least do not throw away your souls to
   indulge that propensity! Surely, something less costly may suffice for
   a sacrifice to the demon of vainglory! It is a dreadful thing that men
   should think it better to go to Hell in a dignified way than to go to
   Heaven by the narrow road of a child-like faith in the Redeemer! Those
   who will not stoop even to receive Christ, Himself, and the blessings
   of eternal life, deserve to perish! God save us from such folly! It may
   well make us weep to think that any man should be so far gone astray
   from right reason as to throw away eternal bliss in order to walk with
   haughty steps through this poor life.

   Some have a pride of self-righteousness. They are good. They have kept
   the Commandments from their youth up. They have attended to religion;
   they have seen to it that all rites and ceremonies have been duly
   performed upon them and they thank God that they are not as other men
   are! This righteousness of theirs is a garment respectable enough for
   them to wear and, therefore, they reject the righteousness of God! O
   you proud fool! I would to God you knew that you are naked, poor and
   miserable! I would to God you understood that your fig-leaf
   righteousness will never cover your nakedness in the sight of God, for
   if you knew this, you would seek after the perfect righteousness of
   Christ and be robed and adorned with it! While sin ruins many in the
   outside world, I fear self-righteousness ruins more among those who
   attend places of worship. They say, "we see," and, therefore, their
   eyes are not opened. They cry, "we are clean," and, therefore, they are
   not washed from their iniquity. Oh that they would cease from this
   vanity and give glory to the Lord their God instead of taking glory
   themselves! How can they believe while they seek honor, one from
   another?

   In some, too, it is the pride of self-love. They cannot deny their
   lusts. To cut off right-hand sins and pluck out right-eye iniquities
   cannot be endured by them. Their hearts are set upon a certain evil
   pleasure and they cannot give it up. The Gospel of Jesus Christ demands
   of those who receive it that they shall be saved not in their sins, but
   from their sins! It comes to give us renewal as well as rest, purity as
   well as pardon, sanctity as well as safety. But there are many who,
   because of their foolish self-indulgence, cannot deny themselves any
   seeming joy, but must fill themselves with the poisoned sweets which
   delight the flesh. O Friend, I wish that this pride were taken from you
   and that it seemed wisdom to you to deny yourself life, itself, for the
   present, rather than miss the hope of eternal life!

   The pride of self-will also works its share of ruin among men. "Who is
   the Lord, that I should obey His voice?" is the cry of many beside
   Pharaoh! The unrenewed heart virtually says--"I shall not mind these
   commands. Why should I be tied hand and foot and ruled, and governed? I
   intend to be a free thinker and a free liver--I will not submit
   myself." Just so, and you are free to lose all hope of Heaven, my
   Friend! Free to destroy yourself. If this is your choice, then who is
   to hinder you in it? I know that I cannot. Oh, that the Lord will lead
   you to a better mind. Would God that the Lord would change your will
   and renew your heart! But if you are so proud that you reject the
   testimony of God against yourself, then who is to blame when you fall
   into eternal destruction? Who is to blame but yourself?

   And so I pass from mournfully considering this great evil which
   prevents the Revelation of God from being properly received.

   IV. Fourthly, THERE COMES AN EARNEST WARNING. The Prophet has put
   it--"Give glory to the Lord your God, before He cause darkness, and
   before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains." I desire to explain
   this with deep humiliation of spirit on my own part--and with much
   trembling lest anyone of you should ever, by experience, know the truth
   of these words. Listen, my Friend, you who have rejected God and His
   Christ till now! You are already out of the way, among the dark
   mountains! There is a King's highway of faith and you have refused it.
   You have turned aside to the right hand or to the left, according to
   your own imagination. Being out of the way of safety, you are in the
   path of danger even now.

   Though the sunlight shines about you and the flowers spring up
   profusely under your feet, yet you are in danger, for there is no
   safety off the King's road. If you will walk according to His bidding,
   you shall be quiet from fear of danger, for no lion shall be there,
   but, inasmuch as you are now your own keeper and your own law and you
   follow in your own ways, you are in great peril. The unbeliever is
   condemned already, because he has not believed on the Son of God.
   Escape,

   I pray you, while you may, and enter upon that one road which is strait
   and narrow, but leads to eternal life --the way of faith in Jesus! If
   you will still pursue your headlong career and choose a path for
   yourself, I pray you remember that darkness is hovering around you. The
   day is far spent! Around your soul there are already hanging mists and
   glooms-- and these will thicken into the night-damps of bewilderment!

   Thinking, but not believing, you will soon think yourself into a horror
   of great darkness. Refusing to hear what Jehovah has spoken, you will
   follow other voices which shall allure you into an Egyptian night of
   confusion. You will go on meditating and carefully thinking, or
   criticizing and trifling till you are enveloped in a cloud of doubts,
   wrapped as in a dense smoke of speculation and well near smothered in
   exhalations of unbelief! You shall not know what to do, nor what to
   think, nor what to say, nor what to do with yourself, for you will have
   renounced your Guide and quenched your torch. At the same time, it may
   be there will come upon you a darkness of distress--you will be sick
   and sorry; you will be faint and weary; you will be tried and
   troubled--and your soul will see no help or deliverance.

   To which of the saints will you turn? Upon whom will you call in the
   day of your calamity? And who will help you? Then your thoughts will
   dissolve into vanity and your spirit shall melt into dismay. "Thus says
   the Lord, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your
   friends." You shall grope after comfort as blind men grope for the
   wall! And because you have rejected the Lord and His Truth, He, also,
   will reject you and leave you to your own devices. Meanwhile, there
   shall cloud over you a darkness bred of your own sin and willfulness.
   You shall lose the brightness of your intellect. The sharp clearness of
   your thought shall depart from you. Professing yourself to be wise, you
   shall become a fool.

   You shall no longer be able to boast of yourself because of the
   clearness of your judgment, but you shall find your conceptions thrown
   into confusion. You shall ask of others, but they shall know no more
   than yourself, or if they know, you shall not understand what they tell
   you! You shall be in an all-surrounding, penetrating blackness. Hence
   comes the solemnity of this warning, "Give glory to the Lord your God,
   before He cause darkness." While as yet you have not absolutely turned
   away from the Truth of God and rejected God's Word, accept it in your
   heart by a living faith and give Him glory, lest, by continuing a
   procrastinator and a halter between two opinions, you are gradually
   made to slide, little by little, away from the brightness of the Truth
   till you are shut up in a sevenfold night out of which there shall be
   no escape. For after that darkness there comes a stumbling, as says the
   text, "before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains."

   He who is going to think out his own way apart from Revelation will
   meet with mysteries which he cannot surmount. There are mysteries in
   Revelation, but these rise before us like hills of light--while to
   those who trifle with the Word of the Lord there shall arise mountains
   of gloom. I care not what philosophy you take, whether it is old or
   new, openly profane or faintly sprinkled with Christianity, you will
   never get rid of mystery--it is essential to the limited capacity of
   the human mind confronted by boundless Truths of God. There must be
   difficulties in every man's way, even if it is a way of his own
   devising. But to the man who will not accept the Light of God, these
   difficulties must necessarily be dark mountains with sheer abysses,
   pathless crags and impenetrable ravines. He has refused the path which
   wisdom has cast up and he is justly doomed to stumble where there is no
   way. Beware of encountering mysteries without guidance and faith, for
   you will stumble either into folly or superstition and only rise to
   stumble again. Those who stumble at Christ's Cross are likely to
   stumble into Hell.

   There are also dark mountains of another kind which will block the way
   of the wanderer--mountains of dismay, of remorse, of despair. Woe to
   that man who finds himself traveling at midnight without a guide,
   without a road--and in the midst of tremendous mountains impassable to
   human feet! Ah, when a man comes into the land of doubt, which is a
   land of darkness, as darkness itself, and of the shadow of death,
   without any order, and where the light is as darkness-- how terrible
   his case! I say no more--thank God, my Hearers, you are not there yet!
   Therefore listen to Jehovah's voice and give glory to God before He
   sends a thick darkness over your soul--even darkness that may be full
   and your feet stumble, never to rise again.

   After that stumbling there will come bitter disappointment. The man
   finding that he cannot discover his way, sits down awhile and says to
   himself, "I will wait till the moon rises, or the day dawns. Many
   before me have come to a pause--no doubt light will come." He looks and
   looks and looks again, but all in vain, for thus says the Prophet,
   "While you look for light, He turns it into the shadow of death." Dread
   word--death! Terrible shade which death casts

   over men's minds! That shadow is coming on the man as years advance and
   he has no light with which to dispel it. The physician cannot remove
   the death shadow--the disease is incurable. The sinner's face is pale
   with anguish and his heart melts like wax in the midst of his insides,
   for the shadow now upon him chills him to the marrow of his bones!

   What will he do, now that the arrow is rankling in his heart? What will
   he do, now that eternal night is descending? He cowers down and waits,
   but nothing comes except the thickening of the death shadows--and the
   weeping of those whom he must leave. He is anticipating the weeping and
   wailing and gnashing of teeth which are to be his endless portion! And
   now a paralyzing despair seizes him, for God makes the darkness to be,
   "gross darkness," black, palpable, as it were a solid thing. The man is
   shut up and he cannot come forth. The darkness is within the chambers
   of his soul! It is in his brain! It is in his heart--he is drowning in
   a Black Sea. This is a just ending this for one who hated the Light of
   God!

   Oh, I pray you, before any of you pass into that state, give glory to
   God and receive His Word! I beseech you believe before your doubt has
   utterly destroyed you! Accept the witness of God before you become
   hardened in skepticism. I do not know what may ever happen to me in
   this life--perhaps it shall come to pass that I may be visited with
   severe physical infirmities and possibly these may cause me mental
   depression and anguish. But this one thing I know, I have committed my
   mind, my heart, my whole intellectual nature to His keeping who has
   promised to preserve His own! I desire to believe nothing but what He
   tells me; to do nothing but what He bids me and to yield myself to no
   influence but that which He ordains for my direction! And, therefore,
   it seems to me that having done this for many a day, I can with
   un-staggering confidence say, at the last, "Father, into Your hands I
   commit my spirit."

   I think I may confidently hope to cast anchor forever in that haven
   which is no new refuge to me, but the daily travel map of my soul. Can
   a man be safer as to his soul's condition than when he has ceased from
   depending upon himself and has taken the great Lord to be the Shepherd
   at whose heels he follows? What shield can so well protect you as the
   Divine faithfulness? Under what rock can you find such shelter as under
   the truthfulness of God? I am at a pass with all new ideas in
   religion--I will have none of them! If this grand old Book fails me, I
   am content to fail! If the Lord shall desert me, I resign myself to be
   deserted! If God lies, then there is an end of all things and we all,
   alike, flounder in chaos!

   But we tolerate no such fears. Believing in God, I am not fearful of
   the future. Neither dark mountains nor dark death can cause the
   Believer to stumble, for he cries, "I know whom I have believed, and I
   am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto
   Him against that day." But oh, if God is true, what will become of you
   who will not hear Him? If the Bible is true, what must be your portion,
   who pretend to be wiser than the Holy Spirit? You must assuredly wander
   into that endless captivity from which there can be no redemption!

   V. So now I have to close, but not till I have delivered my burdened
   heart once more. If the people would not submit

   to God, the Prophet determined what he would do. THERE REMAINS FOR THE
   FRIENDS OF THE IMPENITENT

   BUT ONE RESORT. The loving Prophet cries, "If you will not hear it, my
   soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and my eyes shall weep
   bitterly, and run down with tears, because the Lord's flock is carried
   away captive." He cannot do anything more! He has no other message to
   deliver. He cannot hope that God will overlook their insults and invent
   another way of saving them! He has told them the Truth and if they
   refuse it, he will lay no flattering unction to their souls. He will
   deliver the Word of the Lord once more and if they, again, refuse, he
   will go home to mourn for them even as Samuel mourned for Saul when the
   Lord had put him away.

   Observe that he does not say in the first clause, "my eyes shall weep,"
   but, "my soul shall weep." Bitter tears make red the eyes, but what
   must be the brine of those tears which are wept by the soul itself--a
   soul in anguish over willful men who persist in destroying themselves!
   Those soul-sorrows showed themselves in floods of tears which drenched
   the Prophet's cheeks, for he loved the people and could not bear to
   look upon the ruin which was coming upon them. Like our Lord in later
   times, the Prophet beheld the city and wept over it--he could do no
   less, he could do no more. Alas, his sorrow would be unavailing; his
   grief was hopeless! He could not help those who would not be helped by
   God!

   If they refused to hear, he does not speak to them of a "larger hope"
   yet to be revealed. He speaks not of "purgatory" and another season of
   probation, or a future Revelation which would override the present Word
   of God. Ah no, he loved men too well to invent for them fools'
   paradises! He dared not imitate the old serpent in the garden by
   insinuating, "You shall not surely die." I fear that the garments of
   many modern divines are steeped in the blood of souls whom they are
   deluding with their, "larger hope," which is but a larger snare of
   Satan! Jeremiah had a brave, though tender heart--he did not bow to men
   and sing pretty ditties to them, as preachers, nowadays, are prone to
   do.

   He told them they would stumble in the darkness and that nothing
   remained for him but to sigh out his soul over their ruin. Let us each
   one learn to sympathize with this holy man--

   "Arise, my tender thoughts, arise,

   Though torrents melt my streaming eyes!

   And you, my heart, with anguish feel

   Those evils which you cannot heal!

   See human nature sunk in shame--

   See scandals poured on Jesus 'name!

   The Father wounded through the Son;

   The world abused and souls undone!

   See the short course of vain delight

   Closing in everlasting night

   In flames that no abatement know,

   Though briny tears forever flow." Observe that the Prophet did not
   expect to obtain sympathy in this sorrow of his. He says, "My soul
   shall weep in secret places for your pride." He would get quite alone,
   hide himself away and become a recluse. Alas, that so few even now care
   for the souls of men! Many ignore their danger, forgetting or else
   denying it. And few mourn over the ungodly and seek--

   "With cries, entreaties, tears to save, To snatch them from the fiery
   wave." Hearts are hardened, pride is flattered, falsehoods are cried
   up! And what can the faithful do but seek their God and weep in secret
   places? Solitude and weeping are a poor solace, and yet there is no
   other.

   This also puts a pungent salt into the tears of the godly, that the
   weeping can do no good, since the people refuse the one and only
   Remedy. Jehovah has spoken and if they will not hear Him, they must die
   in their sins! O Sirs, if you will not have Christ--if all the saints
   in the world prayed for you, yes, all the saints that ever lived, or
   ever shall live--if they all prayed for you and if in one great river,
   the tears of the whole Church flowed on forever, they could not help
   you nor bring you hope of salvation! You must have Christ or die! You
   must believe in the Lamb of God or perish forever! Does it stand so
   according to the Scriptures? Then none can change it! Do not dash
   yourselves against this rock! Fall not upon this stone!

   What a burden it is that so many should cause us this unnecessary
   sorrow, for if men turned to God, our joy would exceed all bounds! O my
   Hearers, why will you distress me? Turn, turn--why will you die? What
   excuse can you urge for your folly in choosing to perish? What motive
   can be strong enough to make you leap into the fire when Christ is
   waiting to be gracious to you? We have labor enough in preparing and
   delivering our weighty messages without the added grief of seeing you
   reject them to your own destruction! Our throes of heart are sometimes
   grievous enough before we preach a sermon lest we should not preach
   aright--why must we be driven to this further misery?

   We exhaust ourselves while pleading with you! Why should we have to sit
   down in sorrow because you will not believe our report? O blessed
   Spirit of God, touch all hearts this day, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

A Luther Sermon at the Tabernacle

   (No. 1749)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 11, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But the just shall live by his faith." Habakkuk 2:4.

   This text is three times employed by the Apostle Paul as an argument.
   Read Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11 and Hebrews 10:38--in each of these
   cases it runs, "The just shall live by faith." This is the old original
   text to which the Apostle referred when he said, "As it is written, The
   just shall live by faith." We are not wrong in making the Inspiration
   of the Old Testament to be as important as that of the New, for the
   truth of the Gospel must stand or fall with that of the Prophets of the
   old dispensation. The Bible is one and indivisible--you cannot question
   the Old Testament and retain the New. Habakkuk must be inspired, or
   Paul writes nonsense.

   Yesterday, 400 years ago, [November 10, 1483] there came into this
   wicked world the son of a miner, or refiner of metals, who was to do no
   little towards undermining the Papacy and refining the Church. The name
   of that baby was Martin Luther--a hero and a saint. Blessed was that
   day above all the days of the century, which it honored, for it
   bestowed a blessing on all succeeding ages through "the monk that shook
   the world." His brave spirit overturned the tyranny of error which had
   so long held nations in bondage. All human history since then has been
   more or less affected by the birth of that marvelous boy! He was not an
   absolutely perfect man--we neither endorse all that he said nor admire
   all that he did--but he was a man upon whose like men's eyes shall
   seldom rest!

   He was a mighty judge in Israel, a kingly servant of the Lord. We ought
   to more often pray to God to send us men-- men of God, men of power. We
   should pray that, according to the Lord's infinite goodness, His
   ascension gifts may be continued and multiplied for the perfecting of
   His Church, for when He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive
   and received gifts for men. And "He gave some, Apostles; and some,
   Prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers." He
   continues to bestow these choice gifts according to the Church's needs
   and He would scatter them more plentifully, perhaps, if our prayers
   more earnestly ascended to the Lord of the Harvest to thrust forth
   laborers into His harvest. Even as we believe in the crucified Savior
   for our personal salvation, we ought to believe in the ascended Savior
   for the perpetual enriching of the Church with confessors and
   evangelists who shall declare the Truth of God.

   I wish to take my little share in commemorating Luther's birthday and I
   think I can do no better than use the key of the Truth of God by which
   Luther unlocked the dungeons of the human mind and set bondage hearts
   at liberty. That golden key lies in the Truth briefly contained in the
   text before us--"The just shall live by his faith." Are you not a
   little surprised to find such a clear Gospel passage in Habakkuk? To
   discover in that ancient Prophet an explicit statement which Paul can
   use as a ready argument against the opponents of Justification by
   Faith? It shows that the cardinal doctrine of the Gospel is no
   new-fangled notion! Assuredly it is not a novel dogma invented by
   Luther, nor even a Truth of God which was first taught by Paul!

   This fact, Justification by Faith, has been established in all ages
   and, therefore, we find it here, among the ancient things, a lamp to
   cheer the darkness which hung over Israel before the coming of the
   Lord! This also proves that there has been no change as to the Gospel.
   The Gospel of Habakkuk is the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ! A
   clearer light was cast upon this Truth of God by the giving of the Holy
   Spirit, but the way of salvation has, in all ages, been one and the
   same! No man has ever been saved by his good works. The way by which
   the just have lived has always been the way of faith. There has not
   been the slightest advance upon this Truth--it is established and
   settled--always the same, like the God who uttered it.

   At all times and everywhere, the Gospel is and must forever be the
   same. "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever." We
   read of "the Gospel" as of one--never of two or three gospels--as of
   many. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but Christ's Word shall never
   pass away. It is also noteworthy that this Truth of God should be so
   old

   and should continue so unchanged, but that it should possess such
   vitality. This one sentence, "The just shall live by his faith,"
   produced the Reformation! Out of this one line, as from the opening of
   one of the Apocalyptic seals, came forth all that sounding of Gospel
   trumpets and all that singing of Gospel songs which made a sound like
   the noise of many waters in the world. This one seed--forgotten and
   hidden away in the dark medieval times--was brought forth, dropped into
   the human heart, made to grow by the Spirit of God and, in the end, to
   produce great results.

   This handful of corn on the top of the mountains so multiplied that the
   fruit thereof did shake like Lebanon and they of the city flourished
   like grass of the earth! The least bit of the Truth of God, thrown
   anywhere, will live! Certain plants are so full of vitality that if you
   only take a fragment of a leaf and place it on the soil, the leaf will
   take root and grow. It is utterly impossible that such vegetation
   should become extinct, And so it is with the Truth of God--it is living
   and incorruptible--and, therefore, there is no destroying it! As long
   as one Bible remains, the religion of Free Grace will live! No, if they
   could burn all printed Scriptures, as long as there remained a child
   who remembered a single text of the Word, the Truth would rise again!

   Even in the ashes of truth the fire is still living, and when the
   breath of the Lord blows upon it, the flame will burst forth
   gloriously. Because of this, let us be comforted in this day of
   blasphemy and of rebuke--comforted because though "the grass withers
   and the flower thereof falls away: but the Word of the Lord endures
   forever." And this is the Word by which the Gospel is preached to you.
   Let us now examine this text which was the means of enlightening the
   heart of Luther, as I shall explain to you, by-and-by.

   I. I shall, at the outset, make a brief observation upon it--A MAN WHO
   HAS FAITH IN GOD IS JUST. "The just shall live by his faith." The man
   who possesses faith in God is a just man--his faith is his life as a
   just man. He is "just" in the Gospel sense, namely, that having the
   faith which God prescribes as the way of salvation, he is, by his
   faith, justified in the sight of God. In the Old Testament (Gen. 15:6)
   we are told, concerning Abraham, that, "he believed in the Lord; and He
   counted it to him for righteousness." This is the universal plan of
   justification. Faith lays hold upon the righteousness of God by
   accepting God's plan of justifying sinners through the sacrifice of
   Jesus Christ--and thus she makes the sinner just.

   Faith accepts and appropriates for itself the whole system of Divine
   righteousness which is unfolded in the Person and work of the Lord
   Jesus. Faith rejoices to see Him coming into the world in our nature
   and, in that nature, obeying the Law of God in every jot and tittle,
   though not Himself under that Law until He chose to put Himself there
   on our behalf. Faith is further pleased when she sees the Lord, who had
   come under the Law, offering up Himself as a perfect Atonement and
   making a complete vindication of Divine Justice by His suffering and
   death. Faith lays hold upon the Person, life and death of the Lord
   Jesus as her only hope--and in the righteousness of Christ she arrays
   herself. She cries, "The chastisement of my peace was upon Him and by
   His stripes I am healed."

   Now, the man who believes in God's method of making men righteous
   through the righteousness of Jesus, and accepts Jesus and leans upon
   Him, is a just man! He who makes the life and death of God's great
   Propitiation to be his sole reliance and confidence is justified in the
   sight of God and is written down among the just by the Lord Himself.
   His faith is imputed to him for righteousness because his faith grasps
   the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. "All that believe are
   justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the
   law of Moses." This is the testimony of the Inspired Word--who shall
   deny it?

   But the Believer is also just in another sense which the outside world
   better appreciates, though it is not more valuable than the former. The
   man who believes in God becomes, by that faith, moved to everything
   that is right, good and true. His faith in God rectifies his mind and
   makes him just. In judgment, in desire, in aspiration, in heart, he is
   just. His sin has been freely forgiven him and now, in the hour of
   temptation, he cries, "How, then, can I do this great wickedness and
   sin against God?" He believes in the blood-shedding which God has
   provided for the cleansing of sin and, being washed therein, he cannot
   choose to defile himself again. The love of Christ constrains him to
   seek after that which is true, right, good, loving and honorable in the
   sight of God.

   Having received, by faith, the privilege of adoption, he strives to
   live as a child of God. Having obtained, by faith, a new life, he walks
   in newness of life. "Immortal principles forbid the child of God to
   sin." If any man lives in sin and loves it, he has not the faith of
   God's elect, for true faith purifies the soul. The faith which is
   worked in us by the Holy Spirit is the greatest sin killer under
   Heaven! By the Grace of God it affects the inmost heart; changes the
   desires and the affec-

   tions; and makes the man a new creature in Christ Jesus. If there are
   on earth any who can truly be called just, they are those who are made
   so by faith in God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Indeed, no other men
   are "just" save those to whom the holy God gives the title--and of
   these the text says that they live by faith.

   Faith trusts God and, therefore, loves Him. And, therefore, obeys Him.
   And, therefore, grows like He. It is the root of holiness, the spring
   of righteousness, the life of the just!

   II. Upon that observation, which is vital to the text, I dwell no
   longer, but advance to another which is the converse of it, namely,
   that A MAN WHO IS JUST HAS FAITH IN GOD. Or else, let me say, he were
   not just, for God deserves faith and he who robs Him of it is not just.
   God is so true that to doubt Him is an injustice--He is so faithful
   that to distrust Him is to wrong Him--and he who does the Lord such an
   injustice is not a just man. A just man must first be just with the
   greatest of all beings. It would be idle for him to be just to only his
   fellow creatures if he did a willful injustice to God. I say he would
   be unworthy of the name of just. Faith is what the Lord justly deserves
   to receive from His creatures--it is His due that we believe in what He
   says--and specially in reference to the Gospel.

   When the great love of God in Christ Jesus is set forth plainly, it
   will be believed by the pure in heart. If the great love of Christ in
   dying for us is fully understood, it must be believed by every honest
   mind. To doubt the witness of God concerning His Son is to do the
   sorest injustice to Infinite Love. He that believes not has rejected
   God's witness to the unspeakable Gift and put from Him that which
   deserves man's adoring gratitude, since it, alone, can satisfy the
   Justice of God and give peace to the conscience of man. A truly just
   man must, in order to the completeness of his justness, believe in God
   and in all that He has revealed.

   Some dream that this matter ofjustness only concerns the outer life and
   does not touch man's beliefs. I say, not so-- righteousness concerns
   the inner parts of a man, the central region of his manhood--and truly
   just men desire to be made clean in the secret parts and, in the hidden
   parts, they would know wisdom. Is it not so? We hear it continually
   asserted that our understanding and beliefs constitute a province
   exempt from the jurisdiction of God. Is it, indeed, true that I may
   believe what I like without being accountable to God for my belief? No,
   my Brothers and Sisters! No single part of our manhood is beyond the
   range of the Divine Law! Our whole capacity as men lies under the
   sovereignty of Him that created us and we are as much bound to believe
   aright as we are bound to act aright!

   In fact, our actions and our thoughts are so intertwisted and entangled
   that there is no dividing the one from the other. To say that the
   rightness of the outward life suffices is to go clean contrary to the
   whole tenor of the Word of God. I am as much bound to serve God with my
   mind as with my heart! I am as much bound to believe what God reveals
   as I am to do what God enjoins! Errors of judgment are as truly sins as
   errors of life. It is a part of our allegiance to our great Sovereign
   and Lord that we yield up our understanding, our thought and our belief
   to His supreme control. No man is right until he believes right. A just
   man must be just towards God by believing in God and trusting Him in
   all that He is, and says, and does.

   I see not also, my dear Friends, what reason there is for a man to be
   just towards his fellow men when he has given up his belief in God. If
   it comes to a pinch and a man can deliver himself by a piece of
   dishonesty, why should he not be dishonest if there is no higher law
   than that which his fellow men have made? If there is no Judgment Seat,
   no Judge and no hereafter, why should he be concerned? A few weeks ago
   a man deliberately killed his employer, who had offended him. And as he
   gave himself up to the police, he said that he was not in the least bit
   afraid nor ashamed of what he had done. He admitted the murder and
   acknowledged that he knew the consequences very well. He said he
   expected to suffer about half-a-minute's pain upon the gallows and then
   that would be the end of him and he was quite prepared for that.

   He spoke and acted in consistency with his belief or his
   non-belief--and truly there is no form of crime but what becomes
   logical and legitimate if you take faith in God and the hereafter away
   from man. That gone, break up your commonwealth--there is nothing to
   hold humanity together! Without a God, the moral government of the
   universe has ceased and anarchy is the natural state of things. If
   there is no God and no judgment to come, let us eat and drink, for
   tomorrow we die. If necessary, let us steal, lie and kill!

   Why not? If there is no law, no judgment and no punishment for sin--I
   forget--nothing can be sinful! If there is no lawgiver, there is no
   law! And if there is no law, then there can be no transgression! To
   what a chaos must all things come if faith in God is renounced! Where
   will the just be found when faith is banished? The logically just man
   is a believer in

   some measure or other--and he that is worthy to be called "just" in the
   Scriptural sense, is a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, who is made
   of God unto us righteousness!

   III. But now I come to the point upon which I mean to dwell. Thirdly,
   BY THIS FAITH THE JUST MAN SHALL

   LIVE. This is, at the outset, a narrow statement. It cuts off many
   pretended ways of living by saying, "The just shall live by faith."
   This sentence savors of the strait gate which stands at the head of the
   way--the narrow way which leads into eternal life. At one blow this
   ends all claims of righteousness apart from one mode of life. The best
   men in the world can only live by faith--there is no other way of being
   just in the sight of God! We cannot live in self-righteousness. If we
   are going to trust to ourselves, or anything that comes of ourselves,
   we are dead while we so trust--we have not known the life of God
   according to the teaching of Holy Writ.

   You must come right out from confidence in everything that you are or
   hope to be. You must tear off the leprous garment of legal
   righteousness and part with self in any and every form. Self-reliance
   as to the things of religion will be found to be self-destruction! You
   must rest in God as He is revealed in His Son Jesus Christ and there,
   alone. The just shall live by faith. Those who look to the works of the
   Law are under the curse and cannot live before God. The same is also
   true of those who endeavor to live by sense or feeling. They judge God
   by what they see--if He is bountiful to them in Providence, He is a
   good God. If they are poor, they have nothing good to say of Him, for
   they measure Him by what they feel, taste and see. If God works
   steadily to a purpose and they can see His purpose, they commend His
   wisdom. But when they either cannot see the purpose, or cannot
   understand the way by which the Lord is working unto it, straightway
   they judge Him to be unwise. Living by sense turns out to be a
   senseless mode of life, bringing death to all comfort and hope--

   "Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, But trust Him for His Grace/' for
   only by such trust can a just man live.

   The text also cuts off all idea of living by mere intellect. Too many
   say, "I am my own guide! I shall make doctrines for myself and I shall
   shift them and shape them according to my own devices." Such a way is
   death to the spirit. To be abreast of the times is to be an enemy to
   God! The way of life is to believe what God has taught, especially to
   believe in Him whom God has set forth to be a Propitiation for sin, for
   that is making God to be everything and ourselves nothing. Resting on
   an Infallible Revelation and trusting in an Omnipotent Redeemer, we
   have rest and peace. But, on the other unsettled principle, we become
   wandering stars for whom is appointed the blackness of darkness
   forever. By faith the soul can live--in all other ways we have a name
   to live and are dead.

   The same is equally true of fancy. We often meet with a fanciful
   religion in which people trust to impulses, to dreams, to noises and
   mystic things which they imagine they have seen-- all of it is
   fiddle-faddle! And yet they are quite wrapped up in it. I pray that you
   may cast out this chaffy stuff--there is no food for the spirit in it.
   The life of my soul lies not in what I think, or what I fancy, or what
   I imagine, or what I enjoy of fine feeling, but only in that which
   faith apprehends to be the Word of God! We live before God by trusting
   a promise, depending on a Person, accepting a Sacrifice, wearing a
   righteousness and surrounding ourselves with God--Father, Son and Holy
   Spirit. Implicit trust in Jesus, our Lord, is the way of life--and
   every other way leads down to death. It is a narrowing statement--let
   those who call it intolerance say what they please--it will be true
   when they have execrated it, as much as it is now!

   But, secondly, this is a very broad statement. Much is comprehended in
   the saying--"The just shall live by his faith." It does not say what
   part of his life hangs on his believing, or what phase of his life best
   proves his believing--it comprehends the beginning, continuance,
   increase and perfecting of spiritual life as being all by faith.
   Observe that the text means that the moment a man believes he begins to
   live in the sight of God. He trusts his God; he accepts God's
   revelation of Himself; he confides, reposes, leans upon his Savior--and
   that moment he becomes a spiritually living man, quickened with
   spiritual life by God the Holy Spirit!

   All his existence before that belief was but a form of death. When he
   comes to trust in God, he enters upon eternal life and is born from
   above. Yes, but that is not all, nor half all--for if that man is to
   continue living before God; if he is to hold on to his way in
   holiness--his perseverance must be the result of continued faith. The
   faith which saves is not one single act done and ended on a certain
   day--it is an act continued and persevered in throughout the entire
   life of the man! The just not only commences to live by his faith, but
   he continues to live by his faith! He does not begin in the Spirit

   and end in the flesh, nor go so far by Grace and the rest of the way by
   the works of the Law. "The just shall live by faith," says the text in
   Hebrews, "but if any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in
   him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them
   that believe to the saving of the soul."

   Faith is essential all along every day and all the day, in all things.
   Our natural life begins by breathing and it must be continued by
   breathing. What the breath is to the body, that is faith to the soul.
   Brothers and Sisters, if we are to make advances and increase in the
   Divine life, it must still be in the same way! Our root is faith and
   only through the root comes growth. Progress in Grace comes not of
   carnal wisdom, or legal effort, or unbelief. No, the flesh brings no
   growth unto the spiritual life and efforts made in unbelief rather
   dwarf the inner life than cause it to grow. We become no stronger by
   mortifications, mourning, works, or striving, if these are apart from
   simple faith in God's Grace--for by this one sole channel can
   nourishment come into the life of our spirit. The same door by which
   life came in at the first is that by which life continues to enter.

   If any man says to me, "I once lived by believing in Christ, but I have
   now become spiritual and sanctified and, therefore, I have no longer
   any need to look as a sinner to the blood and righteousness of Christ,"
   I tell that man that he has need to learn the first principles of
   faith! I warn him that he has drawn back from the faith, for he who is
   justified by the Law, or in any other way beside the righteousness of
   Christ, has fallen from Grace and left the only ground upon which a
   soul can be accepted with God. Yes, up to Heaven's gate there is no
   staff for us to lean upon but faith in the ever-blessed Savior and His
   Divine Atonement! Between this place and Heaven we shall never be able
   to live by merits, or live by fancies, or live by intellect--we shall
   still have to be as children taught of God--as Israel in the desert
   depending wholly on the great Invisible One. Ours it is, forever, to
   look out of self and to look above all things that are seen, for "the
   just shall live by his faith."

   It is a very broad sentence, a circle which encompasses the whole of
   our life which is worthy of the name. If there is any virtue; if there
   is any praise; if there is anything that is lovely or of good repute,
   we must receive it, exhibit it and perfect it by the exercise of faith.
   Life in the Father's house; life in the Church; life in private; life
   in the world must all be in the power of faith if we are righteous men.
   That which is without faith is without life! Dead works cannot gratify
   the living God! Without faith it is impossible to please God. I beg you
   to notice, in the third place, what a very unqualified statement it is.
   "The just shall live by his faith." Then, if a man has but a little
   faith, he shall live. And if he is greatly just, he shall still live by
   faith.

   Many a just man has come no further than striving after holiness, but
   he is justified by his faith--his faith is trembling and struggling and
   his frequent prayer is, "Lord, I believe; help You my unbelief"--yet
   his faith has made him a just man! Sometimes he is afraid that he has
   no faith at all! And when he has deep depression of spirits, it is as
   much as he can do to keep his head above water. But even then his faith
   justifies him. He is like a boat upon a stormy sea--sometimes he is
   lifted up to Heaven by flashing waves of mercy--and another he sinks
   into the abyss among billows of affliction. What? Is he, then, a dead
   man? I answer, Does that man truly believe God? Does He accept the
   record concerning the Son of God? Can he truly say, "I believe in the
   forgiveness of sins," and with such faith as he has, does he cling only
   to Christ and to none beside? Then that man shall live! He shall live
   by his faith!

   If the littleness of our faith could destroy us, how few would be
   numbered with the living? "When the Son of man comes, shall He find
   faith on the earth?" Only here and there and now and then, a Luther
   appears who really does believe with all his heart. The most of us are
   not so big as Luther's little finger--we have not so much faith in our
   whole soul as he had in one hair of his head! But yet even that little
   faith makes us live. I do not say that little faith will give us the
   strong, vigorous and lion-like life which Luther had--but we shall
   live. The statement makes no distinction between this and that degree
   of faith, but still lays it down as an unquestionable Truth of
   God--"the just shall live by faith." Blessed be God, then, I shall
   live, for I believe in the Lord Jesus as my Savior and my All! Do you
   not, also, believe in Him? Yes, and is it not singular that this
   unqualified statement should not mention any other Grace as helping to
   make up the ground on which just men live?

   "The just shall live by his faith." But has he not love? Has he not
   zeal? Has he not patience? Has he not hope? Has he not humility? Has he
   not holiness? Oh, yes, he has all these and he lives in them--but he
   does not live by them, because none of these so intimately connects him
   with Christ as does his faith! I will venture to use a very homely
   figure because it is the best I can think of. Here is a little child, a
   suckling. It has many necessary members, such as its eyes, its ears,
   its legs,

   its arms, its heart and so forth. And all these are necessary to it,
   but the one organ by which the tiny baby lives is its mouth, by which
   it sucks from its mother all its nourishment. Our faith is that mouth
   by which we suck in fresh life from the promise of the ever-blessed
   God. Thus faith is that which we live by! Other Graces are necessary,
   but faith is the life of them all. We do not undervalue love, or
   patience, or penitence, or humility any more than we depreciate the
   eyes or the feet of the baby. Still, the means of the life of the
   spiritual man is that mouth by which he receives Divine food from the
   Truths of God revealed by the Holy Spirit in sacred Scripture. Other
   Graces produce results from that which faith receives, but faith is the
   Receiver-General for the whole isle of man.

   This, dear Friends, to proceed a little farther, is a very suggestive
   statement--"The just shall live by his faith"-- because it wears so
   many meanings. First, the righteous man is even to exist by his faith.
   That is to say, the lowest form of Grace in a righteous character is
   dependent upon faith. But, Brothers and Sisters, I hope you will not be
   so foolish as to say--"If I am but a living child of God, it is all I
   need." No, we wish not only to have life, but to have it more
   abundantly! See yonder man rescued from drowning? He is yet alive, but
   the only evidence of it is the fact that a mirror is somewhat bedewed
   by his breath--you would not be content to be alive for years in that
   poor fashion, would you? You ought to be grateful if you are
   spiritually alive even in that feeble way, but still, we do not want to
   remain in a swooning state--we wish to be active and vigorous!

   Yet even for that lowest life you must have faith. For the feeblest
   kind of spiritual existence that can be called life at all, faith is
   necessary. The just who barely live, who are feeble in mind, who are
   scarcely saved, are, nevertheless, delivered by faith. Without faith
   there is no heavenly life whatever. Take the word, "life," in a better
   sense, and the same will apply--"The just shall live by his faith." We
   sometimes meet with very poor persons who say to us in a pitiful tone,
   "Our wages are dreadfully scant." We say to them, "Do you really live
   upon so small a sum?" They answer, "Well, Sir, you can hardly call it
   living, but we exist somehow." None of us would wish to live in that
   style if we could help it. We mean, then, by "life," some measure of
   enjoyment, happiness and satisfaction. The just, when they have
   comfort, joy and peace, have them by faith. Thank God, peace of heart
   is our normal state because faith is an abiding Grace. We sing for joy
   of heart and rejoice in the Lord and, blessed be the Lord, this is no
   novelty to us! But we have known this bliss and still know it by faith
   alone.

   The moment faith comes in, the music strikes up--if it were gone the
   owls would hoot! Luther can sing a Psalm in spite of the devil, but he
   could not have done so if he had not been a man of faith. He could defy
   emperors, kings, popes and bishops while he took firm hold upon the
   strength of God, but only then! Faith is the life of life and makes
   life worth living. It puts joy into the soul to believe in the great
   Father and His everlasting love; in the efficacious Atonement of the
   Son and in the indwelling of the Spirit; in resurrection and eternal
   glory! Without these we were, of all men, most miserable. To believe
   these glorious truths is to live--"The just shall live by his faith."
   Life also means strength. We say of a certain man, "What life he has in
   him! He is full of life! He seems always alive." Yes, the just obtain
   energy, force, vivacity, vigor, power, might and life by faith.

   Faith bestows on Believers a royal majesty. The more they can believe,
   the more mighty they become. This is the head that wears a crown! This
   is the hand that wields a scepter! This is the foot whose royal tread
   does shake the nations! Faith in God links us with the King, the Lord
   God Omnipotent! By faith the just live on when others die. They are not
   overcome by prevalent sin, or fashionable heresy, or cruel persecution,
   or fierce affliction--nothing can kill spiritual life while faith
   abides--"The just shall live by faith." Continuance and perseverance
   come this way. The righteous man, when he is put back a while, is not
   baffled. And when he is wounded by enemies, he is not slain. Where
   another man is drowned, he swims. Where another man is trampled under
   foot, he rises and shouts victoriously--"Rejoice not over me, O my
   enemy! If I fall, yet shall I rise again!"

   In the fiery furnace of affliction he walks unharmed through faith.
   Yes, and when his turn comes to die and, with many tears, his Brothers
   and Sisters carry his ashes to the tomb, "He, being dead, yet speaks."
   The blood of righteous Abel cried from the ground to the Lord and it is
   still crying down the ages, even to this hour. Luther's voice, through
   400 years, still sounds in the ears of men and quickens our pulses like
   the beat of drum in martial music--he lives! He lives because he was a
   man of faith. I would sum up and illustrate this teaching by mentioning
   certain incidents of Luther's life. Upon the great Reformer, Gospel
   Light broke by slow degrees. It was in the monastery that, in turning
   over

   the old Bible that was chained to a pillar, he came upon this
   passage--"The just shall live by his faith." This heavenly sentence
   stuck to him, but he hardly understood all its bearings.

   He could not, however, find peace in his religious profession and
   monastic habit. Knowing no better, he persevered in so many penances
   and mortifications so arduous, that sometimes he was found fainting
   through exhaustion. He brought himself to death's door. He must make a
   journey to Rome, for in Rome there is a fresh church for every day and
   you may be sure to win the pardon of sins and all sorts of benedictions
   in these holy shrines. He dreamed of entering a city of holiness, but
   he found it to be a haunt of hypocrites and a den of iniquity! To his
   horror, he heard men say that if there was a Hell, Rome was built on
   top of it, for it was the nearest approach to it that could be found in
   this world! But he still believed in its Pope and he went on with his
   penances, seeking rest, but finding none.

   One day he was climbing upon his knees the Sancta Scala which still
   stands in Rome. I have stood amazed, at the bottom of this staircase,
   to see poor creatures go up and down on their knees in the belief that
   it is the very staircase that our Lord descended when He left Pilate's
   house! Certain steps are said to be marked with drops of blood--these
   the poor souls--I almost said, fools--kiss most devoutly. Well, Luther
   was crawling up these steps one day when that same text which he had
   met with before, in the monastery, sounded like a clap of thunder in
   his ears, "The just shall live by his faith." He rose from his
   prostration and went down the steps never to grovel upon them again. At
   that time the Lord worked in him a full deliverance from superstition
   and he saw that not by priests, nor priestcraft, nor penances, nor by
   anything that he could do was he to live, but that he must live by his
   faith.

   Our text of this morning had set the monk at liberty and set his soul
   on fire! No sooner did he believe this than he began to live in the
   sense of being active. At this time a gentleman named Tetzel, was going
   about all over Germany selling the forgiveness of sins for so much
   ready cash. No matter what your offense, as soon as your money touched
   the bottom of the box your sins were gone! Luther heard of this, grew
   indignant and exclaimed, "I will make a hole in his drum," which
   assuredly he did--and in several other drums! The nailing up of his
   Theses on the church door was a sure way of silencing the indulgence
   music! Luther proclaimed pardon of sin by faith in Christ without money
   and without price--and the Pope's indulgences were soon objects of
   derision.

   Luther lived by his faith and, therefore, he who otherwise might have
   been quiet, denounced error as furiously as a lion roars upon his prey.
   The faith that was in him filled him with intense life and he plunged
   into war with the enemy. After a while they summoned him to Augsburg
   and to Augsburg he went, though his friends advised him not to go. They
   summoned him, as a heretic, to answer for himself at the Diet of Worms.
   And everybody bade him stay away, for he would be sure to be
   burned--but he felt it necessary that the testimony should be borne and
   so, in a wagon he went from village to village and town to town,
   preaching as he went! The poor people came out to shake hands with the
   man who was standing up for Christ and the Gospel at the risk of his
   life. You remember how he stood before that august assembly and though
   he knew, as far as human power went, that his defense would cost him
   his life, for he would, probably, be committed to the flames like John
   Huss, yet he played the man for the Lord his God?

   That day in the German Diet, Luther did a work for which ten thousand
   times tea thousand mothers' children have blessed his name and blessed,
   yet more, the name of the Lord his God! To put him out of harm's way
   for a while, a prudent friend took him prisoner and kept him out of the
   strife, in the castle of Wartburg. There he had a good time of it,
   resting, studying, translating, making music and preparing himself for
   the future, which was to be so eventful. He did all that a man can do
   who is outside of the fray, but, "the just shall live by his faith,"
   and Luther could not be buried alive in ease--he must be getting on
   with his lifework! He sends word to his friends that he who was coming
   would soon be with them, and all of a sudden he appeared at Wittenberg.
   The prince meant to have kept him in retirement somewhat longer, but
   Luther must live--and when the Elector feared that he could not protect
   him, Luther wrote him, "I come under far higher protection than yours;
   no, I hold that I am more likely to protect Your Grace than Your Grace
   to protect me! He who has the strongest faith is the best protector."

   Luther had learned to be independent of all men, for he cast himself
   upon his God! He had all the world against him and yet he lived right
   merrily--if the Pope excommunicated him, he burned the bull! If the
   Emperor threatened him, he rejoiced because he remembered the Words of
   the Lord, "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
   counsel together. He that sits in the heavens shall laugh." When they
   said to him, "Where will you find shelter if the Elector does not
   protect you?" He answered, "Under the broad shield of God." Luther
   could not be still! He must speak and

   write and thunder! And oh, with what confidence he spoke! Doubts about
   God and Scripture he abhorred! Melancthon says he was not dogmatic. I
   rather differ from Melancthon, there, and reckon Luther to be the chief
   of dogmatists! He called Melancthon the, "soft treader," and I wonder
   what we should have done if Luther had been Melancthon and had trod
   softly, too?

   The times needed a firmly assured leader and faith made Luther all that
   for years, notwithstanding his many sorrows and infirmities. He was a
   Titan, a giant, a man of splendid mental caliber and strong physique,
   but his main life and force lay in his faith. He suffered much in
   exercises of the mind and through diseases of body. And these might
   well have occasioned a display of weakness, but that weakness did not
   appear, for when he believed, he was as sure of what he believed as of
   his own existence and, therefore, he was strong. If every angel in
   Heaven had passed before him and each one had assured him of the Truth
   of God, he would not have thanked them for their testimony, for he
   believed God without the witness of either angels or men! He thought
   the Word of Divine Testimony to be more sure than anything that
   seraphim could say! This man was forced to live by his faith, for he
   was a man of stormy soul--and only faith could speak peace to him.

   Those stirring excitements of his brought on him, afterwards, fearful
   depressions of spirit--and then he needed faith in God. If you read a
   spiritual life of him, you will find that it was hard work, sometimes,
   for him to keep his soul alive. Being a man of like passions with us,
   and full of imperfections, he was, at times, as desponding and
   despairing as the weakest among us. And the swelling grief within him
   threatened to burst his mighty heart. Both he and John Calvin
   frequently sighed for the rest of Heaven, for they loved not the strife
   in which they dwelt, but would have been glad to peacefully feed the
   flock of God on earth and then to enter into rest. These men dwelt with
   God in holy boldness of believing prayer, or they could not have lived
   at all. Luther's faith laid hold upon the Cross of our Lord and would
   not be stirred from it. He believed in the forgiveness of sins and
   could not afford to doubt it.

   He cast anchor upon Holy Scripture and rejected all the inventions of
   clerics and all the traditions of the fathers. He was assured of the
   Truth of the Gospel and never doubted but what it would prevail though
   earth and Hell were leagued against it. When he came to die, his old
   enemy assailed him fiercely, but when they asked him if he held the
   same faith, his, "Yes," was positive enough! They needed not to have
   asked him--they might have been sure of that. And now, today, the
   Truths of God proclaimed by Luther continue to be preached and will be
   till our Lord, Himself, shall come! Then the Holy City shall need no
   candle, neither light of the sun, because the Lord, Himself, shall be
   the Light of His people! But till then we must shine with Gospel Light
   to our utmost. Brothers and Sisters, let us stand to it that as Luther
   lived by faith, even so will we--and may God the Holy Spirit work in us
   more of that faith. Amen and Amen!

The Luther Sermon at Exeter Hall

   (No. 1750)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 11, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT EXETER HALL.

   "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails anything, nor
   uncircumcision; but faith which works by love." Galatians 5:6.

   PAUL makes a clean sweep of that trust in the externals of religion
   which is the common temptation of all time. Circumcision was a great
   thing with the Jew and, oftentimes he trusted in it. But Paul declares
   that it avails nothing. There might be others who were glad that they
   were not Jews, but Paul declares that their uncircumcision avails no
   more than its opposite! Certain matters connected with godliness are
   external and yet they are useful in their places--especially is that
   the case with Baptism and the Lord's Supper, the assembling of
   ourselves together, the reading of the Word of God and public prayer
   and praise. These things are proper and profitable, but none of them
   must be made, in any measure or degree, the ground of our hope of
   salvation, for this text sweeps them all away and plainly describes
   them as availing nothing if they are made to

   be the foundations of our trust.

   In Luther's day superstitious confidence in external observances had
   overlaid faith in the Gospel. Ceremonies had multiplied excessively
   under the authority of the Pope. Masses were said for souls in
   "purgatory" and men were actually selling indulgences for sin in the
   light of day! When God raised up Martin Luther, who was born four
   centuries ago, he bore emphatic testimony against salvation by outward
   forms and by the power of priestcraft, affirming that salvation is by
   faith, alone, and that the whole Church of God is a company of priests,
   every Believer being a priest unto God.

   If Luther had not affirmed it, the doctrine would have been just as
   true, for the distinction between clergy and laity has no excuse in
   Scripture, which calls the saints, "God's kleros"--God's clergy, or
   heritage. Again we read, "You are a royal priesthood." Every man that
   believes in the Lord Jesus Christ is anointed to exercise the Christian
   priesthood and, therefore, he need not put his trust in another, seeing
   the supposed priest is no more than any other man. Each man must be
   accountable for himself before God. Each one must read and search the
   Scriptures for himself and must believe for himself--and when saved, he
   must offer up himself as a living sacrifice unto God by Jesus Christ,
   who is the only High Priest of our profession.

   So much for the negative side of the text, which is full of warning to
   this Ritualistic age. The chief testimony of our great Reformer was to
   the justification of a sinner in the sight of God by faith in Jesus
   Christ and by that alone. He could fitly have taken this as his motto,
   "In Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails anything, nor
   uncircumcision but faith which works by love." He was in the
   Augustinian monastery at Wittenberg, troubled and perturbed in mind,
   and he had there, in an old Latin Bible, this text, "The just shall
   live by faith." It was a new idea to him and by its means spiritual
   light entered his soul in some degree. But such were the prejudices of
   his up-bringing and such the darkness of his surroundings, that he
   still hoped to find salvation by outward performances.

   He therefore fasted long, till he was found swooning from hunger. He
   was exceedingly zealous for salvation by works. At last he made a
   pilgrimage to Rome, hoping to find, there, everything that was holy and
   helpful. He was disappointed in his search, but yet found more there of
   what he looked for. On the pretended staircase of Pilate, while in the
   act of climbing it upon his knees, the Wittenberg text again sounded in
   his ears like a thunderclap--"The just shall live by faith." Up he
   started and descended those stairs, never to grovel upon them again!
   The chain was broken, the soul was free! Luther had found the L of God
   and, therefore, from that day on it became his life's business to flash
   that Light upon the nations, crying evermore, "The just shall live by
   faith."

   The best commemoration which I can make of this man is to preach the
   doctrine which he held so dear. And you who are thus saved can best
   assist me by believing the doctrine and proving its truth in your own
   cases. May the Holy Spirit cause it to be so in hundreds of instances!

   I. First, let us inquire WHAT IS THIS FAITH? We are always talking
   about it, but what is it? Whenever I try to explain it, I am afraid
   lest I should confuse rather than expound. There is a story told
   concerning John Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress." Good Thomas Scott, the
   Commentator, wrote notes to it. He thought the "Pilgrim's Progress" a
   difficult book and he would make it clear. A pious cottager in his
   parish had the book and she was reading it when her minister called. He
   said to her, "Oh, I see, you are reading Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.
   Do you understand it?" She answered innocently enough, "Oh, yes Sir, I
   understand Mr. Bunyan very well, and I hope that one day I shall be
   able to understand your explanations."

   I am afraid lest you should say when I have done, "I understand what
   faith is, as I find it in the Bible, and one day, perhaps, I may be
   able to understand the preacher's explanation of it." Warned by this, I
   will speak as plainly as I can! And first, it is to be remembered that
   faith is not a mere creed-holding. It is very proper to say, "I believe
   in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth," and so forth.
   But you may repeat all that and be no "Believer" in the Scriptural
   sense of that term. Though the creed is true, it may not be true to
   you--it would have been the same to you if the opposite had been true,
   for you put the truth away like a paper in a pigeon-hole and it has no
   effect upon you. "A very proper doctrine," you say, "a very proper
   doctrine," and so you put it to sleep. It does not influence your
   heart, nor affect your life.

   Do not imagine that professing an orthodox creed is the same thing as
   faith in Christ! A truthful creed is desirable for many reasons, but if
   it is a dead, inoperative thing, it cannot bring salvation. Faith is
   belief of the Truths of God, but it is more. Again, faith is not the
   mere belief that there is a God, though that we must have, for we
   cannot come to God except we "believe that He is and that He is a
   Rewarder of them that diligently seek Him." We are to believe in God--
   that He is good, blessed, true, right and, therefore, to be trusted,
   confided in and praised. Whatever He may do, whatever He may say, God
   is not to be suspected, but believed in. You know what it is to believe
   in a man, do you not? To believe in a man so that you follow him and
   confide in him and accept his advice?

   In that same way faith believes in God--not only believes that He is,
   but finds rest in His Character, His Son, His promise, His Covenant,
   His Word and everything about Him. Faith livingly and lovingly trusts
   in her God about everything! Especially must we believe in what God has
   revealed in Scripture--that it is verily and, indeed, a sure and
   Infallible testimony to be received without question. We accept the
   Father's witness concerning Jesus and take heed, thereto, "as unto a
   light that shines in a dark place." Faith has specially to believe in
   Him who is the sum and substance of all this Revelation, even Jesus
   Christ, who became God in human flesh that He might redeem our fallen
   nature from all the evils of sin and raise it to eternal felicity.

   We believe in Christ, on Christ, and upon Christ--accepting Him because
   of the record which God has given to us concerning His Son--that He is
   the Propitiation for our sins. We accept God's unspeakable Gift and
   receive Jesus as our All in All. If I wanted to describe saving faith
   in one word, I should say that it is trust. It is so believing God and
   so believing in Christ that we trust ourselves and our eternal
   destinies in the hands of a reconciled God. As creatures we look up to
   the great Father of Spirits. As sinners we trust for the pardon of our
   sins to the Atonement of Jesus Christ. As being weak and feeble we
   trust to the power of the Holy Spirit to make us holy and to keep us
   so. We venture our eternal interests in the vessel of Free Grace,
   content to sink or swim with it. We rely upon God in Christ.

   The Word employed to set forth faith in the Scriptures sometimes
   signifies to lean. We lean with all our weight upon our God, in Jesus
   Christ. We hang upon Christ as a vessel hangs upon a nail. "Recumbency"
   was a term by which the old Puritans used to describe faith--a lying,
   or leaning upon something out of ourselves. Guilty as I am, I believe
   God's Word that, "the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from
   all sin." Trusting to that blood I know that I am cleansed from all
   sin. God sets forth Christ to be a Propitiation--we believe that He is
   a Propitiation and we take Him to be our Propitiation. By that
   appropriation our sin is covered and we are free! Faith is the
   grasping, the appropriating, the receiving into one's self of the Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   I sometimes illustrate it by that passage of Paul where he says, "The
   word is near you, even in your mouth." When a morsel is in your mouth,
   if you desire to possess it so as never to lose it, what is the best
   thing to do? Swallow it! Let it go down into the inward parts. Now the
   word that we preach is, according to the Apostle, "in your
   mouth"--suffer it, then, by God's Grace, to go down into your heart,
   and you shall find it true that, "with the heart man believes unto
   righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
   This is the faiths which saves the soul.

   II. In the second place we will consider WHY FAITH IS SELECTED AS THE
   WAY OF SALVATION. I would remind you that if we could not answer this
   question it would not matter--since the Lord has appointed believing as
   the way of Grace, it is not ours to challenge His choice. Beggars must
   not be choosers! Let us trust, if so the Lord ordains. But we can
   answer this question in a measure. First, it is clear that no other way
   is possible. It is not possible for us to be saved by our own merits,
   for we have already broken the Law of God and, future obedience, being
   already due, cannot make up for past defects--

   "Could my tears forever flow, Could my zeal no respite know, All for
   sin could not atone You must save, and You alone."

   The road of good works is blocked up by our past sins and it is sure to
   be further blocked up by future sins--we ought, therefore, to rejoice
   that God has commended to us the open road of faith! God has chosen the
   way of faith that salvation might be by Divine Grace. If we had to do
   anything in order to save ourselves, we would be sure to impute a
   measure of virtue to our own doing, or feelings, or prayers, or
   almsgivings and we would thus detract from the pure Grace of God. But
   salvation comes from God as a pure favor--an act of undeserved
   generosity and benevolence--and the Lord will, therefore, only put it
   into the hand of faith, since faith arrogates nothing to herself.
   Faith, in fact, disowns all idea of merit, and the Lord of Grace
   therefore elects to place the treasure of His love in the hands of
   faith.

   Again, it is of faith that there may be no boasting, for if our
   salvation is of our doing or feelings, we are sure to boast. But, if it
   is of faith, we cannot glory in self. "Where is boasting, then? It is
   excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith." Faith is
   humble and ascribes all praise to God. Faith is truthful and confesses
   her obligation to the Sovereign Grace of God. I bless the Lord that He
   has chosen this way of faith because it is so suitable for poor
   sinners. Some among us, tonight, would never have been saved if
   salvation had only been prepared for the good and righteous. I stood
   before my God guilty and self-condemned. No youth ever had a keener
   sense of guilt than I had.

   When I was convicted of sin, I saw my thoughts and desires to be vile
   in the sight of God--and I also became vile in my own eyes. I was
   driven to despair and I know that I could never have been cheered by
   any plan of salvation except that which is of faith. The Covenant of
   Works by reason of our weakness affords us no suitable way of hope at
   any time and, under certain circumstances, we see this very vividly.
   Suppose that you were in the last article of death? What good works
   could you do? Yonder dying thief found it a happy thing that by faith
   he could trust the Crucified One--and before the sun set could be with
   Him in Paradise! Faith is a suitable way for sinners and especially for
   sinners who are soon to die!

   In some sense we are all in that condition and some of us, perhaps, are
   especially so. What man among us knows that he will see tomorrow's
   dawn? I bless God, again, that the way of salvation is by faith because
   it is a way open to the most unlearned. What fine theology we get
   nowadays--deep thinking they call it. The men go down so deep into
   their subjects and so stir the mud at the bottom, that you cannot see
   them and they cannot see themselves! I apprehend that teachers of a
   certain school do not, themselves, know what they are talking about.
   Now, if salvation were only to be learned by reading through huge
   folios, what would become of multitudes of poor souls in Bow, and
   Bethuel Green, and Seven Dials? If the Gospel had consisted of a mass
   of learning, how could the unlearned be saved?

   But now we can go to each one of them and say, "Jesus died"--

   "There is life in a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for you!" However little you may know, you know that you have
   sinned. Know, then, that Jesus has come to put away sin and that
   whoever believes in Him is immediately forgiven and enters into eternal
   life. This brief and blessed Gospel is suitable to all cases, from
   princes to peasants, and we wonder not that faith was selected as the
   way of salvation.

   III. But now, thirdly, I want to say a good deal, tonight, upon another
   question--HOW DOES FAITH OPERATE? For according to our text, it is,
   "Faith which works by love." It is a living, laboring, loving faith
   which, alone, saves the soul. I cannot tell you what hard things I have
   heard about this doctrine of Salvation by Faith. They say that it is
   immoral. I have heard immoral men say so and surely they ought to know!
   They say that it will lead to sin and those who say so would, I should
   think, be rather pleased with it for that reason if they believed their
   own statement. I have never heard a holy man charge faith with leading
   him into sin. I know no man that follows after God and lives near to
   Him who is under fear that faith in God will tempt him to sin!

   The fact is, faith does nothing of the kind! Its action is most
   distinctly the reverse. Like the prudent wife in Proverbs, faith will
   do a man good and not harm all the days of his life. First, it touches
   the mainspring of our nature by creating love within the soul. What is
   needed, now, for the degraded classes in London? Sanitary regulations?
   Certainly, if they are not allowed to be a dead letter for the need of
   someone to carry them out. New houses? By all manner of means--the more
   the better. Lower rents? Assuredly, for no one has a right to get an
   excessive rent for unhealthy accommodations. Higher wages? Certainly,
   we could all of us do with a little more.

   Many other things are needed. While yonder gin-palaces remain at the
   corners of the streets, you will not make much headway in lifting up
   the masses and I suppose the drink-shops will always flourish while the
   taste for drink remains. Suppose the licensed poison-shops were shut
   up--would that suffice? I think not. There are men and women in London,
   and thousands of them, who, if they were put into the cleanest houses
   and were a mile away from a gin-shop, would still drink and still turn
   their houses into pigsties! What is needed? Oh, if you could make
   Christians of them! Suppose they could be born-again? Suppose they
   could be made to love the things which they now hate, and hate the
   things which they now love? New hearts and right spirits are the need
   of London's outcasts!

   How can these be produced? In the hand of God, the Holy Spirit--this is
   exactly what faith works in the heart! Here is a watch. "It needs
   cleaning." Yes, clean it. "It does not work. It needs a new crystal."
   Well, put in a new crystal. "It still does not work. It needs new
   hands." Get new hands by all means! Still it does not run. What is the
   matter with it? The maker says that it needs a mainspring. There's the
   seat of the evil--nothing can be right till that is rectified. Set all
   other matters going, but do not forget that the mainspring is the chief
   part of the business! Faith supplies the soul with a powerful spring of
   action. It says to the man, "You are forgiven through the blood of
   Christ who died for you--how do you feel towards Him?"

   The man replies, "I love the Lord for redeeming me." Loving Jesus, the
   man has now within his soul the seed of every good. He will become a
   holier and a better being, for he has begun to love, and love is the
   mother of holiness. Is any service in the world like the service of
   love? You have a servant in your house, fawning and obsequious, but if
   you were to reduce his wages, he would show you the rough side of his
   tongue and seek another employer! You do not expect any more of him
   than that, but if you did, you would not get it. How different was an
   old servant I have heard of, who, when his master went down in the
   world, was content with half-pay! And when he was sorrowfully told that
   he must go, for his master could not afford him clothes, he made his
   old ones last him, for he would not leave his master in his old age.

   He would rather have earned bread for his old master than have left
   him! He was an attached servant worth his weight in gold! There are few
   such servants nowadays, for there are not many such masters. This kind
   of service cannot be purchased, but its price is above rubies. When the
   Lord leads us to believe in Jesus, we become, from then on, His loving
   servants and serve Him not for reward, but out of gratitude! It is no
   longer with us so much work and so much pay--we do not fear the threat
   of Hell for disobedience, nor do we look to Heaven as won by works. No,
   no, our salvation is a free gift! It is furnished for us through
   infinite love and supreme compassion and, therefore, we return our
   heart's warmest affection. Our heart clings to that dear side which was
   opened for us. We feel a tender love to those dear pierced feet. We
   could kiss them every day.

   Those blessed hands of the Crucified! If they do but touch us, we are
   strengthened, honored, comforted. Jesus is altogether lovely to us, our
   bosom Friend and Lord! Faith, instead of being a poor, paltry thing, as
   some imagine, is the grandest cause of love and so of obedience and
   holiness. Know, again, that faith puts us into a new relation. We are
   bound by nature to be the servants of God, but faith whispers in our
   ear, "Say, 'Our Father,'" and when the heart has received the Spirit of
   adoption, the aspect of service is entirely changed--mercenary service
   is succeeded by loving obedience and our spirit is altered! To become
   an heir of God, a joint-heir with Jesus, is to elevate work into
   delight, labor into fellowship with God! The Law is no fetter to a
   child of God--it is his delight! Faith removes from the heart that form
   of selfishness which before seemed necessary.

   So you hope to be saved by what you do, do you? May I ask you, Friend,
   whom you are serving in all this? I will tell you. You are serving
   yourself! All that you do is to win happiness for yourself. How, then,
   are you serving God? You are living a selfish life, though it is tinged
   with the color of spirituality. What is done by you in the matter of
   religion has no objective but that you may be saved and go to Heaven.
   Your most zealous work is all for self. Suppose I say to you, "I know
   that I am saved. I know that Jesus has put away my sin. I know that He
   will not permit me to perish"? Why, then,

   there is room in my case for the serving of the Lord because of what He
   has done for me! Now I have not myself to save-- I have Christ to
   serve!

   Gratitude is the motive of the Gospel and under its power, unselfish
   virtue is possible, but not upon the ground of legal service. Pure
   virtue, it seems to me, is a sheer impossibility till a man is saved
   because it always must partake, till then, of the low and groveling
   view of benefiting himself by what he is doing. When once the great
   transaction is done, and you are saved, then you are lifted up into a
   nobler sphere and you say--

   "Then why O blessed Jesus Christ, Should I not love You well? Not for
   the hope of winning Heaven, Nor of escaping Hell! Not with the hope of
   gaining anything, Not seeking a reward, But as You have loved me, O
   ever-loving Lord, So would I love You, dearest Lord, And in Your praise
   will sing Solely because You are my God, And my Eternal King."

   Therefore faith inspires us with a higher motive than the Law can
   suggest. Faith soon creates love for man, for, if the Lord Jesus has
   saved you, my Brothers and Sisters, you will speedily desire that
   others may be saved, also. You have tasted of this honey and the
   sweetness upon your own tongue prevails you to invite others to the
   feast. He who has been brought into the liberty of Free Grace would set
   free every captive sinner if he could.

   When well worked out, faith means harmony with God. It creates an
   agreement with the Divine will, so that whatever pleases God pleases
   us. If the Lord should set the Believer on a dunghill with Job, he
   would still bless His name. Faith agrees with the Divine Precept which
   it desires to obey; with the Divine Doctrine which it desires to know
   and publish. Yes, whatever is of God, Faith says, "It is the Lord, let
   Him command, teach, or do what seems Him good." I have shown you that
   faith is not the trifling principle which its deprecators describe as,
   "Only believe." Oh, that they knew what it is to only believe! It is
   the setting free of the mind from fetters. It is the dawn of Heaven's
   own day. It is a lifelong struggle, this "Only believe." It is "the
   work of God, that you believe on Him whom He has sent."

   Brothers and Sisters, I believe that a humble, persevering faith in God
   is one of the highest forms of adoration that ever reaches the Throne
   of God. Though cherubim and seraphim salute the Lord with their, "Holy,
   holy, holy;" though the whole host of shining ones surround the Throne
   of God with perpetual hallelujahs, there is no more hearty reverence
   given to God than when a poor sinner, black as night, cries
   believingly, "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." To believe in
   the pardon of sin is a wonderful adoration of the mercy and power of
   God! To believe in a constant Providence is a sweet way of worshipping
   God in His power and goodness!

   When a poor laborer in his cottage, needing bread for his children,
   kneels down and cries, "Lord, it is written, 'Your bread shall be given
   you, and your water shall be sure!' I believe Your Word and, therefore,
   I look to You in my necessity." He renders a homage to the truth and
   faithfulness of God such as Gabriel could not give, for Gabriel never
   knew the pinch of hunger. To believe that God will keep us to the end
   and raise us to His Glory is more honoring to God than all the hymns of
   the glorified! From us dying sons of earth, when we confide in His
   promise, there arises up to Heaven incense of a sweet smell, acceptable
   to God by Jesus Christ.

   To my mind there is also this about faith--that it has a marvelous
   power over God. Do you ask me to retract that expression? Let it stand!
   I will explain it. Faith overcomes the Highest upon His Throne. Faith
   in an inferior can hold a superior fast. Some years ago I was walking
   in the garden, one evening, and I saw a stray dog about whom I had
   received information that he was in the habit of visiting my grounds
   and that he did not, in the least, assist the gardener and, therefore,
   his attentions were not desired. As I walked along one Saturday
   evening, meditating upon my sermon, I saw this dog busily doing
   mischief. I threw my stick at him and told him to go home. But what do
   you think he did? Instead of baring his teeth at me, or hurrying off
   with a howl, he looked at me very pleasantly, took up my stick in his
   mouth and brought it to me! And then, wagging his tail, he laid the
   stick at my feet!

   The tears were in my eyes--the dog had beaten me. I said, "Good dog!
   Good dog, you may come here when you like after that." Why had the dog
   conquered me? Because he had confidence in me and would not believe
   that I could mean him any hurt. To turn to grander things--the Lord
   Himself cannot resist humble confidence. Do you not see how a sinner
   brings, as it were, the rod of Justice to the Lord, and cries, "If You
   smite me, I deserve it; but I submit to You." The great God cannot
   spurn a trustful heart. It is impossible! He were not God if He could
   cast the soul away that implicitly relies on Him! This is the power of
   faith, then, and I marvel not that the Lord should have chosen it, for
   believing is a thing most pleasing to God!

   O that you would all trust Him! God lifts His sword against you--run
   into His arms! He threatens you--grasp His promise! He pursues you--fly
   to His dear Son! Trust at the foot of the Cross in His full Atonement
   and you must be saved!

   IV. Now, I am going to finish in a way suitable to this Luther
   memorial. You have heard a great deal about Luther's preaching
   salvation by faith alone. Now, LET US TURN TO LUTHER'S LIFE and see
   what Luther himself meant by it. What kind of faith did Luther himself
   exhibit by which he was justified? First, in Luther's case, faith led
   him to an open avowal of what he believed. Luther did not mean to go up
   to Heaven by the back stairs, as many young men hope to do. You wish to
   be Christians on the sly, so as to escape the offense of the Cross.
   Luther did not refuse to confess Christ and take up his cross and
   follow Him. He knew that he, who with his heart believes, must also
   with his mouth make confes-sion--and he did so right nobly.

   He began teaching and preaching the Truth of God which had enlightened
   his own soul. One of his sermons displeased Duke George of Saxony, but
   as it saved a lady of high rank, Luther did not fret. He was not the
   man to conceal the Truth of God because it was dangerous to avow it.
   Tetzel came with his precious indulgences and his releases for souls in
   "purgatory." Thousands of good Catholics were indignant, but no one
   would bell the cat. Luther called Tetzel, "servant of Pope and of the
   devil," and declared, "As he came among us practicing on the credulity
   of the people, I could not refrain from protesting against it and
   opposing his odious career." Without mimicking words, or attempting to
   speak politely, Luther went at him, fearless of the consequences. He
   believed in the blessings of Grace, "without money and without price,"
   and he did not conceal his convictions! He nailed his Theses to the
   Church door where all might read them.

   When astronomers require a new constellation in the heavens let it be
   "the hammer and nails." O you who make no profession, let this man's
   outspoken faith rebuke you! His dauntless valor for the Truth of God
   caused him to be greatly hated in his own day with a ferocity which has
   not yet died out. Luther is still the best hated man in certain
   quarters. Witness the vile tracts which have been produced, during the
   last fortnight, to the disgrace of the press which they defile! I can
   say no worse nor better of them than that they are worthy of the cause
   in whose interest they are issued. Mention the name of Luther and the
   bond-slaves of Rome gnash their teeth! This intense ill-feeling proves
   Luther's power. Young men, I do not know what your ambition may be, but
   I hope you do not wish to be in this world mere chips in the porridge,
   giving forth no flavor whatever.

   My ambition does not run in that line. I know that if I have no intense
   haters, I can have no intense lovers--and, by His Grace, I am prepared
   to have both. When right-hearted men see honest love of the Truth of
   God in a man, they cry, "He is our Brother. Let him be our champion!"
   When the wrong-hearted reply, "Down with him!" we thank them for the
   unconscious homage which they thus pay to decision of character. No
   child of God should court the world's approbation. Certainly Luther did
   not. He pleased God and that was enough for him. His faith was of this
   kind, also--that it moved him to a hearty reverence for what he
   believed to be Holy Scripture. I am sorry that he was not always wise
   in his judgment of what the Bible contains, but to him Scripture was
   the last court of appeal. If any had convinced Luther of error out of
   that Book, he would gladly have retracted.

   But that was not their plan--they simply said, "He is a heretic.
   Condemn him or make him retract." To this he never yielded for an
   instant! Alas, in this age numbers of men are setting up to be their
   own inspired writers. I have been told that every man who is his own
   lawyer has a fool for his client, and I am inclined to think that when
   any man sets up to be his own savior and his own revelation, much the
   same thing occurs. That conceited idea is in the air at this present
   time--every man is excogitating his own bible. Not so Luther! He loved
   the Sacred Book! He fought by its help. It was his battle-ax and his
   weapon of war. A text of Scripture fired his soul, but the words of
   tradition he rejected. He would

   not yield to Melancthon, or Zwingli, or Calvin or whoever it might
   be--however learned or pious. He took his own personal faith to the
   Scripture and, according to his light, he followed the Word of the
   Lord. May many a Luther be in this place!

   The next thing I note was the intense activity of his faith. Luther did
   not believe in God doing his work, so as to lie by in idleness. Not a
   bit of it! A disciple once said to Mohammed, "I am going to turn my
   camel loose and trust in Providence." "No," said Mohammed, "trust in
   Providence, but tie up your camel carefully." This resembled Oliver
   Cromwell's Puritan precept, "Trust in God, but keep your powder dry."
   Luther believed above most men in keeping his powder dry. How he
   worked! By pen, by mouth, by hand! He was energetic almost beyond
   belief. He seemed a many-handed man. He did works which would have
   taxed the strength of hundreds of smaller men. He worked as if
   everything depended upon his own activity and then he fell back in holy
   trust upon God as though he had done nothing! This is the kind of faith
   which saves a man both in this life and in that which is to come.

   Again, Luther's faith abounded in prayer. What supplications they were!
   Those who heard them tell us of his tears, his wrestling, his holy
   arguments. He would go into his closet, heavy at heart, and remain
   there an hour or two, and then come forth singing, "I have conquered, I
   have conquered!" "Ah," he said one day, "I have so much to do today
   that I cannot get through it with less than three hours' prayer." I
   thought he was going to say, "I cannot afford to give even a quarter of
   an hour to prayer"--but he increased his prayer as he increased his
   labor. This is the faith that saves--a faith that lays hold on God and
   prevails with Him in private supplication.

   His was a faith that delivered him entirely from the fear of man. Duke
   George is going to stop him. "Is he?" said Luther. "If it were to rain
   Duke Georges, I would go." He is exhorted not to go to Worms, for he
   will be in danger. If there were as many devils in Worms as there were
   tiles on the housetops, he would be there! And he was there, as you all
   know, playing the man for the Gospel and for his God. He committed
   himself to no man, but kept his faith in God pure and unmingled! Popes,
   emperors, doctors, electors were all as nothing to Luther when they
   stood against the Lord. Be it so with us, also! His was a faith that
   made him risk all for the Truth of God. There seemed no hope of his
   ever coming back from Worms alive. He was pretty sure to be burned like
   John Russ--and the wonder is that he escaped. His very daring brought
   him safety from peril! He expressed his regret that the crown of
   martyrdom would, in all probability, be missed by him, but the faith
   which is prepared to die for Jesus was within him. He, who in such a
   case saves his life, shall lose it, but he that loses his life for
   Christ's sake shall find it unto life eternal! This was the faith that
   made Luther a man among men and saved him from priestly affectations.

   I do not know whether you admire what is thought to be very superior
   religion. It is a thing of beauty, but not of use. It ought always to
   be kept in a glass case--it is made up for drawing-rooms and religious
   meetings, but would be out of place in a shop or on a farm. Now,
   Luther's religion was with him at home--at the table us well as in the
   pulpit. His religion was part and parcel of his common life and that
   life was free, open, bold and unrestrained. It is easy to find fault
   with him from the superfine standpoint, for he lived in an honest
   fearlessness. My admiration kindles as I think of the hearty openness
   of the man! I do not wonder that even ungodly Germans revere him, for
   he is all German, and all man! When he speaks, he does not take his
   words out of his mouth to look at them, and to ask Melancthon whether
   they will do. No, he hits hard and he has spoken a dozen sentences
   before he has thought whether they are polished or not!

   Indeed, he is utterly indifferent to criticism and speaks what he
   thinks and feels. He is at his ease, for he feels at home. Is he not
   everywhere in his great Father's house? Has he not a pure and simple
   intent to speak the Truth of God and do the right? I like Luther with a
   wife and children. I like to see him with his family and a Christmas
   tree, making music with little Johnny Luther on his knee. I love to
   hear him sing a little hymn with the children and tell his pretty boy
   about the horses in Heaven with golden bridles and silver saddles.
   Faith had not taken away his manhood, but sanctified it to noblest
   uses. Luther did not live and move as if he were a mere cleric, but as
   a brother to our common humanity!

   After all, Brothers and Sisters, you must know that the greatest
   divines have to eat bread and butter like other people. They shut their
   eyes before they sleep and they open them in the morning, just like
   other folks! This is matter of fact, though some stilted gentleman
   might like us to doubt it. They feel and think like other men. Why
   should they seem as if they did not? Is it not a good thing to eat and
   drink to the glory of God and show people that common things can be
   sanctified by the Word of God and prayer? What if we do not wear
   canonicals and so on? The best canonicals in the world are thorough
   devotion to the Lord's work! And if a man lives aright, he makes every
   garment a vestment, every

   meal a sacrament and every house a temple! All our hours are canonical!
   All our days holy days! Every breath is incense, every pulse music for
   the Most High!

   They tell us that Luther ignored good works. It is true he would not
   allow good works to be spoken of as the means of salvation, but of
   those who professed faith in Jesus he demanded holy lives! Luther
   abounded in prayer and charity. What an almsgiver Luther was! I fear he
   did not, at all times, dimly regard the principles of the Charity
   Organization Society! As he goes along, if there are beggars, he
   empties his pockets for them. Two hundred crowns have just come in,
   and, though he has a family about him, he cries, "Two hundred crowns!
   God is giving me my portion in this life." "Here," he says to a poor
   Brother minister, "take half! And where are the poor? Fetch them in. I
   must be rid of this!" I am afraid that his Catherine was forced, at
   times, to shake her head at him, for, in truth, he was not always the
   most economical husband that might be. In almsgiving he was second to
   none and in all the duties of life he rose far beyond the level of his
   age. Like all other men, he had his faults, but as his enemies harp on
   that string and go far beyond the truth, I need not dwell upon his
   failings. I wish that the detractors of Luther were half as good as he.
   All the glory of his grand career was unto the Lord, alone!

   Lastly, Luther's faith was a faith that helped him under struggles that
   are seldom spoken of. I suppose that never man had greater
   soul-conflict than Luther. He was a man of heights and depths.
   Sometimes he went up to Heaven and he sang his hallelujahs. And then he
   went down, again, into the abyss with his "Miserere." I am afraid that
   great, vigorous man that he was, he had a bad liver. He was grievously
   afflicted in body in ways which I need not mention. And he was
   sometimes laid aside for months together, being so racked and tortured
   that he longed to die. His pains were extreme and we wonder how he
   endured them so well. But always, between the attacks of illness,
   Luther was up again preaching the Word of God. Those desperate
   struggles with the devil would have crushed him but for his faith. The
   devil seems to have been constantly assailing him and he was constantly
   assailing the devil.

   In that tremendous duel he fell back upon his Lord and, trusting in
   Omnipotence, he put Satan to rout. Young men, I pray that a Luther may
   spring up from your ranks. How gladly would the faithful welcome him!
   I, who am more a follower of Calvin than of Luther, and much more a
   follower of Jesus than of either of them, would be charmed to see
   another Luther upon this earth! God bless you, Brothers and Sisters,
   for Christ's sake. Amen.

Fathers In Christ

   (No. 1751)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 18, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I write unto you, fathers, because you have known Him that is from the
   beginning. Ihave written unto you, fathers, because you ha ve kno wn
   Him that is from the beginning." 1 John 2:13,14.

   OBSERVE the difference in the two verses--John first says, "I write,"
   and then, "I have written." When in two former discourses I preached
   upon the beloved Apostle's address to the young men and the children,
   [Sermon #1711--A Sermon to the Lord's Little Childrei and Sermon
   #1715--A Description of Young Men in Christ] I gave you as full an
   interpretation of this difference as I could command--and I need not,
   now, repeat it. Certain additional thoughts occur to me, which I will
   give you, that the matter may be still clearer. The Apostle John says,
   "I write," and, by-and-by, "I have written." This shows, I think, the
   importance of his subject. If he has already written upon it, he must
   think it to be a very necessary and valuable Truth of God if he writes
   upon it yet again.

   A man does not discourse repeatedly upon the same subject if he is a
   man full of matter, as this Inspired writer was, unless he feels that
   it is necessary that he returns, again and again, to his subject until
   he has impressed it upon the minds of his audience. Hence the Apostle
   is not ashamed to say, in effect--"I write this, though you need not
   remind me that I have written it before, for I feel it to be wise, so
   long as I am in this tabernacle, to put you in remembrance of what I
   have said unto you." Nails which are important to a structure must be
   driven in with diligence. Foundation stones should be laid with
   scrupulous care and Truths of God which are fundamental, should be
   repeated by the teacher till the disciple has learned it beyond all
   fear of ever forgetting it.

   This form of speech also reveals the unchanging conviction of the
   writer, who, having written once, is glad to write the same things
   again. This shows a mind made up and decided, from which proceeds
   consistent testimony. In these fickle times, certain of our public
   teachers must feel unable to say of any one subject, "I write," and, "I
   have written," for before the ink is dry they have need to blot out
   what they have put on paper and to write an amended version of their
   religious ideas! Scarcely for a month at a stretch do these loose
   thinkers abide in one place--they are such wandering stars that no
   chart could ever mark their position for three weeks together!

   They might say, "I write, but bless you, dear people, I do not know
   what I wrote six months ago. Very probably my former opinion is not,
   now, true, for all things are flowing on and my head is swimming with
   the rest. I am a man of progress--forever learning and never coming to
   the knowledge of the Truth of God! Blot out what I wrote a year ago and
   read with care what I write today." To which we reply--"Dear Sir, we
   cannot take much notice of what you write now, because, in all
   probability, in another week or two you will retract it all, or improve
   it from off the face of the earth! Neither shall we pay much attention
   to you, then, for you will probably be on the move as soon as ever you
   have said your say. We decline to learn what we shall have to unlearn!
   We will wait in our present knowledge until you have reached something
   certain for yourself. Perhaps in 20 years' time, when you have pitched
   your gypsy tent, it may be worth our while to hear where it is, but we
   do not commit ourselves even to that promise--for as the progress you
   are now making is into deeper darkness, you will probably end in
   sevenfold night."

   I rejoice, dear Friends, in the solidness of the Christian's faith! I
   know nothing of improvements and growths in the Gospel of the Lord
   Jesus, which is summed up in these words, "Jesus Christ the same
   yesterday, and today, and forever." I believe that God the Holy Spirit
   has given us, in the Scriptures, a perfect and entire Revelation which
   is to be received by all Christians without addition or diminution. I
   do not believe that Apostles, martyrs, confessors and teachers have
   been living for these 1,900 years upon lies--I prefer the faith of
   saints in Glory to the daydreams of those whippersnap-pers who nowadays
   claim to lead us by their "thought." Our mind is that of David when he
   said, "I hate vain thoughts."

   Well says the Scripture, "The Lord knows the thoughts of man, that they
   are vanity." If it is a question of thinking, we can think as well as
   they can--then our thoughts about the modern theology are full of
   sorrowful contempt.

   Perhaps the doctrine is new, though even this we doubt! But if it is
   new, it is not true, for the Truth of God must necessarily be as old as
   the everlasting hills! We observe that the word, "meditation," is now
   seldom used and, "thought," is the modern idol. Just so. We meditate on
   revealed Truths of God--this notion of "thought" sets aside the Truths
   of God and sets up mere fancy. We refuse to be of this vagrant party of
   thinkers! We are of the settled race of Believers. We can say what we
   have written, we still write. What we have preached, we still preach,
   for inasmuch as we have preached that which is revealed in Holy
   Scripture, to that Truth we stand and shall stand, God helping us. If
   we live a thousand years, at the close of life we shall have nothing
   more nor less to say than the fixed, Immutable, eternal Truth of God.
   We hope to understand the Truth better, but we shall never discover
   better Truth!

   "I write," and, "I have written," also indicate the abiding need of
   men--they require the same teaching from time to time. I suppose that
   John alludes to his Gospel when he says, "I have written," and now, a
   little later, he writes his Epistle and says, "I write"--giving, in
   each case, the same teaching. Men's natures are still the same; men's
   spiritual conflicts and dangers are still the same and, therefore, the
   same Truth of God is suitable, not only from day to day, but from
   century to century! There is but one food for soul hunger and but one
   help in spiritual danger. The true teacher always comes to men with the
   same Truths because men continue to have the same dangers, necessities,
   sorrows and hopes.

   The fathers who needed that John should previously write to them, still
   needed that he should write to them the same thing. Though they may
   have grown more fatherly, they have not outgrown Apostolic teaching.
   The former Truth is good for our latter days. Many years ago, when some
   of us were mere boys, we listened to the Gospel of Jesus and our heart
   leaped as we embraced it. It was the life and joy of our spirit and
   now, today, after having advanced far in the Divine Life, if we hear
   one of those simple sermons that first brought us to Christ concerning
   the precious blood of Jesus and child-like faith in Him, it suits us
   quite as well as in those early days!

   I have noticed with regard to well-grown Christian people, that when I
   have given a purely evangelical discourse, meant only for sinners and
   not at all designed for the edifying and comforting of full-aged
   saints, they have sucked it in with as much delight as if they were,
   themselves, newly converted! After all, though you and I are not now
   fed upon milk, yet a drink of milk is still most refreshing! Though we
   can now digest the solid meat of the Kingdom of God, yet the children's
   bread has lost none of its relish in our esteem. The Truths of God are
   still sweet to our hearts, yes, sweeter than they ever were! Though we
   have advanced to the higher courses of the edifice of holy knowledge,
   yet we never cease to look with intense delight upon those foundation
   Truths of God which concern our Lord Jesus. We cleave with full purpose
   of heart to Him of whom the Lord God has said, "Behold, I lay in Zion
   for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure
   foundation." Jesus remains to us, "elect, precious," and we know it
   will be so with us till life's last hour.

   From this text I am to preach principally to the fathers, but as the
   Church has not many fathers, I may be supposed to have a slender
   audience! But this is hardly so, since I hope and trust that the area
   of the sermon's influence will include young men, for you, my Brothers,
   aspire to reach the front rank and to be numbered among the fathers.
   Even to you who are little children, the text has its word of
   instruction, for you will be glad to hear what the fathers know, since
   you hope, before long, to know the same. The life of God is so much the
   same in all stages that the Word which is profitable to fathers has a
   use for babies--and that which is spoken to little children has a voice
   in it for young men. May God the Holy Spirit bless this Word of God to
   the hearts of all His people!

   Concerning the fathers, I am going to inquire three things this
   morning. First, who are they?--"You fathers." Secondly, what is their
   peculiar characteristic?--"You have known Him that is from the
   beginning." And, thirdly, what is the message to them?--"I have written
   unto you, fathers." What is it that John has written to fathers in the
   Church of

   God?

   I. First, WHO ARE THE FATHERS? We usually associate that idea somewhat
   with age, but we must take care that we do not make a mistake here,
   because age, in Grace, albeit that it may run parallel with age in
   nature in many cases, does not always do so. In the Church of God there
   are children who are 70 years old. Yes, little children displaying all
   the infirmities of declining years! It is not a pleasant sight to see
   gray-headed babies, yet I must confess I have seen such and I have even
   been glad that I could dare to go the length of hoping that they were
   babies in Christ! One would not like

   to say of a man of 80 that he had scarcely cut his wisdom teeth--and
   yet there are such--scarcely out of the nurse's arms at 60 years of
   age, needing just as much care and comfort as sucklings at the breast!

   On the other hand, there are fathers in the Church of God--wise,
   stable, instructed--who are comparatively young men. The Lord can cause
   His people to grow rapidly and far outstrip their years. David, as a
   lad, was more of a father in God than Eli in his old age. Growth in
   Grace is not a time growth. In eternal matters, years count for little.
   The Lord gives subtlety to the simple and to the young men knowledge
   and discretion. Solomon was wise while yet young--in some respects
   wiser than when he was old. Some youths have been like Joseph--men with
   God before they were men among men. Joseph, we are told in our
   translation, was more loved by Jacob than any of his brothers, "because
   he was the son of his old age." This can hardly be a correct rendering,
   for Benjamin, who was born 16 years later, was far more entitled to be
   called so.

   Another interpretation, which seems to me more correct, signifies that
   he was a son of the elders and implies that while he was a child, he
   was an associate of elderly persons and was, himself, so thoughtful,
   serious and well-instructed as to be an elderly child, a child-man,
   full of unusual wisdom and prudence. Josephs are still sent into the
   Church, now and then, and the Lord greatly blesses His people by their
   means. Oh, for more of them! From their early youth they have a
   discernment of God's Word and a quickness of apprehension wonderful to
   notice. More than that, I have even observed a depth of experience
   within a very short time granted to certain young Believers, so that
   though they were but youths in age, they were fathers in piety.

   Nevertheless, as a usual thing, it is to be expected that advancement
   in Grace should be accompanied with advancement in years. And it is so
   often so that we are known to call those who are fit to look after the
   souls of others ,"the elders of the Church," not necessarily because
   they are old men, but because they are instructed in the things of God.
   These are the fathers, then--men who have aged in Grace, have come to
   the full development of their spiritual manhood--and have been
   confirmed in that development by the test of time and trials.
   Believers, when they have, in the course of years, shown themselves
   able both to labor and to suffer, are fitly ranked among fathers.

   Why do we call the early writers the fathers of the Church? Not, I
   think, because we owe more to their teaching than to those of a later
   period, but because they were the first men, the pioneers, the
   vanguard--and so the fathers of the Church. The first and earliest
   members of a Church will become fathers, in due time, if they continue
   in the faith, grounded and settled. Their years of persevering holiness
   entitle them to respect. Paul mentions with honor, certain persons,
   saying, "Who also were in Christ before me." There is an honor in
   having been a soldier of Christ for a long time. It was no small praise
   of His disciples when Jesus said of them, "You have been with Me from
   the beginning."

   With the idea of fathers, we so far associate that of age that we hope
   and expect that Believers who have been in Christ, long, have well
   learned their lesson and have come to a fullness of growth in the
   things of God. Judge, Christian Brothers, whether you can rank
   yourselves among the fathers. And if you are not able to do so, yet
   press onward towards it. I boldly say that in this Church there is a
   larger proportion of this class of Christians than I have ever seen
   elsewhere, and for this I thank God with all my heart, for they are of
   the utmost service to our host.

   "Fathers," again, are persons of maturity, men who are not raw and
   green--not fresh recruits, unaccustomed to march or fight--but old
   legionaries who have used their swords on others and are, themselves,
   scarred with wounds received in conflict. These men know what they
   know, for they have thought over the Gospel, studied it, considered it
   and, having so considered it, have embraced it with full intensity of
   conviction! Usually we mean by, "fathers," men who have become
   developed in Grace, mature in character, decided in conviction, clear
   in statement and accurate in judgment. These can discern between things
   that differ and are not deceived by the philosophies which allure the
   ignorant. They know the voice of the Shepherd--and a stranger they will
   not follow.

   The younger folk may be bewitched so that they do not obey the Truth of
   God, but these are not fascinated by error. New converts, in their
   difficulties, resort to these fathers, for doubts which bewilder the
   beginner are simplicity itself to those who are taught of the Lord.
   These are the watchmen on the walls who detect where insidious doubt is
   creeping in, where deadly error under the guise of the Truth of God is
   undermining the faith of the Church--to that end the Lord has
   instructed them and given them to have their senses exercised to
   discern between good and evil. Among them are men who have
   understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do. If you are
   such fathers, dear Brothers, I rejoice in

   you! If you are not such as yet, aspire to this eminence and pray the
   Lord that you may not be long before you arrive at the ripeness and
   sweetness which belong to mellow Christians who are prepared for the
   great ingathering!

   "Fathers," again, are men of stability and strength. If burglars are
   planning to attack a house, they care little about the children and
   make small account of the boys. But if fatherly men are about, the
   thieves are not eager for an encounter. Even thus, the arch-deceiver
   has hope of injuring the Church by deceiving the little children and
   the young men, but the stalwart men of God, who walk in the midst of
   the household, looked up to by everybody, are not so readily blown to
   and fro. As the Spartans pointed to their citizens as the real walls of
   Sparta, so do we point to these substantial men as, under God, the
   bronze walls and bulwarks of the Church!

   Men who are well taught, confirmed, experienced and trained by the
   Spirit of God are pillars in the house of our God. It may be said of
   each of them, "He keeps himself so that the Evil One touches him not."
   These are men who know how to wear the armor which God has provided and
   to use the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. These are men
   of strong faith and convictions; men of decision and courage; men of
   prudent action, in no hurry through fear and under no excitement
   through false hope. These are not men that retract, or shuffle, or
   evade--but witnesses who are faithful and true--imparting confidence to
   the feebler sort by their calm defiance of the foe. Oh, that all
   Christians would grow into such solid saints!

   Many light, frothy, chaffy minds come into the Church and give us
   untold trouble to keep them right--and infinitely more trouble because
   they will not be kept right! Oh, for more men of such a sort that if
   the whole world went wrong they would still abide by the right! Men who
   cannot be carried away by superstition let it adorn itself with all the
   beauties of art! Men who cannot be borne down by skepticism--let it
   flaunt all the pomp of its pretended culture and wisdom! These fathers
   know and are sure. They have learned to be, on their own accounts,
   determined and unyielding, for they will not stir beyond, "It is
   written," nor tempt eternal ruin by building upon the shifting
   quicksand of the hour!

   At this moment there is large need for an army of invincibles. Be you
   steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. But
   there is something more than this in Christian fatherhood. The fathers
   of the Church are men of heart who naturally care for the souls of
   others. It is upon the father that the weight of the household
   falls--he goes forth in the morning to his daily labor and he returns
   at night with the fruit of his toil for the support of the household.
   It is not for himself that he lives, but for that dear family which is
   gathered about him. He is not wholly comprised within his own personal
   self, for he lives in all the house--he lives especially in his
   children. Their suffering or their need would be his suffering and his
   need.

   His heart has grown larger than when he was a child or a young man, for
   now his heart beats in all that household of which he is the life. It
   is a grand thing when Christian men and Christian women come to this,
   that they are not perpetually thinking of their own salvation and of
   their own souls being fed under the ministry, but they care most of all
   for those who are weak and feeble in the Church! During a service,
   their thoughts go out for those assembled. They are anxious as to how
   that stranger may be impressed by the sermon; how yonder anxious spirit
   may be comforted; how a backsliding Brother may be restored; how one
   who is growing somewhat cold may be revived. This paternal care
   betokens a true father in the Church! May the Lord multiply among us
   those who feel it to be their lifework to feed the flock of Christ.

   Having this care upon him, the father comes to be tender. He partakes
   somewhat of the tenderness of a mother and thus is called a nursing
   father. A true father, such as fathers should be, has a tender love for
   all the little ones. He would not hurt them. Nothing would be more
   painful to him than to grieve them--on the contrary, he studies to give
   them pleasure and lays himself out for their good. It is a great
   blessing to the Church, when the leading spirits are loving--not rough
   and uncouth, domineering or hectoring, but gentle and Christ-like! Oh,
   my Brothers who take the lead, let us bear and forbear, and put up with
   a thousand trying things from our Master's children whom He has
   committed to our care! Let us make ourselves the servants of all! Is
   not the father the laborer for the children? Does he not lay up for
   them? Is not his superiority best seen by his doing more for the family
   than anybody else?

   This is how Christians grow great, by making themselves greatly useful
   to others! If you are the slave of all, willing to do anything so that
   you can but help them and make them happy and holy--this is to be a
   father in the Church of God! Sympathetic care and hearty tenderness are
   gifts of the Holy Spirit and will bring you a happiness which will
   richly compensate you for your pains. Not yet have I quite reached the
   full meaning of a father, for the father is the author, un-

   der God, of the being of his children--and happy is a Church that has
   many in it who are spiritual parents in Zion, through having brought
   sinners to Christ! Happy are the men by whose words, acts, spirit,
   prayers and tears, some have been begotten unto God through Jesus
   Christ our Lord!

   What an honor it is to be such a father! Some of us have been filled
   with this joy till it has well-near broken our hearts even to think of
   it, for the Lord has fulfilled to us the promise which He made to
   Abraham when He bade him lift up his eyes to the stars and said, "So
   shall your seed be." This cannot fall to the lot of all, but in the
   Church of God every man and woman should pray that he may not be barren
   or unfruitful. May we all be soul-winners! Not the minister alone--not
   the Sunday school teachers alone--but each one without exception! Why
   should not each saint bring someone to the Lord Jesus? At least, by our
   united prayers and godly living, by our united testimony and fidelity,
   let us labor for the increase of Messiah's kingdom! I hardly think we
   can put anyone among the fathers until he has won some heart for Jesus.

   Thus have I described the fathers. They are never very numerous--they
   are never so numerous as they ought to be. Paul says, "Yet have you not
   many fathers." But wherever they are, they are the strength of the
   Church. I have seen in the army a number of veterans marching in
   front--an ornament and an honor to the whole company. Your
   short-service men come and go, but these tried men stick to the colors
   and are the backbone of the regiment. If a tough bit of fighting has to
   be done, you must rely upon such as these. Like Napoleon's Old Guard,
   they cannot be shaken or driven back-- the smell of gunpowder does not
   alarm them, nor the whistling of the shot, nor the roar of the
   artillery--they have seen such things before. They can also bide their
   time and wait, which is a great thing in a soldier. And when at last
   they are bid to charge, they leap like lions on their prey and the
   enemy is driven before them.

   Such men we have in the Church of God and such we need--men that are
   not flattered by opposition, nor made to lose their heads by
   excitement. They believe in God and if others doubt, they are not
   infected by their folly. They know! They are certain! They have put
   their feet down and will not move from their persuasion. When the time
   comes for action, they are ready for it and throw their whole weight so
   heartily into the war that every charge advances! God send us more
   regiments of these in this evil day and preserve to us such as we have!

   II. Secondly. WHAT IS THE PROMINENT CHARACTERISTIC OF A FATHER IN
   CHRIST? Read the text. "I

   write unto you, fathers, because you have known Him that is from the
   beginning." He repeats the expression without alteration. Observe,
   here, the concentration of their knowledge. Twice he says "You have
   known Him that is from the beginning." Now, a babe in Grace knows 20
   things--a young man in Christ knows 10 things--but a father in Christ
   knows one thing and that one thing he knows thoroughly! It is very
   natural for us, at first, to divide our little stream into many
   rivulets, but as we grow gray in Grace, we pour it all into one
   channel--and then it runs with a force efficient for our lifework. I
   trust I know many doctrines, many precepts and many teachings--but more
   and more my knowledge gathers about my Lord even as the bees swarm
   around their queen!

   May it come to this with us all--"I determined not to know anything
   among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified." May all our knowledge
   be focused as with a burning glass upon this one point! May the
   adorable Person of Him that was from the beginning fill the entire
   horizon of our thought! Oh, to have one heart, one eye, for our one
   Lord and for Him alone! Note, next, the peculiarity of their knowledge
   as to its objective--they know "Him that was from the beginning." Do
   not the babes in Christ know the Lord Jesus? Yes, they do, but they do
   not know Him in His full Character. They know Him as having forgiven
   their sins, and that is much, but it is not all. Yonder is the blessed
   Christ and I, a poor sinner, look to Him just as He comes to me--and I
   am lightened and become one of His little children.

   Yes, and as I grow and become a young man, I approach nearer to Jesus
   and get another view of Him, for I overcome the Wicked One even as He
   did! And thus I stand side by side with Him in the conflict. But if I
   come to be a father, I enter into fellowship with the great Father,
   Himself, for it is union with God the Father that makes a man a father
   in God! Then do we, as it were, not only look toward Jesus as coming to
   save, but we look on Christ from the Father's point of view. The sinner
   sees Jesus coming to him, but the Father sees Jesus as sent from Him.
   When we grow in Grace we, in our measure, see Jesus from God's point of
   view--that is to say, we see Him as "Him that was from the beginning,"
   and in due time was manifested to take away sin.

   "These are ancient things," says one. Just so, but fathers are also
   ancient men--and the deep things of God are suitable to them. Believers
   see Christ in a fashion similar to their own. I scarcely need allude to
   that which I have often men-

   tioned to you, that every man in the Old Testament who saw the Lord saw
   Him in a character like his own. Abraham, the pilgrim, saw Christ as a
   pilgrim. Jacob, the struggler, saw the Covenant Angel wrestling with
   him through the night. Moses, the representative of a people tried as
   by fire and yet continuing, saw the Lord as a burning bush. Joshua, the
   valiant warrior, saw the Captain of the Lord's host as a man with a
   sword drawn in His hand. The three holy children saw the Son of God in
   the fiery furnace, even as they were, themselves. When you become a
   father in Christ, you see Christ from the Father's point of view--not
   as newly come to save--but as, "from the beginning" the Savior of men!

   The father in Grace rejoices to behold the Lord Jesus as God. He
   beholds the glory of His adorable Person as forever with the Father
   before the earth was. He knows that without Him was not anything made
   that was made and, therefore, beholds Him as fashioning everything upon
   the anvil of His power. He knows that "His goings forth were of old,
   from everlasting," and he delights to see Him planning the salvation of
   His chosen in the beginning. A glorious sight it is! The grown Believer
   meditates upon the Covenant--the settlements of Grace in the old
   eternity. Poor babes in Christ are frequently stumbled by the
   mysterious Truths of God--high doctrine they call it. But when a man
   grows to be a father, he loves Covenant Truth and feeds on it.

   It is one mark of advanced Grace that the sublime Truths which concern
   eternity are increasingly valued. In gracious maturity the Christian
   sees the blessed Persons of the Divine Trinity entering into a compact
   for the salvation of men. And he sees the Son of God, Himself, from the
   beginning acting as the Representative of His elect and taking upon
   Himself to answer on their behalf to the Father. He sees the Eternal
   Son then and there becoming the Sponsor and the Surety for His chosen,
   engaging to pay their debt and make recompense to the injured Justice
   of God on account of their sins. He sees that Covenant even from of old
   ordered in all things and sure in the hands of Him that was from the
   beginning!

   There is one point that the father in Christ delights to think upon,
   namely, that the coming of Christ into the world was not an expedient
   adopted after an unavoidable and unforeseen disaster in order to
   retrieve the honor of God! He understands that the whole scheme of
   events was planned in the purpose of Divine Wisdom for the glorifying
   of Christ, so that from the beginning it was part of Jehovah's plan
   that Jesus should take upon Himself human nature and should manifest,
   in that Nature, all the attributes of the Father! It was the original
   plan that the Incarnate God should reveal infinite Grace and boundless
   love by laying down His life for sinners, "the Just for the unjust,
   that He might bring us to

   God."

   The Only-begotten Son is not introduced into the Divine economy as an
   afterthought--the whole arrangement is shaped with an eye to Him who
   was before all things and for whom all things were created. It pleased
   the Father that He should lift up creation by uniting the creature and
   the Creator in one Person and that He should ennoble our nature, which
   is a combination of the spiritual and the material, by assuming a body
   and bearing that body to the Throne of God. O matchless plan, by which
   the redeemed are ennobled and God, Himself, is glorified! Oh, fathers,
   if you have ever seen this, I know that you will say, "The preacher
   does not describe the half of it!" No, I do not--I wish that I could--
   but neither time nor ability are present with me. Still, I delight in
   the everlasting glories of the Lord Jesus who was from the beginning.

   Greatly dear to my own heart are the "chief things of the ancient
   mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills." I believe
   in my Lord Jesus Christ as second to none, but as the King and Lord
   from the beginning, who, though He was despised and rejected of men,
   yet still is God over all, blessed forever, and will be so forever and
   ever! Though "the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing,"
   Jehovah has set His Son as King upon His holy hill of Zion--and God's
   decree shall stand! He that is Alpha shall be Omega--He that is from
   the beginning shall be to the end, King of kings and Lord of lords! My
   heart cries, "Hallelujah!" Oh, you fathers, cry "Hallelujah" with me!

   Yes, but I need to notice, again, that this knowledge is, in itself,
   special. The knowledge, itself, is remarkable as well as the Object of
   the knowledge. "You have known Him." A dear servant of Christ on this
   platform, the other evening, sat beside me. He belonged to quite
   another part of the Church of Christ, but he said to me, of
   such-and-such a person, "You know, dear Brother, he is one that knows
   the Lord. He is not merely a Christian, but he knows our Lord--you and
   I know what that means, do we not?" I could only look at him with a
   deep look of loving appreciation. Yes, we do know the Lord as a living,
   bright reality! A daily Friend, Counselor and Companion.

   True fathers in Grace meditate upon Christ. They feed upon Scripture,
   press the juice of it and inwardly enjoy the flavor of it. People say
   they have a sweet tooth. It is a good thing to have a sweet tooth for
   the Lord Jesus Christ! They

   not only know the Lord by much meditation upon Him, but they know Him
   by actual communion--they walk with Him, they talk with Him! Such
   saints are more with Christ than with anyone else--to no one do they
   tell so much as they have told Him--and no one has ever told them as
   much as Jesus tells them, for "the secret of the Lord is with them that
   fear Him; and He will show them His Covenant." Ask them, "Who is your
   dearest friend?" and they will reply, "The Well-Beloved is my next of
   kin, my dearest companion."

   They know the Lord by communion and they have come to know Him, now, by
   having an intense sympathy with Him. They feel as Jesus does about
   matters and so they know Him. His tender pity for sinners stirs their
   hearts, not in the same degree, but yet in like manner according to
   their measure. They often feel as if they could die for sinners. One of
   these fathers said, "I could wish myself accursed from Christ, for my
   brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh." They look upon matters
   not from man's standpoint, but from Christ's point of view and,
   therefore, they understand much of the Lord's ways which, before, were
   dark to them. He who very deeply sympathizes with a man knows him well.

   Learning by faith to sit still and believingly wait on the event, these
   fathers calmly expect that all things will work together for good to
   them and, therefore, they understand the unbroken serenity of the heart
   of Jesus and know Him in His joys as well as in His sorrows. Such
   saints know what it is to weep over the city with Jesus and to rejoice
   over returning sinners with the Good Shepherd! Yes, they know what it
   is to sit down with Him on His Throne, waiting till His enemies are
   made His footstool. They are calm with Jesus, for they have drunk in
   the meaning of the text, "He must reign." Yes, He must reign! He must
   reign till all His enemies shall be under His feet! This knowing Him
   that is from the beginning is the chief characteristic of the father in
   Christ.

   III. Thirdly, dear Friends, WHAT IS THE MESSAGE TO THE FATHERS? I would
   indicate that message very

   briefly by referring you to the context. John has been saying to you,
   dear fathers, and indeed to all of us who are in Christ, that we should
   love one another. If you are truly fathers, you cannot help loving all
   the family--the fatherly instinct is love--and fathers in Christ should
   be full to the brim with it. Little ones should be induced, by our
   loving spirit, to come around us, feeling that if nobody else loves
   them, we do; if nobody else cares for them, we do. I have known a
   father in Christ to whom a convert would speak much more readily than
   he would to his own earthly father or mother. I suppose they see an
   invitation in the faces of these fathers. I do not quite know how they
   discover it, but somehow converts feel that such an one is a man whom
   they could address, or a woman whom they could talk with.

   These fathers and mothers in Israel are full of love and their speech
   betrays the fact. I know some men who are like great harbors for
   ships--a soul tossed with tempest makes for them as for a harbor!
   Breaking hearts say, "Oh, that I could tell him my troubles and get his
   prayers." May you and I be just such persons and may the Holy Spirit
   use us for the good of our fellows. The next message immediately
   succeeds the text--"Love not the world, neither the things that are in
   the world." Oh, dear fathers, you must not love the world, for it
   passes away--and this is specially true of you! If any Christian man
   might love the world--and I hope none will do so--certainly the fathers
   may not! You know so much of Christ that you may well despise the
   world--and you are so soon going Home so that you ought to set little
   store by these fleeting things.

   You have all the marks of what they call declining years--I call them
   ascending years--you will soon be gone from the world and its changing
   vanities, therefore do not set your love on earthly treasures. Hold
   wealth with a loose hand! Be ready to depart, for depart you soon will.
   Before the morning watch, you may be gone to your Father's House on
   high! "Love not the world." Another duty of fathers is also mentioned
   here. While they are not to love the world, they must take care that
   they do not fall victims to any of the lusts of this present evil
   world, such as the lust of the flesh. Can fathers ever fall that way?
   Ah me, we have to speak very solemnly and admit that the most advanced
   saint still needs to be warned against the lust of the flesh, the
   indulgence of appetites which so readily lead men to sin.

   Then there is the lust of the eyes. David fell into that when he
   repined because of the prosperity of the wicked. He was obliged to
   confess, "So foolish was I, and ignorant." He looked at the prosperous
   wicked till he began to fret about them. That lust of the eyes, in
   desiring more for yourself and envying those that have more--never let
   it happen to a father! And the pride of life--that thirsting to be
   thought respectable, that emulation of others, that struggling after
   honor and such like--this must not be in a father! You are men and must
   put away childish things. My dear and honored Brothers, fall not prey
   to vanities--these toys are for the children of the world--not for you
   who are so near to the

   Glory of the Lord! You are grown ripe in Grace and will soon enter
   Heaven--live accordingly. Let all earthly things be like babies'
   baubles beneath your feet while you rise to the manhood of your soul.

   The next exhortation to the fathers is that they should watch, for,
   says the Apostle, "You have heard that antichrist shall come, even now
   are there many antichrists." Oh, valiant fathers, keep watch and ward!
   I marvel that members of Churches agree to the choice of ministers who
   are not sound in the faith, no, who do not seem to have any faith at
   all! Why is this? We used to have, in our Baptist Churches, substantial
   men who would as soon have entertained Satan at their own table as an
   unsound preacher in the pulpit! There used to be a company in the north
   of Scotland called, "The Men." Why, if heresy had been preached before
   them, they would have been as provoked as Janet Geddes when she threw
   her milking stool at the head of the preacher! They would not have
   endured these modern heresies as the present effeminate generation is
   enduring them! Let the new theologians have liberty to preach what they
   like on their own ground, but not in our pulpits!

   Alas, the leading members in many Churches are Christians without
   backbones! I would call them slimy, spongy snails--only they have not
   the consistency of a snail's shell! They are ready to swallow any
   mortal thing if the preacher seems clever and eloquent. Cleverness and
   eloquence--away with them forever! If it is not the Truth of God, the
   more cleverly and eloquently it is preached the more damnable it is! We
   must have the Truth of God and nothing but the Truth of God and I
   charge the fathers in Christ all over England and America to see to
   this! Get to your watchtower and guard the flock, lest the sheep be
   destroyed while they are asleep!

   Lastly, it is the duty of the fathers to prepare for the coming of the
   Lord. How beautifully it is put in the 28th verse-- "Abide in Him; that
   when He shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before
   Him at His coming." It is addressed to you all, for you are all little
   children, but it is specially incumbent upon those of you who are
   fathers. Awaken all your faculties! Watch for the coming of the Lord
   and keep your loins well girded! Jesus may come today-- this Lord's Day
   may be the last Sabbath of this dispensation! Yet He may not come for
   10,000 years for all we know!

   Therefore weary not if you wait through a long night. Say not that He
   delays His coming, for He will return at the day appointed. Only let us
   hold fast that which we have received and stand waiting for the
   midnight cry. He will come! He will not tarry--therefore go forth to
   meet Him--

   "Hold the fort, for I am coming, Jesus signals still! Wave the answer
   back to Hea ven, By Your Grace we will."

   Amen.

Mourners, Inquirers, Covenanters

   (No. 1752)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 25, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "In those days and in that time, says the LORD, the children of Israel
   shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping:
   they shall go and seek the LORD their God. They shall ask the way to
   Zion with their faces toward it, saying, Come, and let usjoin ourselves
   to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten."
   Jeremiah 50:4.

   THE previous part of this chapter declares the overthrow of Israel's
   cruel oppressor--"Babylon is taken, Bel is ashamed, Merodach is broken
   in pieces." The Assyrian and Babylonian power had been the great tyrant
   of the ages and the Lord had employed it for the chastening of His
   people, until, at last, Israel and Judah had been carried away captive
   to the banks of the Euphrates and the land of their fathers knew them
   no more. This was the mournful song of the exiles, "By the rivers of
   Babylon, there we sat down, yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion."
   What a turn would come! In the day when God would reckon with Babylon
   and punish the haughty people for their cruelties and oppressions, then
   should Israel and Judah come to their own again.

   "In those days, and in that time," there would be hope for the
   downtrodden--the Lord would keep His appointments of Grace to the hour
   and, at the determined time, Israel would be free. "Surely the least of
   the flock would draw out the enemy" and escape from his power. God
   devises means for bringing back His banished ones and among those ways
   we usually see the overthrow of their conquerors. When, therefore, the
   Lord deals with Babylon in a way of vengeance it is that He may deliver
   His own people. See how the two things are joined together in the 18th
   and 19th verses-- "Therefore thus says the Lord of Hosts, the God of
   Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I
   have punished the king of Assyria. And I will bring Israel again to his
   habitation and he shall feed on Carmel and Ba-shan, and his soul shall
   be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead."

   When Pharaoh is drowned, Israel is saved! When Sihon and Og are slain,
   the Lord's mercy to His people is seen to endure forever! The
   destruction of Amalek is the salvation of Jacob and the overthrow of
   Babylon is the restoration of Jerusalem! It was a very amazing thing
   that a nation so crushed and scattered as the Jews were, should come
   back from captivity--it was a very marvelous instance of Divine power
   and faithfulness, as it is written--"For Israel has not been forsaken,
   nor Judah of his God, of the Lord of Hosts; though their land was
   filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel."

   I will not talk much with you concerning the Chaldeans and the Jews,
   but I would speak concerning ourselves. We, too, by nature are in
   banishment, far off from our God and the abode of His Glory. We are not
   what we ought to have been, for the Lord did not make us to be sinners,
   but to be His happy and obedient creatures. Our present lost estate is
   not our true state. We are banished through coming under the power of
   our great adversary. Sin has carried us into captivity and we are in
   the far country, away from the great Father's house. It is a great
   blessing when the times come--and they have come--when there is an
   opportunity and an invitation to return. Today the power of the
   adversary is broken and we may flee out of the Babylon of sin. A
   greater than Cyrus has opened the two-leaved gates, broken the bars of
   iron in sunder and proclaimed liberty to the captives! We may now
   return to our God and freely enjoy the holy and happy associations
   which belong to the City of our God.

   At such times, when the Lord is leading men to seek His face, questions
   arise, anxieties abound and difficulties multiply. The lost tribes
   could not come back from Babylon by merely thinking of it--the way was
   long and dangerous, the paths were unknown and difficult--and they who
   came back to Zion found the journey to be no promenade of pleasure or
   parade of pomp. It is so with the Lord's banished when He gives them a
   heart and a will to return to Him--they are

   not, therefore, restored to the Father's house at once--they may have
   to persevere through months of weary pilgrimage before they come to
   their desired abode. As I have said, returning times are anxious times.
   Men wander thoughtlessly, but they do not return without grave thought
   and serious consideration. I earnestly desire to be the means in the
   hand of God of answering questions, removing fears and clearing the way
   for those who have begun to seek the Lord. They mourn and I wish to
   comfort them. They ask the way and I would gladly direct them. They
   long to join themselves unto the Lord and I would, by His Grace, help
   them.

   Last Lord's-Day morning was given to the fathers of the Church. Let
   this be given to the beginners in the Divine Life. May the Holy Spirit
   give us thoughts and words which may lead the seeker into the way of
   peace. Everyone who is really seeking the Lord desires to be sure that
   he is seeking aright. He is not willing to take anything for granted,
   since his soul is of too much value to be left in danger. He does not
   even believe in his own judgment of himself, but when he thinks his
   face is towards Zion, he still asks the way. He inquires, "Are my
   feelings like those of the truly penitent? Am I believing as those do
   who are justified by faith? Am I seeking the Lord in a manner which
   will be pleasing to Him?" They have so long been as lost sheep, going
   from mountain to hill, that they have forgotten their resting places
   and, therefore, in their confusion they are afraid of going wrong
   again--and so they inquire with eager anxiety.

   Perhaps we may show them from this Scripture how others sought and how
   others found--and this may be a guide and a comfort to them--for
   although there are differences of operation and all do not come to
   Christ with equal terrors, or with equal joys--yet there is a likeness
   in all the pilgrims to the Holy City. "As in water, face answers to
   face, so the heart of man to man." The experience of God's people in
   its root principles is always the same. All coming sinners endure
   similar griefs and pass through similar struggles--the same desires,
   the same fears, the same hopes and, by-and-by, the same realizations
   are to be found in all those who seek the Lord their God.

   Looking carefully at the text, we perceive that those who came back to
   Zion by God's gracious leadership were first, mourners; secondly,
   inquirers and thirdly, covenanters, for they ended by joining
   themselves unto the Lord in a perpetual covenant.

   I. To begin at the beginning, the Lord's restored ones, during the
   processes of Grace, were first of all MOURNERS--"In those days, and in
   that time, says the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and
   the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and
   seek the Lord their God." Oh, my Hearer, after all your sins, I will
   not believe that you are truly coming to God if there is not about you
   a great sorrow for sin and a lamenting after the Lord! Some seekers are
   made to drink of this bitter cup very deeply; the wine of astonishment
   is long kept to their lips; their sense of sin is terrible--even to
   anguish and agony!

   I know that there are others who do not taste this bitterness to the
   same degree. It is in their cup, but for all that, the sweet love of
   Christ is revealed to them so soon and so fully that the healthful
   wormwood of penitence is veiled beneath the exceeding sweetness of
   gracious pardon. The clear shining in their case so soon follows the
   rain that they scarcely know that there has been a shower of grief!
   Surely, in their case the bitterness is passed, but is it truly there
   even though the other ingredient of intense delight in God's mercy
   swallows up all its sharpness.

   Oh, Friends, you cannot imagine the Jews returning from captivity
   without bewailing the sins which drove them into the place of their
   exile! How could they be restored to God if they did not lament their
   former wicked estrangement? Shall the Lord press to His bosom an
   impenitent transgressor? How can there be peace to an offender as long
   as his offenses are not repented of? While the heart feels no
   compunction concerning its wanderings, no mourning over its guilt, no
   grief at having grieved the Lord, there can be no acceptance with God!
   There must be a shower in the day of mercy-- not always a long driving
   rain causing a flood--but the soft drops must fall in every case.

   There must be tenderness toward God if we expect reconciliation with
   God. The heart must cry, "How could I have sinned against so good a
   Lord! How could I have stood out against His love! How could I have
   refused my Savior and His abounding Grace! My God, forgive me!" These
   confessions, if truly made, cannot be spoken without sighs and sorrows.
   The multitudes of our sins cannot be thought of without a moving of the
   soul and a measure of heartbreak. Is it not written, "They shall look
   on Him whom they have pierced, and shall mourn for Him, and be in
   bitterness as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn"? A look at
   Christ gives life, but it also produces the tokens of that life, among
   which we find godly sorrow which works true and sincere repentance.
   Even a sense of pardon does not exclude this holy mourning--on the
   contrary, it increases it. The more certain we are that we are
   forgiven, the more do we loathe the sin which caused the

   Savior to bleed and die. The more sure we are of the Divine favor, the
   more intensely do we regret the fact of our having been enemies to the
   infinitely gracious God. Of all the ransomed it is written, "They shall
   come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them."

   Observe that this mourning in the case of Israel and Judah was so
   strong that it mastered other feelings. Between Judah and Israel there
   was an old feud. They were brethren and it ought not to have been so,
   but they had become bitter adversaries of each other. Yet now that they
   return to the Lord, we read, "The children of Israel shall come, they
   and the children of Judah together." O happy union in a common search
   for God! One of the first results of holy sorrow for sin is to cast out
   of our heart all forms of enmity and strife with our fellow men. When
   we are reconciled to God we are reconciled to men! I have seen those
   who had been fired with mutual hatred, loving each other when they have
   been alike under the power of the Spirit of God and bowed down with
   contrition! I am sure if you were to go forward as a sincere inquirer
   to ask the way to Heaven, if you met your worst enemy at the door and
   he said to you, "I am seeking mercy of God for my transgressions," you
   would grasp each other's hands and weep together.

   If a man, professing to be a penitent, drew back at the sight of
   another who also came penitently to Christ, and said, "I can have
   nothing to do with him," I should unhesitatingly declare him to be a
   hypocrite! And even if he were sincere, I should have to tell him that
   to a certainty the Lord could not and would not accept his repentance
   or grant him peace. If you will not forgive your brother, how shall God
   forgive you? Do you pray, "Forgive us our trespasses," if you cannot
   forgive your brother his trespasses? A penitent sense of our own
   provocations of God will prevent our being provoked with men. As
   Aaron's rod swallowed up all other rods, so a sincere sorrow for sin
   will remove all readiness to take offense against our fellow sinners.
   In the secret chambers of their souls the truly penitent say,
   "Everything that I have against any man is gone, now, for I remember
   nothing but that I have offended against my God. If the Lord will
   forgive my wrong, everything I have had to bear from others shall be as
   the small dust of the balance, not worthy to be considered or thought
   of in the day of Infinite Grace."

   I am trying to preach that I may help you who are seeking the Lord to
   discover whether you are coming in the right way. This shall be one
   simple test to you--you cannot be coming home to your Father unless
   there is some degree of mourning for sin, some smiting upon the breast,
   some bemoaning of yourself because of your iniquities. And again, for
   certain, you cannot be coming to the Lord aright unless there is a
   blotting out altogether from your heart of every offense that every man
   may have committed against you in past times. Judah and Israel, when
   the Lord has mercy on them, forget their enmity and recognize the
   brotherhood which they ought never to have forgotten! If I am speaking
   to any who are seeking the Lord, but seem to make small progress to His
   Light, I entreat them to inquire whether sins of enmity and wrath may
   not be lying at the door and blocking the way of Grace. Hasten to
   forgive freely, fully, heartily--and then pray, "Forgive us our
   trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us." A family
   disagreement may seem to be a little thing, but it may be holding many
   in the deadly bonds of the Evil One. Be reconciled to your brother, or
   you cannot be reconciled to your God!

   Keeping close to the text, we notice, again, that the exiles on their
   return were mourning while marching. Observe the words--"going and
   weeping." We might have thought, perhaps, that when they began to go to
   their God, so much Light of God would break in upon them that they
   would cease to weep--but no, it is, "going and weeping." A true heart
   that is coming to God takes the road by Weeping-Cross--it feels its
   sin, its guilt, its unworthiness and it, therefore, mourns. The closet
   is sought out and prayer is offered, but in the supplication there is a
   dove's note, a moaning as of one sorrowing for love. When the prayer is
   over, there is dissatisfaction with the prayer, a smiting on the
   breast, as much as to say, "I pray but coldly compared with the way in
   which I ought to pray. I look not to Christ as I ought, but look half
   askance, I fear, at something else besides the Cross."

   An honestly believing soul is fearful lest it should be mistaken in its
   faith. A truly praying heart is jealous of its own prayer, lest it
   should ask amiss. Probably no prayer is more sincere than that which is
   followed by deep regret that it is not more fervent--in the fact that
   the pleader is dissatisfied with his cry lies a proof that the Lord is
   satisfied with it! Our humility is the watermark which proves our
   prayer to be genuine. If we think well of our prayers and imagine that
   we have almost a right to be heard, we shall make a fruitless visit to
   the Mercy Seat. We may not claim of God as a matter of justice those
   gifts which are pure gifts of mercy. The Lord had no respect unto Cain
   and his sacrifice because there was no reference to sin, no type of
   atonement, no confession of guilt in that which he presented. Publicans
   confessing sin are jus-

   tified rather than self-satisfied Pharisees. When a sense of sin leads
   to prayer, the prayer itself appears to be another cause for repentance
   because of the sin which mingles with it.

   He who feels a humbling sorrow while he seeks his God is coming aright.
   Now the seeker opens his Bible and sits down to read the promise. And
   as he reads, he thinks what great mercy there is in it, but he adds,
   "Alas, how evil has been my life, since I have grieved the Lord of
   Love." Then the tears flow like the water which gushed from the smitten
   Rock, for as the Believer sees that pardon is real and that it is meant
   for him, he is all the more melted down with penitential sorrow. This
   is his song--

   "Your mercy is more than a match for my heart, Which wonders to feel
   its own hardness depart. Dissolved by Your goodness, I fall to the
   ground And weep to the praise of the mercy I've found." Having grasped
   the promise and having looked to Christ and seen himself forgiven, the
   sincere soul continues to draw nearer and nearer to his God--and yet
   all the while he is filled with self-accusations and humility on
   account of sin. While he cries, "Blessed be the God of my salvation who
   has delivered me from my iniquities," he also mourns within himself,
   exclaiming, "Alas, that I should have so transgressed and grieved His
   Holy Spirit! I am ashamed at having rejected such wondrous love!" Thus,
   "Going and mourning" depict a gracious blending of activity and
   repentance.

   Turning the text around, we read not only of "going and weeping," but
   also of weeping and going. The holy grief here intended does not lead
   to sitting still, for it is added, "they shall go." That word,
   "weeping," is sandwiched in between two goings--"going and weeping:
   they shall go, and seek the Lord." To sit down and say, "I will sorrow
   for my sin, but never seek a Savior," is an impenitent pretense of
   repentance--a barren sorrow which brings forth no cleansing of the life
   and no diligent search after the Lord. Such a sorrow is the first
   dropping of that dread shower of remorse which will fall upon the soul
   forever. Remorse is the never-dying worm and the unquenchable fire. No
   doubt, all that are now lost lament that they have brought themselves
   into such a ruin, but that lamentation is no evidence of reconciliation
   with God--many have a kind of repentance for having brought themselves
   into a condemned condition--but this is not genuine repentance if it
   stands alone.

   When the prodigal cries, "I will arise and go to my Father," then a
   work of Grace is certainly begun, but not till then. It is not enough
   to say, "I perish with hunger"--but when there follows upon it, "I will
   arise, and go to my Father, and will say unto Him, Father, I have
   sinned," then we have reached the true turning point--salvation has
   come to our house! True mourning for sin leads the sinner to the Cross.
   When you talk about repentance, if your repentance is with your back to
   the Cross, away with your repentance! If you are trusting to your
   tears, sorrows and grief--and not trusting to the blood of Jesus
   Christ--you are trusting in vain! Vanity of vanities! Your tears shall
   scald you if you trust in them and your groans shall be the echoes of
   your death sentence if you rely on them! That repentance in which a
   guilty man dares to fix his confidence shall be swept away as a thing
   that lacks the salt which would make it acceptable with

   God.

   The way to repent is with your eyes upon the Sacrifice, viewing the
   flowing of the sin-atoning blood, marking every precious drop, gazing
   into the Redeemer's wounds and believing in the love which, in death,
   opened up its unsearchable depths. All the while we must be saying, "My
   God, my God, I groan within myself that such a Sacrifice should have
   been required by my atrocious transgressions against You." This is the
   holy mixture which is needed--going and weeping-- but still going and
   seeking the Lord! We must not pass over that last word, "They shall go
   and seek the Lord their God." This, dear Hearer, shall be a guide to
   you as to whether your present state of feeling is leading you aright.
   What is it you are seeking? "I am seeking," says one, "I am seeking
   peace." May you soon obtain it and may it be real peace, but I am not
   sure of you.

   "I am seeking," says another, "the pardon of sin." Again, I pray that
   you may find it, but I am not sure of you, either. If another shall
   reply, "I am seeking the Lord; for I desire above all things to have
   Him for a Friend, though to Him I have been an enemy"--then I have good
   hope of him! I rejoice over the heart which is crying, "I want to see
   my Father's face, and hear Him say, 'I have blotted out your sins.' I
   want to dwell with God, to serve Him, to obey Him, to grow like He.
   There has been a quarrel between Him and me--and other lords have had
   dominion over me--but now I desire that He shall be my Lord and King,
   and myself His loyal humble servant and beloved child. I hunger and
   thirst

   after God!" You see, Brothers and Sisters, we require a great many
   things in order to be saved, and yet only one thing is necessary.

   I would represent it in this form--Here is a little child, picked up
   from the gutter, diseased and filthy, unclad, unfed. And if you ask me
   to make out a catalog of what the child needs you must give me a large
   sheet of paper to write it all down! And then I fear I shall leave out
   many things. I will tell you in one word what that poor infant
   requires--it needs its mother. If it gets its mother, it has all it
   needs. So to tell what a poor sinner needs might be a long task, but
   when you say that he needs his heavenly Father, you have said it all!
   This was what the prodigal needed, was it not? He needed his
   Father--and when he went to his Father, all his necessities were
   supplied.

   Oh Souls, you are seeking aright if you are seeking your God! Nothing
   short of this will suffice. This may greatly aid you to judge whether
   you are in the right way or not. And so you see, first of all, the
   returning exiles were mourners.

   II. Secondly, these mourners became INQUIRERS. We read in the second
   verse of our text, "They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces
   toward it." They knew something, that is clear, for they turned their
   faces in the right direction, but having been born and nurtured in
   Babylon, the road to Jerusalem had never been trod by them--the route
   was strange and new. They knew within a little the quarter in which
   Zion lay and they looked that way, but they did not know all about the
   road--how could they? The saving point about them was that they were
   not ashamed to confess their ignorance. Minds that the Lord has touched
   are never boastful of their wisdom. There are many persons in the world
   who would be converted if they could but consent to be taught by God's
   Word and Spirit--but they are such wise peo-ple--they know too much to
   enter the school of Grace. Jesus tells such, "Except you are converted
   and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of
   Heaven."

   A sense of ignorance is the doorstep of wisdom! He shall never know,
   who is not willing to confess that he does not know. These exiles
   confessed their ignorance. They knew a little, but they felt that they
   had much more to learn before they could stand in the temple of God in
   happy fellowship with Him. It is clear from their asking the way that
   these inquirers were teachable. They not only yielded to be instructed,
   but they were eager to be taught and, therefore, they asked for
   information. It is a hopeful sign when children ask questions. If we
   can get them to desire knowledge, the desire will be more valuable than
   the knowledge, itself. The way, nowadays, is to cram the memory, but if
   our youths could be brought to hunger for knowledge and to ask
   questions, their minds would be much more effectually benefited.

   It is a great mercy for a poor seeking sinner to have a teachable
   spirit, so as to pray, "Lord Jesus, write Your Gospel on my heart. Here
   it is, ready to be written on. Only tell me what You would have me do.
   I make no reservation--I am willing, by Your help, to do it. Or if
   there is nothing to be done but to sit at Your feet, tell me that, and
   I will do it as Your Grace enables me." This teachable spirit is a
   great benefit to any man--it is, in fact, a precious fruit of the
   Spirit. "They shall ask the way to Zion." They shall, therefore, be
   conscious of ignorance and they shall be willing to be taught! These
   are good characteristics, such as God accepts.

   More than this, they will be anxious although they are right--"They
   shall ask the way to Zion with their faces toward it"--they are
   traveling in the right direction and yet they ask the way! They have
   looked westward from Babylon, towards Jerusalem. They have taken up the
   westward position which, in their case, had a hopeful meaning in it.
   They are setting out for the land of Canaan as their first father did
   when he left Chaldea. And as they have no map of the road, they ask for
   the way which leads from banishment to the city of their God! They are
   right, for their faces are Zionward and one proof of it is that they
   are anxious to keep right, or to be set right. You who are certain that
   you are right are very liable to be wrong! But those who make every
   inquiry of the Word of God, of the servants of God and of their fellow
   travelers are, in all probability, pursuing the right road. He that has
   never raised a question about his condition before God had better raise
   it at once.

   The fullest assurance of faith we can ever attain will never excuse us
   from the duty of self-examination. When a man is most surely prospering
   in business, it will be wise for him to keep his accounts with care. If
   he does not attend to the state of his affairs, we shall suspect that
   his prosperity is a pleasing delusion which he dares not disturb. He
   who is most sure that he is right before God is most willing to look
   within--and he that will not search his own heart, but takes it for
   granted he is safe, may take my word for it that he is in a perilous
   condition! It is a strange thing that when men set their faces in the
   right way, they become careful and serious and deeply concerned, for
   they feel that their eternal destiny is not a thing to trifle with.

   At the same time, note concerning those who are coming to the Lord and
   His people, that they are questioning, but they are still resolved.
   They ask their way to Zion, but they have set their faces like flints
   in that direction! They ask how they can be right with God, not as a
   matter of curiosity, but because they mean to be at peace with Him--by
   God's Grace, nothing shall turn them aside from their God and His
   temple--and, therefore, their anxiety to be right. They do not raise
   questions by way of quibbling that they may have an excuse for sitting
   still, but they question because they are in downright earnest. True
   penitents will have Christ or die! Therefore with solemn resolve, lest,
   perhaps, they should be misled, they ask their way, determined to walk
   therein.

   Though they ask the way, we may remark, further, that they know where
   they are going. They ask their way to Zion. They wish to know how they
   can become fellow citizens with the people of God; how they can behold
   the great Sacrifice; how they can eat the true Passover; how they can
   be accepted worshippers of Jehovah and how they can enjoy fellowship
   with Him. They ask their way with understanding, for they know what
   their heart is seeking. They ask their way, not to somewhere or other,
   but to Zion--not to some imaginary blissful shore that may be or may
   not be--they seek God's own dwelling place, God's own palace, God's own
   Sacrifice! They ask boldly too, for they are not ashamed to be found
   inquiring! And when they are informed, their faces are already that way
   and, therefore, they have nothing to do but to go straight on. May God
   grant us myriads of such inquirers!

   Observe the right order--first they sought the Lord and then they asked
   their way to Zion. First God and then God's people! First the Master of
   the house and then the house of the Master! First that you may become
   His child, secondly that you may be put among the children. We pray the
   Holy Spirit to teach you this order well--first give yourself to the
   Lord and afterwards to us by the Word of God.

   III. Now we come to the last matter--these inquirers become
   COVENANTERS, for they said to one another, "Come, and let us join
   ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be
   forgotten." Oh, that word, "covenant." I can never pronounce it without
   joy in my heart! It is to me a mine of comfort, a mint of delight, a
   mass if joy. Time was when theology was full of Covenant Truth.
   Nowadays these grand old doctrines are laid aside by our wise men as
   too commonplace for their enlightened minds! I do not believe that some
   modern preachers can say, "covenant." They could not frame their mouths
   to pronounce it right. The doctrine of the "Covenant" is a kind of
   Shibboleth by which we may know the man of God from the false prophet.

   Let the people of God take no delight in the man who does not delight
   in the Covenant of Grace. I rejoice in those old Scot books about the
   Covenant--Covenant Truth was so inwrought into the Scot heart that Scot
   peasants, as well as divines, perpetually talked about it. You remember
   the good old cottager's blessing over her porridge? I cannot repeat it
   in pure Doric, but it ran like this-- "Lord, I thank you for the
   porridge, I thank you for an appetite for the porridge, but I thank you
   most of all that I have a Covenant right to the porridge." Only think
   of that! A Covenant right to the porridge! Does not the promise say,
   "Your bread shall be given you and your waters shall be sure?" God has
   given to His children a Covenant right to be fed in this life with
   daily bread--otherwise we might not pray for it!

   In the day in which the Lord put us into the Covenant by personal
   experience, He said, "No good thing will I withhold from them that walk
   uprightly" and, consequently, He promised the porridge and any other
   provision which He judged to be "food convenient for us." If we are in
   poverty, it sweetens everything if we can feel that our food and
   raiment must come to us, for the Lord has covenanted to supply all our
   needs! We pray the Lord, "Give us this day our daily bread." How came
   it to be ours? Why, because it was guaranteed us in the
   Covenant--Covenant provision has made it ours and, therefore, we may
   ask for it as ours.

   Have I any right to ask God for what is not mine in Christ Jesus? As
   sinners we ask for mercy and grace for the sake of Grace, but when we
   come to be children, we can also appeal to other attributes--and
   especially to faithfulness which is a great Covenant security. We can
   now say, "My Father, since I am Your child I am an heir of God,
   joint-heir with Jesus Christ--therefore give me of the fullness which
   You have treasured up in Him on my behalf." The upper springs are ours
   and the nether springs shall not be withheld--

   "He who has made my Heaven secure Will here all good provide. Since
   Christ is rich, can I be poor? What can I need beside?"

   Returning to the text, from which I have swerved a little, these
   inquirers become covenanters, for we read that they seek to be joined
   unto the Lord--"Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord." The
   mischief of our fallen state arose from our trying to be distinct and
   independent of our God. The younger son said, "Give me the portion of
   goods that falls to me." See, he has received his share in ready money
   and off he goes to the far country. What does he do when he penitently
   returns? Why he joins himself to his father! Nothing in the house is
   his--he has had his portion of goods long ago--but he lives at home
   because he is one with his father and cannot be shut out from the
   house. He is in communion with his father and so he is a partaker of
   all his father's goods. O that word, "joint-heirs"! What security and
   sweetness dwell in it! It is a grand thing to be an heir of God, but it
   makes it so much surer to be "joint-heirs with Christ." We have such
   fellowship with Jesus that we share all that Jesus has--our title to
   all good things lies in Jesus and in our being one with Him. "Come, and
   let us join ourselves to the Lord."

   Now dear Hearts, are you willing to be one with Christ and so to be one
   with the Father? Is not this the one thing you long for, that you may
   be so at peace with God through Jesus Christ that you may be joined
   with Him? You are a right-hearted seeker! In fact, you have already
   found the Lord, or else you would not find it in your heart to use such
   an expression as seeking to be joined unto the Lord! Next, notice for
   how long a time this Covenant is to be made--"Let us join ourselves to
   the Lord in a perpetual covenant." In our English army of late they
   have enlisted "short time" men. A good brother came to join the Church
   last week who is in the Reserves and I said to him, "You are not coming
   to unite with us for two sixes, the first six with the colors and the
   other six as a reserve man--you have come, I hope, to fight under the
   colors as long as life lasts."

   "Yes, Sir," he said, "I give myself up to the Lord forever." No
   salvation is possible except that which saves the soul forever! It must
   be an everlasting salvation or no salvation! And yet some professors
   try to be off and on with God--they are wonderfully good on the
   Sabbath--but they slip their regimentals off on Sunday night and there
   is no accounting for them during the week. I do not know where these
   double-faced people are to be found on Monday night, but I fear they
   are up to no good! These chameleons change their color according to the
   light they are in. Their religion is a sort of acting--a kind of
   masquerade. Beware of a religion which you can put on and off! In the
   Capitol at Rome I saw one of the Roman Emperors and I remembered well
   His Majesty's brutal countenance! Soon after I saw the gentleman
   looking very different--I would not have recognized His Imperial
   Highness at all if it had not been for the name--the fact is, they had
   put another wig on him! Oddly enough, certain of their statues are so
   carved that a series of stone headdresses can be put upon them--and
   this makes a mighty difference in their appearance.

   I am afraid that to some professors their religion is a wig, which so
   wonderfully changes them when they put it on or take it off, that you
   would not think they were the same people! A real man of God has his
   religion interwoven into the warp and woof of his being--he could not
   be other than he is, whatever his circumstances might be. Said one, "I
   hate such a man; he shall not come to my house; for I hear he is never
   ten minutes in a room but he begins to talk about religion." Such a man
   the world may hate--but such a man the Lord loves! Oh, that our
   godliness may be as our eyes, our mouth, our countenance, our heart,
   our life--never to be parted with, but forever essential to ourselves!
   May we now join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant! The
   Covenant of Life requires a lifelong covenant! We do not take Grace
   upon a terminable lease--it is an entailed inheritance, an immortal,
   eternal possession!

   Note, further, that this joining to God these covenanters intended to
   carry t out in a most solemn way--"Let us join ourselves to the Lord in
   a perpetual"--agreement? Promise? No! "Covenant" is the word! It is a
   profitable thing for the soul to covenant with God. Dr. Doddridge gives
   a form of personal covenant in his, "Rise and Progress," and I have
   been told that some persons have written it out and even signed it with
   their blood. I believe that such a formal transaction may lead a soul
   into bondage--this covenanting is not to be performed quite so
   literally--but I believe that it should really be done.

   That a man should give himself to the Lord in set and solemn form at
   some time in his life I believe to be a great help to his later
   perseverance. And if he will renew his covenant every now and then it
   may greatly help to his keeping it. In the ordinance of Baptism we have
   the best visible setting forth of that Covenant. Circumcision set forth
   the taking away of the filth of the flesh, but Baptism sets forth the
   death and burial of the flesh, itself--we see in it the emblem of our
   death and burial with our Lord. The Believer, thereby, says, "Now I am
   come to an end of my old life, for I am dead and buried." And he
   becomes from that time on as one who has risen with Christ, to walk in
   newness of life. By that solemn

   act the Believer has covenanted that Christ shall be his life and that
   his old self, being dead and buried, shall no more rule and reign.

   I have known some Believers, and I think they did wisely, take a part
   of a day for the special objective of giving themselves anew to the
   Lord. They have said, "Lord, I do this day, as a poor sinner, solemnly
   put my trust in Your Word, in Your Son and in His atoning Sacrifice.
   And, doing this, I feel that I am not my own, for I am bought with a
   price. And I now ask for Grace that from this day forward I may be
   wholly Yours. Not only I, but my wife, my children and my
   substance--all that I have I give to You, my Lord, admitting that
   nothing which I have was ever mine, but always Yours. I pray that You
   will be my God forever and ever, and be my Guide even unto death--and
   that after death You will receive me to Glory." Such a covenant as this
   will bear to be looked back upon and repeated. You can gladly say--

   "High Heaven that heard my solemn vow, That vow renewed shall daily
   hear, Till in life's latest hour I bow, And bless in death a bond so
   dear." You are coming to the Lord rightly, my dear Friend, if you are
   yielding body, soul and spirit unto Him to be His forever. There is no
   fear about your safety when you join yourself unto the Lord by a
   perpetual covenant.

   One word more remains to be spoken. Those who came mourning and
   inquiring, when they became covenanters, felt that they had a nature
   very apt to forgetfulness of good things and, so, a part of what they
   desired in their covenanting with God was "a perpetual covenant that
   shall not be forgotten." God will never forget, yet may you pray,
   "Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom." The fear is lest
   you should forget. What is your view of that possibility? Would it not
   be terrible? Think it over and say, "If I should ever forget the Lord
   Jesus. If I should ever forget my obligations for His great salvation
   and for the good hope of eternal life which He has given me, it would
   be infamous! God grant I may die sooner than deny my Lord!"

   Where could we go for comfort if we had forgotten our God? What would
   remain for us but everlasting despair? Let us, therefore, pray the Lord
   that it may be a perpetual covenant that shall never, never, not even
   for an hour, be forgotten! Ask the Lord to write this covenant upon the
   fleshy tablets of your heart, that it may be there forever! O Zion, if
   I forget You, let my right hand forget her cunning! Sooner than I
   should forget You, O my God, suffer me speedily to die! Let me not live
   to become so false, so wicked as under stress of infirmity or
   temptation, even for a moment, to turn aside from You!

   Beloved Brothers and Sisters, take hold on Christ this morning with a
   renewed grip and say, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I love
   You! Suffer me not to forsake You. Hold me up and I shall be safe. I
   would be Yours living. Yours dying and Yours forever and ever." Thus
   desiring and pleading, all will be well with you. May the God of the
   Everlasting Covenant bless you. Amen.

Blessed Promises For Dying Outcasts

   (No. 1753)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, DECEMBER 2, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For I will restore health unto you, and I will healyou of your wounds,
   says the Lord; because they called you an outcast, saying, This is
   Zion, whom no man seeks after." Jeremiah 30:17.

   THE promises of this verse will be exceedingly sweet to those who feel
   their personal need of them. But those who boast that they are neither
   sick nor wounded will take no interest in this comfortable promise.
   Those who are charmed with themselves will see no charm in the beloved
   Physician. I have heard of certain hungry travelers, lost in the
   wilderness, who came upon a bag which they longingly hoped might yield
   them a seasonable supply of food. They were near to death's door by
   starvation and eagerly opened the bag, but, alas, it contained nothing
   but pearls--which they poured out contemptuously upon the desert sand
   as things of no use to them! Even so, when a man is hungry and
   thirsting after the things of this life and all his thoughts are taken
   up with carnal appetites, carnal sorrows and carnal joys, he will
   reject as worthless the priceless promises of God, for he considers
   that they are of no immediate use to him.

   Let his hunger be of another sort; let his heart hanker after
   unsearchable riches; let his soul pine for eternal love and then his
   are views of things entirely changed--and to buy the pearl of great
   price he would gladly sell all that he has! Oh, you that are sick at
   heart, here is a word for you from the God of all Grace! Jehovah Rophi,
   Himself, says, "I will restore health unto you." Oh, you that have felt
   the shafts of God pierce your inmost souls, here is a word from Him who
   heals the broken in heart and binds up their wounds--"I will heal you
   of your wounds, says the Lord." Here is music for your ears, honey for
   your mouth, comfort for your heart!

   But if you feel you have no sickness and no wound, no weakness and no
   spiritual need, then the Words of sacred consolation will pass over
   your ears as a meaningless sound, having no voice for you. Neither
   shall we wonder at this, for the whole have no need of a physician!
   Only they that are sick! Healthy men care not to hear of medicines and
   remedies, for they feel no need of them. This thins my audience, but
   improves it, for while it drives away the conceited, it draws the needy
   to a more careful listening!

   Our text describes a serious plight, mentions a special interference
   and records a singular reason for that interference. When we have
   spoken upon each of these, we shall close by giving you suitable
   advice. May the Spirit of God bless the discourse.

   I. First, then, taken in connection with the verses which precede it,
   our text describes a class of men and women who are in A SERIOUS
   PLIGHT. These people suffer under two evils. First, they are sick
   through sin, for they need to have their health restored. And,
   secondly, they are wounded for their sin by the chastisements of the
   Lord, so that there is necessity for their wounds to be healed. They
   are afflicted with the distemper of evil and, also, by dismal
   disquietude of conscience. They have broken God's Commandments and now
   their own bones are broken. They have grieved their God and their God
   is grieving them.

   Let us carefully look at the first part of their sad condition--they
   are sick with sin and that disease is one which, according to the 5th
   and 6th verses, brings great pain and trouble into men's minds when
   they come to their senses and know their condition before God. At
   first, iniquity numbs the conscience, and its tendency is to sear it as
   with a hot iron. It may be compared to a stroke of paralysis, which,
   when it falls upon a man's body, takes away from him all pain and makes
   him as one dead in the parts which it affects. Sin paralyzes the
   consciences of the ungodly. At first they do not know it to be an
   exceedingly great evil. They trifle with it--it is a serpent whose very
   look is poisonous and yet they sport with it as though it were a bird!
   It is a deadly disease, causing the soul to be full of leprosy and yet
   men will exhibit the marks of it as though they were the spots of God's
   children.

   But after a while, when the conscience is awakened by judgments, or
   awakened by God's Word, then this disease ceases to stupefy and becomes
   the source of intolerable pain. Read these Words--"For thus says the
   Lord; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear and not of peace. Ask
   you, now, and see whether a man does travail with child? Why do I see
   every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all
   faces are turned into paleness?" The fiercest form of bodily pain is
   here selected as the type of the anguish caused by strong conviction of
   sin. Believe me, there can be nothing in the world so terrible as to
   feel sin without feeling pardon--to know yourself to be guilty and not
   to know how to get the guilt removed!

   Conviction without faith is an earthly Hell! Brothers and Sisters, you
   have, many of you, felt it, and you know that death itself, if there
   were no hereafter, would be preferable to life under the pressure of
   guilt. "The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded
   spirit who can bear?" Sin is a disease of the spirit which embitters
   the central fountain and wellspring of our life till gall and wormwood
   flavor all things. Sin felt and known is a terrible killjoy--as the hot
   wind of the desert smites the caravan with death and as the sirocco
   withers every herb of the field, so does a sense of sin dry up peace,
   blast hope and utterly kill delight! If those who hear me are oppressed
   with the disorder of sin, they will rejoice greatly as they dwell upon
   the Words of our text, "I will restore health unto you, and I will heal
   you of your wounds."

   This disease, moreover, is not only exceedingly painful when the
   conscience is smarting, but it is altogether incurable, so far as any
   human ill is concerned. We are told in the 12th verse, "Thus says the
   Lord, Your bruise is incurable, and your wound is grievous." It would
   be much easier to heal a man's body of leprosy than to heal a man's
   soul of sin. It is a disease which takes such fast hold upon the nature
   and so entirely impregnates the mind with a deadly virus, that it
   abides in the very essence of manhood and can only be removed by a
   miracle. It is far more possible for the Ethiopian to change his skin,
   or the leopard his spots, than for a man who is accustomed to do evil,
   to learn to do well--especially to love to do well and find pleasure in
   it. If this were a matter of custom, or practice, it might be fought
   with and overcome, but inasmuch as it is a matter of nature and the
   whole head is sick--and the whole heart faint with it--no human power
   can possibly effect a cure.

   Some have wept over sin, but tears are a poor lotion for a disease
   which penetrates to the core of the heart. Others have shut themselves
   up alone and retired as hermits to escape from evil by solitude--but
   they have found no secret place which evil could not enter! Where shall
   we flee from the presence of sin? When it has once laid hold upon our
   nature, if we take the wings of the morning and fly to the uttermost
   parts of the sea, our depravity will still be with us. If we cover
   ourselves with multiplied midnights, sin will only be the more
   completely in its element. Where can we fly and what can we do to
   escape from this terrible force, this ever-present mischief? This
   poison has penetrated all our nature, so that we must confess--

   "It lies not in a single part, But throughout my frame is spread! A
   burning fever in my heart, A palsy in my head."

   Neither body, soul, nor spirit is free from its taint. At all hours it
   is our curse and plague. Over all places it casts its defiling
   influence. In all duties it injures and hinders us. To those who know
   this, there is a music sweeter than wedding bells in these words--"I
   will restore health unto you, and I will heal you of your wounds." The
   incurable shall be cured! The insatiable malady shall be stopped!

   Further on we are told that this disease is one for which there is
   neither surgeon nor medicine--"There is none to plead your cause, that
   you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines. Why do you cry for
   your affliction? Your sorrow is incurable for the multitude of your
   iniquity: because your sins were increased, I have done these things
   unto you." What a disease this must be for which there is no physician!
   The most dire forms of human disease have found, each one, its
   specialist who has at least attempted to perform a cure--but here is a
   sickness for which there is no physician! Bad men do not pretend to
   heal the disease of sin. They do not consider it to be a disease and
   they care not to make men holy. Good men are very far from thinking
   that they can conquer sin in others, for they cannot even overcome it
   in themselves and, therefore, they never set up to be physicians in
   such a case as this. No human hand can bind up this wound! No earthly
   skill can touch this deeply seated complaint! It is past all mortal
   surgery. Yes, and the Prophet adds, "There is no healing
   medicine"--none has ever been known!

   The question is often asked, "Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no
   physician there?" The answer to that question is, No, there is no balm
   in Gilead; there never was! Balms for soul-mischiefs do not grow in the
   fields of Gilead, no, nor on Carmel and Sharon. Physicians of sin-sick
   souls are not to be found beneath the skies! The other question proves
   it-- "Why, then, is not the health of the daughter of My people
   recovered?" If there were balms and physicians for her disease, she
   would have been healed long ago! But neither salve nor surgeon can be
   found among the sons of men. Search through all the lore of the
   ancients and you shall discover no remedy for sin! Examine all the
   inventions of the moderns and you shall light upon no medicine for the
   love of evil!

   Nothing can touch it but one thing, and that is not of earth. The Lord
   from Heaven, upon the Cross, bled a balm that can cure this wound and
   by His death He was the death of this disease! But apart from Him no
   one can bind up our wounds, or mollify them with ointment. He is the
   one and only Good Samaritan for the spiritually bruised! He, alone, has
   wine and oil suitable for our wounds! Are my Hearers brought to feel
   this? Are there any here who have not yet discovered God's way of
   salvation and still are well aware that they have none of their own? I
   am thankful you are brought so far! May it not be long before you go
   much further and find the Lord Jesus able to heal you of every disease.
   You are forever lost unless you go to Him, for your sickness is unto
   death! Your wound is breeding corruption! No one can give you health
   for your sickness, or healing for your wound but the Lord Jesus, who is
   able to save unto the uttermost--

   "When wounded sore the stricken soul Lies bleeding and unbound. One
   only hand, a pierced hand, Can salve the sinner's wound."

   This disease is exceedingly dangerous because it impregnates itself
   into the heart and takes up its abode there. If apparently it is, for a
   time, driven out, it returns when we least expect it. Like the tree
   which is cut down, it will sprout and bud, again, at the scent of
   water. It annoys us in every way--it hinders our aspirations--for how
   to perform that which we would, we find not. It robs us of comfort and
   makes us groan, being burdened. It enters into our holiest things,
   chills our prayers, freezes our praise and hampers our usefulness. It
   is evil, only evil, and that continually! How gracious is it on God's
   part to pity a creature infected with this vile distemper! How good of
   Him to regard our iniquity rather as a sickness to be healed than as a
   crime to be punished!

   I told you of a double mischief in this plight and the second mischief
   is that this person has been wounded for his sin. His wounds are of no
   common sort, for we are told in the 14th verse that God Himself has
   wounded him. The Lord says, "I have wounded you with the wound of an
   enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of your
   iniquity; because your sins were increased." God, in infinite mercy,
   determines to make the sinner see and feel the evil consequences of his
   sin. And in doing this He makes deep wounds, such as an enemy would
   give who felt no pity, but only wished to cause pain. The Lord knows
   that in this work, pity is of no avail and, therefore, He strikes home
   and cuts deep. He does not play with consciences, but His chastisement
   is so severe that men think Him cruel.

   There is such a thing as cruel kindness and the opposite to it is a
   loving cruelty, a gracious severity! When the Lord brings sin to
   remembrance and makes the soul see what an evil it has committed in
   transgressing against God, then the wound bleeds and the heart breaks.
   You could not tell the blows of our greatest Friend from those of our
   worst enemy if you only judged by present feeling. Under the Lord's
   hands, the soul is well near driven to despair. Vain hopes are dashed
   in pieces like potsherds! False lights are quenched in gloom and joys
   are ground to powder! It is in love that the Lord thus judges us and
   chastens us that we should not be condemned with the world. The smart
   is sharp, but salutary. The Lord wounds that He may heal--He kills that
   He may make alive. His storms wreck us upon the Rock of Salvation and
   His tempests drive us into the fair havens of lowly faith.

   Happy are the men who are thus made unhappy! But for the present they
   know this not and, therefore, they need the promise, "I will heal you
   of your wounds, says the Lord." The blows are not only on the
   conscience, for when God is in earnest to make men flee from their
   sins, He will smite them anywhere and everywhere. He takes away the
   delight of their eyes with a stroke--the child, the husband, the wife,
   or the friend is laid low--for the Lord will fill our houses with
   mourning sooner than leave us in carnal security! He takes away the
   silver and the gold, for He will make us beggars sooner than leave us
   to worship the idols of the world. The oil vat is burst and the barn is
   burned, for He will not permit us to bury our souls in earthly things.
   He brings the body into sickness and the mind into distress. Health
   departs and the robust worker is stretched upon a sick bed--he groans
   and moans under the hand of God.

   God is, in all this, smiting most cruelly according to the shortsighted
   judgment of men--but in very truth He is tender and gracious--and is
   working out the eternal good of the sufferers. Like the surgeon uses a
   sharp knife and cuts far down into the flesh when he would eradicate
   some deadly ulcer, even so does the Lord, in true severity, wound the
   heart until He gets at the root of our self-love. Surely, a man is in a
   wretched plight when he is diseased with sin and then bruised by Divine
   chastisement! But, it may be he adds to this, wounds inflicted by
   himself, for falls into sin are falls that break bones. Many a man will
   have to go limping to his grave because of his transgressions.
   Doubtless David did--he never recovered what he lost when he sinned
   with Bathsheba.

   Much pain comes of broken bones, especially when you have broken them,
   yourself, through your own folly. When you cannot trace an affliction
   to second causes, nor look upon it as an affliction from God--when you
   hear Conscience whisper, "You have procured this unto yourself"--then
   the wormwood is mixed with gall and the suffering knows no solace. If
   you are poor because you have squandered your substance--if you are
   sick because you have indulged your appetites or passions--who can give
   you a word of cheer? If you have lost godly friends whom you did once
   despise. If you are by sickness, prevented from going up to the house
   of the Lord which was formerly a weariness to you, is there not a
   special sharpness in your grief?

   Now, put these three things together--bones broken through your own
   sin; God dealing with you in the way of chastisement--and sin felt in
   the conscience like a grievous disease--and I think I did not say too
   much when I described the soul as in a serious plight! God help the man
   who is in such a case, for none else can. The comfort is that the Lord
   Jesus does help such, for so His gracious promise runs, "I will restore
   health unto you, and I will heal you of your wounds." May the Holy
   Spirit bless this first head to many of you!

   II. Our second consideration fitly falls under the title of A SPECIAL
   INTERFERENCE. The poor creature is in desperate straits, but the God of
   pitying Love comes in and I beg you to notice the result. This
   interference is, first of all, Divine. "I will restore health unto you,
   and I will heal you of your wounds." Only the Infinite Jehovah can
   speak with that grand Ego and say, "I will," and again, "I will." No
   human physician who was worthy of the name would speak thus. He would
   humbly say, "I will attempt to give you health; I will endeavor to heal
   your wounds." But the Lord speaks with the positiveness of Omnipotence,
   for He has the power to make good His Words.

   All others fail, but the Lord will do it. You can not heal yourself,
   but the Lord will heal you. And who is this great "I" that speaks so
   exceedingly bold? It is none other than He that made the heavens and
   the earth and sustains all things by the power of His hands! It is the
   "I AM," the everlasting Jehovah whose Word has boundless power in it.
   He appears in the moment of man's extremity and when there is no
   helper--His own arm brings salvation. Blessed be the Lord who forgives
   all our iniquities, who heals all our diseases! Note that because this
   interference is Divine, it is effectual! The Lord effectually heals all
   those on whom He lays His hands. How could it be otherwise? What can
   baffle the Lord? Can anything perplex Infinite Wisdom? Is anything
   difficult for Almighty Power?

   "If it is marvelous in your eyes, should it also be marvelous in My
   eyes? says the Lord of Hosts." He speaks and it is done! He commands
   and it stands fast! Therefore, when God says, "I will restore health
   unto you," health will visit the wretch who lies at Death's door! When
   He says, "I will heal you of your wounds," the deep cuts and gashes are
   closed up at once! Glory be to the name of the Beloved Physician! Poor,
   troubled Heart, where are you this morning? Do you say, "Nobody can
   cure me"? You say truly but you can make one exception and that
   exception is your God! I tell you He can heal you now, so that the
   bones which He has broken shall rejoice! He can take away this disease
   of yours and give you back wholeness as though your flesh were the
   flesh of a little child! And you shall be clean--only have faith in
   Him. He that made you can make you anew!

   Do you believe this? Observe that this interposition performs a work
   which is most complete, for it meets the twofold mischief. "I will
   restore health unto you"--that is a great matter. When a man grows
   healthy, he can bear a wound or two without being too much
   overburdened. But God does nothing by halves, for having restored
   health, He then adds, "I will heal you of your wounds." He will heal
   both disease and wounds! There is no condition into which the heart can
   sink but what the Lord is equal to the raising of it from the depths.
   If you are on the borders of Hades, yet as long as you have not passed
   the iron gates of Death, your salvation is possible with God! Yes,
   simple and sure with God if you will but trust in His well-beloved Son!
   What a mercy it is that the Redeemer does not half save us and leave us
   to finish the work!

   He does not commence and do a part of the cure and then say, "I must
   leave Nature to work out the rest." No, the cure is absolutely
   complete--"I will restore health unto you, and I will heal you of your
   wounds." Oh, sick and wounded one, go just as you are and throw
   yourself at Jesus' feet and say to Him, "Keep Your promise, Lord! I
   have come with Your Word in my mouth and in my heart. Be as good as
   Your own declaration and restore health to me! And heal me of my
   wounds." Notice, too, how sovereignly free this promise is. It does not
   say, "I will restore health unto you if--." No, there is no, "if," and
   there is no mention of a fee! Here is healing for nothing! Jesus comes
   to give us health without money and without price, without pence or
   penance, without labor or merit!

   I admire, for my part, the splendid, unconditional character of this
   promise made by Jehovah to His Covenant people. Its tenor is, "I will."
   There is no sort of condition or demand. "Perhaps" is banished--it is
   not so much as hinted at! Come, poor guilty Soul, you who have no claim
   on God, come and plead the Divine, "I will"! You can not have a better
   handhold of the Covenant Angel in wrestling with Him! God's promise is
   an unconquerable plea--to use it well will put you among the
   invincibles. Come then, I pray you, and just say, "Lord, it is so
   written in Your Word. Therefore, write it, I pray You, on the page of
   my experience." Notice that although it is thus free and unconditional,
   yet it is now a matter of Covenant certainty, for God has made the
   promise and He cannot turn from it.

   To every guilty sinner conscious of his guilt, who will come and
   confess it before God, this promise is made today, "I will restore
   health unto you, and I will heal you of your wounds." To you, dear
   fellow sinners, as much as unto Judah and Israel of old, is this
   promise sent--if you will bring your sorrow and your sin before the
   eyes of the all-merciful Father--and plead the precious blood of
   Christ. No sick one shall be shut out from this hospital of love. If,
   like Job, the sinner is covered with sores from head to foot and if he
   only feels at home when he sits on a dunghill and begins to scrape
   himself with a potsherd, yet the Lord says, "I will heal you"!

   If your sins have made you loathsome to yourself till you cry out with
   one of old, "My wounds stink and are corrupt," still the Lord Jesus is
   able to save you--no, He promises to save you! Grasp the promise by the
   hand of faith and you shall be made whole! All manner of sin and of
   iniquity shall be forgiven unto men--yes, and all tendencies to sin and
   all taint of iniquity shall be removed from men if they will trust the
   power and promise of the faithful Lord! Sinner, His touch can make you
   clean at once! Trust that touch, I say, and the miracle shall be
   worked!

   III. But now I come to a third point which is this--A SINGULAR REASON.
   "I will restore health unto you, and I will heal you of your wounds,
   says the Lord; because they called you an outcast, saying, This is
   Zion, whom no man seeks after." God never finds a reason for mercy in
   the sinner's supposed goodness. He looked upon this sick one and He
   could not find a redeeming feature of beauty by which the blessing
   might be won. Therefore He did not look at the sinner at all, except to
   pity him. Is it not a singular thing that the Lord will sooner find a
   reason for mercy in the lying mouths of the wicked than He will attempt
   to find it in the supposed righteousness of those who count themselves
   righteous? He says not, "Because you were holy," or, "Because you had
   good desires," but, "Because they called you an outcast"!

   Who were they? Why, the jeerers, mockers and blasphemers! The Lord
   actually transforms the venom of asps which was under the tongues of
   the malicious into a reason for His mercy! This clearly shows how God
   hates the very notion of man's merit--but it also shows that He will
   find a reason for mercy somewhere! They called poor Zion, when God
   seemed to have given up on her, "an outcast." They said, "Nobody goes
   to Jerusalem--there was a temple there once, but it is a wretched heap!
   Princes once dwelt there, but now the inhabitants of Jerusalem are a
   set of beggars--no man cares to mix with them--they are the world's
   castaways."

   This awakened the Lord's pity. "Oh," He said, "has it come to this?
   Have they dared to call My Beloved, 'an outcast,' and say that no man
   seeks after her? Then I will seek her, and heal her, and restore her,
   for I cannot endure such taunts." Now, if there is a poor sinner in the
   world upon whom other sinners, who are just as bad in their heart,
   begin to vent their scorn and say, "She is an outcast," then the God of
   Mercy seems to say, "Who are you that you should talk like this? You
   are as vile, yourselves, and yet you dare to look down upon this poor,
   selected one, as if she were so much worse than you? Therefore I will
   save that despised one and will have mercy upon the rejected." God's
   tastes and man's differ very much. Whom man despises, God delights
   in--and whom man delights in, God despises.

   It often happens that when a transgressor has been put out of the
   synagogue, Jesus finds him directly. When certain offenders happen to
   transgress in a particular way, which particular way is observed and
   denounced by the bulk of ungodly people and when. like so many hounds.
   they unite to hunt the wretched being to death, the Lord Jehovah inter-

   poses to save, as if He would say, "Why do you do this, you hypocrites?
   Why do you denounce those whose sins are no viler than your own?" I
   believe the Lord Jesus often stands as He did with the woman taken in
   adultery, and cries, "He that is without sin among you, let him cast
   the first stone at her." Still, He convicts men in their consciences
   and in sweetness of mercy turns to the poor, condemned one, and says,
   "Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more."

   Where are you, poor hunted Sinner? You are somewhere or other in the
   crowd, I know. They told you yesterday that they would never associate
   with you again. You do not deny your wickedness--still, it is not for
   your fellow sinners to be hard with you, for they are not your judges.
   By faith take this promise to yourself--"I will restore health unto you
   because they called you an outcast." You may get a good deal out of it
   if you have but faith to do so! Now that the world has cast you out,
   the Church shall take you in! Now that the devil seems tired of you,
   Christ shall begin with you! Now that the door is shut against you by
   those who once delighted in you, Christ's door is open to receive you!
   "Because they called you an outcast," He calls you to approach Him!

   But this is not the full meaning of the text. I think it means that
   God's jealousy is awakened against those who despise His people and
   speak ill of them. Whatever Zion might be, it was still the palace of
   God. However guilty Jerusalem might have become, it was still the Holy
   City, the dwelling place of the great King. The Lord, for a while, when
   He was very angry with Jerusalem on account of its great iniquity, gave
   it over to the destroyer and it was laid waste and burned with fire.
   But when He heard the heathen everywhere saying, "As for those people,
   they are outcasts, and as for that city, no man seeks after it"--then
   the Lord said to Himself, "But they are My people and I will not have
   them called outcasts. And this is My city and I will not have it said
   that no man seeks after it. Her name shall be called Hephzibah and her
   land Beulah, for the Lord delights in her."

   His love burned like fire and kindled into a flame of jealousy. And He
   said, "I will restore health to her, and shut the mouths of her
   adversaries." It is one thing for a father to chasten his boy, but if,
   when he is out in the streets, a stranger begins to kick him, his
   father declares that it shall not be. He awakens himself to defend his
   child, the same child that just now he smote so heavily! A man might
   complain of his wife if she has vexed him, but I suppose the quickest
   way to put him in good temper with her would be for somebody else to
   find fault with her! "What business is that of yours?" he asks. "I will
   not have my wife abused--no man shall speak against her in my
   presence." That is a fair parallel to the case of our God. He will
   chasten His people in measure, but the moment that their enemies call
   them outcasts, He turns His anger another way and releases His people!

   Oh, how blessedly does good come out of evil! How graciously He causes
   the wrath of man to praise Him! He restores health to Zion and heals
   her wounds because she is called an outcast. I always have great hope
   for the entire Church of Christ when the ungodly begin to rail and
   revile. They say, "Christianity has lost its power! The Church is an
   old effete institution! No people of culture and intelligence keep to
   the old Book and the old faith. The religion of Jesus is a byword and a
   proverb among learned men." And then I am confident that God will
   return to His Church and magnify His truth! As surely as He lives, He
   will give us bright days and glorious days because they call His true
   Church an outcast, whom no man seeks after. I like to read in man's
   black book, for man's reviling will lead to the speedier fulfillment of
   God's glorious promises--

   "Let Zion's foes be filled with shame-- Her sons are blessed of God!
   Though scoffers now despise their name, The Lord shall break their rod.
   Oh, would our God to Zion turn, God with salvation clad, Then Judah's
   harps should music learn, And Israel be glad."

   Appropriate the text personally, any of you who have been made to feel
   that you are outcasts. One said to me the other day, talking of her sin
   and of her repentance, "Yet, Sir, I am an outcast." That word pierced
   my heart like a dagger. I said, "Yes, but the Church of Christ was made
   on purpose to be a home for outcasts--here is a new household for you,
   new Brothers and Sisters for you, a new future for you--for now you are
   one of the solitary ones whom the Lord will set in families." Some of
   us were never called outcasts by other people, but we thought ourselves
   such. I once felt like Cain, as if God had set a mark upon me, never to
   bless me. I felt like an outlaw, condemned and cast away. But when I

   reached that point, the Lord's mercy revealed itself to me! He seemed
   to say, "Because you have called yourself an outcast, therefore will I
   restore health unto you, and I will heal you of your wounds."

   I should like to say a word that would be comforting to poor hearts
   that are greatly downtrodden. I do not feel able to preach at all, for
   I am weak and weary. But I always find, when I am weak, the Lord says
   something by me which is just the thing needed by some poor
   devil-hunted soul that cannot find rest. I think the Lord puts the
   trumpet out of order on purpose to draw from it a different note from
   what it gives when it is in proper condition--a note that may precisely
   suit some weary ears that could not listen to any other sound. May the
   Holy Spirit cause it to be so now!

   IV. I am going to finish, in the fourth place, by giving A LITTLE
   SUITABLE ADVICE. I will suppose that I have those before me who have
   felt their disease and their wound and have been healed by the God of
   Mercy. I would recommend them to attend to certain matters. The first
   thing is take care that you live very near your Physician. I notice
   that patients come up from the country, when they are suffering with
   serious complaints, and they take lodgings near a medical man who is in
   high esteem for such cases as theirs. They leave the comforts of home
   and let their business go because life is precious--and they need a
   helper close at hand. No one blames them for this. In fact, we count
   them wise. Let us learn wisdom from their example.

   Now, the Lord has healed your wound and restored health to you,
   therefore abide in Him. Never leave Him, nor live far away from Him,
   for this old disease of yours may break out, all of a sudden, and it
   will be well to have the Healer close at hand. It will be best to
   constantly entertain Him beneath your roof and within your heart, for
   His Presence is the wellspring of health to the soul. Abide perpetually
   with Christ and then the sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon
   by night! Dwelling in the secret place of the Most High, there shall be
   no evil befall you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.
   This disease of sin may cause eruptions when we least expect then--when
   we suppose that the evil leaven will work no more, it may suddenly
   gather force and the whole body of our nature will be in a ferment with
   iniquity. The danger is near. Abide, therefore, near your Security.
   Live with Him who renews your youth like the eagle's and restores your
   soul!

   I recommend you often put yourself under His searching examination. Go
   to this great Physician and ask Him to look into your hidden parts--to
   search you and try you--and see what wicked way may be in you, that He
   may lead you in the way everlasting. A man may have a deadly disease
   upon him and scarcely be aware of it because no skilled person has
   looked upon him and observed his symptoms! And in spiritual things this
   is a common mischief to which multitudes fall prey! Invite, therefore,
   the eyes of the Lord Jesus, for in our most honest searches we miss
   much and we are naturally prejudiced in our own favor, so that we are
   pretty sure to give a verdict on our own side--and this may lead to
   final and fatal self-delusion! If we entrust the search to Him whose
   eyes are as a flame of fire, we shall not be deceived! I recommend to
   you, from personal experience, to consult with this Doctor every day.

   It is a wise thing, before you go downstairs into the world's tainted
   atmosphere, to take a drink of His Elexir Vitae in the form of renewed
   faith in Him. I am sure, at night, it is an admirable thing to purge
   the soul of all the perilous stuff which has accumulated through the
   day by full confession and renewed confidence. Lay bare your case
   before Him! Conceal nothing. Beg Him to deal with you according to His
   knowledge of your case. Make a clean breast that Christ may make a sure
   cure. Conceal no symptom, however threatening, but tell Him the truth.
   He cannot be deceived--do not attempt it--but tell every secret thing
   before His all-surveying gaze. Entreat Him to search both thoughts and
   affections, designs and motives. The evil may gather in secret places
   unless His discerning eyes shall detect the growing danger and prevent
   it by immediate action.

   Then I very strongly recommend you always to obey the prescriptions of
   the great Healer. "Whatever He says unto you, do it." Do not follow a
   part of His orders and neglect the rest. The Lord Jesus must be
   received as a whole, or not at all. Say not, "This is non-essential,"
   for such a speech is flat rebellion! I do not believe in any Words of
   our Lord being non-essential. They may not be essential to our
   salvation, but every Word of Christ is essential to our spiritual
   health! Neither can we disregard the least of His precepts without
   suffering loss through our disobedience. Be very careful that you
   follow the Lamb wherever He goes--no other kind of walking is safe in
   such a world as this. Do what He bids you, as He bids you and it shall
   be well with you.

   Take care, also, to exercise great confidence in this Physician. Rely
   upon Him without stint or question. Your cure is working wondrously
   when you trust in Jesus heartily. Never doubt the Savior's power to
   make you perfectly whole. Our

   Lord can never be baffled--though all diseases should meet in one
   person, He would overcome them all! Stick to this with unyielding
   assurance. Let not the devil force you to doubt the boundless power of
   your Lord. When our Lord Jesus set up to be Savior, He understood the
   work upon which He entered. His is no apprenticed hand. He has never
   had a failure! Never did a soul trust Him for salvation and remain
   unsaved--and you shall not be the first to defeat His skill! Trust Him
   with all your heart. There is no cause to doubt. Distrust is what you
   have to fear--faith is your strength.

   When you are healed, as I trust you are, already, speak well of your
   Benefactor. Make a point of going round to your neighbors, if you find
   them sick, and telling them how you have been healed! Thus will you
   make to your Lord a name of honor and renown. Tell all men what the
   Lord has done for you. I know you can tell them that story though you
   are no orator. When you were restored from sickness the other day, you
   were quite able to inform your friends as to that new medicine which
   acted like a charm--and you found a tongue to speak well of your
   doctor--and I am sure you have ability enough to declare the wonderful
   works of the Lord in your case.

   "Oh, but I could not embellish the tale!" Do not attempt to embellish
   it, for that would only spoil it! Tell the story as simply as possible.
   I think it is of Mr. Cecil that I have read the following incident. A
   friend came from some distance to inform him of a medicine which was to
   relieve him of his disorder. This friend told him all about it and,
   having done so, entered into conversation upon the current matters of
   the day. The result was that Mr. Cecil was greatly interested in the
   talk and when his friend was gone, he quite forgot every ingredient of
   the wonderful medicine. Beware of allowing the many things to drive the
   one thing necessary out of your friend's mind! When we preach fine
   sermons our hearers say, "That was prettily put." They do not so much
   notice what we taught as how we taught it--and this is a great evil!
   Even so, if you go and talk about your salvation to your neighbor and
   narrate it eloquently, she will say, "Mrs. So-and-So has been here and
   told me about her conversion in such beautiful language! I do not know
   that I ever heard such elegant sentences. It was most delightful to
   hear her." What did she say? "I do not know what she said, but it was
   very beautiful."

   Thus many a sermon or Sunday school address is overlaid and buried
   under its own robes! Pity that those we seek to bless should be more
   taken up with our pretty words than with our adorable Master! I hope I
   have not, this morning, fallen into the evil which I lament. Lest I
   should have done so in any measure I would make my text, my banner, and
   display it again. The Lord has said, "I will restore health unto you,
   and heal you of your wounds." I believed that Word of God when I was
   sick and wounded and, "the Lord was ready to save me: therefore we will
   sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in
   the house of the Lord."

The Blind Man's Eyes Opened--or, Practical Christianity

   (No. 1754)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, AUGUST 12, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT EXETER HALL.

   "Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that
   the works of God should be made manifest in him. I must work the works
   of Him that sent Me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can
   work." John 9:3,4.

   OBSERVE, dear Friends, how little disconcerted our Lord Jesus Christ
   was by the most violent opposition of His enemies. The Jews took up
   stones to stone Him and He hid Himself from them. But almost the moment
   after, when He had passed, perhaps, through a single court and was
   sufficiently out of range to be unobserved by them, He stood still and
   fixed His eyes upon a blind beggar who had been sitting near the Temple
   gate. I am afraid that the most of us would have had no heart to help
   even the most needy while we were escaping from a shower of stones! And
   if we had attempted the work, moved by supreme compassion, we would
   have gone about it blunderingly, in a great hurry and certainly would
   not have talked calmly and wisely, as the Savior did when He answered
   His disciples' question and went on to talk with them.

   One of the things worthy to be noticed in our Lord's Character is His
   wonderful quiet spirit, especially His marvelous calmness in the
   presence of those who misjudged, insulted and slandered Him. He is
   reviled often, but never ruffled. He is often in deaths but always full
   of life. No doubt He felt keenly all the contradictions of sinners
   against Himself, for in a passage in the Psalms which refers to the
   Messiah, we read, "Reproach has broken My heart," yet the Lord Jesus
   did not permit His feelings to overcome Him--He was quiet and
   self-possessed, acting with a profound disregard of the calumnies and
   assaults of His bitter enemies.

   One reason, I take it, for His being so self-contained was that He was
   never elated by the praise of men. Take my word for it, for I know,
   that if you ever allow yourself to be pleased by those who speak well
   of you, to that extent you will be capable of being grieved by those
   who speak ill of you! But if you have learned (and it is a hard lesson
   for the most of us) that you are not the servant of men, but of God and
   that, therefore, you will not live upon the breath of men's nostrils if
   they praise you--and you will not die if they denounce you--then you
   will be strong and show that you have come to the stature of a man in
   Christ Jesus. If the great Master's head had been turned by the
   hosannas of the multitude, then His heart would have sunk within Him
   when they cried, "Crucify Him, crucify Him!" But He was neither lifted
   up nor cast down by men--He committed Himself unto no man because He
   knew what was in man!

   The innermost reason for this quiet of heart was His unbroken communion
   with the Father. Jesus dwelt apart, for He lived with God--the Son of
   Man who came down from Heaven still dwelt in Heaven, serenely patient
   because He was raised above earthly things in the holy contemplations
   of His perfect mind. Because His heart was with His Father, the Father
   made Him strong to bear anything that might come from men. Oh, that we
   all could wear this armor of the Light of God, the celestial panoply of
   communion with the High Eternal One! Then we would not be afraid of
   evil tidings, or of evil occurrences, for our hearts would be fixed on
   the sure Rock of Jehovah's unchanging love!

   There was, perhaps, another reason for our Savior's wonderful composure
   when He was attacked with stones, namely, that His heart was so set
   upon His work that He could not be turned away from it whatever the
   unbelieving Jews might do. The ruling passion bore Him on through
   danger and suffering--and made Him calmly defy all opposition. He had
   come into the world to bless men and He must bless men. The Jews might
   oppose Him for this reason and for that, but they could not turn the
   current of His soul from the riverbed of mercy along which it rushed
   like a torrent. He must do good to the suffering and the poor! He could
   not help it--His face was set like flint towards His lifework!

   It had become His meat and His drink to do the will of Him that sent
   Him and so, when they took up stones, although He withdrew Himself a
   little, yet as He only wished to preserve His life to do good, He
   returned to His lifework

   without a moment's delay! Stones cannot drive Him from His gracious
   pursuits. As we have seen a parent bird, chased away, for a moment,
   from its nest, return to it the instant the intruder has withdrawn, so
   do we see our Lord come back to His holy work almost before He is out
   of the sight of His would-be murderers!

   Yonder sits a blind man and Jesus is at once at his side to heal him.
   They will overtake You, O Christ! They will seek to slay You! There are
   more stones in their cruel hands! Your haters hurl their missiles
   fiercely and they will be upon You in a moment! What cares He for that?
   No coward spirit can make Him overlook an occasion for glorifying the
   Father! That blind man must be attended to and at all hazards. He stops
   to deal with Him in love. If you and I become completely taken up with
   zeal for God and with the desire to win souls, then nothing will daunt
   us. We shall bear anything and not seem to have anything to bear! We
   shall hear slander as though we heard it not and endure hardship as
   though there were none to endure.

   As an arrow from a bow shot by an strong archer, defies the opposing
   wind and speeds forward to the white of the target, so shall we fly
   forward towards the great objective of our compassionate ambition.
   Happy is that man whom God has launched like a thunderbolt from His
   hand--who must go on and fulfill his destiny--happy that it is his
   vocation to bring sinners to the Savior's feet! O Blessed Spirit, lift
   us up to dwell in God and so to sympathize with His fatherly compassion
   that we may heed neither stones, nor sneers, nor slanders, but become
   absorbed in our self-denying service for Jesus' sake!

   Let that stand for an introduction. The Savior in His worst and lowest
   estate, when near to death, thinks of nothing but the good of men! When
   cruel eyes are spying Him out that they may slay Him, He has an eye for
   the poor blind. There is no stone in His heart towards the sorrowful
   even when stones are flying past His ears!

   I. So I introduce you, tonight, to the first topic of the present
   discourse, which is THE WORKER. I give that as a well-earned title to
   the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Worker, the Chief Worker and the
   Example to all workers. He came into the world, He says, to do the will
   of Him that sent Him and to finish His work. On this occasion, when He
   is pursued by His enemies, He is still a worker--a wonder-worker with
   the blind man. There are many in this world who ignore sorrow, who pass
   by grief, who are deaf to lamentation and blind to distress.

   The easiest thing that I know of to do with this wicked, wretched city
   of London is not to know much about it. They say that half the world
   knows not how the other half lives! Surely if it did, it would not live
   so carelessly as it does, or be quite as cruel as it is. There are
   sights in this metropolis that might melt a heart of steel and make a
   Nabal generous! But it is an easy way of escaping from the exercise of
   benevolence to shut your eyes and see nothing of the abject misery
   which is groveling at your feet. "Where ignorance is bliss it is folly
   to be wise"--so said some easygoing ignoramus of old! If beggars are
   importunate, then passersby must be deaf. If sinners are profane, it is
   a simple matter to stop your ears and hurry on.

   If this blind man must necessarily sit and beg at the gate of the
   Temple, then those who frequent the Temple must just slip by as if they
   were as blind as he. Crowds pass by and take no notice of him. Is not
   that the way with the multitude today? If you are in trouble--if you
   are suffering heartbreak--do they not ignore you and go their way to
   their farm and to their merchandise, though you lie down and starve?
   Dives finds it convenient to remain ignorant of the sores of Lazarus.
   It is not so with Jesus! He has a quick eye to see the blind beggar if
   He sees nothing else. If He is not enraptured with the massive stones
   and the beautiful architecture of the temple, yet He fixes His eyes
   upon a sightless mendicant at the Temple gate. He is all eyes, all
   ears, all heart, all hands where misery is present. My Master is made
   of tenderness! He melts with love. O true souls who love Him, copy Him
   in this, and always let your hearts be touched with a fellow
   being--feeling for the suffering and the sinning!

   There are others who, though they see misery, do not diminish it by
   warm sympathy, but increase it by their cold logical conclusions.
   "Poverty," they say--"Yes. Well--that, of course, is brought on by
   drunkenness and by laziness and by all sorts of vice." I do not say
   that it is not so in every case, but I do say that the observation will
   not help a poor man to become either better or happier! Such a hard
   remark will rather exasperate the hardened than assist the struggling.
   "Sickness," say some--"Oh, no doubt, a great deal of sickness is caused
   by wicked habits, neglect of sanitary laws, and so on." This may be
   sadly true, but it grates on a sufferer's ears--a very kind and
   pleasing doctrine to teach in the wards of our hospitals! I would
   recommend you not to teach it till you are ill, yourself, and then,
   perhaps, the doctrine may not seem quite so instructive.

   Even Christ's disciples, when they saw this blind man, thought that
   there must be something particularly wicked about his father and
   mother, or something especially vicious about the man, himself, which
   God foresaw and, on account of which, He punished him with blindness!
   The disciples were of the same spirit as Job's three comforters, who,
   when they saw the Patriarch on a dunghill, bereft of all his children,
   robbed of all his property and scraping himself because he was covered
   with sores, said, "Of course he must be a hypocrite. He must have done
   something very dreadful, or he would not be so grievously afflicted."
   The world will still stick to its unfounded belief that if the Tower of
   Siloam falls upon any men, they must be sinners above all sinners upon
   the face of the earth!

   A cruel doctrine, a vile doctrine, fit for savages, but not to be
   mentioned by Christians who know that whom the Lord loves He chastens!
   Yet I do see a good deal of this cruel notion about. And if men are in
   trouble, I hear it muttered, "Well, of course they brought it on
   themselves." Is this your way of cheering them? Cheap moral
   observations steeped in vinegar make a poor dish for an invalid! Such
   censures are a sorry way of helping a lame dog over a stile--no, it is
   putting up another stile for him so that he cannot get over it at all!
   Now I mark this of my Lord--that it is written of Him that He "gives to
   all men liberally, and upbraids not." When He fed those thousands in
   the wilderness, it would have been most just if He had said to them,
   "Why did you all come out into the wilderness and not bring provisions
   with you? What have you to do out here without something to eat? You
   are unthrifty and deserve to starve!" No, no! He never said a word of
   the sort, but He fed them, fed them all and sent them home filled!

   You and I are not sent into the world to thunder out commandments from
   the top of Sinai--we are come unto Mount Zion! We are not to go on
   circuit as if we were judge and hangman rolled into one, to meet all
   the sorrow and misery in the world with bitter words of censure and
   condemnation. If we do so, how different we are from that blessed
   Master of ours who says not a word by way of rebuke to those who seek
   Him, but simply feeds the hungry and heals all those who have need of
   healing! It is easy to criticize. It is easy to upbraid. But ours
   should be the higher and nobler task of blessing and saving!

   I notice, yet again, that there are certain others who, if they are not
   indifferent to sorrow and do not pitch upon some cruel theory of
   condemnation, nevertheless speculate a good deal where speculation can
   be of no practical service. When we get together, there are many
   questions which we like to raise and dispute upon which are of no
   practical value whatever. There is the question of the origin of evil.
   That is a fine subject for those who like to chop logic by the week
   without making enough chips to light a fire for cold hands to warm!
   Such was the subject proposed to the Savior-- foreseen guilt, or
   hereditary taint--"Who did sin, this man, or his parents?" How far is
   it right that the sin of parents should, as it often does, fall upon
   the children?

   I could propose to you a great many topics equally profound and
   curious, but what would be the use? Yet there are many in the world who
   are fond of these topics, spinning cobwebs, blowing bubbles, making
   theories, breaking them, and making more! I wonder whether the world
   was ever blessed to the extent of a bad farthing by all the theories of
   all the learned men that have ever lived? May they not all be put down
   under the head of vain jangling? I would rather create an ounce of help
   than a ton of theory! It is beautiful to me to see how the Master
   breaks up the fine speculation which the disciples are setting forth.
   He says somewhat shortly, "Neither has this man sinned, nor his
   parents." And then He spits on the ground, makes clay and opens the
   blind man's eyes! This was work, the other was mere worry.

   "Father," said a boy, "the cows are in the corn. How did they get in?"
   "Boy," said the father, "never mind how they got in, let us hurry up
   and get them out!" There is common sense about that practical
   proceeding. Here are these people sunken in vice and steeped in
   poverty. Postpone the inquiries as to how they got into this condition!
   What is the origin of moral evil? How is it transmitted from parent to
   child? Answer those questions after the Day of Judgment, when you will
   have more light! But just now, the great thing is to see how you and I
   can get evil out of the world and how we can lift up the fallen and
   restore those who have gone astray!

   Never let us imitate the man in the fable who saw a boy drowning and
   then and there lectured him upon the imprudence of swimming out in the
   deep water. No, no! Let us land the boy on the bank, dry him and dress
   him--and then tell him not to go there again, lest a worse thing happen
   to him! I say that the Master was no speculator--He was no spinner of
   theories; He was no mere doctrinalist--but He went to work and healed
   those that had need of healing. Now, in this, He is the great Example
   for us all in this year of Grace. Come, what have we ever done to bless
   our fellow men? Many of

   us are followers of Christ and, oh, how happy we ought to be that we
   are! What have we ever done worthy of our high calling?

   "Sir, I heard a lecture the other night," says one, "upon the evils of
   intemperance." Is that all you did? Has any action come of that
   brilliant oration and of your careful attention to it? Did you
   straightway try to remove this intemperance by your example? "Well, I
   shall think of that, Sir, one of these days." Meanwhile what is to
   become of these intemperate ones? Will not their blood lie at your
   door? "I heard the other day," says one, "a very forcible and
   interesting lecture upon political economy. I feel that it is a very
   weighty science and can explain much of the poverty you mention."
   Perhaps so--but political economy in itself is about as hard as brass!
   It has no heart, or conscience--neither can it make allowance for such
   things.

   The political economist is a man of iron who would be rusted by a tear
   and, therefore, never tolerates the mood of compassion. His science is
   a rock which will wreck a navy and remain unmoved by the cries of
   drowning men and women! It is as the moon of the desert which withers
   all it blows upon. It seems to dry up men's souls when they get to be
   masters of it, or rather are mastered by it. It is a science of
   stubborn facts which would not be facts if we were not so brutish.
   Political economy or no political economy, I come back to my
   point--What have you done for others? Let us think of that and if any
   of us have been dreaming, day after day, what we would do "if--let us
   see what we can do now and, like the Savior, get to work!

   Yet that is not the point which I am driving at. It is this. If Jesus
   is such a worker and no theorizer, then what a hope there is, tonight,
   for some of us who need His care! Have we fallen? Are we poor? Have we
   brought ourselves into sorrow and misery? Do not let us look to men or
   to ourselves for the answers! Men will let us starve and then they will
   hold a coroner's inquest over our body to find why we dared to die and
   so necessitated the paying for a grave and a coffin! They will be sure
   to make an inquiry after it is all over with us! But if we come to
   Jesus Christ, He will make no inquiry at all, but receive us and give
   rest unto our souls. That is a blessed text, "He gives to all men
   liberally, and upbraids not."

   When the prodigal son came home to his father, according to all
   propriety, as people would do, nowadays, the father should have said to
   his son, "Well, you have come home and I am glad to see you, but what a
   state you are in! How did you get into this condition? Why, you have
   scarcely a clean rag on your back! How is it you have become so poor?
   And you are lean and hungry--how did this comes about? Where have you
   been? What have you done? What company have you kept? Where were you a
   week ago? What were you doing the day before yesterday at seven
   o'clock?"

   His father never asked him a single question, but pressed him to his
   bosom, and knew all about it by instinct! He came as he was and his
   father received him as he was. The father seemed, with a kiss, to say,
   "My boy, bygones are bygones. You were dead but you are alive. You were
   lost but you are found and I inquire no further." That is just how
   Jesus Christ is willing to receive penitent sinners tonight! Is there a
   streetwalker here? Come, poor woman, as you are, to your dear Lord and
   Master who will cleanse you of your grievous sin. "All manner of sin
   and blasphemy shall be forgiven."

   Is there one here who has transgressed against the rules of society and
   is pointed at as especially sinful? Yet, come, and welcome to the Lord
   Jesus of whom it is written, "This Man receives sinners, and eats with
   them." The physician never thinks it scorn to go among the sick and
   Christ never felt it shame that He looks after the guilty and the lost!
   No, write this about Him--"The Savior of sinners, even of the very
   chief." He counts this His glory! He will work for you, not chide you!
   He will not treat you with a dose of theories and with a host of bitter
   rebukes, but He will receive you just as you are into the wounds of His
   side and hide you there from the wrath of God! Oh, blessed Gospel that
   I have to preach to you! May the Holy Spirit lead you to embrace it!

   So much concerning the Worker.

   II. Now, the second thing is THE WORKROOM. Every worker needs a place
   to work. Every artist must have a studio. Did Christ have a studio?
   Yes, He came to do very wonderful works--the works of Him that sent
   Him--but what a strange, strange place the Lord found to do His work!
   And yet I do not know that He could have found any other. He resolved
   to work the works of God and He selected the fittest place for doing
   so. One of the works of God is creation. If Jesus is to perform this
   work among men, He must find out where something is missing which He
   can supply by a creating act. Here are two eyes without the proper
   light-receiving apparatus--here there is room for Jesus to create eyes
   and sight! He could not have created eyes in my head or in yours had we
   been present, for eyes are already there, and more eyes would be
   unsuitable for us.

   In the blind beggar of the Temple there was room for Jesus to produce
   that which was lacking in the curious mechanism of the eyes--the blind
   eyes were, therefore, His workshop. If there were eyeballs, they were
   completely sightless and had been from the man's birth--and this gave
   the occasion for Jehovah Jesus to say, "Let there be light!" If that
   man's eyes had been like yours and mine--clear and bright and full of
   light--there would have been no space for our Lord's Divine operation.
   But since he was still in the darkness which had been about him from
   his birth, his eyes afforded space in which the power of the Almighty
   might be manifested by a work so wonderful that since the world began
   it had never been heard that anyone had opened the eyes of a man who
   was born blind!

   The man was blind for this reason--"That the works of God should be
   made manifest in him." Oh, and that is a blessed thought if you will
   think about it! Apply it to yourself. If there is anything lacking in
   you, there is room for Christ to work in you! If you are naturally
   perfect and there is no fault in you, then there is no room for the
   Savior to do anything for you, for He will not gild refined gold, nor
   lay enamel on the lily! But if you suffer from some great deficiency,
   some awful lack that makes your soul sit in darkness--your necessity is
   Christ's opportunity--your need of Grace supplies His need of objects
   for His pity! Here is room for the Savior to come and display His pity
   towards you and you may be sure He will soon be with you. Even so, come
   Lord Jesus!

   Then, again, it was not only this man's deficiency of sight, but it was
   this man's ignorance which required Almighty aid. It is a work of God
   not only to create, but also to illuminate! The same power which calls
   into existence also calls into light, whether that light is natural or
   spiritual. It is a Divine work to enlighten and regenerate the heart.
   This man was as dark in mind as he was in body--what a grand thing to
   enlighten him in a double sense! He did not know the Son of God,
   therefore he did not believe in Him, but asked in wonder, "Who is He,
   Lord, that I might believe on Him?" Jesus Christ came to work in this
   man the knowledge of God, the life of God--in a word, SALVATION--and
   because the man was destitute of these things, there was room in him
   for the Savior's skill and power!

   Friend, is that your case? Are you unconverted? Then there is space in
   you for the Redeemer to work by converting Grace! Are you unregenerate?
   Then there is space in you for the Spirit of God to work regeneration!
   All these spiritual deficiencies of yours--your ignorance and your
   darkness--shall be turned, by Infinite Love, into opportunities for
   Grace. If you were not lost, you could not be saved! If you were not
   guilty, you could not be pardoned. If you were not sinful, you could
   not be cleansed! But all your sin and sorrow, by a strange mystery of
   love, is a sort of qualification of yourself for Christ to come and
   save you!

   "That is putting it," says one, "in a new light to me." Accept that new
   light and be comforted, for it is Gospel Light and intended to cheer
   the despairing! You have said, "There is nothing in me"--therefore it
   is clear that there is room for Christ to be your All in All. You see
   there cannot be two all in alls--there can be but one--and as you do
   not pretend to the title, Jesus will wear it! All the space that you
   occupy in your own esteem takes so much away from the glory of the Lord
   Jesus. But if you are nothing, then the whole house is left for the
   Savior! He will come and fill up all your inward vacuum with His own
   dear Self and be glorious in your eyes forever! Pray to be nothing!

   I may venture to say, tonight, that all affliction may be regarded in
   the same manner as affording opportunity for the mercy work of God.
   Whenever you see a man in sorrow and trouble, the way to look at it is
   not to blame him and inquire how he came there, but to say, "Here is an
   opening for God's almighty love! Here is an occasion for the display of
   the Grace and goodness of the Lord!" This man, being blind, gave the
   Lord Jesus opportunity for the good work of giving him his sight and
   that work was so great a wonder that all around were obliged to
   acknowledge it and admire it! The neighbors began to inquire about it.
   The Pharisees had to hold a conclave over it and though nearly 19
   centuries have slipped away, here are we at this hour meditating upon
   it!

   That man's opened eyes are enlightening our eyes at this hour! The
   Bible would not have been complete without this touching and teaching
   narrative--if this man had not been born blind and if Christ had not
   opened his eyes, all generations would have had less Light of God! We
   ought to be glad that this man was so grievously afflicted, for thereby
   we are graciously instructed! If he had not been sightless, we had not
   seen the great sight of blindness at birth chased away by Him who is
   the Light of men! So I think I may say to all afflicted ones here
   tonight--Do not kick at your afflictions. Do not be excessively
   troubled by them, or utterly cast down by them, but hopefully regard
   them as openings for mercy, gates for Grace, roadways for love! The
   valley of Achor shall be to you a door of hope!

   That mighty Worker of whom I have been speaking will find a workshop in
   your affliction and therein He will fashion monuments of His Grace.
   Glory in your infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon you!
   Rejoice that as your tribulations abound, so, also, shall your
   consolations abound by Christ Jesus. Ask Him to make all things work
   together for your good and for His Glory and so it shall be! I leave
   the thought of the workshop when I have added that I do believe that
   sin, itself, has somewhat of the same aspect as affliction, for it
   makes room for the mercy of God. I hardly dare say what Augustine said,
   when speaking of the Fall and of the sin of Adam, and looking to all
   the splendor of Grace that followed after it. He said, "Beata
   culpa"--happy fault--as if he thought that sin had furnished such
   opportunities for the unveiling of the Grace of God and so displayed
   the Character of Christ, that He even dared to call it a happy fault!

   I will not venture upon such an expression. I scarcely dare do more
   than repeat what that great master in Israel once said. But I do say
   that I cannot imagine an occasion for glorifying God equal to the fact
   that man has sinned, since God has given Christ to die for sinners. How
   could that unspeakable Gift have been bestowed if there had been no
   sinners? The Cross is a constellation of Divine Glory brighter than
   creation itself!--

   "For in the Grace that rescued man, His noblest form of Glory shines;
   Here on the Cross 'tis fairest writ In precious blood and crimson
   lines." How could we have known the heart of God? How could we have
   understood the mercy of God? If it had not been for our sin and misery,
   how could such forbearance and love have been displayed? Come, then,
   guilty ones, take heart and look for Grace! As a physician needs the
   sick that he may exert his healing power, so does the Lord of Mercy
   need you that He may show what Grace He can bestow!

   If I were a physician and desired a practice, I Would not inquire for
   the healthiest parish in England, but for a position where the sick
   would fill my surgery. If all I sought was to do good to my fellow men,
   I should desire to be in Egypt or some other land visited by cholera,
   or plague, where I could save human life. The Lord Jesus Christ,
   looking over this throng tonight, seeks not those who are good, or
   think themselves so, but for the guilty who know their sinnership and
   bemoan it! If there is a sinner here, leprous and defiled. If there is
   a soul here sick from head to foot with the incurable disease of sin,
   the Lord Christ, the mighty Worker, looks on him, for in him He finds a
   laboratory in which He may work the works of Him that sent Him!

   III. Please bear with me, now, as I pass on, in the third place,
   briefly to notice THE WORK BELL. You hear early in the morning a bell
   which awakens the workers from their beds. See how they troop into the
   streets, swarming like bees hastening to or from the hive. You see them
   going forth to labor, for the bell is ringing! There was a work bell
   for Christ and He heard it. Then He said, "I must work. I must work. I
   must work." What made Him say that? Why, the sight of that blind man!
   He no sooner saw him than He said, "I must work." The man had not asked
   anything, nor uttered a sound, but those sightless orbs spoke
   eloquently to the heart of the Lord Jesus and rang aloud the summons
   which Jesus heard and obeyed, for He, Himself said, "I must work."

   And why must He work? Why, He had come all the way from Heaven to do
   so! He had come from His Father's Throne to be a Man to bless men and
   He would not cause His long descent to go for nothing! He must
   work--why else was He here where work was to be done? Besides, there
   were impulses in His heart which we need not stop, now, to explain,
   which forced Him to work. His mind, His soul, His heart, were all full
   of a Force which produced perpetual activity. Sometimes He selected a
   route when He was traveling because, "He must go through Samaria."
   Sometimes He went after men because, He said, "Other sheep I have,
   which are not of this fold: them also I must bring." There was a sort
   of instinct in Christ to save men and that instinct craved
   gratification and could not be denied. "I must work," He said.

   The sight of those blind eyes made Him say "I must work." And He
   thought of that poor man--how for 20 years and more he had lived in
   utter darkness--how he had not been able to enjoy the beauties of
   Nature, or look his loved ones in the face, or earn his daily bread.
   And He pitied the sorrows of the man in a life-long darkness. Moreover,
   as He recollected how that man's soul had also been shut up like a
   prisoner in a dungeon by reason of gross ignorance, He said, "I must
   work, I must work." You see they are after Him with stones, but He
   stops, for He says "I must work. They may stone Me if they will, but I
   must work. I hear the summons and I must work."

   Now learn this lesson, all you followers of Christ. Whenever you see
   suffering, I hope you will each one feel, "I must work. I must help."
   Whenever you witness poverty, whenever you behold vice, say to
   yourself, "I must work. I must

   work." If you are worthy of the Christ whom you call Leader, let all
   the necessities of men impel you, compel you, constrain you to be
   blessing them. Let the world which lies in the Wicked One awaken you!
   Let the cries of men of Macedonia awaken you as they say, "Come over
   and help us!" Men are dying, dying in the dark. The cemetery is filling
   and Hell is filling, too! Men are dying without hope and are passing
   into the eternal night. "I must work."

   They cry--"Master, spare Yourself! Incessant labor will wear You down
   and bring You to Your grave." But look! Look! Look! Perdition swallows
   crowds! They go down, alive, into the Pit! Listen to their doleful
   cries! Lost souls are being shut out from God! "I must work." Oh, that
   I could lay my hands--or, far better--that my Master would lay His
   pierced hands on every true Christian here and press them upon him
   until he cried out, "I cannot sit here! I must be at work as soon as
   this service is done! I must not only hear and give, and pray, but I
   must also work!"

   Well, that is a grand lesson, but I do not mean it to be the chief one,
   for I am looking out for those who long to find mercy and salvation!
   What a blessing it is for you, dear Friend, if you desire to be saved,
   that Christ must save! There is an impulse upon Him that He must save!
   I know you say, "I cannot pray. I cannot feel as I wish to do." Never
   mind about that--the matter is in abler hands. You see, this man did
   not say a word--the sight of Him was enough to move the heart of the
   Lord Jesus! As soon as Jesus had seen him, He said, "I must work." Have
   you ever seen a man in London who has no particular oratory skills and
   yet succeeds in obtaining alms on a large scale? I have seen him! He
   dresses like a laborer. He wears a tattered smock frock and he sits
   down in a corner where many pass by.

   His squatting place is a little out of the rush of traffic, but near
   enough to secure attention from many passengers. He displays a spade
   much the worse for the use made of it by somebody else, and on it is
   written, "I am starving!" He looks gaunt and hungry. He is exceedingly
   well made up and is as pale as chalk can make him! Oh, the quantity of
   halfpence that go into his old hat! How people pity him! He does not
   sing a mournful ditty. He does not speak a word and yet many are moved
   by the fact that he looks as if it were true that he is starving!

   Now, my Hearer, you need not be false in what you do if you set out
   your misery and sin before the Lord. Tonight, when you get home, kneel
   at your bedside and say, "Lord Jesus, I cannot pray, but here I am. I
   am perishing and I put myself within sight of You. Instead of hearing
   my pleas, look at my sins. Instead of demanding arguments, look at my
   wickedness. Instead of oratory, which I have none, Lord, remember that
   I shall soon be in Hell if You do not save me."

   I tell you, the bell will ring and the Great Worker will feel that the
   time has come for Him to labor! He will say in the words of my text, "I
   must work," and in you the works of God shall be made manifest! You
   shall be the workshop of

   Christ!

   IV. One more head and that is THE WORKDAY. Our Divine Master said, "I
   must work the works of Him that sent me, while it is day: the night
   comes, when no man can work." Now, listen. This is not meant about
   Christ, the risen Savior, but this refers to the Lord Jesus Christ as
   He was Man here on earth. There was a certain day in which He could
   bless men and when that day was over He would be gone--there would be
   no Jesus Christ on earth to open blind men's eyes, or to heal the
   sick--He would be gone from among men and be no more approachable as
   the healer of bodily disease. Our Lord, as a Man here on earth, had a
   day. It was only a day--a short period, and not very long--He could not
   make it longer, for it was settled by the great Lord.

   The day of His Sacrifice was appointed. He, Himself, once said, "My
   hour is not yet come." But that hour did come. Our Lord occupied 30
   years in getting ready for His lifework and then in three years His
   warfare was accomplished. How much He crowded into those three years!
   Centuries of service could not equal the labor of that brief period.
   Brothers, some of us have had 30 years of work, but we have done very
   little, I am afraid. And what if we have only three years more? Let us
   feel the impulses of the coming eternity! Within a little while I shall
   no more look into the faces of the throng--they will remember me but as
   a name--therefore I will preach as best I can while my powers remain
   and my life is prolonged.

   Within a little while, my Brother, you will not be able to go from door
   to door winning souls--the street will miss you and your tracts--the
   District will miss you and your regular visits. Do your work well, for
   your sun will soon set. These words of mine may be more prophetic to
   some present than we dream. I may be speaking to some who are nearing
   their last hour and shall soon render in their account. Up Brothers! Up
   Sisters! Say, "We must work, for the night comes in which no man can
   work." Life cannot be made longer if we wish to make it
   so--predestination will not lengthen out the thread when the hour has
   come to cut it off! Life will be short at the very longest and O, how
   short with those who

   die young! If you and I shall omit any part of our lifework, we can
   never make up the omission. I speak with solemn reverence of our Divine
   Master, but, if He had not healed that blind man in the days in which
   He lived on earth, He would have missed a part of the business upon
   which the Father sent Him.

   I do not mean that as God, out of Heaven, He might not have given the
   poor beggar sight, but that makes the case the more stern in its
   bearing upon us since we have no such future to expect--if we do not
   serve men now, it will be out of our power to bless them from the
   skies. This narrative could never have appeared in the life of the Son
   of Man had He forgotten to be gracious to the blind man! His period of
   sojourn here below was the time for our Lord to work--if He had come
   back from Heaven to heal the man, that would have been done in a Second
   Advent and not in the first! And if He omits anything from His first
   errand, below, it cannot be put in again.

   When you and I have written a letter we add a postscript. When we have
   made a book we can write an appendix or insert something that we have
   left out. But to this life of yours and mine there can be no
   postscript! We must do our work now, or never and, if we do not do it
   now, even now, while our opportunity serves us to perform our service
   to our God, we can never do it! If you omitted anything yesterday, you
   cannot alter the fact of imperfect service on that day. If you are more
   zealous, now, it will be the work of today--but yesterday will still
   remain as incomplete as you left it. We must, therefore, be on the
   alert to do the work of Him that sent us while it is called today.

   To this conclusion I come and here draw to a close--if our Lord Jesus
   Christ was so diligent to bless men when He was here, I feel certain
   that He is not less diligent to hear and heal them, now, in that
   spiritual sense in which He still works upon men. Oh, that I knew how
   to lead you to seek my Lord and Master! For if you seek Him, He will be
   found of you as surely as you seek Him! Christ has not lost the heart
   of His compassion! He is not cold in heart or slack in hand. Go to Him
   at once! I spoke, just now, to some of the chief of sinners, and I say
   to them again--Go to Jesus!

   Let me speak to some of you who are not the chief of sinners--you that
   have been hearers of the Gospel and have only failed because you do not
   believe in Jesus. Go to Him at once! You are backward, but He is not.
   He must still work, and still work while the Gospel Day lasts, for that
   Gospel Day will soon close. He is waiting and watching for you. Oh,
   come to Him--come even now! "I do not know what it is to come," says
   one. Well, to come to Christ is simply to trust Him. You are
   guilty--trust Him to pardon you. "If I do that," says one, "may I then
   live as I did before?" No, that you cannot, for if a ship needed to be
   brought into harbor and they took a pilot on board, he would say to the
   captain, "Captain, if you trust me, I will get you into harbor all
   right. There, let that sail be taken down."

   But they do not reef it. "Come," he says, "attend to the tiller and
   steer as I bid you." But they refuse. "Well," says the pilot, "you said
   you trusted me." "Yes," says the captain, "and you said that if we
   trusted you, you would get us into port, but we have not got into port
   at all." "No," says the pilot, "you do not trust me, for if you trusted
   me you would do as I tell you."

   A true trust is obedient to the Lord's commands and these forbid sin.
   If you trust Jesus, you must leave your sins and take up your cross and
   follow Him. Such trust shall surely have its reward--you shall be saved
   now and saved forever! God bless you, dear Friends, for Christ's sake.

The Top of the Ladder

   (No. 1755)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 25, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And to know the love of Christ, whichpasses knowledge, thatyou might
   be filled with all the fullness of God." Ephesians 3:19.

   THIS is a part of Paul's prayer for the Ephesian believers. It is the
   closing clause and consummation of it. It mentions the grandest gift
   for which he prayed. His prayer was like that ladder which Jacob saw,
   the top of which reached to Heaven and God--and the Apostle at the foot
   of it was not asleep--but looking up with eager eyes and marking each
   rising rung of light. Be it ours by sweet experience to ascend that
   staircase of light! May the Holy Spirit reveal it to us even now! You
   must begin to read at the 14th verse--"For this cause I bow my knees
   unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in
   Heaven and earth is named, that"--this is one rung of the ladder. "That
   He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be
   strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man, that"-- here
   comes the second rung--one step helps you to reach the next and you are
   strengthened that you may rise higher and enjoy a further privilege!

   "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that"--this is the
   third rung. Oh, that the Holy Spirit may help you at once take a firm
   footing upon it! "That you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be
   able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and
   depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passes
   knowledge." Surely we are at the top of the ladder now, are we not?
   What a height! How glorious is the view! How solid the standing! How
   exhilarating the sense of communion with all saints and with the Lord
   of saints! Yet this is not the top of it! Here is another step--"that
   you might be filled with all the fullness of God." You see that the
   prayer begins with the gracious petition that we may be
   strengthened--"strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man,
   according to the riches of His glory."

   The objective is that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith. Before
   the Lord can dwell in us, we must be strength-ened--mentally and
   spiritually strengthened. To entertain the High and Holy One--to
   receive into our soul the indwelling Christ--it is necessary that the
   temple be strengthened, that there be more power put into every pillar
   and into every stone of the edifice. It is taken for granted that we
   have already been washed and cleansed and so made fit for Christ to
   come and dwell within us. But we also need to be strengthened, for,
   unless we become stronger in all spiritual life, how is Christ to dwell
   in our hearts by faith? Unless we become stronger in love and in all
   the Graces of the Spirit, how can we worthily entertain such a Guest as
   the Lord Jesus?

   Yes, and we even need that our spiritual perception should be
   strengthened, that we may be able to know Him when He does come and
   dwell in us. We need that our spirit should be elevated and lifted into
   a higher condition than as yet it has known in order that we may be on
   a platform where we can have communion with Christ and may, by a
   heavenly enlargement of mind and heart, be made able, to the fullest,
   to entertain the Lord of Glory! We must be strengthened into stability
   of mind, that so Christ may dwell, abide, reside in our hearts by
   faith. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, everything has to be done for us, for
   even when we are made clean enough for Christ to enter us, we are not
   strong enough! Even when the Lord has taken away the defilement so that
   "sin no longer lies at the door" to shut Him out, yet even then we are
   too feeble to entertain so great a Guest!

   We should be like Peter, who, when Christ came into his boat and filled
   it with fish, was too feeble to receive Him and, therefore, cried out
   in an agony of weakness, "Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O
   Lord." "Oh," says one, "I would never say that." I do not know,
   Brother. If the Lord were to favor you with such Divine manifestations
   as He has given to the stronger saints, you might be overcome and swoon
   with inward faintness, almost desiring that Christ would not draw so
   near to you. If the Lord should appear to you in His Glory, you would
   be afraid and, like John in the Apoca-

   lypse, fall at His feet as dead. You need to be strengthened, for how
   else could you endure the vision of His splendor or the divine
   excitement of His infinite love?

   Paul, therefore, begins his requests for the Ephesians with a prayer
   for more strength for their inner man. Let us pray it tonight--"O Holy
   Spirit, strengthen my feeble mind that I may be able to receive more of
   my Lord! Give me more capacity; give me a clearer perception; give me a
   better memory; give me an intense affection; give me a larger faith."
   This is the first prayer that you may be strengthened according to the
   riches of His Glory with might, by His Spirit, in the inner man. Be
   eager for this! Plead now with all your hearts for me and for
   yourselves, that we may all be strengthened by the power of the Spirit
   of our God!

   Now, having stood on the first step of the ladder, Paul goes on to pray
   that when we are strengthened, we may be inhabited--that Christ may
   dwell in our hearts by faith. When the house is ready to receive Him
   and strong enough for such a wondrous Inhabitant, may Jesus come, not
   to look about Him as He did when He went into the Temple--for we read
   that He looked round about Him with indignation and did not remain
   there--but may He come on purpose to abide with us! May He come, not to
   tarry for a night and give us some transient visits of His love, sweet
   as that would be, but, "that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith."

   This will make you living temples for the indwelling Lord! Oh, but this
   is a great prayer! And when you are strengthened to receive so sacred a
   Gift, may the Lord fulfill it to you till your communion with Christ
   shall be constant all the while you are awake! And when you awake in
   the night, may you still be with Him, being even now, "forever with the
   Lord." I pray that you may no longer envy the disciples in their walk
   to Emmaus, as though they were the most privileged of all mankind
   because they had one walk with Jesus--but may your fellowship be such
   that you entertain the Savior day and night! Going, may you take Him
   where you go. And staying, find Him where you stay. May you have His
   perpetual, unclouded Presence with you, being strengthened up to that
   mark, for it is not every man that is capable of it.

   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, you must aspire to the power of Grace at its
   fullest! Pray to be strengthened by the Spirit of God until Christ
   shall reside in your hearts by faith! Pray that you may always see Him
   within you, having so clear a view of what Jesus is and what He has
   done, that you may never again be vexed with doubts concerning Him or
   His Word. May you have such familiar communion with Him that you may
   believe Him implicitly and never dream of distrusting Him. As a child
   lies on its mother's bosom, so may you rest upon the love of Christ,
   leaning all your weight upon Him. May you never have to inquire for
   your Well-Beloved, but know that He abides within you, as surely as
   your heart remains in living energy within your body. Be not afraid to
   ask, and seek, and believe for this--the ladder is meant to be climbed!
   This experience is attainable! Christ may dwell in your hearts by
   faith!

   This second step of the ladder is worth reaching. Rise to it, you
   struggling Believers! The Lord bring us all to it by the Holy Spirit!
   And when we climb thus far, what next? This third step is a broad one
   and it has three parts to it. Its first part is establishment--"That
   you, being rooted and grounded in love." When you are strengthened and
   when Jesus dwells in your heart, then you are no longer "carried about
   with every wind of doctrine," but you are rooted, like a cedar in
   Lebanon which receives but fears not the stormy wind. You are no longer
   upset by doubts and fears, as a bowing wall is thrown over by a breeze,
   for you are grounded like a well-built house, settled on its rocky
   foundation. Your wall has made its last settlement and has settled down
   upon the eternal Foundation which can never be removed--"Jesus Christ,
   the same yesterday, today, and forever."

   No man attains to this rooted and grounded state unless Christ dwells
   in his heart. The indwelling is necessary to the settlement of the
   house. He that has Jesus dwelling in him laughs to scorn the whimsies
   and fancies which men call philosophies. He knows nothing about
   "advanced thought," for, by the Grace of God, he has advanced as far as
   he needs to advance since he has come to live in Christ and Christ has
   come to live in him! What is there beyond this as to firmness of basis
   and foundation? If there is anything beyond this, we do not know it,
   nor want to know it! We are perfectly content and satisfied to remain
   with the love of Christ abiding in our souls--"that Christ may dwell in
   our hearts, that we may be rooted and grounded in love."

   Oh, when the heart gets grounded in love--when it loves Christ and
   feels the love of Christ shed abroad in it by the Holy Spirit, it says,
   "To where do you invite me? To what fair havens could I sail? With what
   do you tempt me? What can be sweeter under Heaven or in Heaven than
   that which I now enjoy, namely, the love of an indwelling Christ? Oh,
   evil sirens, you sing to me in vain! You might sooner tempt the angels
   in Heaven to descend to Hell than persuade my spirit to

   leave my Beloved who dwells in me and lives in me--and who has grounded
   and settled me in a deep sense of His eternal

   love."

   Side by side with this very blessed establishment in the faith, for
   which I would bow my knees as Paul did for the Ephesians, that you may
   all have it, comes a comprehension of Divine love. How anxiously do I
   desire your firm settlement in the Truth of God, for this is an age
   which needs rooted and grounded saints! This is a time when men need to
   be confirmed in the present Truth of God and to hold it as with an iron
   hand. Side by side with that, however, we would have you receive this
   further blessing, namely, a comprehension of the love of Christ--"That
   you may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and
   length, and depth, and height"--that you may have no crude idea, but a
   clear and definite understanding of what the love of Christ is to you.

   As a mathematician makes calculations and arrives at clear ideas; as a
   mechanic cubes a quantity and takes its length, and depth, and height,
   so may the Lord Jesus Christ's love be to you no more an airy dream,
   but a substantial fact about which you know distinctly, being taught of
   the living God by the Holy Spirit. You know that Christ's love is an
   eternal love, without beginning. It is an everlasting love, without
   end. It is a love that knows no boundary. It is a love that never
   lessens and cannot be increased. It is a love that burns freely in His
   heart towards you as an unworthy, undeserving sinner! It is a love
   which led Him to live for you in human nature and to die for you in His
   own body on the Cross. It is a love which made Him stand Sponsor,
   Surety and Substitute for you. It is a love which led Him to bear your
   load of sin and die while doing so--and bury that sin of yours in a
   sepulcher out of which it never shall rise!

   You know that it is a love which made Him rise again and mount the
   heavens and sit at the right hand of God, still doing all for
   you--living, that you may live; pleading, that you may be preserved;
   preparing Heaven, that you may come there to dwell with Him--and
   intending to come, by-and-by, that He may receive you to Himself, that
   where He is, there you may also be. Oh, Beloved, this is a delightful
   thing! First, to be strengthened, then to have Christ dwelling in you,
   and then to begin to know the measure of His immeasurable love! This is
   to be taught of God--when you are able to speak of height, depth,
   length, breadth and so see the Savior's love to be a tangible, real,
   practical, efficient thing!

   How blessed to comprehend that Divine love which, after all, is
   incomprehensible! I know that some of you who have been lately
   converted think that you know all about it, but you do not, for I tell
   you freely that some of us who have now known the Lord for a third of a
   century must still confess that we have only coasted along the shore of
   this great world of love, while into the center of the bright continent
   we have never yet been able to penetrate! I could introduce you to
   friends who have been 50 years in Christ and though they hold a
   constant jubilee in the sense of His love, yet they will tell you that
   they are only scholars on the lowest form, beginning to spell out the
   alphabet of the Grace of our Lord Jesus

   Christ!

   You do not know what lies before you, young saints--but press on--ask
   the Lord to make you stronger and you shall then entertain your Lord as
   a perpetual Guest within your bosom! And you shall come to know what
   fathers in the Church have loved to learn--the heights and depths of
   unsearchable love! Be this our prayer at this moment--

   "Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell By faith and love in every
   breast! Then shall we know, and taste, and feel The joys that cannot be
   expressed! Come fill our hearts with inward strength Make our enlarged
   souls possess And learn the height, and breadth, and length, Of your
   immeasurable Grace!"

   Do not overlook the third part of this subject, which is, "that you may
   know the love of Christ, which passes knowl-edge"--that you may have
   acquaintance with that love which can never be fully known! This is the
   subject upon which I would briefly speak, taking the whole verse as a
   step that leads to another step. "That you may know the love of Christ,
   which passes knowledge, that"--and now we came to the top step of
   all--"that you might be filled with all the fullness

   of God."

   Here are four things to talk about. First, to know the love of Christ.
   Secondly, to know it so as to be filled with all the fullness of God.
   Thirdly, to be filled with the fullness of God. And then, fourthly,
   being full, what then? Does not

   that mean that when we are full we shall overflow to the glory of Him
   who filled us? God grant that we may! May the fullness of Jesus be
   glorified by our holy and useful outpourings!

   I. First, then, TO KNOW THE LOVE OF CHRIST. Observe that Paul was not
   praying for people who did not know the love of Christ in the ordinary
   meaning of the term. They did know it--they had heard all about it from
   Paul. They had read about it in his Epistles and in other gracious
   records. They knew the whole story of the love of Christ through
   Apostolic teaching. Yes, and they knew it by faith, too. They had
   believed in the Lord Jesus Christ unto the salvation of their souls, so
   that in the first verse of this Epistle he calls them, "saints which
   are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus."

   What does he mean by his prayer that they might know the love of
   Christ? He intended another kind of knowledge. I know very many people,
   that is to say, I have read about them. I have heard of them. I have
   seen them in the streets and they touch their hats to me and I do the
   same to them. And thus I know them. This is a slender form of
   knowledge, yet I fear it is the kind of knowledge which most men have
   of Christ. They have seen Him. They have looked to Him and, blessed be
   His name, there is life in a look--but they have gone no further. Even
   such a knowledge as that which comes by trembling faith is a knowledge
   that saves.

   But I will tell you the people I know best. They live with me in my own
   house. I see them every day. I am on the most familiar terms with
   them--this is the knowledge here intended! Read our text again. "That
   Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith." And then--"that you may know
   the love of Christ." Is not this the best way of knowing it? Jesus
   resides in your heart, which is the center of your love, and then you
   know His love! He teaches you to love Him and, as you learn the sweet
   lesson, you begin to know how Jesus loves you. You come to know Him by
   personal acquaintance, by having Christ dwelling in you so that you see
   Him, hear Him, feel His touch and enjoy His blessed company! This kind
   of knowledge is the most precious of all knowledge--whatever the
   subject may be!

   You see the method of this knowledge; the way in which it comes to us.
   It is a sure and efficient way, for by having Jesus dwell in us and by
   becoming rooted and grounded in love to Him, we come to know Him as we
   can never know Him by being taught by our fellow men, or by all the
   reading or study in the world. This is the highest style of the science
   of Christ Crucified, for this comes of personal proof and experimental
   test and, therefore, it is not to be taken from us, but is woven into
   our consciousness. We have been taught by certain modern philosophers
   that we do not know anything--I fancy our friends are not far off the
   mark if they only speak for themselves, but I object to their
   representing us. They tell us that we only know what our senses have
   been operated upon and, perhaps, we may know that certain things do
   thus operate, but we can hardly be sure.

   One of these philosophers kindly says that religion is a matter of
   belief, not of knowledge. This is in opposition to all the teaching of
   Scripture! Take your pencil and read through all the Epistles of John
   and mark the word, "know." It is repeated continually. In fact, it is
   the key word of the Apostle's letters. He writes perpetually, "We know;
   we know; we know; we know." Truly, Brethren, we know the love of
   Christ! When Jesus dwells in us, we do not merely believe in His love
   as a report, but we enjoy it as a fact! We have made its
   acquaintance--we have tasted, we have handled, we have experienced this
   heavenly gift! What a favor! To know the love of Christ! Do not forget
   that this only comes of Christ's dwelling in us and of our being rooted
   and grounded in love to Him.

   "We cannot be certain of anything," someone says. Well, perhaps you
   cannot. But the man who has Christ dwelling in him says, "There is one
   thing I am certain of and that is the love of Christ to me. I am
   assured of the loveliness of His Character and the affection of His
   heart. I perceive that He, Himself, is Love and I am equally clear,
   since He has come to live with me, that He loves me, for He would not
   have lived in my heart at all if He had not loved me! He would not
   cheer and encourage me. He would not rebuke and chasten me, as He does,
   if He did not love me. He gives me every proof of His love and,
   therefore, I am sure of it. I will have no question raised or if you
   raise it, you will kindly understand that I do not, for I have come to
   this--I know the love of Christ."

   What a blessed knowledge this is! Do they talk of science? No science
   can rival the science of Christ Crucified! Knowledge? No knowledge can
   compare with the knowledge of the love that passes knowledge! How sweet
   it is to know love! Who needs a better subject to exercise his mind
   upon? And how precious is the love of Christ! The sweetest of all the
   sweets that life can yield--the source of love, the mirror of love, the
   model of love, the love which surpasses all love, as the knowledge of
   it surpasses all knowledge! Who would not be a scholar when the book he
   reads in is the heart of Christ?

   Who would not be a student when the science is Christ Crucified; the
   lesson book Christ manifested; the Tutor Christ glorified and the prize
   Christ enthroned in the heart?

   Jesus is most dear from every point of view, but how charming is it to
   see Him in the light of love, so as "to know the love of Christ"! You
   see, then, the way in which we come by our knowledge and the certainly
   there is in it--and the sweetness of the Subject! I shall have to show
   you, as we go on, the efficacy of this knowledge, for when we know the
   love of Christ that passes knowledge, it follows, before long, that we
   come to be filled with all the fullness of God. Here is a sweet perfume
   brought into a man's house! For substance, it seems to be a little
   thing--it can lie on his finger. Wait a few minutes and it has actually
   filled the room! Everyone exclaims, "What sweetness!" The fragrance
   perfumes all the chamber. They open the door--the delicious scent is in
   the passage--it has gone upstairs into every bedroom till the fragrance
   is diffused through all the house!

   And if you open a window it invades the street and charms the
   passersby. If the love of Christ is really known in the soul, it is
   like a precious box of rarest aromatics--it diffuses itself till it
   fills our entire being! I do not wonder to find my text saying, "And to
   know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be
   filled with all the fullness of God," for the love of the Lord Jesus is
   the most filling thing in existence! In Him dwells all the fullness of
   the Godhead bodily--and you are complete in Him, for of His fullness
   have all you received and Grace for Grace--how can we be otherwise than
   filled?

   II. We must dwell a minute on that rung of the ladder to which we have
   ascended--TO KNOW SO AS TO BE FILLED. It is not every kind of knowledge
   that will fill a man. Many forms of knowledge make a man more empty
   than he was before. The knowledge of earthly luxuries tends to make a
   man hunger for them and so a new vacuum is created in his mind. When he
   perceives that there is this or that delight to be had, he becomes
   discontented till he gets it and so he is emptier than he was before.
   Much of human knowledge is described by the Apostle, thus, "Knowledge
   puffs up; but love builds up."

   Sometimes the more men know, the greater fools they become, for
   knowledge is not wisdom, though wisdom cannot be without knowledge.
   Knowledge in the hands of a fool is but a means of publishing his
   folly. Wisdom is the flower which grows out of knowledge, but all
   knowledge does not bear that flower--much of it is barren. Brothers and
   Sisters, if you get a knowledge of Christ's love, it is a filling
   knowledge, for it contents the soul! When a man knows the love of
   Christ to him, every part of his being is satisfied. We are made up, as
   it were, of a number of horseleeches, every one of which cries, "Give!
   Give!" Here is the heart craving for something to love. Oh, but when
   you love Christ, you have a heart's love that will satisfy you for all
   time! Where can such sweetness be? Your heart shall never go hungering
   again. His charms shall hold you fast!

   There is the intellect--what a horseleech it is! It is always craving
   for more--more certainty, more novelty, more wonder. But when the
   intellect comes to know Christ, it acknowledges that in Him dwells all
   wisdom! To know the Eternal Son is to know the Father and this is a
   knowledge which rests the understanding and fills up the mind.
   Imagination itself is content with Jesus. Hope cannot conceive anything
   more lovely--she gives up all attempts to paint a fairer than He and
   she cries, "Yes, He is altogether lovely! This is my Beloved and this
   is my Friend. O you daughters of Jerusalem!" No power or passion that
   is vital to our manhood is discontented with the Lord Jesus Christ.

   Before conversion we gad abroad and go to this house and to that to
   pick up scanty meals. But when Christ comes home to dwell with us, we
   sup with Him and no more go out since there is nowhere to be found
   anything that is as good as He, much less anything that can be better
   than He! When the love of Christ enters the heart, it is swiftly filled
   with a perfect satisfaction. A certain man of renown, not a thousand
   miles away, who has no very great love for the Gospel, says that he can
   influence and enlighten most people except those who hold the views of
   a certain "notorious individual." That epithet I take to myself!

   He adds, "When once they receive his doctrinal teaching there is no
   stirring them an inch." Blessed be God for that! I scarcely hoped that
   the work was so well done and I am glad of the worthy gentleman's
   certificate. So it is--when once you cast anchor in the port of
   Christ's love, you wish for no more voyages! You will not change when
   you feel that it is well with your soul. You are convinced that there
   is no better article in the market than that which your soul has
   learned to feed upon and so you are not inclined to go further and fare
   worse!

   Again, when the soul comes to enjoy Christ, it is filled in a most
   emphatic sense. It is not merely satisfied, but overjoyed! One said to
   me the other day, "I am sure that you have a contented heart." "Well,"
   I replied, "if I were pinched with poverty you might talk of my
   contentment, but God blesses me so richly that I have passed beyond
   mere contentment--I have all things and abound! I feel as if I can
   bless God all day long." Christ's people are not merely safe and
   contented, they are filled! And well they may be, for there is enough
   in Christ for millions--and yet He is altogether ours. He has given
   Himself to us as a glorious whole!

   A little patrimony may make a man contented, but what shall we say when
   our heritage is Christ, Himself? Contented? Why, our heart leaps as we
   survey our infinite portion--

   "In the heavenly Lamb thrice happy I am And my heart does dance at the
   sound of His name." When you live in the full enjoyment of the Lord's
   Presence and abide under a sense of His love, you feel more happy than
   tongue can tell. Your heart is too full to hold--it is like a vessel
   needing vent--it possesses a joy unspeakable and full of glory. Once
   more, when the love of Christ comes to work upon the soul--when it
   brings with it all its choice treasures-- then the mind of the Believer
   is filled with the fullness of God. What is it that the love of Christ
   gives to the objects of it? Let me ask another question. What is it
   which is worth having that it does not give? He gives us light for our
   darkness; eyes for our blindness; food for our hunger; cleansing for
   our defilement; garments for our nakedness; healing for our sickness.
   He gives us strength for our weakness, joy for our sorrow, comfort for
   our distress, deliverance for our peril and triumph for our conflict!

   When Jesus comes to dwell in the heart, He brings with Him such
   furniture, such provision that our entire nature is equipped,
   furnished, provided for--in a word, "filled with all the fullness of
   God." Christ does not long dwell in an unfurnished house. Oh, you that
   have a poor, poverty-stricken religion of which you have to say, like
   the elder brother in the parable, "These many years did I serve you,
   neither transgressed I at any time your commandment: and yet you never
   gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends," I beseech you,
   say so no more! Come, Friends, alter that tune and hear what the great
   Father says--"Son, you are always with Me, and all that I have is
   yours." If Christ dwells in your heart, His Father is your Father! His
   God is your God! His Heaven is your Heaven! Yes, and His Throne shall
   be your throne, for He will make you to sit where He sits at the right
   hand of God in Glory! Oh, the blessedness of knowing the love of
   Christ! It fills the spirit to the fullest!

   III. In a sentence or two I will pass over the third point, namely,
   WHAT IT IS TO BE FILLED WITH ALL THE

   FULLNESS OF GOD. Does it not mean that self is banished, for if the
   fullness of God has filled you, where is room for self? Does it not
   mean that the soul is perfectly charmed with all that God does for it?
   "Filled with all the fullness of God." Does it not mean that every
   power of the entire nature is solaced and satisfied? Does it not mean
   that the whole man is occupied and inhabited by God--that the whole
   nature becomes permeated with Grace, saturated with love, satisfied
   with favor and full of the goodness of the Lord? I will not talk more
   of it at this time. I hope that you will know by experience what that
   fullness means, if you do not know it already. May the Holy Spirit give
   you this glad experience.

   IV. I want to come to the practical point that WHEREVER CHRIST DWELLS
   IN THE HEART BY FAITH WE RECEIVE THE FULLNESS OF GOD INTO OUR SPIRIT
   WITH THE DESIGN THAT WE MAY OVERFLOW.

   Brothers, Sisters, I dare say you know what it is to be empty. Have you
   ever tried to pray when you are empty? Yes, and the result is a very
   empty prayer. "Out of nothing comes nothing." And when there is no
   prayer in you and you pray, why, it is no prayer at all! You try to
   praise, but if there is no praise in you, your attempted hallelujahs
   languish and expire. If true praise comes forth from you, it must first
   have been within you.

   But do you know what it is to pray when you are full of prayer? When
   the Lord has filled you with hunger, thirst, desires, hopes and
   expectations--what an overflowing of prayer is with you! When the
   season of prayer is over and you go down to business, you cry, "Alas, I
   never knew a quarter of an hour fly so quickly as this has done! How
   refreshed I am! I made no effort to pray, but I poured out my soul like
   water before the Lord." Yes, because you have been filled with all the
   fullness of God, therefore you have prayed readily and with fullness.
   In singing, you have felt the same plenitude of devotion. Sometimes
   when you have been praising the Lord, you have wished that you had all
   men's tongues in your mouth and that you had all the songs of birds at
   your command, and all the music of the spheres! You have desired

   to make the stars your keyboard, to play upon them a glorious Te
   Deum--and yet you would not even then have praised your God as your
   heart desired. When you are full of praise, then you praise, indeed!

   It is a blessed thing for our heart to get full towards God, for then
   we worship Him with a full soul. It may be only full of regrets,
   repentance and desires, but yet if it is full, it is a blessed
   fullness. Even if you are only full of groans, cries and entreaties, it
   is well. When God dwells in you, by the Holy Spirit, as the Spirit of
   supplication and devotion, then you live towards God with vigorous
   life. And, dear Brothers and Sisters, when you are all full of Divine
   Grace, you are filled for all the circumstances of life. You have
   lately buried a greatly beloved one. The news came upon you all of a
   sudden, but you were not afraid of evil tidings. Why? Because your
   heart was "fixed, trusting in the Lord." When the sad bereavement came,
   it did not overwhelm you--at another time it might have done so--but
   the Lord was pleased to fill you with His Presence that you were quite
   prepared for the trouble.

   Tomorrow morning if you go into the world filled with the fullness of
   God, afflictions may come in business-- perhaps an extra heavy account
   will be sent in and you will be perplexed as to how to meet it--but you
   will not mind. You will be ready for the difficulty because the
   fullness of God will ballast you and save you from the rough winds.
   Perhaps tomorrow you will meet with a great success and if you are not
   full of Grace you will grow proud and lifted up. But if you are filled
   with all the fullness of God, if the Lord should make you as rich as
   Solomon, you would not grow worldly. If you are filled with all the
   fullness of God, you are as ready for prosperity as you are for
   adversity! Whatever happens to you in the future you will be prepared
   for it. If you are called upon to confess His name, if you are filled
   with all the fullness of God, courage will be yours!

   And if you are called to endure great suffering, patience will be
   ready, for the God of Patience will grant you strength equal to your
   need. If a knotty problem poses you and you are filled with God's
   wisdom, you will work it out. If you go forth filled with God, you are
   provided for every emergency. Come calamity or prosperity, whatever
   shape the temptation may assume, if the love of Christ has filled you
   with the fullness of God, you are ready for it! Look how prepared you
   will be to meet your Brethren and benefit them! Suppose you should meet
   a little gathering of Believers and they should ask you to speak a
   word? If you are full, your speech will be worth hearing. But if you
   are empty, your communications will be also empty.

   Sometimes when we preach we are conscious of unfitness for the work
   because our soul is poverty-stricken. There cannot be much in our
   mouths if there is little in our hearts. Out of an empty sack you
   cannot shake a bushel of wheat, even if you shake it very hard. I have
   heard a Brother pray a wearisome while and I believe he was long
   because he had nothing to say. A horse can run many miles if he has
   nothing to carry. Long prayers often mean wind and emptiness. If you
   are full with a Divine fullness, your lips scatter gems more precious
   than pearls and diamonds. Filled with all the fullness of God, your
   paths, like God's paths, drop fatness!

   Do you not know Christian men of that sort? They are millionaire
   Christians who make others rich. I know saints whom I rejoice to visit
   because I always learn from them. It is a privilege to be in the
   company of full saints, just as it is a misery to hear the clatter of
   empty professors. It is said that we English people feel delighted if
   we sit by the side of a lord--this I know, that if I get into the
   company of one of God's aristocracy and have a quarter of an hour's
   talk with him, and a little prayer as well, I feel quite lifted up! My
   heart is glad within me when I see the Grace of God abundant in a
   Brother or Sister in Christ. I want you, Brothers and Sisters, to be
   full of sympathy, full of pity, full of mercy, full of wisdom--and when
   your Brethren hear you speak, they will be as men who have found
   running springs and filled up their vessels!

   Lastly, if the love of Jesus Christ is in us so that we are filled with
   all the fullness of God, how ready we shall be to meet common folk that
   are not the Lord's people as yet! We shall have a word on wheels for
   all who cross our path. You find it difficult to get the right words at
   the right time when you are talking to seekers? Just so, Brothers and
   Sisters, but may not that be because you are not full up to the brim?
   You are nearly empty and it takes you a long time to turn your tub up
   and pour out the little drop which hangs at the bottom. It you were
   full up to the brim, you would run over on all sides--and all around
   you there would be a holy moisture. If you are so full of spiritual
   life that you cannot help running over, you will, by the Holy Spirit's
   power, pour out the right expressions when they are needed--and thirsty
   souls will receive of the Living Water.

   If we are quite full, we may move about among ungodly men and our
   presence will be a benediction to them. I read the other day of one who
   heard a man swear and tell a lie at the same time. He did not say
   anything, but the swearer was aware that the listener was aware of his
   falsehood. The reprover fixed his eye on the liar and was silent. That
   glance went to the other's heart, for it said more than a dozen hard
   names. What the reprover did not say had more power than what he might
   have said! If you are only full of His life, the Lord will tell you
   what to do and guide you as how to do it! "But I do not know how to
   speak," says one. Just so. You know that you have only a little Living
   Water at the bottom of your barrel and you do not know how to get it
   out.

   "Oh, but I feel such a difficulty in speaking." If there is only a
   little in the tub, the difficulty is to get it out. But if you are
   full, that difficulty will vanish. If the Lord has brought us to His
   fullness, it is a very high state to be in. Look at our blessed Master.
   Wherever He was and whatever happened--and wherever He went--He did the
   right thing, then and there, and said the best thing that could be said
   because the Holy Spirit rested upon Him without measure! Oh, that the
   Holy Spirit would fill us, also, according to our capacity! If the
   water carts go along the road in dusty weather with nothing in them,
   they will not stop the dust! And if you Christians go about the world
   empty, you will not stop the dust of sin which blinds and defiles
   society!

   If you go to a fountain and find no water flowing, that fountain mocks
   your thirst--it is worse than useless. Likewise, therefore, do not
   forget that if you ever become empty of Grace, you mock those who look
   to you. Blessed is he of whom it is written, "Out of his belly shall
   flow rivers of Living Water." This spoke Christ of the Spirit of God
   dwelling in men. God grant that you and I may understand His meaning!
   If anybody is saying, "This is out of my sphere--I have not come as far
   as this." I know it is so. I have not been talking to you. Yet I will
   not be altogether silent to you. Look to Jesus Christ at once and you
   shall be saved. Trust Him! Trust Him wholly! By faith you will begin to
   live.

   After you begin to live, you will be strengthened by the Spirit of the
   Lord. After you are strengthened, Christ will dwell in your heart.
   After Christ has dwelt in your heart, you shall know the love that
   passes knowledge--and after you know the love that passes knowledge,
   you shall be filled with all the fullness of God! Do not begin at the
   end, but take things according to God's order. A man who wishes to
   climb a ladder does not expect to put his foot upon the top rung at the
   first step--he ascends by degrees.

   There is your first rung--"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved." Take that first step at once! May the Lord help you!
   Beginning with faith in Jesus, you shall persevere and ascend till you
   reach the top of the ladder. The Lord be with you and in you to the
   fullest! Amen and Amen.

Renewing Strength

   (No. 1756)

   SUITABLE FOR THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR, DELIVERED

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength." Isaiah
   40:31.

   HUMAN strength is of many kinds, but in any form it will spend itself
   in due time. God can lend to men immense physical force, but though a
   man had the strength of a lion and an ox combined, he would one day
   fail. The force of flesh must fade like the grass to which it is
   likened. Samson sometimes becomes exhausted and he is likely to die of
   thirst, though he has slain a thousand men! Yes, more, he must
   ultimately die and his mighty and tremendous muscles must yield to the
   worm and return to the dust of death. Since even granite and iron yield
   to constant wear and tear, assuredly man's frail body cannot long be a
   thing of strength--

   "Our days a transient period run, And change with every circling sun.
   And while to lengthened years we trust, Before the moth we sink to
   dust."

   Mental strength is a noble possession, but it also fails its owner, for
   at best it is a finite power. The wisest of men, by-and-by, feel the
   infirmities of age creeping upon them and frequently present the sad
   spectacle of second childhood. Death pays no regard to science or
   eloquence. The fool dies and as surely dies the senator, the
   philosopher, the Divine. When you take up the skull of a sage, you find
   no weight of wisdom there, nor trace of all the curious movements of a
   potent brain. Knowledge, genius, imagination, prophetic fire all
   depart--even before death they often fail. Baffled by mysteries; balked
   by prejudice; blinded by pride, the man of great understanding may yet
   be driven to his wit's end.

   So far as even spiritual strength is of the man, himself--so far as you
   can conceive of it apart from the immediate operation of the Holy
   Spirit--it, also, cannot be depended on. The most devout may grow
   lukewarm, the strongest Believer may doubt, the most sanctified may
   backslide! It is a heavenly strength, but so far as it is transfused
   into our humanity and becomes a part of ourselves, it, also, may wax
   weak, though, blessed be God, it can never utterly die! Every form of
   human strength must of necessity spend itself, for the world of which
   it forms a part decays and, by-and-by, like a worn-out vesture, the
   heavens and the earth shall be rolled up and put away.

   Some signs of age, the creatures show already, but the time will come
   when their strength shall utterly fail. The reason is that all strength
   apart from God is derived strength and is, consequently, measurable.
   Yes, apart from God it is not strength at all and, consequently, must
   come to an end. The river runs on and the brook fails not because they
   come from fountains that are not affected by drought--but cisterns are
   dried and reservoirs fail because they have no springing well at the
   bottom of them--and if the pipes which supply them cease to flow, they
   are soon left dry as a threshing-floor. Pools which are not
   self-supplied are always liable to be exhausted as the water is drained
   from them. Let every man know, therefore, that whatever his strength
   may be, of body, mind, or spirit--if it is his own, it will one day
   fail him.

   Let him see to it, therefore, that he does not trust it--especially
   that he does not trust it with eternal hazards or rest upon it for his
   soul's safety--for which it never can be equal. It will be a horrible
   thing to be leaning and to find your staff fail you when you are on the
   edge of a measureless precipice! It will be terrible to be building and
   to find your foundation washed from under you and all your handiwork
   carried away by the flood! Yet so it must be if we are depending upon
   anything that comes of ourselves. Our own righteousness, our own
   thoughts, our own religiousness, our own prayers, resolves,
   attainments, achievements--everything that is of ourselves must sooner
   or later prove themselves to be but human--and over all things human it
   is best to write, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!"

   Mingled with all things human there are portions of that all-dissolving
   acid which fell upon man's nature when Infinite Justice said, "Dust you
   are, and unto dust shall you return." On the other hand, what a
   contrast there is as to Divine strength! That never fails! It seems
   almost a superfluity to say as much as that--it abides in joyous
   fullness, never in the least diminished. With God there are no years to
   make Him decline with age, no labors to tax His powers. With God our
   lives are but as the swing of the pendulum. A thousand years in His
   sight are passed away as a watch in the night! Millions of ages are
   nothing to Him. He was God when as yet this sun, moon and all these
   stars slept in His thoughts like unborn forests in an acorn! And He
   will be God when all this brief creation shall melt back to nothing as
   a moment's foam dissolves into the wave that bore it and is lost
   forever.

   God changes not in any degree whatever--the fountain of His
   almightiness still overflows. He made this world--no doubt He has made
   thousands more and has still an undiminished power to create! All the
   worlds that we can see revolving in yonder sky are, perhaps, as a
   single chamber in the mansion of creation--they occupy an insignificant
   corner behind the door--compared to other and vaster worlds that He has
   made. But the glorious Lord is just as ready to make more! He is still
   the same forever and forever. In your dire necessity you may draw
   largely upon Him, but you cannot exhaust Him. You may bring your
   boundless needs and have them all supplied, but you shall no more
   diminish His all-sufficiency than when an infant dips his cup into the
   sea and leaves the sea brimming over upon 10,000 leagues of shore!

   Oh, the glory of the strength of God! I cannot speak of it. I will not
   contrast it with the strength of man. What then? These two things seem
   very far away--man with his faintness, his strength gradually drying
   up--God with His eternity and inexhaustible Omnipotence! If we can
   bring these two together; if by an act of faith you that are human can
   be linked with the Divine, what a wondrous thing will happen! Then the
   sacred Words of the text will be fulfilled and your strength will be
   renewed! Apt as it is to dry up, it will be renovated, freshened,
   filled up, increased, established! From the eternal deep that lies
   under--that deep of which Moses said that it, "couches beneath"--from
   that measureless fountain shall you draw strength which all eternity
   will not exhaust!

   You are weakness itself, but it you are united to the Divine strength,
   you shall be infinitely strong. The cipher is nothing, but with a unit
   before it, becomes ten! A man is nothing, but with God in him, he makes
   Hell tremble! Now that is just my text, "They that wait upon the Lord
   shall renew their strength." If they are apart from God, their strength
   will die out. But when they are linked to God and wait upon God for
   everything--casting their nothingness upon His Omnipotence--then shall
   they find their strength renewed. With God in him, though the man were
   dead, yet shall he live! Job says, "My bow was renewed in my hand."
   Grass cut down shall grow again when Heaven's dew shall quicken it. The
   brook that was ready to dry up shall flow again when Heaven remembers
   it and unseals its treasures! The skies that burned like brass shall be
   cooled, again, with clouds when the Lord thinks upon them. When the
   heart drinks life from the heart of God and man is at one with his
   Maker, then all is well--

   "From God, the overflowing spring, Our souls shall drink a flesh
   supply-While those who trust their native strength Shall melt away and
   droop and die."

   I have now to speak from my text, first, upon how a true Church may be
   described. "They that wait upon the Lord." Secondly, upon what such a
   Church needs to renew its strength. And thirdly, how such a Church may
   renew its strength--by waiting upon the Lord. That which serves as a
   description of true Believers serves, also, as a direction to true
   Believers--They that wait upon the Lord are the men who may most
   hopefully be encouraged, still, to wait upon the Lord that their
   strength may be renewed.

   I. First, then, here WE SEE HOW A TRUE CHURCH MAY BE DESCRIBED--"They
   that wait upon the Lord." A Church such as a Church ought to be,
   consists of men who depend only upon the Lord, for waiting signifies
   dependence. Their hope is in God. They rest in God's righteousness as
   their righteousness and they receive the great Sacrifice provided by
   God to be their atonement and their acceptance. No man is really a
   Christian who finds his hope and confidence within himself--he must be
   looking out of himself to God in Christ Jesus. It is absolutely
   essential that it should be so. He that is God's beloved is a Believer
   in God, that is to say, a truster in God, waiter upon God. His one sole
   confidence is in God His Savior. This being so with each individual,
   the whole Church can sing--

   "Our spirits look to God alone, Our rock and refuge is His throne.

   In all our fears, in all our straits Our soul on His salvation waits."

   If Christians are what they ought to be, they depend upon God alone in
   their Church capacity. God's Word is their only creed--they do not add
   to it anything whatever--no, not a sentence, a gloss, or a thought.
   They have greatly erred who look upon anything as the authoritative
   standard of faith but God's own Word. I hear you say, "Do you not
   respect the Thirty-Nine Articles?" However much or little I may respect
   them, it makes no difference to the fact that the Church of God is not
   bound to any faith but that which God Himself has revealed! "But the
   Westminster Assembly's Confession?" It must be treated in the same
   manner. That summary of doctrine is very admirable, but human creeds,
   as such, have nothing on earth to do with me!

   The point I have to make is this, What does God say? What does His Word
   say? Within the covers of the Bible you find all theology. Nothing
   outside of this Book is binding on a Christian man as doctrine in the
   least degree whatever! The Bible and only the Bible is the religion of
   Christians! "To the Law and to the Testimony! If they speak not
   according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them." This
   Word has life within it which rules in the souls of the Lord's elect.
   Blessed be the Spirit of God who dictated it! We yield implicit faith
   to all that He has revealed and to nothing else. A true Church of God
   will say, "We wait upon the Lord for teaching--this Word of the Lord is
   to us our Infallible source of doctrine--and that alone."

   Those who wait upon the Lord for their creed shall never need to give
   up their faith for something better, but they shall renew their
   strength. Faithful to her Lord in doctrine, a true Church also waits
   upon the Lord for Grace and has faith in the Doctrines of Grace as the
   testimony with which she is to work. What am I to teach to my people if
   I am a Christian minister? If a Church is rightly constituted, it says
   to the pastor, "Teach what God has taught. Preach Christ Crucified!
   Preach not your own thoughts, nor notions of your own inventing, but
   what is revealed by God! Preach that, for it shall be the power of God
   unto salvation." I am always sorry when, in order to promote a revival,
   false doctrine is preached. I will preach no false doctrine if I know
   it--no, not to save the world!

   Of this I am assured--if the Truth of God will not save a man, a lie
   will not! If the bare unaltered Truth of God will not break a man's
   heart, then it certainly will not break it when it is rounded and toned
   down and made to look pretty so as to suit the prevailing taste! No, a
   Church that waits upon the Lord uses only the Doctrines of Scripture as
   its battle-ax and weapons of war. A Church that is waiting upon the
   Lord always knows where its strength lies, namely, in its God. What is
   the power with which men are to be converted? Some say eloquence. The
   Church of God says, "Not so! Not by might, nor by power, but by the
   Spirit of the Lord!"

   I solemnly believe that so much of human oratory as there is in a
   sermon, so much there is of the weakness of the flesh--for all the
   power must be of God working with the Truth of God through the Holy
   Spirit. Therefore we should use great plainness of speech and never
   speak for the sake of the language, but always for the sake of the
   Truth of God we have to say, that God may bless it to the hearts of
   men. No man in this world was ever converted except by the Holy Spirit
   and never will any man be truly converted by any other power. Bang your
   drums, Brother, and blow your brass instruments, if you like, but
   neither cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, nor any other
   kind of music will ever save a soul!

   Deck your altar out as prettily as you like and burn your most fragrant
   incense, but no soul ever finds Heaven by the light of candles nor by
   the scent of censers! The Gospel has salvation in it when the Holy
   Spirit works by it--and no other doctrine can save. The Spirit of the
   Lord, alone, must bless the Truth of God, and He will bless only the
   Truth of God. This is the Church's sole power with souls. Now, you
   Christian people that are trying to do good and glorify God, I pray you
   wait upon the Lord and resolve that you will only go to God's work
   armed with God's Truth and backed up by God's Spirit. Many in these
   days think that we need a great deal besides the Spirit of God, but
   they are in error. They think that the world is not to be converted and
   men saved in the old-fashioned way of preaching the Word of God with
   the Holy Spirit sent down from Heaven. But let me assure you that it is
   to be converted in that way and in no other!

   Human agriculture is capable of daily improvement, but as the plans of
   the great Husbandman are perfect from the first, you may be sure that
   there will be no change in them! You may go through the world ranting
   and raving, or you may go arguing and discussing, but you cannot touch
   a dead heart to make it alive either by excitement or by philosophy.
   You cannot breathe into the nostrils of a dead soul eternal life,
   though your winds should blow hot with fanaticism,

   or chill with rationalism! Spiritual life can only come in God's way
   and it is God's way by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
   believe! From the Gospel pulpit believing preachers work more miracles
   than your learned men will ever believe. God's Word will not return to
   Him void, but man's word is void when it goes forth--and void it
   remains to the end of the chapter! The magicians and their enchantments
   cannot compare with the rod of Moses. One Word of the Lord is stronger
   than all the rage of Hell or the enmity of the world. We mean to,
   whatever others do, keep to "waiting upon the Lord," going to work in
   the Lord's way and depending upon the Lord's power and upon Him alone!

   But waiting upon God means something more than dependence upon God, so
   I go a step farther--if we depend upon God, our expectation is from
   Him. We wait upon God as the birds in the nest wait upon the parent
   bird, expecting from her their food. Before she comes, you hear their
   cries, but when she comes, if you look into the nest, you will see
   nothing but so many gaping mouths, all waiting, expecting to be filled
   by the mother bird. Now, that is just what a Church of God ought to
   be--a company of wide-opened mouths waiting to be filled only by the
   Lord! "Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it," says the Lord. Do you
   not think that some Churches and some Christians, with very small
   expectations, have scarcely learned to open their months at all?

   If the Lord were to convert a soul, now and then, they would be pleased
   and express a grateful surprise! But do they expect to hear of hundreds
   added to the Church at a time, or of thousands in a year brought to
   Christ? No, they think this may be done in some extraordinary instances
   in very large places, but they do not expect it in their gatherings.
   Oh, Friends, let us expect more of God and we shall receive more! Does
   He not always come up to our expectations? Does He not amaze us with
   the blessings of His goodness? Is He not able to do exceedingly above
   all that we ask or even think? I find it such a blessing to have
   expecting people about me, for they make a flourishing Church. Some
   Brothers and Sisters here at this Tabernacle are men and women of great
   expectations, for even now while I am preaching, they are planning
   whereabouts they will be in the aisle to talk with folk going out--they
   know that some will be converted by the Word of God and they are on the
   look-out to pick them up!

   These Brethren are grieved and surprised if, after a service, they do
   not meet with one or two enquirers or convicted sinners, that they may
   join with them in tearful prayer! They are believers in the power of
   the Gospel and they act accordingly. When I fire the gun, they are on
   the alert to pick up the birds, for they believe in the killing power
   of the Word of God! They could not be content with ineffectual
   preaching--they expect that the Word will be fruitful and so they bring
   their basket to put the fruit in! Oh, if a Church would but wait upon
   God in this sense of expecting great things from Him, it should have
   them! He will never allow His people to complain that He has been a
   wilderness to them. He will never raise their hopes to dash them to the
   ground.

   Is there any man alive who has believed in the Lord too largely, and
   expected too confidingly? Brother ministers, let us begin to expect
   more--not from our ministry because it is powerful, for it is nothing
   of the kind by itself--but from God's ministry through us, for if He
   speaks by us, why should not men yield to His voice though they will
   not yield to ours? If He is with us, can He not make us hammers that
   shall break the rocks in pieces? Can He not use even us to be as a fire
   to melt the iron hearts of men? So then, a true Church depends upon God
   and expects from God--and in this sense answers to the description--
   "They that wait upon the Lord."

   To make up waiting, I think there is a third thing, and that is
   patience--to hold out and wait the Lord's time and will. The three
   together--dependence, expectation, patience--make up waiting upon the
   Lord. This "patience" is, to the uttermost, desirable in a thousand
   matters, that we may endure affliction, persevere in holiness, continue
   in hope and abide in our integrity. Patience is the long life of virtue
   and sets on its head the crown of experience. It is no child's play to
   continue to suffer affliction with joyfulness and to remain, for years,
   perfectly acquiescent in the will of the Lord. But let that be what it
   may. It needs the eyes of faith to see God in the dark, to believe in
   His love when He is angry and to rest in His promise when it tarries
   long. That little word, WAIT, is a word fit for a father in Christ and
   comes not out of the mouth of a babe in Grace. Let us ask for Grace to
   pronounce it aright--

   "Wait, my Soul, upon the Lord, to His gracious promise flee, Laying
   hold upon His Word, 'As your day, your strength shall be.'"

   Some of my dear Brothers in Christ are ardent followers of Christ, but
   they do not seem to have learned the meaning of that word, "patience."
   They are working for Christ and they are depending upon the Lord. And
   they are looking for results--but when they do not quite see them
   immediately--they are at once offended and depressed. They are in such
   a

   hurry that they seem half inclined to cry, "Why should I wait for the
   Lord any longer?" I daresay that you were much the same when you were
   children--you wanted everything at once, and waiting was dismal work to
   you. We are all impatient as long as we are imperfect. It is the mark
   of the child that he is in a violent hurry where men are steady.

   Perhaps our father gave us some seed and we hurried to sow it. We put
   in a little mustard and cress one morning and then we thought that we
   would eat it with tea, but as we saw no sign of green, we went and
   turned over the earth to see if the seed was sprouting! We were greatly
   surprised to find that it had not grown up green and ready to cut--we
   did not understand that the farmer waits. We had a little apple tree
   and we put it in the ground. The planting of that tree was a grand
   affair and we reckoned upon many puddings being made out of the apples
   gathered from it next year. We were sadly surprised to see that the
   apples did not come. Yes, that is the spirit of children--their name is
   Passion--not Patience! They live in the present hour and have no power
   to extend themselves into days to come.

   The Lord sometimes sends us speedy results to our labors. It happens at
   times that the moment we speak, conversions are worked--but at other
   times it is not so--the Truth of God works slowly and surely and
   effects all the more precious results. We must wait for seed to grow
   and for fruit to ripen. If we really wait upon the Lord, we shall just
   keep on, resolved to abide in duty, determined to remain in prayer,
   undaunted in confidence, unmoved in expectation. We shall not fly into
   a passion with the Lord and refuse to believe Him any more. Neither
   shall we run off to novelties and fall into the fads and crazes of the
   day--to try this and to try that--because God's own way, we think, is a
   failure! No, by God's Grace we shall say, "I have done what God bade
   me. I have done it in dependence upon His Spirit and I believe that
   good will come of it. Therefore I shall wait and watch. I shall be
   found moving when God moves, or sitting still when the Lord tarries. I
   am sure that He will not fail the soul that waits upon Him--all will be
   well--the blessing will come."

   What a sweet thing is the calm leisure of faith!--"He that believes
   shall not make haste." Fret and worry, hurry and haste are all slain by
   the hand of faith! God has plenty of time--no, He fills eternity and,
   therefore, He can bear with man's waywardness with much long-suffering!
   You and I are in feverish haste, but when we get to be linked with God,
   we also, can wait, even as God waits to be gracious and has patient
   compassion upon men. That is a description of what a Christian ought to
   be--"waiting upon the Lord"--depending upon God, expecting from God and
   patiently waiting for God till He shall give the desired blessing.

   II. But now, secondly, we see WHAT THE LORD'S WAITING PEOPLE NEED. They
   need to renew their strength. Even those saints who wait upon God for
   everything, may grow faint and require reviving. And that is, first,
   because they are human. As long as you and I are mortal, we shall be
   mutable--as the world is full of changes, so are we. Some friends never
   seem to be either high or low in their feelings--their life has neither
   hills nor valleys in it, but is comparable to an unbroken plain--they
   traverse a perpetual level. It is not so with others of us--we are all
   Alps and Andes. These favored pilgrims march steadily and evenly
   through the world, always at one pitch and pace, but others of us who
   mount up into the heavens in burning zeal and holy joy, go low, down
   very low, into the depths till our soul sinks because of sorrow. The
   best and bravest of the saints are poor creatures.

   Elijah on the top of Carmel, when he has brought fire from Heaven,
   cries, "Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape." Hear
   him, as he pleads with God and unlocks the treasury of the rain! See
   him gird up his loins and run before the chariot of Ahab! There is a
   man for you! If ever hero-worship might be tolerated, it is in the case
   of, "this, my lord, Elijah." Look not too closely at the champion, for
   within 24 hours he is afraid of Jezebel and soon he is whining, "O
   Lord, take away my life; for I am no better than my fathers." Do you
   blame him? Do you fail to understand so sad a fall from so great a
   height? Take heed of censuring a man so greatly approved of God as to
   be spared the pains of death! If you do as well as Elijah did, perhaps
   you may hear some nobodies blaming you in your hour of exhaustion!

   As for me, I cannot censure him, nor can any man who has ever enjoyed
   the heavenly delirium of high-strung zeal in the Master's service--and
   having been borne aloft on eagle's wings--at last falls upon the earth
   in absolute exhaustion. After high excitement, there will come
   reaction. Creatures whose home is on the earth cannot always live upon
   the wing--they must feel faint, at times and, therefore, the necessity
   of this blessed promise--"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew
   their strength." They will rise again! From their deepest depressions
   they will leap into supreme elevations! They shall dwell on the
   heights, they shall soar above the clouds! The very depths to which
   they dive are prophetic of the heights to which they will climb, again,
   by God's Grace! The Lord has said, "I will bring, again, from the
   depths of the sea."

   They need renewing, also, because in addition to being human, they are
   imperfect. The sin that dwells in us, drags us down. However high we
   have ascended, when we have walked in the Light of God, still we have
   needed that the blood of Christ should cleanse us from all sin. Our
   natural corruption and the imperfection and infirmity of our flesh are
   still about us. And these bring us down at times till we say with
   David, "I am this day weak, though anointed king." What a blessing it
   is that failing, flagging, fainting, falling spirits, by waiting upon
   the Lord, shall renew their strength! Even those who actually fall
   shall be recovered. "Though he falls, he shall not be utterly cast
   down: for the Lord holds him up with His hands." Though our sands run
   very low, God shall fill the glass, again, and the believing man shall
   again rejoice in the Lord and have confidence in the God of His
   salvation!

   Because we are human and imperfect, we cannot always be at our best.
   The sky is not always clear; the sea is not always at flood; the year
   is not always at summer; the sun is not always in the zenith; the moon
   is not always at her fullest; the tree is not always adorned with
   fruit; the vineyard does not always flow with wine; roses do not always
   blush, nor lilies always bloom! Creatures have their rises and their
   falls and to us, also, there must be times when we need to renew our
   strength--and we shall renew it, for here the promise comes--"They that
   wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength."

   Brothers and Sisters, I will suppose that I am addressing some who have
   become weak and failing. You must renew your strength. It must be
   renewed, for otherwise it will decline, still further, and this would
   be painful, dangerous and dishonoring. The Lord would not have us
   utterly fail, nor fall prone upon the ground in the heavenly race.
   Therefore, to those who have no might, He increases strength. We must
   renew our strength, for it is for our honor, comfort and safety. It is
   not to a Christian's credit that he should be weak. The glory of a man
   is his strength and especially is his spiritual strength his honor. It
   is not for your comfort to be weak. When a man is feeble, he becomes a
   burden to himself--his sadness makes him stoop--he is feeble-minded and
   ready to halt. "A wounded spirit who can bear?"

   It is not for your usefulness that you should be weak. What can you do
   for others when you, yourself, can hardly stand? It is not for your
   safety that you should be weak, for you will be liable to many attacks
   and open to many injuries from sin and extremely likely to be overcome
   by temptation. Blessed is that man who is "strong in the Lord, and in
   the power of His might." To him the joy of the Lord is his strength.
   The Lord Jehovah is his strength and his song! He also has become his
   salvation. It is for God's Glory and for our own usefulness that we
   should be strong--and if we fall into decline and weakness, pray do not
   let us stop there. Let us try to escape from a spiritual consumption.

   If I address Believers who lament that the whole Church with which they
   are connected is getting weak, I charge them not to suffer it to be so
   with themselves! Brothers and Sisters, shun a spiritual wasting away! A
   pining sickness is an awful disease for a Church to die of. Do not
   linger in such a state. Up with you and cry mightily unto the Lord--and
   you shall yet be restored, for it is written--"They that wait upon the
   Lord shall renew their strength." At this time I should be very glad if
   this dear Church, over which the Holy Spirit has made me an overseer,
   would have its strength renewed. Our ministry needs renewal that it may
   be more full of power and Grace. How weak it is if God is even a little
   withdrawn!

   Our Sunday school work requires constant renewal. Everything around us
   needs to be renewed, revived and refreshed! And just at this time I
   wish that it might be laid on the hearts of the members of the Church
   to pray that we might renew our strength. Your minister grows old--not
   very old in natural age, it is true--but 30 years of continuous labor
   in preaching to so vast a congregation has taken much more out of his
   strength than almost any other form of service would have done. And
   therefore he needs to be invigorated again--physically, mentally and
   spiritually. Many of you are in the same condition and need that your
   strength be renewed like the eagle's. This can be done for us all by
   that great Master, in whose hand the residue of the Spirit abides! He
   can lay His hands on us and say, "Be strong. Fear not!"

   He can strengthen us to a degree of force far beyond our previous
   experience! The members of the Church and the officers of the Church
   all desire, I know, that they should renew their strength just now--it
   is well that such a desire is on them. May this desire for renewal
   become an insatiable craving with those of you who live near to God and
   have power in prayer--then through your importunate intercessions the
   Lord may make good His promise that this waiting congregation may renew
   its strength! After 30 years of unflagging prosperity we are as weak as
   ever "apart from God, and need constant renewal of strength." I see
   many reasons why it is imperative that we should have it at this
   present time. Join, I pray you, in fervent prayer for it! It is
   promised and, therefore, if we do not have it, it is our own fault.

   God's promises are our precepts! What He promises to give, it is our
   duty to seek! And if He promises that we shall renew our strength, why
   not let us have the promise fulfilled to our faith? I wish that it
   might come to pass that my dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ
   here--men and women who are working for Him and are a little weary and
   faint--may be encouraged, cheered, refreshed and led to say, "From this
   time on we will serve our Lord with all our youthful vigor, and with a
   great deal more. We will labor in the service of the Lord our God with
   all our might, not slackening our right hand nor withholding the
   fullness of our strength but giving our all to God."

   O blessed Spirit, awaken Your children to renewed consecration, renewed
   zeal, renewed delight in holy service and renewed hope of victory!

   III. So I close with the third point, which is this--HOW ARE WE TO
   RENEW OUR STRENGTH? If we are God's people, we must renew our strength
   by continually waiting upon God. When a man needs his bodily strength
   renewed, his purpose may be effected by eating a good meal. He has
   grown empty through hunger and there is nothing in him. He must be
   filled up with substantial nourishment and then the human engine will
   generate fresh force. Oh, you who are weak in spirit, come and feed
   upon Christ! They that wait upon the Lord in that way, by feeding upon
   the body and blood of Christ, shall find Him to be meat, indeed, and
   drink indeed, and so they shall renew their strength!

   Sometimes a man may renew his strength by taking a little rest. He has
   grown weak through stern labor and long fatigue and he must be quiet
   and repose till he recovers. Oh, you weary, heavy-laden, where is there
   rest for you except in the Christ of God? Oh, come to God and rest in
   Him and wait patiently for Him! Then shall your peace be as a river and
   then shall your strength be restored right speedily. We have known
   strength to be restored by a bath. A weary one has plunged himself into
   cool water and he has risen quite another man. Oh, for a Baptism into
   the Spirit of God! Oh, to plunge into the Godhead's deepest sea--to
   throw one's self into the might and majesty of God--to swim in love,
   borne up by Grace!

   We have known men's strength renewed by breathing their native air.
   They have risen out of a hot atmosphere into the cool breeze of the
   mountainside and the bracing breeze has made them strong again. Oh, to
   have the breath of the Spirit blowing upon us once again! By Him we
   were born; by Him we were quickened; by Him we have been revived from
   former faintness and it is by breathing His Divine life that we shall
   be filled with life again! Oh, that at this moment we might each one
   feel the power of the Lord entering into us! In a word, if a Church
   needs reviving; if saints individually need reviving, they must wait
   upon God! First in prayer. Oh, what a blessing a day's prayer might be!
   When Archbishop Leighton used to go into his room, his servant said
   that he would remain there for two or three hours, having locked the
   door and having nothing with him but his Bible and a candle. Yes, then
   he came out to speak those gracious words which still linger in his
   works like the echoes of music. His Bible and candle were the only
   earthly illumination that he needed, for prayer brought him Divine
   Light!

   Get with God, Brothers and Sisters! Be much with God! I am sure that
   we, none of us, are alone enough with God. But in prayer, laying hold
   upon the Invisible, we shall win strength for service. Add to that a
   re-dedication of ourselves to the Lord who bought us. This often helps
   us to renew our strength. Go over, again, that blessed covenant which
   has made you one of the covenanted ones with God. You gave yourself
   years ago wholly up to your Lord and you sometimes sing--

   "High Heaven that heard that solemn vow, That vow renewed shall daily
   hear." Let this day hear the renewal of it--let your covenant be
   solemnly rehearsed. Consecrate yourself anew to God. Then realize,
   afresh, your entire dependence upon God. Put yourself into the Lord's
   hands whole-heartedly. Be like the sere leaf that is carried by the
   breath of the storm.

   When you have submitted yourself completely and trusted entirely,
   setting both your strength and your weakness on one side and giving
   yourself up for God to use you, oh, then you shall renew your strength!
   Then go forward to renewed action! In renewing your strength, ask the
   Lord that you may undertake fresh work and that this work may be done
   to a nobler tune--that you may have more expectancy, more confidence,
   more faith, more God-reliance. What things are done by men in common
   life with self-reliance! But with God-reliance we work impossibilities
   and miracles fly from us like sparks from the anvil of a smith! When a
   man learns to work with God's strength and with that, alone, he can do
   all

   things. So would I stir my Brothers and Sisters up, one by one, and
   then as a body, to work for God with renewed energy.

   I am almost done. I know that there are some here to whom this appears
   to have very slight reference. Yet if you are an unconverted man, my
   dear Friend, after all, this is a lesson for you, for the pith of it
   all is that if ever you are to be saved you must get away from yourself
   into God--and your confidence must be in Christ, the Son of God, and
   not in your own strength. One of my greatest delights is to see how our
   people die. I have never, for years, visited the deathbed of a single
   member of this Church in which I have seen a shade of doubt, or the
   least suspicion as to their triumphant entrance into the Kingdom of
   God! I have been somewhat astonished to find it always so. I just now
   sat by the bedside of one of our Brothers who is melting away with
   consumption--and it was sad to see his wife lying by his side almost
   equally ill.

   When I spoke with him who was so soon to be with God, he said, "As for
   my faith, dear Sir, it never wavers in the least degree. I have my
   times of depression of spirit, but I take no notice of that. You have
   told us not to look to feelings, but simply to trust in the Infallible
   Word of a faithful God. Fifteen years ago, Sir," he said, "one Thursday
   night I dropped into the Tabernacle to hear you preach and, blessed be
   the day, I looked to Christ and found salvation! I have had plenty of
   ups and downs, but Jesus has never left me nor forsaken me, and I am
   not going to think that He will do so now. His Word stands fast
   forever. My strength is in my God." He added, "I am not resting upon
   man in any degree or measure, but wholly upon the faithful promise of
   God and the precious blood of Christ."

   I wished that I could get into his place and not come here tonight, but
   just slip off to Heaven as he is doing! It makes one sure of the Gospel
   when you see men dying so. It gives me courage to come and tell it out,
   again, to men and women. The Gospel which I preach to you is good to
   live upon and good to die upon! If you will but trust my Lord, you
   shall find it a blessed thing to depart out of this world and be
   forever with the Lord! Death shall lose every air of dread--every
   ghastly gloom shall be taken from it! It shall be but undressing to go
   to bed, that you may wake up in the morning in royal robes as a
   courtier of the King of kings!

   Only you must have done with yourself, and commit yourself to Christ!
   Say today, in life, what you will need to say when you come to
   die--"Father, into Your hands I commit my spirit." That is a Gospel
   prayer! If you are waiting upon the Lord in the sense of complete
   reliance upon the merit of Jesus, you shall, in dying, renew your
   strength and leap out of your frail body into the Presence and Glory of
   God! In due time, also, you shall re-assume your body--but it shall be
   made like unto Christ's glorious body--and in its resurrection you
   shall emphatically renew your strength!

   Blessed be His name that He has taught many of us to wait upon the
   Lord! May He teach you all to do so, for Christ's sake. Amen.
