PART II. -- ANTHROPOLOGY.

   Having considered the doctrines which concern the nature of God and his
   relation to the world, we come now to those which concern man; his
   origin, nature, primitive state, probation, and apostasy; which last
   subject includes the question as to the nature of sin; and the effects
   of Adam's first sin upon himself and upon his posterity. These subjects
   constitute the department of Anthropology.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I.

  ORIGIN OF MAN.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Scriptural Doctrine.

   The Scriptural account of the origin of man is contained in Genesis i.
   26, 27, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
   likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
   the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and
   over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created
   man in his own image, in the image of God created He him; male and
   female created He them." And Gen. ii. 7, "And the Lord God formed man
   of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of
   life; and man became a living soul."

   Two things are included in this account; first that man's body was
   formed by the immediate intervention of God. It did not grow; nor was
   it produced by any process of development. Secondly, the soul was
   derived from God. He breathed into man "the breath of life," that is,
   that life which constituted him a man, a living creature bearing the
   image of God.

   Many have inferred from this language that the soul is an emanation
   from the divine essence; particula spiritus divini in corpore inclusa.
   This idea was strenuously resisted by the Christian fathers, and
   rejected by the Church, as inconsistent with the nature of God. It
   assumes that the divine essence is capable of division; that his
   essence can be communicated without his attributes, and that it can be
   degraded as the souls of fallen men are degraded. (See Delitzsch's
   "Biblical Psychology" in T. and T. Clark's "Foreign Library," and
   Auberlen in Herzog's "Encyclopädie," article "Geist der Menschen.")
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Anti-Scriptural Theories.

   Heathen Doctrine of Spontaneous Generation.

   The Scriptural doctrine is opposed to the doctrine held by many of the
   ancients, that man is a spontaneous production of the earth. Many of
   them claimed to be gegeneis, autochthenes, terrigena. The earth was
   assumed to be pregnant with the germs of all living organisms, which
   were quickened into life under favourable circumstances; or it was
   regarded as instinct with a productive life to which is to be referred
   the origin of all the plants and animals living on its surface. To this
   primitive doctrine of antiquity, modern philosophy and science, in some
   of their forms, have returned. Those who deny the existence of a
   personal God, distinct from the world, must of course deny the doctrine
   of a creation ex nihilo and consequently of the creation of man. The
   theological view as to the origin of man, says Strauss, "rejects the
   standpoint of natural philosophy and of science in general. These do
   not admit of the immediate intervention of divine causation. God
   created man, not as such, or, quatenus infinitus est, sed quatenus per
   elementa nascentis telluris explicatur.' This is the view which the
   Greek and Roman philosophers, in a very crude form indeed, presented,
   and against which the fathers of the Christian Church earnestly
   contended, but which is now the unanimous judgment of natural science
   as well as of philosophy." [1] To the objection that the earth no
   longer spontaneously produces men and irrational animals, it is
   answered that many things happened formerly that do not happen in the
   present state of the world. To the still more obvious objection that an
   infant man must have perished without a mother's care, it is answered
   that the infant floated in the ocean of its birth, enveloped in a
   covering, until it reached the development of a child two years old; or
   it is said that philosophy can only establish the general fact as to
   the way in which the human race originated, but cannot be required to
   explain all the details.

   Modern Doctrine of Spontaneous Generation.

   Although Strauss greatly exaggerates when he says that men of science
   in our day are unanimous in supporting the doctrine of spontaneous
   generation, it is undoubtedly true that a large class of naturalists,
   especially on the continent of Europe, are in favour of that doctrine.
   Professor Huxley, in his discourse on the "Physical Basis of Life,"
   lends to it the whole weight of his authority. He does not indeed
   expressly teach that dead matter becomes active without being subject
   to the influence of previous living matter; but his whole paper is
   designed to show that life is the result of the peculiar arrangement of
   the molecules of matter. His doctrine is that "the matter of life is
   composed of ordinary matter, differing from it only in the manner in
   which its atoms are aggregated." [2] "If the properties of water," he
   says, "may be properly said to result from the nature and disposition
   of its component molecules, I can find no intelligible ground for
   refusing to say that the properties of protoplasm result from the
   nature and disposition of its molecules." [3] In his address before the
   British Association, he says that if he could look back far enough into
   the past he should expect to see "the evolution of living protoplasm
   from not living matter." And although that address is devoted to
   showing that spontaneous generation, or Abiogenesis, as it is called,
   has never been proved, he says, "I must carefully guard myself against
   the supposition that I intend to suggest that no such thing as
   Abiogenesis has ever taken place in the past or ever will take place in
   the future. With organic chemistry, molecular physics, and physiology
   yet in their infancy, and every day making prodigious strides, I think
   it would be the height of presumption for any man to say that the
   conditions under which matter assumes the properties we call vital,'
   may not some day be artificially brought together." [4] All this
   supposes that life is the product of physical causes; that all that is
   requisite for its production is "to bring together" the necessary
   conditions.

   Mr. Mivart, while opposing Mr. Darwin's theory, not only maintains that
   the doctrine of evolution is "far from any necessary opposition to the
   most orthodox theology," but adds that "the same may be said of
   spontaneous generation." [5] As chemists have succeeded in producing
   urea, which is an animal product, he thinks it not unreasonable that
   they may produce a fish.

   But while there is a class of naturalists who maintain the doctrine of
   spontaneous generation, the great body even of those who are the most
   advanced admit that omne vivum ex vivo, so far as science yet knows, is
   an established law of nature. To demonstrate this is the object of
   Professor Huxley's important address just referred to, delivered before
   the British Association in September, 1870. Two hundred years ago, he
   tells us, it was commonly taken for granted that the insects which made
   their appearance in decaying animal and vegetable substances were
   spontaneously produced. Redi, however, an Italian naturalist, about the
   middle of the seventeenth century, proved that if such decaying matter
   were protected by a piece of gauze admitting the air but excluding
   flies, no such insects made their appearance. "Thus, the hypothesis
   that living matter always arises by the agency of preëxisting living
   matter, took definite shape; and had henceforward a right to be
   considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before
   the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by
   careful reasoners." [6] This conclusion has been more and more
   definitely settled by all the investigations and experiments which have
   been prosecuted from that day to this. It has been proved that even the
   infusorial animalcules, which the most powerful microscopes are
   necessary to detect, never make their appearance when all preëxisting
   living germs have been carefully excluded. These experiments,
   prosecuted on the very verge of nonentity, having for their
   subject-matter things so minute as to render it doubtful whether they
   were anything or nothing, and still more uncertain whether they were
   living or dead, are reviewed in chronological order by Professor
   Huxley, and the conclusion to which they lead fully established. [7]
   This is confirmed by daily experience. Meat, vegetables, and fruits are
   preserved to the extent of hundreds of tons every year. "The matters to
   be preserved are well boiled in a tin case provided with a small hole,
   and this hole is soldered up when all the air in the case has been
   replaced by steam. By this method they may be kept for years, without
   putrefying, fermenting, or getting mouldy. Now this is not because
   oxygen is excluded, inasmuch as it is now proved that free oxygen is
   not necessary for either fermentation or putrefaction. It is not
   because the tins are exhausted of air, for Vibriones and Bacteria live,
   as Pasteur has shown, without air or free oxygen. It is not because the
   boiled meats or vegetables are not putrescible or fermentable, as those
   who have had the misfortune to be in a ship supplied with unskilfully
   closed tins well know. What is it, therefore, but the exclusion of
   germs? I think the Abiogenists are bound to answer this question before
   they ask us to consider new experiments of precisely the same order."
   [8]

   But admitting that life is always derived from life, the question still
   remains, Whether one kind of life may not give rise to life of a
   different kind? It was long supposed that parasites derived their life
   from the plant or animal in which they live. And what is more to the
   point, it is a matter of familiar experience "that mere pressure on the
   skin will give rise to a corn" which seems to have a life of its own;
   and that tumours are often developed in the body which acquire, as in
   the ease of cancer, the power of multiplication and reproduction. In
   the case of vaccination, also, a minute particle of matter is
   introduced under the skin. The result is a vesicle distended with
   vaccine matter "in quantity a hundred or a thousand-fold that which was
   originally inserted." Whence did it come? Professor Huxley tells us
   that it has been proved that "the active element in the vaccine lymph
   is non-diffusible, and consists of minute particles not exceeding
   1/20000 of an inch in diameter, which are made visible in the lymph by
   the microscope. Similar experiments have proved that two of the most
   destructive of epizootic diseases, sheep-pox and glanders, are also
   dependent for their existence and their propagation upon extremely
   small living solid particles, to which the title of microzymes is
   applied." The question, he says, arises whether these particles are the
   result of Homogenesis, or of Xenogenesis, i.e., Are they produced by
   preëxisting living particles of the same kind? or, Are they a
   modification of the tissues of the bodies in which they are found? The
   decision of this question has proved to be a matter of vast practical
   importance. Some years since diseases attacked the grape-vine and the
   silk-worm in France, which threatened to destroy two of the most
   productive branches of industry in that country. The direct loss to
   France from the silk-worm disease alone, in the course of seventeen
   years, is estimated at two hundred and fifty millions of dollars. It
   was discovered that these diseases of the vine and worm, which were
   both infectious and contagious, were due to living organisms, by which
   they were propagated and extended. It became a matter of the last
   importance to determine whether these living particles propagated
   themselves, or whether they were produced by the morbid action of the
   plant or animal. M. Pasteur the eminent naturalist, sent by the French
   government to investigate the matter, after laborious research decided
   that they were independent organisms propagating themselves and
   multiplying with astonishing rapidity. "Guided by that theory, he has
   devised a method of extirpating the disease, which has proved to be
   completely successful wherever it has been properly carried out." [9]

   Professor Huxley closes his address by saying that he had invited his
   audience to follow him "in an attempt to trace the path which has been
   followed by a scientific idea, in its slow progress from the position
   of a probable hypothesis to that of an established law of nature."
   Biogenesis, then, according to Huxley, is an established law of nature.
   [10]

   Professor Tyndall deals with this subject in his lecture delivered in
   September, 1870, on "The Scientific Uses of the Imagination." He says
   that the question concerning the origin of life is, Whether it is due
   to a creative flat, Let life be!' or to a process of evolution. Was it
   potentially in matter from the beginning? or, Was it inserted at a
   later period? However the convictions here or there may be influenced,
   he says, "the process must be slow which commends the hypothesis of
   natural evolution to the public mind. For what are the core and essence
   of this hypothesis? Strip it naked, and you stand face to face with the
   notion that not alone the more ignoble forms of animalcular or animal
   life, not alone the nobler forms of the horse and lion, not alone the
   exquisite and wonderful mechanism of the human body, but that the human
   mind itself -- emotion, intellect, will, and all their phenomena --
   were once latent in a fiery cloud. Surely the mere statement of such a
   notion is more than a refutation. I do not think that any holder of the
   evolution hypothesis would say that I overstate it or overstrain it in
   any way. I merely strip it of all vagueness, and bring before you,
   unclothed and unvarnished, the notions by which it must stand or fall.
   Surely these notions represent an absurdity too monstrous to be
   entertained by any sane mind." [11] Professor Tyndall, however, as well
   as Professor Huxley, is on both sides of this question. Materialism,
   with its doctrine of spontaneous generation, is thus monstrous and
   absurd, only on the assumption that matter is matter. If you only
   spiritualize matter until it becomes mind, the absurdity disappears.
   And so do materialism, and spontaneous generation, and the whole array
   of scientific doctrines. If matter becomes mind, mind is God, and God
   is everything. Thus the monster Pantheism swallows up science and its
   votaries. We do not forget that the naturalist, after spending his life
   in studying matter, comes to the conclusion that "matter is nothing,"
   that the "Supreme Intelligence" is the universe. [12] Thus it is that
   those who overstep the limits of human knowledge, or reject the control
   of primary truths, fall into the abyss of outer darkness.

   The way Professor Tyndall puts the matter is this: [13] "These
   evolution notions are absurd, monstrous, and fit only for the
   intellectual gibbet in relation to the ideas concerning matter which
   were drilled into us when young. Spirit and matter have ever been
   presented to us in the rudest contrast; the one as all-noble, the other
   as all-vile." If instead of these perverted ideas of material and
   spirit, we come "to regard them as equally worthy and equally
   wonderful; to consider them, in fact, as two opposite faces of the same
   great mystery," as different elements, of "what our mightiest spiritual
   teacher would call the Eternal Fact of the Universe," then the case
   would be different. It would no longer be absurd, as Professor Tyndall
   seems to think, for mind to become matter or matter mind, or for the
   phenomena of the one to be produced by the forces of the other. The
   real distinction, in fact, between them would be done away. "Without
   this total revolution," he says, "of the notions now prevalent, the
   evolution hypothesis must stand condemned; but in many profoundly
   thoughtful minds such a revolution has already occurred." We have,
   then, the judgment of Professor Tyndall, one of the highest authorities
   in the scientific world, that if matter be what all the world believes
   it to be, materialism, spontaneous generation, and evolution, or
   development, are absurdities "too monstrous to be entertained by any
   sane mind."

   We can cite his high authority as to another point. Suppose we give up
   everything; admit that there is no real distinction between matter and
   mind; that all the phenomena of the universe, vital and mental
   included, may be referred to physical causes; that a free or
   spontaneous act is an absurdity; that there can be no intervention of a
   controlling mind or will in the affairs of men, no personal existence
   of man after death, -- suppose we thus give up our morals and religion,
   all that ennobles man and dignifies his existence, what do we gain?
   According to Professor Tyndall, nothing. [14] "The evolution
   hypothesis," he tells us, "does not solve -- it does not profess to
   solve -- the ultimate mystery of this universe. It leaves that mystery
   untouched. At bottom, it does nothing more than transpose the
   conception of life's origin to an indefinitely distant past.' Even
   granting the nebula and its potential life, the question, Whence came
   they?' would still remain to baffle and bewilder us." If we must admit
   the agency of will, "caprice," as Professor Tyndall calls it, billions
   of ages in the past, why should it be unphilosophical to admit it now?

   It is very evident, therefore, that the admission of the primary truths
   of the reason -- truths which, in point of fact, all men do admit --
   truths which concern even our sense perceptions, and involve the
   objective existence of the material world, necessitates the admission
   of mind, of God, of providence, and of immortality. Professor Tyndall
   being judge, materialism, spontaneous generation, the evolution of
   life, thought, feeling, and conscience out of matter, are absurdities
   "too monstrous to be entertained by any sane mind, unless matter be
   spiritualized into mind, -- and then everything is God, and God is
   everything.

   Theories of Development.

   Lamarck.

   Lamarck, a distinguished French naturalist, was the first of modern
   scientific men who adopted the theory that all vegetables and animals
   living on the earth, including man, are developed from certain
   original, simple germs. This doctrine was expounded in his "Zoölogie
   Philosophique," published in 1809. Lamarck admitted the existence of
   God, to whom he referred the existence of the matter of which the
   universe is composed. But God having created matter with its
   properties, does nothing more. Life, organisms, and mind are all the
   product of unintelligent matter and its forces. All living matter is
   composed of cellular tissue, consisting of the aggregation of minute
   cells. These cells are not living in themselves, but are quickened into
   life by some ethereal fluid pervading space, such as heat and
   electricity. Life, therefore, according to this theory, originates in
   spontaneous generation.

   Life, living cells or tissues, having thus originated, all the
   diversified forms of the vegetable and animal kingdoms have been
   produced by the operation of natural causes; the higher, even the
   highest, being formed from the lowest by a long-continued process of
   development.

   The principles of Lamarck's theory "are involved in the three following
   propositions: --

   "1. That any considerable and permanent change in the circumstances in
   which a race of animals is placed, superinduces in them a real change
   in their wants and requirements.

   "2. That this change in their wants necessitates new actions on their
   part to satisfy those Wants, and that finally new habits are thus
   engendered.

   "3. that these new actions and habits necessitate a greater and more
   frequent use of particular organs already existing, which thus become
   strengthened and improved; or the development of new organs when new
   wants require them; or the neglect of the use of old organs, which may
   thus gradually decrease and finally disappear." [15]

   Vestiges of Creation.

   Some thirty years since a work appeared anonymously, entitled "The
   Vestiges of Creation," in which the theory of Lamarck in essential
   features was reproduced. The writer agreed with his predecessor in
   admitting an original creation of matter; in referring the origin of
   life to physical causes; and in deriving all the general species and
   varieties of plants and animals by a process of natural development
   from a common source. These writers differ in the way in which they
   carry out their common views and as to the grounds which they urge in
   their support.

   The author of the "Vestiges of Creation" assumes the truth of the
   nebular hypothesis, and argues from analogy that as the complicated and
   ordered systems of the heavenly bodies are the result of physical laws
   acting on the original matter pervading space, it is reasonable to
   infer that the different orders of plants and animals have arisen in
   the same way. He refers to the gradation observed in the vegetable and
   animal kingdoms; the simpler everywhere preceding the more complex, and
   the unity of plan being preserved throughout. He lays great stress also
   on the foetal development of the higher orders of animals. The human
   foetus, for example, assuming in succession the peculiarities of
   structure of the reptile, of the fish, of the bird, and of man. This is
   supposed to prove that man is only a more perfectly developed reptile;
   and that the orders of animals differ simply as to the stage they
   occupy in this unfolding series of life. As the same larva of the bee
   can be developed into a queen, a drone, or a worker, so the same living
   cell can be developed into a reptile, a fish, a bird, or a man. There
   are, however, the author admits, interruptions in the scale; species
   suddenly appearing without due preparation. This he illustrates by a
   reference to the calculating machine, which for a million of times will
   produce numbers in regular series, and then for once produce a number
   of a different order; thus the law of species that like shall beget
   like may hold good for an indefinite period, and then suddenly a new
   species be begotten. These theories and their authors have fallen into
   utter disrepute among scientific men, and have no other than a slight
   historical interest.

   Darwin.

   The new theory on this subject proposed by Mr. Charles Darwin, has, for
   the time being, a stronger hold on the public mind. He stands in the
   first rank of naturalists, and is on all sides respected not only for
   his knowledge and his skill in observation and description, but for his
   frankness and fairness. His theory, however, is substantially the same
   with those already mentioned, inasmuch as he also accounts for the
   origin of all the varieties of plants and animals by the gradual
   operation of natural causes. In his work on the "Origin of Species" he
   says: "I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or
   five progenitors; and plants from an equal or lesser number." On the
   same page, [16] however, he goes much further, and says: "Analogy would
   lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all animals and
   plants are descended from some one prototype;" and he adds that "all
   the organic beings, which have ever lived on this earth, may be
   descended from some one primordial form." [17] The point of most
   importance in which Darwin differs from his predecessors is, that he
   starts with life, they with dead matter. They undertake to account for
   the origin of life by physical causes; whereas he assumes the existence
   of living cells or germs. He does not go into the question of their
   origin. He assumes them to exist; which would seem of necessity to
   involve the assumption of a Creator. The second important point of
   difference between the theories in question is, that those before
   mentioned account for the diversity of species by the inward power of
   development, a vis a tergo as it were, i.e., a struggle after
   improvement; whereas Darwin refers the origin of species mainly to the
   laws of nature operating ab extra, killing off the weak or less
   perfect, and preserving the stronger or more perfect. The third point
   of difference, so far as the author of the "Vestiges of Creation" is
   concerned, is that the latter supposes new species to be formed
   suddenly; whereas Darwin holds that they arise by a slow process of
   very minute changes. They all agree, however, in the main point that
   all the infinite diversities and marvellous organisms of plants and
   animals, from the lowest to the highest, are due to the operation of
   unintelligent physical causes.

   The Darwinian theory, therefore, includes the following principles: --

   First, that like begets like; or the law of heredity, according to
   which throughout the vegetable and animal world, the offspring is like
   the parent.

   Second, the law of variation; that is, that while in all that is
   essential the offspring is like the parent, it always differs more or
   less from its progenitor. These variations are sometimes
   deteriorations, sometimes indifferent, sometimes improvements; that is,
   such as enable the plant or animal more advantageously to exercise its
   functions.

   Third, that as plants and animals increase in a geometrical ratio, they
   tend to outrun enormously the means of support, and this of necessity
   gives rise to a continued and universal struggle for life.

   Fourth, in this struggle the fittest survive; that is, those
   individuals which have an accidental variation of structure which
   renders them superior to their fellows in the struggle for existence,
   survive, and transmit that peculiarity to their offspring. This is
   "natural selection;" i.e., nature, without intelligence or purpose,
   selects the individuals best adapted to continue and to improve the
   race. It is by the operation of these few principles that in the course
   of countless ages all the diversified forms of vegetables and animals
   have been produced.

   "It is interesting," says Darwin, "to contemplate a tangled bank,
   clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the
   bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling
   through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately
   constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each
   other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting
   around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with
   Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction;
   Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of
   life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead
   to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection,
   entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less improved
   forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most
   exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the
   production of the higher animals, directly follows." [18]

   Remarks on the Darwinian Theory.

   First, it shocks the common sense of unsophisticated men to be told
   that the whale and the humming-bird, man and the mosquito, are derived
   from the same source. Not that the whale was developed out of the
   humming-bird, or man out of the mosquito, but that both are derived by
   a slow process of variations continued through countless millions of
   years. Such is the theory with its scientific feathers plucked off. No
   wonder that at its first promulgation it was received by the scientific
   world, not only with surprise, but also with indignation. [19] The
   theory has, indeed, survived this attack. Its essential harmony with
   the spirit of the age, the real learning of its author and advocates,
   have secured for it an influence which is widespread, and, for the
   time, imposing.

   A second remark is that the theory in question cannot be true, because
   it is founded on the assumption of an impossibility. It assumes that
   matter does the work of mind. This is an impossibility and an absurdity
   in the judgment of all men except materialists; and materialists are,
   ever have been, and ever must be, a mere handful among men, whether
   educated or uneducated. The doctrine of Darwin is, that a primordial
   germ, with no inherent intelligence, develops, under purely natural
   influences, into all the infinite variety of vegetable and animal
   organisms, with all their complicated relations to each other and to
   the world around them. He not only asserts that all this is due to
   natural causes; and, moreover, that the lower impulses of vegetable
   life pass, by insensible gradations, into the instinct of animals and
   the higher intelligence of man, but he argues against the intervention
   of mind anywhere in the process. God, says Lamarck, created matter;
   God, says Darwin, created the unintelligent living cell; both say that,
   after that first step, all else follows by natural law, without purpose
   and without design. No man can believe this, who cannot also believe
   that all the works of art, literature, and science in the world are the
   products of carbonic acid, water, and ammonia.

   The Atheistic Character of the Theory.

   Thirdly, the system is thoroughly atheistic, and therefore cannot
   possibly stand. God has revealed his existence and his government of
   the world so clearly and so authoritatively, that any philosophical or
   scientific speculations inconsistent with those truths are like cobwebs
   in the track of a tornado. They offer no sensible resistance. The mere
   naturalist, the man devoted so exclusively to the study of nature as to
   believe in nothing but natural causes, is not able to understand the
   strength with which moral and religious convictions take hold of the
   minds of men. These convictions, however, are the strongest, the most
   ennobling, and the most dangerous for any class of men to disregard or
   ignore.

   In saying that this system is atheistic, it is not said that Mr. Darwin
   is an atheist. He expressly acknowledges the existence of God; and
   seems to feel the necessity of his existence to account for the origin
   of life. Nor is it meant that every one who adopts the theory does it
   in an atheistic sense. It has already been remarked that there is a
   theistic and an atheistic form of the nebular hypothesis as to the
   origin of the universe; so there may be a theistic interpretation of
   the Darwinian theory. Men who, as the Duke of Argyle, carry the reign
   of law into everything, affirming that even creation is by law, may
   hold, as he does, that God uses everywhere and constantly physical
   laws, to produce not only the ordinary operations of nature, but to
   give rise to things specifically new, and therefore to new species in
   the vegetable and animal worlds. Such species would thus be as truly
   due to the purpose and power of God as though they had been created by
   a word. Natural laws are said to be to God what the chisel and the
   brush are to the artist. Then God is as much the author of species as
   tile sculptor or painter is the author of the product of his skill.
   This is a theistic doctrine. That, however, is not Darwin's doctrine.
   His theory is that hundreds or thousands of millions of years ago God
   called a living germ, or living germs, into existence, and that since
   that time God has no more to do with the universe than if He did not
   exist. This is atheism to all intents and purposes, because it leaves
   the soul as entirely without God, without a Father, Helper, or Ruler,
   as the doctrine of Epicurus or of Comte. Darwin, moreover, obliterates
   all the evidences of the being of God in the world. He refers to
   physical causes what all theists believe to be due to the operations of
   the Divine mind. There is no more effectual way of getting rid of a
   truth than by rejecting the proofs on which it rests. Professor Huxley
   says that when he first read Darwin's book he regarded it as the
   death-blow of teleology, i.e., of the doctrine of design and purpose in
   nature. [20] Büchner, to whom the atheistical character of a book is a
   recommendation, says that Darwin's "theory is the most thoroughly
   naturalistic that can be imagined, and far more atheistic than that of
   his despised (verrufenen) predecessor Lamarck, who admitted at least a
   general law of progress and development; whereas, according to Darwin,
   the whole development is due to the gradual summation of innumerable
   minute and accidental natural operations." [21]

   Mr. Darwin argues against any divine intervention in the course of
   nature, and especially in the production of species. He says that the
   time is coming when the doctrine of special creation, that is, the
   doctrine that God made the plants and animals each after its kind, will
   be regarded as "a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived
   opinion. These authors," he adds, "seem no more startled at a
   miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth. But do they
   really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth's history
   certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into
   living tissues?" [This is precisely what Darwin professes to believe
   happened at the beginning. If it happened once, it is not absurd that
   it should happen often.] "Do they believe that at each supposed act of
   creation one individual or many were produced? Were all the infinitely
   numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as
   full grown? And in the case of mammals, were they created bearing the
   false marks of nourishment from the mothers womb?" [22]

   Mr. Wallace devotes the eighth chapter of his work on "Natural
   Selection" [23] to answering the objections urged by the Duke of Argyle
   to the Darwinian theory. He says, "The point on which the Duke lays
   most stress, is, that proofs of mind everywhere meet us in nature, and
   are more especially manifest wherever we find contrivance' or beauty.'
   He maintains that this indicates the constant supervision and direct
   interference of the Creator, and cannot possibly be explained by the
   unassisted action of any combination of laws. Now Mr. Darwin's work has
   for its main object to show, that all the phenomena of living things --
   all their wonderful organs and complicated structures; their infinite
   variety of form, size, and colour; their intricate and involved
   relations to each other, -- may have been produced by the action of a
   few general laws of the simplest kind, -- laws which are in most cases
   mere statements of admitted facts." [24] In opposition to the doctrine
   that God "applies general laws to produce effects which those laws are
   not in themselves capable of producing," he says, "I believe, on the
   contrary, that the universe is so constituted as to be self-regulating;
   that as long as it contains life, the forms under which that life is
   manifested have an inherent power of adjustment to each other and to
   surrounding nature; and that this adjustment necessarily leads to the
   greatest amount of variety and beauty and enjoyment, because it does
   depend on general laws, and not on a continual supervision and
   rearrangement of details." [25]

   Dr. Gray [26] endeavours to vindicate Darwin's theory from the charge
   of atheism. His arguments, however, only go to prove that the doctrine
   of development, or derivation of species, may be held in a form
   consistent with theism. This no one denies. They do not prove that Mr.
   Darwin presents it in that form. Dr. Gray himself admits all that those
   who regard the Darwinian theory as atheistic contend for. [27] He says,
   "The proposition that things and events in nature were not designed to
   be so, if logically carried out, is doubtless tantamount to atheism."
   Again, [28] he says, "To us, a fortuitous Cosmos is simply
   inconceivable. The alternative is a designed Cosmos. . . . If Mr.
   Darwin believes that the events which he supposes to have occurred and
   the results we behold were undirected and undesigned, or if the
   physicist believes that the natural forces to which he refers phenomena
   are uncaused and undirected, no argument is needed to show that such
   belief is atheistic." No argument, after what has been said above, can
   be needed to show that Mr. Darwin does teach that natural causes are
   "undirected," and that they act without design or reference to an end.
   This is not only explicitly and repeatedly asserted, but argued for,
   and the opposite view ridiculed and rejected. His book was hailed as
   the death-blow of teleology. [29] Darwin, therefore, does teach
   precisely what Dr. Gray pronounces atheism. A man, it seems, may
   believe in God, and yet teach atheism.

   The anti-theistic and materialistic, character of this theory is still
   further shown by what Mr. Darwin says of our mental powers. "In the
   distant future," he says, "I see open fields for far more important
   researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the
   necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.
   Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history." [30] Of
   this prediction he has himself attempted the verification in his recent
   work on the "Descent of Man," in which he endeavours to prove that man
   is a developed ape. The Bible says: Man was created in the image of
   God.

   It is a mere Hypothesis.

   A fourth remark on this theory is that it is a mere hypothesis, from
   its nature incapable of proof. It may take its place beside the nebular
   hypothesis as an ingenious method of explaining many of the phenomena
   of nature. We see around us, in the case of domestic animals, numerous
   varieties produced by the operations of natural causes. In the
   vegetable world this diversity is still greater. Mr. Darwin's theory
   would account for all these facts. It accounts, moreover, for the unity
   of plan on which all animals of the same class or order are
   constructed; for the undeveloped organs and rudimentally in almost all
   classes of living creatures; for the different forms through which the
   embryo passes before it reaches maturity. These and many other
   phenomena may be accounted for on the assumption of the derivation of
   species. Admitting all this and much more, this does not amount to a
   proof of the hypothesis. These facts can be accounted for in other
   ways; while there are, as Darwin himself admits, many facts for which
   his theory will not account. Let it be borne in mind what the theory
   is. It is not that all the species of any extant genus of plants or
   animals have been derived from a common stock; that all genera and
   classes of organized beings now living have been thus derived; but that
   all organisms from the earliest geological periods have, by a process
   requiring some five hundred million years, been derived from one
   primordial germ. [31] Nor is this all. It is not only that material
   organisms have thus been derived by a process of gradation, but also
   that instincts, mental and moral powers, have been derived and attained
   by the same process. Nor is even this all. We are called upon to
   believe that all this has been brought about by the action of
   unintelligent physical causes. To our apprehension, there is nothing in
   the Hindu mythology and cosmology more incredible than this.

   It is hazarding little to say that such a hypothesis as this cannot be
   proved. Indeed its advocates do not pretend to give proof. Mr. Wallace,
   as we have seen, says, "Mr. Darwin's work has for its main object, to
   show that all the phenomena of living things, -- all their wonderful
   organs and complicated structures, their infinite variety of form,
   size, and colour, their intricate and involved relations to each other,
   -- may have been produced by the action of a few general laws of the
   simplest kind." May have been. There is no pretence that this account
   of the origin of species can be demonstrated. All that is claimed is
   that it is a possible solution. Christians must be very timid to be
   frightened by a mere "may have been."

   Mr. Huxley says, "After much consideration, and with assuredly no bias
   against Mr. Darwin's views, it is our clear conviction that, as the
   evidence stands, it is not absolutely proven that a group of animals,
   having all the characters exhibited by species in Nature, has ever been
   originated by selection, whether artificial or natural." [32]

   In "Frasers Magazine" for June and July, 1860, are two papers on the
   Darwinian theory, written by William Hopkins F. R. S. In the number for
   July it is said, "If we allow full weight to all our author's arguments
   in his chapter on hybridism, we only arrive at the conclusion that
   natural selection may possibly have produced changes of organization,
   which may have superinduced the sterility of species; and that,
   therefore, the above proposition may, be true, though not a single
   positive fact be adduced in proof of it. And it must be recollected
   that this is no proposition of secondary importance -- a mere turret,
   as it were, in our author's theoretical fabric, -- but the chief
   corner-stone which supports it. We confess that all the respect which
   we entertain for the author of these views, has inspired us with no
   corresponding feeling towards this may be philosophy, which is content
   to substitute the merely possible for the probable, and which, ignoring
   the responsibility of any approximation to rigorous demonstration in
   the establishment of its own theories, complacently assumes them to be
   right till they are rigorously proved to be wrong. When Newton, in
   former times, put forth his theory of gravitation he did not call on
   philosophers to believe it, or else to show that it was wrong, but felt
   it incumbent on himself to prove that it was right." [33]

   Mr. Hopkins' review was written before Mr. Darwin had fully expressed
   his views as to the origin of man. He says, the great difficulty in any
   theory of development is "the transition in passing up to man from the
   animals next beneath him, not to man considered merely as a physical
   organism, but to man as an intellectual and moral being. Lamarck and
   the author of the Vestiges' have not hesitated to expose themselves to
   a charge of gross materialism in deriving mind from matter, and in
   making all its properties and operations depend on our physical
   organization. . . . . We believe that man has an immortal soul, and
   that the beasts of the field have not. If any one deny this, we can
   have no common ground of argument with him. Now we would ask, at what
   point of his progressive improvement did man acquire this spiritual
   part of his being, endowed with the awful attribute of immortality? Was
   it an accidental variety,' seized upon by the power of natural
   selection,' and made permanent? Is the step from the finite to the
   infinite to be regarded as one of the indefinitely small steps in man's
   continuous progress of development, and effected by the operation of
   ordinary natural causes ?" [34]

   The point now in hand, however, is that Mr. Darwin's theory is
   incapable of proof. From the nature of the case, what concerns the
   origin of things cannot be known except by a supernatural revelation.
   All else must be speculation and conjecture. And no man under the
   guidance of reason will renounce the teachings of a well-authenticated
   revelation, in obedience to human speculation, however ingenious. The
   uncertainty attending all philosophical or scientific theories as to
   the origin of things, is sufficiently apparent from their number and
   inconsistencies. Science as soon as she gets past the actual and the
   extant, is in the region of speculation, and is merged into philosophy,
   and is subject to all its hallucinations.

   Theories of the Universe.

   Thus we have, --

   1. The purely atheistic theory; which assumes that matter has existed
   forever, and that all the universe contains and reveals is due to
   material forces.

   2. The theory which admits the creation of matter, but denies any
   further intervention of God in the world, and refers the origin of life
   to physical causes. This was the doctrine of Lamarck, and of the author
   of the "Vestiges of Creation," and is the theory to which Professor
   Huxley, notwithstanding his denial of spontaneous generation in the
   existing state of things, seems strongly inclined in his address as
   President of the British Association for the Promotion of Science,
   delivered in September, 1870, he said: "Looking back through the
   prodigious vista of the past, I find no record of the commencement of
   life, and therefore I am devoid of any means of forming a definite
   conclusion as to the conditions of its appearance. Belief, in the
   scientific sense of the word, is a serious matter, and needs strong
   foundations. To say, therefore, in the admitted absence of evidence,
   that I have any belief as to the mode in which the existing forms of
   life have originated, would be using words in a wrong sense. But
   expectation is permissible, where belief is not; and if it were given
   me to look beyond the abyss of genealogically recorded time to the
   still more remote period when the earth was passing through physical
   and chemical conditions which it can no more see again than a man may
   recall his infancy, I should expect to be a witness of the evolution of
   living protoplasm from not living matter. I should expect to see it
   appear under forms of great simplicity, endowed, like existing fungi,
   with the power of determining the formation of new protoplasm from such
   matters as ammonium carbonates, oxalates and tartrates, alkaline and
   earthy phosphates, and water, without the aid of light." [35] It had
   been well for the cause of truth, and well for hundreds who have been
   perverted by his writings, if Mr. Darwin had recognized this
   distinction between "scientific belief" needing "strong foundations,"
   and "expectation" founded, as Professor Huxley says in a following
   sentence, "on analogical reasoning." In the paper already quoted in
   "Fraser's Magazine," the writer says in reference to Darwin: "We would
   also further remind him that the philosophical naturalist must not only
   train the eye to observe accurately, but the mind to think logically;
   and the latter will often be found the harder task of the two. With
   respect to all but the exact sciences, it may be said that the highest
   mental faculty which they call upon us to exert is that by which we
   separate and appreciate justly the possible, the probable, and the
   demonstrable." [36]

   Darwin.

   3. The third speculative view is that of Mr. Darwin and his associates,
   who admit not only the creation of matter, but of living matter, in the
   form of one or a few primordial germs from which without any purpose or
   design, by the slow operation of unintelligent natural causes, and
   accidental variations, during untold ages, all the orders, classes,
   genera, species, and varieties of plants and animals, from the lowest
   to the highest, man included, have been formed. Teleology, and
   therefore, mind, or God, is expressly banished from the world. In
   arguing against the idea of God's controlling with design the operation
   of second causes, Mr. Darwin asks, "Did He ordain that the crop and
   tail-feathers of the pigeon should vary, in order that the fancier
   might make his grotesque pouter and fan-tail breeds? Did He cause the
   frame and mental qualities of the dog to vary in order that a breed
   might be formed of indomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin down
   the bull for man's brutal sport? But, if we give up the principle in
   one case, -- if we do not admit that the variations of the primeval dog
   were intentionally guided, in order that the greyhound, for instance,
   that perfect image of symmetry and vigour, might be formed -- no shadow
   of reason can be assigned for the belief that variations, alike in
   nature and the result of the same general laws, which have been the
   groundwork through natural selection of the formation or the most
   perfectly adapted animals in the world, man included, were
   intentionally and specially guided. However much we may wish it, we can
   hardly follow Professor Asa Gray in his belief that variation has been
   led along certain beneficial lines,' like a stream along definite and
   useful lines of irrigation.'" [37] In this paragraph man is declared to
   be an unintended product of nature.

   J. J. Murphy.

   4. Others again, unable to believe that unintelligent causes can
   produce effects indicating foresight and design, insist that there must
   be intelligence engaged in the production of such effects, but they
   place this intelligence in nature and not in God. This, as remarked
   above, is a revival of the old idea of a Demiurgus or Anima mundi. Mr.
   J. J. Murphy, in his work on "Habit and Intelligence," says, I believe
   "that there is something in organic progress which mere natural
   selection among spontaneous variations will not account for. Finally, I
   believe this something is that organizing intelligence which guides the
   action of the inorganic forces and forms structures which neither
   natural selection nor any other unintelligent agency could form." [38]
   What he means by intelligence and where it resides we learn from the
   preface to the first volume of his book. "The word intelligence," he
   says, "scarcely needs definition, as I use it in its familiar sense. It
   will not be questioned by any one that intelligence is found in none
   but living beings; but it is not so obvious that intelligence is an
   attribute of all living beings, and coextensive with life itself. When
   I speak of intelligence, however, I mean not only the conscious
   intelligence of the mind, but also the organizing intelligence which
   adapts the eye for seeing, the ear for hearing, and every other part of
   an organism for its work. The usual belief is, that the organizing
   intelligence and the mental intelligence are two distinct
   intelligences. I have stated the reasons for my belief that they are
   not distinct, but are two separate manifestations of the same
   intelligence, which is coextensive with life, though it is for the most
   part unconscious, and only becomes conscious of itself in the brain of
   man." [39]

   Owen.

   5. Professor Owen, England's great naturalist, agrees with Darwin in
   two points: first, in the derivation or gradual evolution of species;
   and secondly, that this derivation is determined by the operation of
   natural causes. "I have been led," he says, "to recognize species as
   exemplifying the continuous operation of natural law, or secondary
   cause; and that, not only successively, but progressively; from the
   first embodiment of the vertebrate idea under its old ichthyic vestment
   until it became arrayed in the glorious garb of the human form." [40]
   He differs from Darwin in that he does not refer the origin of species
   to natural selection, i.e., to the law of the survival of the fittest
   of accidental variations; but to inherent or innate tendencies. "Every
   species changes, in time, by virtue of inherent tendencies thereto."
   [41] And in the second place he does not regard these changes as
   accidental variations, but as designed and carried out in virtue of an
   original plan. "Species owe as little," he says [42] "to the accidental
   concurrence of environing circumstances as Kosmos depends on a
   fortuitous concourse of atoms. A purposive route of development and
   change, of correlation and interdependence, manifesting intelligent
   will, is as determinable in the succession of races as in the
   development and organization of the individual. Generations do not vary
   accidentally, in any and every direction; but in preordained, definite,
   and correlated courses." [43]

   The Reign of Law Theory.

   6. Still another view is that which demands intelligence to account for
   the wonders of organic life, and finds that intelligence in God, but
   repudiates the idea of the supernatural. That is, it does not admit
   that God ever works except through second causes or by the laws of
   nature. Those who adopt this view are willing to admit the derivation
   of species; and to concede that extant species were formed by the
   modifications of those which preceded them; but maintain that they were
   thus formed according to the purpose, and by the continued agency, of
   God; an agency ever operative in guiding the operation of natural laws
   so that they accomplish the designs of God. The difference between this
   and Professor Owen's theory is, that he does not seem to admit of this
   continued intelligent control of God in nature, but refers everything
   to the original, preordaining purpose or plan of the Divine Being.

   7. Finally, without pretending to exhaust the speculations on this
   subject, we have what may be called the commonly received and
   Scriptural doctrine. That doctrine teaches, -- (1.) That the universe
   and all it contains owe their existence to the will and power of God;
   that matter is not eternal, nor is life self-originating. (2.) God
   endowed matter with properties or forces, which He upholds, and in
   accordance with which He works in all the ordinary operations of his
   providence. That is, He uses them everywhere and constantly, as we use
   them in our narrow sphere. (3.) That in the beginning He created, or
   caused to be, every distinct kind of plant and animal: "And God said,
   Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the
   fruit-tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon
   the earth: and it was so." "And God said, Let the earth bring forth the
   living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast
   of the earth after his kind: and it was so." This is the Scriptural
   account of the origin of species. According to this account each
   species was specially created, not ex nihilo, nor without the
   intervention of secondary causes, but nevertheless originally, or not
   derived, evolved, or developed from preëxisting species. These distinct
   species, or kinds of plants and animals thus separately originated, are
   permanent. They never pass from one into the other. It is, however, to
   be remembered that species are of two kinds, as naturalists distinguish
   them, namely, natural and artificial. The former are those which have
   their foundation in nature; which had a distinct origin, and are
   capable of indefinite propagation. The latter are such distinctions as
   naturalists have made for their own convenience. Of course, it is not
   intended that every one of the so-called species of plants and animals
   is original and permanent, when the only distinction between one
   species and another may be the accidental shape of a leaf or colour of
   a feather. It is only of such species as have their foundation in
   nature that originality and permanence are asserted. Artificial
   species, as they are called, are simply varieties. Fertility of
   offspring is the recognized criterion of sameness of species. If what
   has been just said be granted, then, if at any time since the original
   creation, new species have appeared on the earth, they owe their
   existence to the immediate intervention of God.

   Here then are at least seven different views as to the origin of
   species. How is it possible for science to decide between them? Science
   has to do with the facts and laws of nature. But here the question
   concerns the origin of such facts. "Here," says Dr. Gray, "proofs, in
   the proper sense of the word, are not to be had. We are beyond the
   region of demonstration, and have only probabilities to consider." [44]
   Christians have a right to protest against the arraying of
   probabilities against the clear teachings of Scripture. It is not easy
   to estimate the evil that is done by eminent men throwing the weight of
   their authority on the side of unbelief, influenced by a mere balance
   of probabilities in one department, to the neglect of the most
   convincing proofs of a different kind. They treat, for example, the
   question of the unity of the human race, exclusively as a zoölogical
   question, and ignore the testimony of history, of language, and of
   Scripture. Thus they often decide against the Bible on evidence that
   would not determine an intelligent jury in a suit for twenty shillings.

   Admitted Difficulties in the Way of the Darwinian Theory

   One of the great excellences of Mr. Darwin is his candor. He
   acknowledges that there are grave objections against the doctrine which
   he endeavours to establish. He admits that if one species is derived by
   slow gradations from another, it would be natural to expect the
   intermediate steps, or connecting links, to be everywhere visible. But
   he acknowledges that such are not to be found, that during the whole of
   the historical period, species have remained unchanged. They are now
   precisely what they were thousands of years ago. There is not the
   slightest indication of any one passing into another; or of a lower
   advancing towards a higher. This is admitted. The only answer to the
   difficulty thus presented is, that the change of species is so slow a
   process that no indications can be reasonably expected in the few
   thousand years embraced within the limits of history. When it is
   further objected that geology presents the same difficulty, that the
   genera and species of fossil animals are just as distinct as those now
   living; that new species appear at certain epochs entirely different
   from those which preceded; that the most perfect specimens of these
   species often appear at the beginning of a geologic period and not
   toward its close; the answer is that the records of geology are too
   imperfect, to give us full knowledge on this subject: that innumerable
   intermediate and transitional forms may have passed away and left no
   trace of their existence. All this amounts to an admission that all
   history and all geology are against the theory; that they not only do
   not furnish any facts in its support, but that they do furnish facts
   which, so far as our knowledge extends, contradict it. In reference to
   these objections from geology, Mr. Darwin says, "I can answer these
   questions and objections only on the supposition that the geological
   record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe. The number
   of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with
   the countless generations of countless species which have certainly
   existed." [45] Nevertheless the record, as far as it goes, is against
   the theory.

   With regard to the more serious objection that the theory assumes that
   matter does the work of mind, that design is accomplished without any
   designer, Mr. Darwin is equally candid. "Nothing at first," he says,
   "can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs
   and instincts have been perfected, not by means superior to, though
   analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable
   slight variations, each good for the individual possessor.
   Nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination
   insuperably great, cannot be considered real, if we admit the following
   propositions, namely, that all parts of the organization and instincts
   offer at least individual differences, -- that there is a struggle for
   existence leading to the preservation of profitable deviations of
   structure or instinct, -- and, lastly, that gradatians in the state of
   perfection of each organ may have existed, each good of its kind." [46]

   Again, he says, "Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the
   eye could have been formed by natural selection, is more than enough to
   stagger any one; yet in the case of any organ, if we know of a long
   series of gradations in complexity, each good for its possessor; then,
   under changing conditions of life, there is no logical impossibility in
   the acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through natural
   selection." [47] Mr. Darwin refuses to be staggered by that which he
   says is enough to stagger any one. Give him a sufficient number of
   millions of years, and fortuitous complications may accomplish
   anything. If a rude piece of flint be found in deposits, it is declared
   to be the work of man, because it indicates design, while such an organ
   as the eye may be formed by natural selection acting blindly. This, Dr.
   Gray says in his apology, is, or would be, a strange contradiction.

   Sterility of Hybrids.

   The immutability of species is stamped on the very face of nature What
   the letters of a book would be if all were thrown in confusion, the
   genera and species of plants and animals would be, if they were, as
   Darwin's theory assumes, in a state of constant variation, and that in
   every possible direction. All line-marks would be obliterated, and the
   thoughts of God, as species have been called, would be obliterated from
   his works. To prevent this confusion of "kind," it has been established
   as a law of nature that animals of different "kinds" cannot mingle and
   produce something different from either parent, to be again mingled and
   confused with other animals of a still different kind. In other words,
   it is a law of nature, and therefore a law of God, that hybrids should
   be sterile. This fact Mr. Darwin does not deny. Neither does he deny
   the weight of the argument derived from it against his theory. He only,
   as in the cases already mentioned, endeavours to account for the fact.
   Connecting links between species are missing; but they may have
   perished. Hybrids are sterile; but that may be accounted for in some
   other way without assuming that it was designed to secure the
   permanence of species. When a great fact in nature is found to secure a
   most important end in nature, it is fair to infer that it was designed
   to accomplish that end, and consequently that end is not to be
   overlooked or denied.

   Geographical Distribution.

   Mr. Darwin is equally candid in reference to another objection to his
   doctrine. "Turning to geographical distribution," he says, [48] "the
   difficulties encountered on the theory of descent with modification are
   serious enough. All the individuals of the same species, and all the
   species of the same genus, or even higher group, must save descended
   from common parents; and therefore, in however distant and isolated
   parts of the world they may now be found, they must in the course of
   successive generations have travelled from some one point to all the
   others." When it is remembered that this is true of the mollusks and
   crustacea, animals whose power of locomotion is very limited, this
   almost universal distribution from one centre would seem to be an
   impossibility. Darwin's answer to this is the same as to the
   difficulties already mentioned. He throws himself on the possibilities
   of unlimited duration. Nobody can tell what may have happened during
   the untold ages of the past. "Looking to geographical distribution," he
   says, "if we admit that there has been through the long course of ages
   much migration from one part of the world to another, owing to former
   climatal and geographical changes and to the many occasional and
   unknown means of dispersal, then we can understand, on the theory of
   descent with modification, most of the great leading facts in
   distribution." [49] Every one must see how inconclusive is all such
   reasoning. If we admit that many unknown things may have happened in
   the boundless past, then we can understand most, but not all, of the
   facts which stand opposed to the theory of the derivation of species.
   The same remark may be made in reference to the constant appeal to the
   unknown effects of unlimited durations. "The chief cause," says Mr.
   Darwin, "of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has
   given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow
   in admitting any great change of which we do not see the steps. . . . .
   The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of even ten
   million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many
   slight variations accumulated during an almost infinite number of
   generations." [50] If we say that the ape during the historic period
   extending over thousands of years has not made the slightest
   approximation towards becoming a man, we are told, Ah! but you do not
   know what he will do in ten millions of years. To which it is a
   sufficient reply to ask, How much is ten million times nothing?

   Ordinary men reject this Darwinian theory with indignation as well as
   with decision, not only because it calls upon them to accept the
   possible as demonstrably true, but because it ascribes to blind,
   unintelligent causes the wonders of purpose and design which the world
   everywhere exhibits; and because it effectually banishes God from his
   works. To such men it is a satisfaction to know that the theory is
   rejected on scientific grounds by the great majority of scientific men.
   Mr. Darwin himself says, "The several difficulties here discussed,
   namely -- that, though we find in our geological formations many links
   between the species which now exist and which formerly existed, we do
   not find infinitely numerous tine transitional forms closely joining
   them all together; the sudden manner in which several whole groups of
   species first appear in our European formations; the almost entire
   absence, as at present known, of formations rich in fossils beneath the
   Cambrian strata, -- are all undoubtedly of the most serious nature. We
   see this in the fact that the most eminent palæontologists, namely,
   Cuvier, Agassiz, Barrande, Pictet, Falconer, E. Forbes, etc., and all
   our greatest geologists, as Lyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, etc., have
   unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the immutability of species."
   [51]

   In 1830 there was a prolonged discussion of this subject is the
   Académie des Sciences in Paris, Cuvier taking the side of the
   permanence of species, and of creation and organization governed by
   final purpose; while Geoffroy St. Hilaire took the side of the
   derivation and mutability of species, and "denied," as Professor Owen
   says, "evidence of design, and protested against the deduction of a
   purpose." The decision was almost unanimously in favour of Cuvier; and
   from 1830 to 1860 there was scarcely a voice raised in opposition to
   the doctrine which Cuvier advocated. This, as Büchner thinks, was the
   triumph of empiricism, appealing to facts, over philosophy guided by
   "Apriorische Speculationen." Professor Agassiz, confessedly the first
   of living naturalists, thus closes his review of Darwin's book: "Were
   the transmutation theory true, the geological record should exhibit an
   uninterrupted succession of types blending gradually into one another.
   The fact is that throughout all geological times each period is
   characterized by definite specific types, belonging to definite genera,
   and these to definite families, referable to definite orders,
   constituting definite classes and definite branches, built upon
   definite plans. Until the facts of nature are shown to have been
   mistaken by those who have collected them, and that they have a
   different meaning from that now generally assigned to them, I shall
   therefore consider the transmutation theory as a scientific mistake,
   untrue in its facts, unscientific in its method, and mischievous in its
   tendency." [52] If species, then, are immutable, their existence must
   be due to the agency of God, mediate or immediate, and in either case
   so exercised as to make them answer a thought and purpose in the divine
   mind. And, more especially, man does not owe his origin to the gradual
   development of a lower form of irrational life, but to the energy of
   his Maker in whose image he was created.

   Pangenesis.

   Mr. Darwin refers, in the "Origin of Species," [53] to "the hypothesis
   of Pangenesis," which, he says, he had developed in another work. As
   this hypothesis is made subservient to the one under consideration, it
   serves to illustrate its nature and gives an insight into the character
   of the writer's mind. Mr. Mivart says that the hypothesis of Pangenesis
   may be stated as follows: "That each living organism is ultimately made
   up of an almost infinite number of minute particles, or organic atoms,
   termed gemmules,' each of which has the power of reproducing its kind.
   Moreover, that these particles circulate freely about the organism
   which is made up of them, and are derived from all parts of all the
   organs of the less remote ancestors of each such organism during all
   the states and stages of such several ancestors' existence; and
   therefore of the several states of each of such ancestors' organs. That
   such a complete collection of gemmules is aggregated in each ovum and
   spermatozoon in most animals, and each part capable of reproducing by
   gemmation (budding) in the lowest animals and plants. Therefore in many
   of such lower organisms such a congeries of ancestral grammules must
   exist in every part of their bodies since in them every part is capable
   of reproducing by gemmation. Mr. Darwin must evidently admit this,
   since he says, It has often been said by naturalists that each cell of
   a plant has the actual or potential capacity of reproducing the whole
   plant; but it has this power only in virtue of containing gemmules
   derived from every part.'" [54] These gemmules are organic atoms; they
   are almost infinite in number; they are derived from all the organs of
   the less remote ancestors of the plant or animal; they are stored in
   every ovum or spermatozoon; they are capable of reproduction. But
   reproduction, as involving the control of physical causes to accomplish
   a purpose, is a work of intelligence. These inconceivably numerous and
   minute gemmules are, therefore, the seats of intelligence. Surely this
   is not science. Any theory which needs the support of such a hypothesis
   must soon be abandoned. It would be far easier to believe in fairies
   forming every plant, than in these gemmules.

   Finally, it may be noticed that Mr. Wallace, although advocating the
   doctrine of "Natural Selection," contends that it is not applicable to
   man; that it will not account for his original or present state; and
   that it is impossible, on Mr. Darwin's theory, to account for man's
   physical organization, for his mental powers, or for his moral nature.
   To this subject the tenth chapter of his work is devoted.

   stated in the text Professor Huxley asks, "How can we over-estimate the
   value of that knowledge of the nature of epidemic and epizootic
   diseases, and consequently, of the means of checking or eradicating
   them, the dawn of which has assuredly commenced? Looking back no
   further than ten years, it is possible to select three (1863, 1864, and
   1869) in which the total number of deaths from scarlet fever alone
   amounted to ninety thousand. That is the return of killed, the maimed
   and disabled being left out of sight. . . . . The facts which I have
   placed before you must leave the least sanguine without a doubt that
   the nature and causes of this scourge will one day be as well
   understood as those of the Pébrine (the silk-worm disease) and that the
   long-suffered massacre of our innocents will come to an end."

   [10] In quoting Professor Huxley as an authority on both sides of the
   question of spontaneous generation, no injustice is done that
   distinguished naturalist. He wishes to believe that doctrine. His
   principles lead to that conclusion. But, as a question of scientific
   fact, he is constrained to admit that all the evidence is against it.
   He, therefore, does not believe it, although he thinks it may be true.
   Hence Mr. Mivart says that Professor Huxley and Tyndall, while they
   dissent from Dr. Bastian's conclusions in favour of spontaneous
   generation, nevertheless, "agree with him in principle, though they
   limit the evolution of the organic world from the inorganic to a very
   remote period of the world's history." Genesis of Species, p. 266,

   H. Higgins, in which he says that he considered the paper of M.
   Agassiz, inserted in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History,
   against Darwin, "to be quite unworthy of so distinguished a naturalist"
   (p.42). On a subsequent page he gives a selection from Agassiz's
   disparaging remarks. The same volume contains a paper from Dr.
   Collingwood in defence of Agassiz and his criticism. In the review of
   the argument he says he will pass over Agassiz's "caustic remarks upon
   the confusion of ideas implied on the general terms, variability of
   species," and also "his categorical contradictions of many of Darwin's
   fundamental statements; but never was a theory more solely beset than
   is that of Darwin by the repeated assaults of such a giant in
   palæontology as Agassiz. Statement after statement, by which the whole
   theory hangs together, is assailed and impugned, -- stone after stone
   of the Darwinian structure trembles before the battering-ram of the
   champion of species. Out of twelve such reiterated attacks, ten of
   which are purely palæntological, and stand unchallenged only one has
   called for remarks, and that one, perhaps, the least important" (p.87).
   Agassiz is not a theologian; he opposes the theory as a scientific man
   and on scientific grounds.

   [20] Criticisms on "The Origin of Species;" in his Lay Sermons and
   Addresses, p. 330. "The teleological argument," he says, "runs thus: An
   organ or organism is precisely fitted to perform a function or purpose;
   therefore it was specially constructed to perform that function. In
   Paley's famous illustration, the adaptation of all the parts of the
   watch to the function, or purpose, of showing the time, is held to be
   evidence that the watch was specially contrived to that end; on the
   ground that the only cause we know, competent to produce such an effect
   as a watch which shall keep time, is a contriving intelligence adapting
   the means directly to that ends." Suppose, however, he goes on to say,
   it could be shown that the watch was the product of a structure which
   kept time poorly; and that of a structure which was no watch at all,
   and that of a mere revolving barrel, then "the force of Paley's
   argument would be gone;" and it would be "demonstrated that an
   apparatus thoroughly well adapted to a particular purpose might be the
   result of a method of trial and error worked by unintelligent agents,
   as well as of the direct application of the means appropriate to that
   end, by an intelligent agent." This is precisely what he understands
   Darwin to have accomplished.

   "actions of law," he must mean by law a permanent, regularly acting
   force. Yet the laws to which Mr. Wallace refers in the above passages
   are not forces, but simply rules according to which an agent acts, or,
   a regular, established sequence of events. The laws intended are the
   law of multiplication in geometrical progression, the law of limited
   populations, the law of heredity, the law of variation, the law of
   unceasing change of physical conditions upon the surface of the earth,
   the equilibrium or harmony of nature. There is no objection to these
   being called laws. But there is the strongest objection to using the
   word law in different senses in the same argument. If law here means
   the rule according to which an agent (in this case God) acts, the Duke
   of Argyle could agree with every word Mr. Wallace says; if taken in the
   sense intended by the writer, the passage teaches the direct reverse,
   namely, that all the world is or contains is due to unintelligent
   physical forces.

   the wonders of animals and vegetable organisms and life can be
   accounted for by unintelligent, physical laws. The act, however, is, as
   we have already seen, that he belives no such thing. He does not
   believe that there is any such thing as matter or unintelligent forces;
   all force is mind force; and the only power operative in the universe
   is the will of the Supreme Intelligence.

   [31] Sir William Thompson, of England, had objected to the theory that,
   according to his calculations, the sun cannot have existed in a solid
   state longer than five hundred millions of years. To this Mr. Wallace
   replies, that that period, he thinks long enough to satisfy the demands
   of the hypothesis. Mr. J. J. Murphy, however, is of a contrary opinion.
   He says that it is probable that it required at least five hundred
   years to produce a greyhound -- Mr. Darwin's ideal of symmetry -- out
   of the original wolf-like dog, and that certainly it would require more
   than a million times longer to produce an elephant out of a Protozoon,
   or even a tadpole. Besides, Sir William Thompson allows in fact only
   one, and not five hundred millions of years for the existence of the
   earth. In the Transactions of Geological Society of Glasgow, vol. iii.,
   he says: "When, finally, we consider under-ground temperature, we find
   ourselves driven to the conclusion that the existing state of things on
   the earth, life on the earth, all geological history showing continuity
   of life, must be limited within some such period of past time as one
   hundred million years." See Habit and Intelligence, by J. J. Murphy,

   and species, with all their attributes of instinct and intelligence

   words, "But Sir Charles Lyell now gives the support of his high
   authority to the opposite side." Professor Owen, as shown above,
   although now admitting the mutability of species, is very far from
   adopting Mr. Darwin's theory. The essential element of that theory is
   the denial of teleology; the assertion that species owe their origin to
   the unintelligent operation of natural causes. This Owen distinctly
   denies. "Assuming, then," he says, "that Palæotherium did ultimately
   become Equus, I gain no conception of the operation of the effective
   force by personifying as Nature' the aggregate of beings which compose
   the universe, or the laws which govern these beings, by giving to my
   personification an attribute which can properly be predicated only of
   intelligence, and by saying, Nature has selected the mid-hoof and
   rejected the others.'" American Journal of Science, second series, vol.
   xlvii. p. 41. As to Sir Charles Lyell, unless he has become a new man
   since the publication of the ninth edition of his Principles of Geology
   in 1853, he is as far as Professor Owen from adopting the Darwinian
   theory; although he may admit in a certain sense, the derivation of
   species.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Antiquity of Man.

   "Anthropologists are now," as we are told, "pretty well agreed that man
   is not a recent introduction into the earth. All who have studied the
   question, now admit that his antiquity is very great; and that, though
   we have to some extent ascertained the minimum of time during which he
   must have existed, we have made no approximation towards determining
   that far greater period during which he may have, and probably has,
   existed. We can with tolerable certainty affirm that man must have
   inhabited the earth a thousand centuries ago, but we cannot assert that
   he positively did not exist, or that there is any good evidence against
   his having existed, for a period of ten thousand centuries." [55]

   On this it may be remarked, first, that it is a historical fact that
   nothing is less reliable than these calculations of time. A volume
   might be filled with examples of the mistakes of naturalists in this
   matter. The world has not forgotten the exultation of the enemies of
   the Bible when the number of successive layers of lava on the sides of
   Mount Etna was found to be so great as to require, as was said,
   thousands upon thousands of years for their present condition. All that
   has passed away. Mr. Lyell calculated that two hundred and twenty
   thousand years were necessary to account for changes now going on on
   the coast of Sweden. Later geologists reduce the time to one tenth of
   that estimate. A piece of pottery was discovered deeply buried under
   the deposits at the mouth of the Nile. It was confidently asserted that
   the deposit could not have been made during the historic period, until
   it was proved that the article in question was of Roman manufacture.
   Sober men of science, therefore, have no confidence in these
   calculations requiring thousands of centuries, or even millions of
   years, for the production of effects subsequent to the great geological
   epochs.

   The second remark in reference to this great antiquity claimed the
   human race is that the reasons assigned for it are, in the judgment of
   the most eminent men of science, unsatisfactory. The facts urged to
   prove that men have lived for an indefinite number of ages on the
   earth, are, (1.) The existence of villages built on piles, now
   submerged in lakes in Switzerland and in some other places, which, it
   is assumed, are of great antiquity. (2.) The discovery of human remains
   in a fossil state in deposits to which geologists assign an age counted
   by tens, or hundreds, of thousands of years. (3) The discovery of
   utensils of different kinds made of flint, in connection with the
   remains of extinct animals. (4.) The early separation of men into the
   distinct races in which they now exist. On this point Sir Charles Lyell
   says: "Naturalists have long felt that to render probable the received
   opinion that all the leading varieties of the human family have
   originally sprung from a single pair (a doctrine against which there
   appears to me to be no sound objection), a much greater lapse of time
   is required for the slow and gradual formation of races (such as the
   Caucasian, Mongolian, and Negro) than is embraced in any of the popular
   systems of chronology." The Caucasian and the Negro are distinctly
   marked in the Egyptian monuments to which an antiquity of three
   thousand years is ascribed. We must, therefore, he argues, allow "for a
   vast series of antecedent ages" to account for the gradual formation of
   these distinct races. [56] In addition to all these arguments, it is
   contended that monuments and records exist which prove the existence of
   man on the earth long before the period assigned to his creation in the
   Bible.

   Lake Dwellings.

   In many of the lakes of Switzerland piles have been discovered worn
   down to the surface of the mud, or projecting slightly above it, which
   once supported human habitations. These are so numerous as to render it
   evident that whole villages were thus sustained over the surface of the
   water. These villages, "nearly all of them," are "of unknown date, but
   the most ancient of them "certainly belonged to the age of stone, for
   hundreds of implements resembling those of the Danish shell-mounds and
   peat mosses have been dredged up from the mud into which the piles were
   driven." Numerous bones of no less than fifty-four species of animals
   have been dug up from these localities, all of which, with one
   exception, are still living in Europe. The remains of several
   domesticated animals, as the ox, sheep, goat, and dog, are included in
   the number. [57]

   There is evidently in all this no proof of great antiquity. Even as
   late as during the last century, similar huts, supported on piles, were
   to be seen. All the animal remains found are of extant species. There
   is nothing to show that these lake dwellings were even as old as the
   time of the Romans. The fact relied upon is the absence of metal, and
   the presence of stone implements. Hence, it is inferred that these
   villages belonged to the "Stone Age." To this succeeded the "Bronze
   Age," and to that the Age of Iron. Sir Charles Lyell informs us that
   the Swiss geologists, as represented by M. Monet, assign "to the bronze
   age a date of between three thousand and four thousand years, and to
   the stone period an age of five thousand to seven thousand." [58]

   It is, however, a mere arbitrary speculation that there ever was a
   stone age. It is founded on the assumption that the original condition
   of man was one of barbarism, from which he elevated himself by slow
   degrees; during the first period of his progress he used only
   implements of stone; then those of bronze; and then those of iron; and
   that thousands of years elapsed before the race passed from one of
   these stages of progress to another. Hence, if remains of men are found
   anywhere in connection with stone implements, they are referred to the
   stone age. According to this mode of reasoning, if in an Indian village
   flint arrow-heads and hatchets should be found, the inference would be
   that the whole world was in barbarism when those implements were used.
   Admitting that at the time the lake dwellings were inhabited, the
   people of Switzerland, and even all the people of Europe, were
   unacquainted with the use of the metals, that would not prove that
   civilization was not at its height in Egypt or India. Moreover, the
   assumption that the original state of man was one of barbarism, is not
   only contrary to the Bible and to the convictions of the great body of
   the learned, but, as is believed, to the plainest historical facts.

   Fossil Human Remains.

   Much more weight in this discussion is attached to the discovery of
   human remains in the same localities and under the same circumstances
   with those of animals now extinct. From this it is inferred that man
   must have lived when those animals still inhabited the earth. These
   human remains are not found in any of the ancient fossiliferous rocks.
   The Scriptural fact that man was the last of the living creatures which
   proceeded from the hand of God, stands unimpeached by any scientific
   fact. A nearly perfect human skeleton was found imbedded in a limestone
   rock on the island of Guadaloupe. That rock, however, is of modern
   origin, and is still in process of formation. The age assigned to this
   fossil is only about two hundred years. A fragment of conglomerate rock
   was obtained at the depth of ten feet below the bed of the river Dove,
   in England, containing silver coins of the reign of Edward the First.
   This shows that it does not require many years to form rocks, and to
   bury them deeply under the surface. The remains on which stress is laid
   are found only in caverns and buried under deposits of peat or of
   earthy matter. Geologists seem to be agreed as to the fact that human
   bones have been found in certain caves in France, Belgium, and England
   intimately associated with the remains of animals now living, and with
   those of a few of the extinct races.

   The fact being admitted, the question is, How is it to be accounted
   for? This juxtaposition is no certain proof of contemporaneousness.
   These caverns, once the resort of wild beasts, became to men places of
   concealment, of defence, of worship, or of sepulture, and, therefore,
   as Sir Charles Lyell himself admits, "It is not on the evidence of such
   intermixtures that we ought readily to admit either the high antiquity
   of the human race, or the recent date of certain lost species of
   quadrupeds." [59]

   In immediate connection with the passage just referred to, Lyell
   suggests another method by which the remains of animals belonging to
   very different ages of the world might become mixed together. That is,
   "open fissures" which "serve as natural pitfalls." He quotes the
   following account from Professor Sedgwick of a chasm of enormous but
   unknown depth, which "is surrounded by grassy shelving banks, and many
   animals, tempted toward its brink, have fallen down and perished in it.
   The approach of cattle is now prevented by a strong lofty wall; but
   there can be no doubt that, during the last two or three thousand
   years, great masses of bony breccia must have accumulated in the lower
   parts of the great fissure, which probably descends through the whole
   thickness of the scar-limestone to the depth of perhaps five or six
   hundred feet." To this Lyell adds, "When any of these natural pit-falls
   happen to communicate with lines of subterranean caverns, the bones,
   earth, and breccia may sink by their own weight, or be washed into the
   vaults below." [60]

   There is a third way in which this intermingling of the bones of
   animals of different ages may be accounted for. With regard to the
   remarkable caverns in the province of Liege, Sir Charles Lyell says
   that Dr. Schmerling, the naturalist, by whom they had been carefully
   and laboriously examined, did not think they were "dens of wild beasts,
   but that their organic and inorganic contents had been swept into them
   by streams communicating with the surface of the country. The bones, he
   suggested, may often have been rolled in the beds of such streams
   before they reached their underground destination." [61] It is clear,
   therefore, that no conclusive argument to prove that man was
   contemporary with certain extinct animals can be drawn from the fact
   that their remains have in some rare instances been found in the same
   localities.

   Human Bones found deeply buried.

   Still less weight is to be attached to the fact that human bones have
   been found deeply buried in the earth. Every one knows that great
   changes have been made in the earths surface within the historic
   period. Such changes are produced sometimes by the slow operation of
   the causes which have buried the foundations of such ancient cities as
   Jerusalem and Rome far beneath the present surface of the ground. At
   other times they have been brought about by sudden catastrophes. It is
   not surprising that human remains should be found in peat-bogs, if as
   Sir Charles Lyell tells us, "All the coins, axes, arms, and other
   utensils found in British and French mosses, are Roman; so that a
   considerable portion of the peat in European peat-bogs is evidently not
   more ancient than the age of Julius Cæsar." [62]

   The data by which the rate of deposits is determined are so uncertain
   that no dependence can be placed upon them. Sir Charles Lyell says,
   "the lowest estimate of the time required" for the formation of the
   existing delta of the Mississippi, is more than one hundred thousand
   years. [63] According to the careful examination made by gentlemen of
   the Coast Survey and other United States officers, the time during
   which the delta has been in progress is four thousand four hundred
   years. [64] Since the memory of man, or, since fishing-huts have been
   built on the coasts of Sweden, there has been such a subsidence of the
   coast that "a fishing-hut having a rude fire-place within, was struck,
   in digging a canal, at a depth of sixty feet." [65] "At the earthquake
   in 1819 about the Delta of the Indus, an area of two thousand square
   miles became an inland sea, and the fort and village of Sindree sunk
   till the tops of the houses were just above the water. Five and a half
   miles from Sindree, parallel with this sunken area, a region was
   elevated ten feet above the delta, fifty miles long and in some parts
   ten broad." [66] While such changes, secular and paroxysmal, gradual
   and sudden, have been in operation for thousands of years, it is
   evident that the intermingling of the remains of recent with those of
   extinct races of animals furnishes no proof that the former were
   contemporaneous with the latter.

   Flint Implements.

   Quite as much stress has been laid on the discovery of certain
   implements made of flint under deposits which, it is contended, are of
   such age as prove that man must have existed on the earth for ages
   before the time assigned in the Bible for his creation. To this
   argument the same answer is to be given. First, that the presence of
   the works of human art in such deposits is no proof that men were
   contemporaneous with such deposits; in view of the upheavals and
   displacements which all geologists admit are of frequent occurrence in
   the history of our globe. And secondly, the facts themselves are
   disputed, or differently interpreted by men of science of equal
   authority. This is especially true of the flint arrows, beads, and axes
   found in the valley of the Somme in France. [67] Lyell is confident
   that the argument from them is conclusive. Later examinations, however,
   have led others to a different conclusion. This is a question for
   scientific men to decide among themselves, and which they alone are
   competent to decide. So long however, as men of the highest rank as
   naturalists maintain that science knows of no facts inconsistent with
   the Scriptural account of the origin of man, the friends of the Bible
   are under no obligation to depart from the generally received
   interpretation of the Scriptures on this subject. Professor Guyot, as
   all who know him or have heard his public lectures, are well aware,
   teaches that there are no known facts which may not be accounted for on
   the assumption that man has existed seven or eight thousand years on
   this earth. It is well known also that this doctrine, until very
   recently, was universal among scientific men. Cuvier was so convinced
   on this point that he could hardly be brought to look at what purported
   to be the fossil remains of man. This conviction on his part, was not a
   prejudice; nor was it due to a reverence for the Bible. It was a
   scientific conviction founded on scientific evidence. The proofs from
   all sources of the recent origin of man were considered such as to
   preclude the possibility of his being contemporaneous with any of the
   extinct races of animals. And even those who were led to admit that
   point, were in many cases disposed to regard the fact as proving not
   the antiquity of man, but the existence to a much later period than
   generally supposed, of animals now extinct. The occurrence of human
   relics with the bones of extinct animals, "does not seem to me," says
   Prestwich, "to necessitate the carrying of man back in past time, so
   much as the bringing forward of the extinct animals toward our own
   time." [68] The fact that the monuments of human art cannot pretend to
   a higher antiquity than a few thousand years, renders it utterly
   incredible that man has existed on the earth hundreds of thousands or,
   as Darwin supposes, millions of years.

   Argument from the Races of Men and from Ancient Monuments

   Another argument is founded on the assumption that the difference
   between the Caucasian, Mongolian, and negro races, which is known to
   have been as distinctly marked two or three thousand years before
   Christ as it is now, must have required countless ages to develop and
   establish. To this it is obvious to answer, First, that differences
   equally great have occurred in domestic animals within the historic
   period. Secondly, that marked varieties are not unfrequently produced
   suddenly, and, so to speak, accidentally. Thirdly, that these varieties
   of race are not the effect of the blind operation of physical causes,
   but by those causes as intelligently guided by God for the
   accomplishment of some wise purpose. Animals living in the arctic
   regions are not only clothed in fur for their protection from the cold,
   but the color of their clothing changes with the season. So God
   fashions the different races of men in their peculiarities to suit them
   to the regions which they inhabit. Dr. Livingstone, the great African
   traveller, informs us that the negro type, as it is popularly conceived
   of, occurs very rarely in Africa, and only in districts where great
   heat prevails in connection with great moisture. The tribes in the
   interior of that continent differ greatly, he says, both in hue and
   contour.

   The idea that it must have taken countless ages for men to rise from
   the lowest barbarism to the state of civilization indicated by the
   monuments of Egypt, rests on no better assumption. The earliest state
   of man instead of being his lowest, was in many respects his highest
   state. And our own experience as a nation shows that it does not
   require millenniums for a people to accomplish greater works than Egypt
   or India can boast. Two hundred years ago this country was a wilderness
   from the Atlantic to the Pacific. What is it now? According to Bunsen
   it would require a hundred thousand years to erect all these cities,
   and to build all these railroads and canals.

   It is further urged as a proof of the great antiquity of man that the
   monuments and monumental records of Egypt prove that a nation existed
   in the highest state of civilization at the time of, or immediately
   after, the flood. The chronology of the Bible, it is argued, and the
   chronology of Egypt are thus shown to be irreconcilable.

   In reference to this difficulty it may be remarked, that the
   calculations of Egyptologists are just as precarious, and in many
   stances just as extravagant as those of geologists. This is proved by
   their discrepancies. It may be said, however, that even the most
   moderate students of Egyptian antiquities assign a date to the reign of
   Manes and the building of the pyramids inconsistent with the chronology
   of the Bible. To this it may be replied that the chronology of the
   Bible is very uncertain. The data are for the most part facts
   incidentally stated; that is, not stated for the purposes of
   chronology. The views most generally adopted rest mainly on the
   authority of Archbishop Usher, who adopted the Hebrew text for his
   guide, and assumed that in the genealogical tables each name marked one
   generation. A large part, however, of Biblical scholars adopt the
   Septuagint chronology in preference to the Hebrew; so that instead of
   four thousand years from the creation to the birth of Christ, we have
   nearly six thousand years. Besides it is admitted, that the usual
   method of calculation founded on the genealogical tables is very
   uncertain. The design of those tables is not to give the regular
   succession of births in a given line, but simply to mark the descent.
   This is just as well done if three, four, or more generations be
   omitted, as if the whole list were complete. That this is the plan on
   which these genealogical tables are constructed is an admitted fact.
   "Thus in Genesis xlvi. 18, after recording the sons of Zilpah, her
   grandsons and her great-grandsons, the writer adds, These are the sons
   of Zilpah . . . . . and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.'
   The same thing recurs in the case of Bilhah, verse 25, she bare these
   unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.' Compare, verses 15, 22. No one
   can pretend that the author of this register did not use the term
   understandingly of descendants beyond the first generation. In like
   manner, according to Matthew i. 11, Josias begat his grandson
   Jechonias, and verse 8, Joram begat his great-great-grandson Ozias. And
   in Genesis x. 15-18, Canaan, the grand son of Noah, is said to have
   begotten several whole nations, the Jebusite, the Amorite, the
   Girgasite, the Hivite, etc., etc. Nothing can be plainer, therefore,
   than that in the usage of the Bible, to bear and to beget' are used in
   a wide sense to indicate descent, without restricting this to the
   immediate offspring." [69]

   The extreme uncertainty attending all attempts to determine the
   chronology of the Bible is sufficiently evinced by the fact that one
   hundred and eighty different calculations have been made by Jewish and
   Christian authors, of the length of the period between Adam and Christ.
   The longest of these make it six thousand nine hundred and eighty-four,
   and the shortest three thousand four hundred and eighty-three years.
   Under these circumstances it is very clear that the friends of the
   Bible have no occasion for uneasiness. If the facts of science or of
   history should ultimately make it necessary to admit that eight or ten
   thousand years have elapsed since the creation of man, there is nothing
   in the Bible in the way of such concession. The Scriptures do not teach
   us how long men nave existed on the earth. Their tables of genealogy
   were intended to prove that Christ was the son of David and of the Seed
   of Abraham, and not how many years had elapsed between the creation and
   the advent. [70]

CHAPTER II.

  NATURE OF MAN.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Scripture Doctrine.

   The Scriptures teach that God formed the body of man out of the dust of
   the earth, and breathed into him the breath of life and he became nphs
   chyh, a living soul. According to this account, man consists of two
   distinct principles, a body and a soul: the one material, the other
   immaterial; the one corporeal, the other spiritual. It is involved in
   this statement, first, that the soul of man is a substance; and,
   secondly, that it is a substance distinct from the body. So that in the
   constitution of man two distinct substances are included.

   The idea of substance, as has been before remarked, is one of the
   primary truths of the reason. It is given in the consciousness of every
   man, and is therefore a part of the universal faith of men. We are
   conscious of our thoughts, feelings, and volitions. We know that these
   exercises or phenomena are constantly changing, but that there is
   something of which they are the exercises and .manifestation. That
   something is the self which remains unchanged, which is the same
   identical something, yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow. The soul is,
   therefore, not a mere series of acts; nor is it a form of the life of
   God, nor is it a mere unsubstantial force, but a real subsistence.
   Whatever acts is, and what is is an entity. A nonentity is nothing, and
   nothing can neither have power nor produce effects. The soul of man,
   therefore, is an essence or entity or substance, the abiding subject of
   its varying states and exercises. The second point just mentioned is no
   less plain. As we call know nothing of substance but from its
   phenomena, and as we are forced by a law of our nature to believe in
   the existence of a substance of which the phenomena are the
   manifestation, so by an equally stringent necessity we are forced to
   believe that where the phenomena are not only different, but
   incompatible, there the substances are also different. As, therefore,
   the phenomena or properties of matter are essentially different from
   those of mind, we are forced to conclude that matter and mind are two
   distinct substances; that the soul is not material nor the body
   spiritual. "To identify matter with mind," says Cousin, in a passage
   before quoted," or mind with matter; it is necessary to pretend that
   sensation, thought, volition, are reducible, in the last analysis, to
   solidity, extension, figure, divisibility, etc.; or that solidity,
   extension, figure, etc.. are reducible to sensation, thought, will."
   [71] It may be said, therefore, despite of materialists and idealists,
   that it is intuitively pertain that matter and mind are two distinct
   substances; and such has been the faith of the great body of mankind.
   This view of the nature of man which is presented in the original
   account of his creation, is sustained by the constant representations
   of the Bible.

   Truths on this Subject assumed in Scripture.

   The Scriptures do not formally teach any system of psychology, but
   there are certain truths relating both to our physical and mental
   constitution, which they constantly assume. They assume, as we have
   seen, that the soul is a substance; that it is a substance distinct
   from the body; and that there are two, and not more than two, essential
   elements in the constitution of man. This is evident, (1.) From the
   distinction everywhere made between soul and body. Thus, in the
   original account of the creation a clear distinction is made between
   the body as formed from the dust of the earth, and the soul or
   principle of life which was breathed into It from God. And in Gen. iii.
   19, it is said, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." As it
   was only the body that was formed out of the dust, it is only the body
   that is to return to dust. In Eccles. xii. 7, it is said, "Then shall
   the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return
   unto God who gave it." Is. x. 18, Shall consume . . . . both soul and
   body." Daniel says (vii. 15), "I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the
   midst of my body." Our Lord (Matt. vi. 25) commands his disciples to
   take no thought for the body; and, again (Matt. x. 28), "Fear not them
   which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear
   him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." Such is the
   constant representation of the Scriptures. The body and soul are set
   forth as distinct substances, and the two together as constituting the
   whole man. (2.) There is a second class of passages equally decisive as
   to this point. It consists of those in which the body is represented as
   a garment which is to be laid aside; a tabernacle or house in which the
   soul dwells, which it may leave and return to. Paul, on a certain
   occasion, did not know whether he was in the body or out of the body.
   Peter says he thought it meet as long as he was in this tabernacle to
   put his brethren in remembrance of the truth, "knowing," as he adds,
   "that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle." Paul, in 2 Cor. v. 1,
   says, "If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a
   building of God." In the same connection, he speaks of being unclothed
   and clothed upon with our house which is from heaven; and of being
   absent from the body and present with the Lord, knowing that while we
   are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. To the Philippians
   (i. 23, 24) he says, "I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to
   depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: nevertheless, to
   abide in the flesh is more needful for you." (3.) It is the common
   belief of mankind, the clearly revealed doctrine of the Bible, and part
   of the faith of the Church universal, that the soul can and does exist
   and act after death. If this be so, then the body and soul are two
   distinct substances. The former may be disorganized, reduced to (lust,
   dispersed, or even annihilated, and the latter retain its conscious
   life and activity. This doctrine was taught in the Old Testament, where
   the dead are represented as dwelling in Sheol, whence they occasionally
   reappeared, as Samuel did to Saul. Our Lord says that as God is not the
   God of the dead but of the living, his declaring himself to be the God
   of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, proves that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are
   now alive. Moses and Elijah conversed with Christ on the Mount. To the
   (lying thief our Lord said, "To-day shalt thou" (that in which his
   personality resided) "be with me in Paradise." Paul, as we have just
   seen, desired to be absent from the body and present with the Lord. He
   knew that his conscious personal existence was to be continued after
   the dissolution of his body. It is unnecessary to dwell on this point,
   as the continued existence of the soul in full consciousness and
   activity out of the body and in the interval between death and the
   resurrection, is not denied by any Christian Church. But if this be so
   it clearly proves that the soul and body are two distinct substances,
   so that the former can exist independently of the latter.

   Relation of the Soul and Body.

   Man, then, according to the Scriptures, is a created spirit in vital
   union with a material organized body. The relation between these two
   constituents of our nature is admitted to be mysterious. That is, it is
   incomprehensible. We do not know how the body acts on the mind, or how
   the mind acts on the body. These however, are plain, (1.) That the
   relation between the two is a vital union, in such a sense as that the
   soul is the source of life to the body. When the soul leaves the body
   the latter ceases to live. It loses its sensibility and activity, and
   becomes at once subject to the chemical laws which govern unorganized
   matter, and by their operation is soon reduced to dust,
   undistinguishable from the earth whence it was originally taken. (2.)
   It is a fact of consciousness that certain states of the body produce
   certain corresponding states of the mind. The mind takes cognizance of,
   or is conscious of, the impressions made by external objects on the
   organs of sense belonging to the body. The mind sees, the mind hears,
   and the mind feels, not directly or immediately (at least in our
   present and normal state), but through or by means of the appropriate
   organs of the body. It is also a matter of daily experience that a
   healthful condition of the body is necessary to a healthful state of
   the mind; that certain diseases or disorders of the one produce
   derangement in the operations of the other. Emotions of the mind affect
   the body; shame suffuses the cheek; joy causes the heart to beat and
   the eyes to shine. A blow on the head renders the mind unconscious,
   i.e., it renders the brain unfit to be the organ of its activity; and a
   diseased condition of the brain may cause irregular action in the mind,
   as in lunacy. All this is incomprehensible, but it is undeniable. (3.)
   It is also a fact of consciousness that, while certain operations of
   the body are independent of the conscious voluntary action of the mind,
   as the processes, of respiration, digestion, secretion, assimilation,
   etc., there are certain actions dependent on the will. We can will to
   move; and we can exert a greater or less degree of muscular force. It
   is better to admit these simple facts of consciousness and of
   experience, and to confess that, while they prove an intimate and vital
   union between the mind and body, they do not enable us to comprehend
   the nature of that union, than to have recourse to arbitrary and
   fanciful theories which deny these facts, because we cannot explain
   them. This is done by the advocates of the doctrine of occasional
   causes, which denies any action of the mind on the body or of the body
   on the mind, but refers all to the immediate agency of God. A certain
   state of the mind is the occasion on which God produces a certain act
   of the body; and a certain impression made on the body is the occasion
   on which God produces a certain impression on the mind. Leibnitz's
   doctrine of a preëstablished harmony is equally unsatisfactory. He
   denied that one substance could act on another of a different kind;
   that matter could act on mind or mind or matter. He proposed to account
   for the admitted correspondence between the varying states of the one
   and those of the other on the assumption of a prearrangement. God had
   foreordained that the mind should have the perception of a tree
   whenever the tree was presented to the eye, and that the arm should
   move whenever the mind had a volition to move. But he denied any causal
   relation between these two series of events.

   Realistic Dualism.

   The Scriptural doctrine of the nature of man as a created spirit in
   vital union with an organized body, consisting, therefore, of two, and
   only two, distinct elements or substances, matter and mind, is one of
   great importance. It is intimately connected with some of the most
   important doctrines of the Bible; with the constitution of the person
   of Christ, and consequently with the nature of his redeeming work and
   of his relation to the children of men; with the doctrine of the fall,
   original sin, and of regeneration; and with the doctrines of a future
   state and of the resurrection. It is because of this connection, and
   not because of its interest as a question in psychology, that the true
   idea of man demands the careful investigation of the theologian.

   The doctrine above stated, as the doctrine of the Scriptures and of the
   Church, is properly designated as realistic dualism. That is, it
   asserts the existence of two distinct res, entities, or substances; the
   one extended, tangible, and divisible, the object of the senses; the
   other unextended and indivisible, the thinking, feeling, and willing
   subject in man. This doctrine stands opposed to materialism and
   idealism, which although antagonistic systems in other respects, agree
   in denying any dualism of substance. The one makes the mind a function
   of the body; the other makes the body a form of the mind. But,
   according to the Scriptures and all sound philosophy, neither is the
   body, as Delitzsch [72] says, a precipitate of the mind, nor is the
   mind a sublimate of matter.

   The Scriptural doctrine of man is of course opposed to the old heathen
   doctrine which represents him as the firm in which nature, der
   Naturgeist, the anima mundi, cones to self-consciousness; and also to
   the wider pantheist, doctrine according to which men are the highest
   manifestations of the one universal principle of being and life; and to
   the doctrine which represents man as the union of the impersonal,
   universal reason or logos, with a living corporeal organization.
   According to this last mentioned view, man consists of the body (soma),
   soul (psuche), and logos, or the impersonal reason. This is very nearly
   the Apollinarian doctrine as to the constitution of Christ's person,
   applied to all mankind.

   § 2. Trichotomy.

   It is of more consequence to remark that the Scriptural doctrine is
   opposed to Trichotomy, or the doctrine that man consists of three
   distinct substances, body, soul, and spirit: soma, psuche, and pneuma;
   corpus, anima, and animus. This view of the nature of man is of the
   more importance to the theologian because it has not only been held to
   a greater or less extent in the Church, but also because it has greatly
   influenced the form in which other doctrines have been presented; and
   because it has some semblance of support from the Scriptures
   themselves. The doctrine has been held in different forms. The
   simplest, the most intelligible, and the one most commonly adopted is,
   that the body is the material part of our constitution; the soul, or
   psuche, is the principle of animal life; and the mind, or pneuma, the
   principle of our rational and immortal life. When a plant dies its
   material organization is dissolved and the principle of vegetable life
   which it contained disappears. When a brute dies its body returns to
   dust, and the or principle of animal life by which it was animated,
   passes away. When a man dies his body returns to the earth, his psuche
   ceases to exist, his pneuma alone remains until reunited with the body
   at the resurrection. To the pneuma, which is peculiar to man, belong
   reason, will, and conscience. To the psuche which we have in common
   with the brutes, belong understanding, feeling, and sensibility, or,
   the power of sense-perceptions. To the soma belongs what is purely
   material. [73] According to another view of the subject, the soul is
   neither the body nor the mind; nor is it a distinct subsistence, but it
   is the resultant of the union of the pneuma and soma. [74] Or according
   to Delitzsch, [75] there is a dualism of being in man, but a trichotomy
   of substance. He distinguishes between being and substance, and
   maintains, (1.) that spirit and soul (pneuma and psuche) are not
   verschiedene Wesen, but that they are verschiedene Substanzen. He says
   that the nphs chyh, mentioned in the history of the creation, is not
   the compositum resulting from the union of the spirit and body, so that
   the two constituted man; but it is a tertium quid, a third substance
   which belongs to the constitution of his nature. (2.) But secondly,
   this third principle does not pertain to the body; it is net the higher
   attributes or functions of the body, but it pertains to the spirit and
   is produced by it. It sustains the same relation to it that breath does
   to the body, or effulgence does to light. He says that the psuche,
   (soul) is the apaugasma of the pneuma and the bond of its union with
   the body.

   Trichotomy anti-Scriptural.

   In opposition to all the forms of trichotomy, or the doctrine of a
   threefold substance in the constitution of man, it may be remarked,
   (1.) That it is opposed to the account of the creation of man as given
   in Gen. ii. 7. According to that account God formed man out of the dust
   of the earth and breathed into him the breath of life, and he became
   nphs chyh i.e., a being ('srbv nphs chyh) in whom is a living soul.
   There is in this account no intimation of anything more than the
   material body formed of the earth and the living principle derived from
   God. (2.) This doctrine (trichotomy) is opposed to the uniform usage of
   Scripture. So far from the nphs, psuche, , anima, or soul, being
   distinguished from the rvch, pneuma, animus, or mind as either
   originally different or as derived from it, these words all designate
   one and the same thing. They are constantly interchanged. The one is
   substituted for the other, and all that is, or can be predicated of the
   one, is predicated of the other. The Hebrew nphs, and the Greek psuche,
   mean breath, life, the living principle; that in which life and the
   whole life of the subject spoken of resides. The same is true of rvch
   and pneuma, they also mean breath, life, and living principle. The
   Scriptures therefore speak of the nphs or psuche not only as that which
   lives or is the principle of life to the body, but, as that which
   thinks and feels, which may be saved or lost, which survives the body
   and is Immortal. The soul is the man himself, that in which his
   identity and personality reside. It is the Ego. Higher than the soul
   there is nothing in man. Therefore it is so often used as a synonym for
   self. Every soul is every man; my soul is I; his soul is he. What shall
   a man give in exchange for his soul. It is the soul that sins (Lev. iv.
   2): it is the soul that loves God. We are commanded to love God, en
   hole te psuche. Hope is said to be the anchor of the soul, and the word
   of God is able to save the soul. The end of our faith is said to be (1
   Peter i. 9), the salvation of our souls; and John (Rev. vi. 9; xx. 4),
   saw in heaven the souls of them that were slain for the word of God.
   From all this it is evident that the word psuche, or soul, does not
   designate the mere animal part of our nature, and is not a substance
   different from the pneuma, or spirit. (3.) A third remark on this
   subject is that all the words above mentioned, rvch ,nphs , and nsmh in
   Hebrew, psuche and pneuma in Greek, and soul and spirit in English, are
   used in the Scriptures indiscriminately of men and of irrational
   animals. If the Bible ascribed only a psuche to brutes, and both psuche
   and pneuma to man, there would be some ground for assuming that the two
   are essentially distinct. But such is not the case. The living
   principle in the brute is called both nphs and rvch, psuche and pneuma.
   That principle in the brute creation is irrational and mortal; in man
   it is rational and immortal. "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth
   upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?"
   Eccles. iii. 21. The soul of the brute is the immaterial principle
   which constitutes its life, and which is endowed with sensibility, and
   that measure of intelligence which experience shows the lower animals
   to possess. The soul in man is a created spirit of a higher order,
   which has not only the attributes of sensibility, memory, and instinct,
   but also the higher powers which pertain to our intellectual, moral,
   and religious life. As in the brutes it is not one substance that feels
   and another that remembers; so it is not one substance in man that is
   the subject of sensations, and another substance which has intuitions
   of necessary truths, and which is endowed with conscience and with the
   knowledge of God. Philosophers speak of world-consciousness, or the
   immediate cognizance which we have of what is without us; of
   self-consciousness, or the knowledge of what is within us; and of
   God-consciousness, or our knowledge and sense of God. These all belong
   to one and the same immaterial, rational substance. (4.) It is fair to
   appeal to the testimony of consciousness on this subject. We are
   conscious of our bodies and we are conscious of our souls, i.e., of the
   exercises and states of each; but no man is conscious of the psuche as
   distinct from the pneuma, of the soul as different from the spirit. In
   other words consciousness reveals the existence of two substances in
   the constitution of our nature; but it does not reveal the existence of
   three substances, and therefore the existence of more than two cannot
   rationally be assumed.

   Doubtful Passages Explained.

   (5.) The passages of Scriptures which are cited as favouring the
   opposite doctrine may all be explained in consistency with the cur-rent
   representations of Scripture on the subject. When Paul says to the
   Thessalonians, "I pray God your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be
   preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1
   Thessalonians v. 23). he only uses a periphrasis for the whole man. As
   when in Luke i. 46, 47, the virgin says, "My soul doth magnify the
   Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour," soul and spirit
   in this passage do not mean different things. And when we are commanded
   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
   soul, with all thy strength, and with all thy mind" (Luke x. 27), we
   have not an enumeration of so many distinct substances. Nor do we
   distinguish between the mind and heart as separate entities when we
   pray that both may be enlightened and sanctified; we mean simply the
   soul in all its aspects or faculties. Again, when in Heb. iv. 12, the
   Apostle says that the word of God pierces so as to penetrate soul and
   spirit, and the joints and marrow, he does not assume that soul and
   spirit are different substances. The joints and marrow are not
   different substances. They are both material; they are different forms
   of the same substance; and so soul and spirit are one and the same
   substance under different aspects or relations. We can say that the
   word of God reaches not only to the feelings, but also to the
   conscience, without assuming that the heart and conscience are distinct
   entities. Much less is any such distinction implied in Phil. i. 27,
   "Stand fast in one spirit (en heni pneumati), with one mind (mia
   psuche)." There is more difficulty in explaining 1 Cor. xv. 44. The
   Apostle there distinguishes between the soma psuchikon and the soma
   pneumatikon; the former is that in which the psuche is the animating
   principle; and the latter that in which the pneuma is the principle of
   life. The one we have here, the other we are to have hereafter. This
   seems to imply that the psuche exists in this life, but is not to exist
   hereafter, and therefore that the two are separable and distinct. In
   this explanation we might acquiesce if it did not contradict the
   general representations of the Scriptures. We are constrained,
   therefore, to seek another explanation which will harmonize with other
   portions of the word of God. The general meaning of the Apostle is
   plain. We have now gross, perishable, and dishonorable, or unsightly
   bodies. Hereafter we are to have glorious bodies, adapted to a higher
   state of existence. The only question is, why does he call the one
   psychical, and the other pneumatic? Because the word psuche, although
   often used for the soul as rational and immortal, is also used for the
   lower form of life which belongs to irrational animals. Our future
   bodies are not to be adapted to those principles of our nature which we
   have in common with the brutes, out to those which are peculiar to us
   as men, created in the image of God. The same individual human soul has
   certain susceptibilities and powers which adapt it to the present state
   of existence, and to the earthly house in which it now dwells. It has
   animal appetites and necessities. It can hunger and thirst. It needs
   sleep and rest. But the same soul has higher powers. The earthly body
   is suited to its earthly state; the heavenly body to its heavenly
   state. There are not two substances psuche and pneuma, there is but one
   and the same substance with different susceptibilities and powers. In
   this same connection Paul says, Flesh and blood cannot inherit the
   kingdom of heaven. Yet our bodies are to inherit that kingdom, and our
   bodies are flesh and blood. The same material substance now constituted
   as flesh and blood is to be so changed as to be like Christ's glorious
   body. As this representation does not prove a substantial difference
   between the body which now is and that which is to be hereafter, so
   neither does what the Apostle says of the soma psuchikon and the soma
   pneumatikon prove that the psuche and pneuma are distinct substances.

   This doctrine of a threefold constitution of man being adopted by
   Plato, was introduced partially into the early Church, but soon came to
   be regarded as dangerous, if not heretical. It being held by the
   Gnostics that the pneuma in man was a part of the divine essence, and
   incapable of sin; and by the Apollinarians that Christ had only a human
   soma and psuche, but not a human pneuma, the Church rejected the
   doctrine that the psuche and pneuma were distinct substances, since
   upon it those heresies were founded. In later times the Semi-Pelagians
   taught that the soul and body, but not the spirit in man were the
   subjects of original sin. All Protestants, Lutheran and Reformed, were,
   therefore, the more zealous in maintaining that the soul and spirit,
   psuche and pneuma, are one and the same substance and essence. And
   this, as before remarked, has been the common doctrine of the Church.

   § 3. Realism.

   Its General Character.

   There is still another view of the nature of man which, from Its
   extensive and long-continued influence, demands consideration.
   According to this view, man is defined to be, The manifestation of the
   general principle of humanity in union with a given corporeal
   organization. This view has been held in various forms which cannot
   here be severally discussed. It is only the theory in its more general
   features, or in the form in which it has been commonly presented. that
   our limits permit us to examine. It necessarily assumes that humanity,
   human nature as a general principle of a form of life, exists
   antecedently (either chronologically or logically) to individual men.
   "In the order of nature," says Dr. Shedd, "mankind exists before the
   generations of mankind; the nature is prior to the individuals produced
   out of it." [77] It exists, also, independently and outside of them. As
   magnetism is a force in nature existing antecedently, independently,
   and outside of any and all individual magnets; and as electricity
   exists independently of the Leyden jars in which it may be collected or
   through which it is manifested at present; as galvanism exists
   independently of any and all galvanic batteries; so humanity exists
   antecedently to individual men and independently of them. As an
   individual magnet is a given piece of soft iron in which the magnetic
   force is present and active, and as a Leyden jar is simply a coated jar
   in which electricity is present, so an individual man is a given
   corporeal organization in which humanity as a general life or force is
   present. To the question what is human nature, or humanity generically
   considered, there are different answers given. It is said to be a res,
   an essence, a substance, a real objective existence. It is some-thing
   which exists in time and space. This is the common mode of statement.
   The controversy between realists and nominalists, in its original and
   genuine form, turned upon this point. The question which for ages
   occupied to so great an extent the attention of all philosophers, was,
   What are universals? What are genera and species? What are general
   terms? Are they mere words? Are they thoughts or conceptions existing
   in the mind? Are the things expressed by general terms real objective
   existences? Do individuals only exist; so that species and genus are
   only classes of individuals of the same kind; or are individuals only
   the revelations or individualizations of a general substance which is
   the species or genus? According to the early and genuine realists, and
   according to the modern speculative philosophers, the species or genus
   is first, independent of and external to the individual. The individual
   is only "a subsequent modus existendi; the first and antecedent mode
   [in the case of man] being the generic humanity of which this
   subsequent serial mode is only another aspect or manifestation." [78]

   Precisely, as just stated, as magnetism is antecedent to the magnet.
   The magnet is only an individual piece of iron in and through which
   generic magnetism is manifested. Thus the realist says, "Etsi
   rationalitas non esset in aliquo, tamen in natura remaneret." [79]
   Cousin quotes the complaint of Anselm against Roscelin and other
   nominalists, "de ne pas comprendre comment plusieurs hommes ne sont
   qu'un seul et même homme, -- nondum intelliget quomodo plures homines
   in specie sint unus homo." [80] The doctrine of his "Monologium" and
   "Proslogium" and "Dialogus de veritate," Cousin says, is "que
   non-seulement il y a des individus humains, mais qu'il y a en autre le
   genre humain, l'humanité, qui est une, comme il admettait qu'il y a un
   temps absolu que les durées particulières manifestent sans le
   constituer, une vérité une et subsistante par elle-même, un type absolu
   du bien, que tous les biens particuliers supposent et réfléchissent
   plus ou moins imparfaitement." [81] He quotes Abélard as stating the
   doctrine which he opposed, in the following words: "Homo quædam species
   est, res una essentialiter, cui adveniunt formæ quædam et efficiunt
   Socratem: illam eamdem essentialiter eodem modo informant formæ
   facientes Platonem et cætera individua hominis; nec aliquid est in
   Socrate, præter illas formas informantes illam materiam ad faciendum
   Socratem, quin illud idem eodem tempore in Platone informatum sit
   formis Platonis. Et hoc intelligunt de singulis speciebus ad individua
   et de generibus ad species." [82] According to one theory, "les
   individus seuls existent et constituent 1'essence des choses;"
   according to the other, "1'essence des individus est dans le genre
   auquel ils se rapportent; en tant qu' individus ils ne sont que des
   accidents." [83] All this is sufficiently plain. That which constitutes
   the species or genus is a real objective existence, a substance one and
   the same numerically as well as specifically. This one general
   substance exists in every individual belonging to the species, and
   constitutes their essence. That which is peculiar to the individual,
   and which distinguishes it from other individuals of the same species,
   is purely accidental. This one substance of humanity, which is revealed
   or manifested in all men, and which constitutes them men, "possesses
   all the attributes of the human individual; for the individual is only
   a portion and specimen of the nature. Considered as an essence, human
   nature is an intelligent, rational, and voluntary essence; and
   accordingly its agency in Adam partakes of the corresponding
   qualities." [84] "Agency," however, supposes "an agent; and since
   original sin is not the product of the individual agent, because it
   appears at birth, it must be referred to the generic agent, -- i.e., to
   the human nature in distinction from the human person or individual."
   [85]

   Generic Humanity.

   What God created, therefore, was not an individual man, but the species
   homo, or generic humanity, --an intelligent, rational, and voluntary
   essence; individual men are the manifestations of this substance
   numerically and specifically one and the same, in connection with their
   several corporeal organizations. Their souls are not individual
   essences, but one common essence revealed and acting in many separate
   organisms.

   This answer to the question proposed above, What is human nature
   generically considered, which makes it an essence or substance common
   to all the individuals of the race, is the most common and the most
   intelligible. Scientific men adopt a somewhat different phraseology.
   Instead of substances, they speak of forces. Nature is defined to be
   the sum of the forces operating in the external world. Oxygen is a
   force; magnetism, electricity, etc., are forces. "A species is . . . .
   based on a specific amount or condition of concentred force, defined in
   the act or law of creation." [86] Humanity, or human nature, is the sum
   of the forces which constitute man what he is. The unity of the race
   consists in the fact that these forces are numerically as well as
   specifically the same in all the individuals of which it is composed.

   The German theologians, particularly those of the school of
   Schleiermacher, use the terms life, law, and organic law. Human nature
   is a generic life, i.e., a form of life manifested in a multitude of
   individuals of the same kind. In the individual it is not distinct or
   different from what it is in the genus. It is the same organic law. A
   single oak may produce ten thousand other oaks; but the whore forest is
   as much an inward organic unity as any single tree.

   These may be convenient formulas to prevent the necessity of
   circumlocutions, and to express a class of facts; but they do not
   convey any definite idea beyond the facts themselves. To say that a
   whole forest of oaks have the same generic life, that they are as truly
   one as any individual tree is one, means simply that the nature is the
   same in all, and that all have been derived from a common source. And
   to say that mankind are a unit because they have the same generic life,
   and are all descended from a common parent, either means nothing more
   than that all men are of the same species, i.e., that humanity is
   specifically the same in all mat kind or it means all that is intended
   by those who teach that genera and species are substances of which the
   individual is the mere modus existendi. As agency implies an agent, so
   force, which is the manifestation of power, supposes something, a
   subject or substance in which that power resides. Nothing, a nonentity,
   can have no power and manifest no force. Force, of necessity, supposes
   a substance of which it is the manifestation. If, therefore, the forces
   are numerically the same, the substance must be numerically the same.
   And, consequently, if humanity be a given amount and kind of concentred
   force, numerically and not merely specifically the same in all men,
   then are men homoousioi, partakers of one and the same identical
   essence. The same remarks apply to the term life. Life is a predicable,
   not an essence. It supposes a subject of which it is predicable. There
   can be no life unless something lives. It is not a thing by itself. if,
   therefore, the generic life of man means anything more than the same
   kind of life, it must mean that that which lives in all men is
   identically the same numerical substance.

   Objections to Realism.

   According to the common doctrine, the soul of every man is an
   individual subsistence, of the same kind but not of the same numerical
   substance as the souls of his fellow-men, so that men are homoi-, but
   not homoousioi. In support of this view and in opposition to the
   doctrine that "all men are one man," or, that human nature is
   numerically one and the same essence of which individual men are the
   modes of manifestation, it may be remarked, --

   1. That the latter doctrine is a mere philosophical hypothesis. It is a
   simple assumption founded on what is possible. It is possible that the
   doctrine in question may be true. So in itself it is possible that
   there should be an anima mundi, a principle of life immanent in the
   world, of which all living organisms are the different manifestations;
   so that all vegetables, all animals, and man himself, are but different
   forms of one and the same numerical living substance, just as the
   multitudinous waves of the sea in all their infinite diversity of size,
   shape, and hue, are but the heavings of one and the same vast ocean. In
   like manner it is possible that all the forms of life should be only
   the various manifestations of the life of God. This is not only
   possible, but it is such a simple and grand idea that it has fascinated
   the minds of men in all ages, so that the prevailing hypothesis of
   philosophers as to the constitution of the universe has been. and still
   is, pantheistic. Nevertheless, pantheism is demonstrably false, because
   it contradicts the intuitive convictions of our moral and religious
   nature. It is not enough, therefore, that a theory be possible or
   conceivable. It must have the support of positive proof.

   2. Such proof the doctrine under consideration does not find in the
   Bible. It is simply a hypothesis on which certain facts of the
   Scriptures may be explained. All men are alike; they have the same
   faculties, the same instincts and passions; and they are all born in
   sin. These and other similar facts admit of an easy explanation on the
   assumption that humanity is numerically one and the same substance of
   which individuals are only so many different manifestations; just as a
   thousand different magnets reveal the magnetic force which is the same
   in all, and therefore all magnets are alike. But as the facts referred
   to may be explained on divers other assumptions, they afford no proof
   of this particular theory. It is not pretended that the Bible directly
   teaches the doctrine in question. Nor does it teach anything which
   necessitates its adoption. On the contrary, it teaches much that is
   irreconcilable with it.

   Not Supported by Consciousness.

   3. The hypothesis under consideration derives no support from
   consciousness. We are conscious of our own existence. We are (in one
   sense) conscious of the existence of other men. But we are not
   conscious of a community of essence in ourselves and all other men. So
   far from this being the common interpretation which men put on their
   consciousness, it is diametrically opposed to it. Every man believes
   his soul to be a distinct, individual substance, as much as he believes
   his body to be distinct and separate from every other human body. Such
   is the common judgment of men. And nothing short of the direct
   assertion of the Bible, or arguments which amount to demonstration, can
   rationally be admitted to invalidate that judgment. It is inconceivable
   that anything concerning the constitution of our nature so momentous in
   its consequences, should be true, which does not in some way reveal
   itself in the common consciousness of men. There is nothing more
   characteristic of the Scriptures, and there are few things which more
   clearly prove its divine origin, than that it takes for granted and
   authenticates all the facts of consciousness. It declares us to be what
   we are revealed to ourselves as being in the very constitution and
   present condition of our nature. It recognizes the soul as rational,
   free, and responsible. It assumes that it is distinct from the body.
   All this we know from consciousness. But we do not know that the
   essence or substance of our soul is numerically the same as the
   substance of the souls of all men. If the Bible teaches any such
   doctrine it teaches something outside of the teachings of
   consciousness, and something to which those teachings, in the judgment
   of the vast majority of men, even the most enlightened, are directly
   opposed.

   Realism Contrary to the Teachings of Scripture.

   4. The Scriptures not only do not teach the doctrine in question, but
   they also teach what is inconsistent with it. We have already seen that
   it is a clearly revealed doctrine of the Bible, and part of the faith
   of the Church universal, that the soul continues to exist after death
   as a self-conscious, individual person. This fact is inconsistent with
   the theory in question. A given plant is a material organization,
   animated by the general principle of vegetable life. If the plant is
   destroyed the principle of vegetable life no longer exists as to that
   plant. It may exist in other plants; but that particular plant ceased
   to exist when the material organization was dissolved. Magnetism
   continues to exist as a force in nature, but any particular magnet
   ceases to be when it is melted, or volatilized. In like manner, if a
   man is the manifestation of a generic life, or of humanity as an
   essence common to all men, then when his body dies the man ceases to
   exist. Humanity continues to be, but the individual man no longer
   exists. This is a difficulty which some of the advocates of this theory
   endeavour to avoid by giving up what is essential to their own
   doctrine. Its genuine and consistent advocates admit it in its full
   force. The anti-Christian portion of them acknowledge that their
   doctrine is inconsistent with the personal immortality of man. The
   race, they say, is immortal, but individual men are not. The same
   conclusion is admitted by those who hold the analogous pantheistic, or
   naturalistic doctrines. If a man is only the modus existendi, a form in
   which a common substance or life reveals itself, it matters not whether
   that substance be humanity, nature, or God, when the form, the material
   organism, is destroyed, the man as a man ceases to exist. Those
   advocates of the doctrine who cling to Christianity, while they admit
   the difficulty, endeavour to get over it in different ways.
   Schleiermacher admits that all philosophy is against the doctrine of
   the personal existence of man in a future state. His whole system leads
   to the denial of it. But he says that the Christian must admit it on
   the authority of Christ. Olshausen, in his commentary on the New
   Testament, says, when explaining 1 Cor. xv. 19, 20, and verses 42-44,
   that the Bible knows nothing of the immortality of the soul. He
   pronounces it to be a heathen. idea. A soul without a body loses its
   individuality. It ceases to be a person, and of course loses
   self-consciousness and all that is connected with it. As, however, the
   Scriptures teach that men are to exist hereafter, he says their bodies
   must also continue to exist, and the only existence of the soul during
   the interval between death and the resurrection, which he admits, is in
   connection (i.e., vital union) with the disintegrated particles of the
   body in the grave or scattered to the ends of the earth. This is a
   conclusion to which his doctrine legitimately leads, and which he is
   sufficiently candid to admit. Dr. Nevin, a disciple of Schleiermacher,
   has to grapple with the same difficulty. His book entitled "The
   Mystical Presence," is the clearest and ablest exposition of the
   theology of Schleiermacher which has appeared in our language, unless
   Morell's "Philosophy of Religion" be its equal. He denies [87] all
   dualism between the soul and body. They are "one life." The one cannot
   exist without the other. He admits that what the Bible teaches of the
   separate existence of the soul between death and the resurrection, is a
   difficulty "which it is not easy, at present, to solve." He does not
   attempt to solve it. He only says that the difficulty is "not to
   reconcile Scripture with a psychological theory, but to bring it into
   harmony with itself." This is no solution. It is a virtual admission
   that he cannot reconcile the Bible with his psychological theory. The
   doctrine that man is a modus existendi of a generic humanity, or the
   manifestation of the general principle of humanity, in connection with
   a given corporeal organization, is inconsistent with the Scriptural
   doctrine of the separate existence of the soul, and therefore must be
   false.

   Inconsistent with the Doctrine of the Trinity.

   5. This theory is inconsistent with the Scriptural doctrine of the
   Trinity. It necessitates the conclusion that the Father, Son, and
   Spirit are no more one God than Peter, James, and John are one man. The
   persons of the Trinity are one God, because the Godhead is one essence;
   but if humanity be one essence numerically the same in all men, then
   all men are one man in the same sense that the Father, Son, and Spirit
   are one God. This is a reductio ad absurdum. It is clearly taught in
   Scripture and universally believed in the Church that the persons of
   the Trinity are one God in an infinitely higher sense than that in
   which all men are one man. The precise difference is, that the essence
   common to the persons of the Godhead is numerically the same whereas
   the essence common to all men is only specifically the same, i.e., of
   the same kind, although numerically different. The theory which leads
   to the opposite conclusion must therefore be false. It cannot be true
   that all mankind are one essence, substance, or organic life, existing
   or manifesting itself in a multitude of individual persons. This is a
   difficulty so obvious and so fatal that it could not fail to arrest the
   attention of realists in all ages and of every class. The great point
   of dispute in the Council of Nice between the Arians and orthodox was,
   whether the persons of the Trinity are homoi- or homoousioi, of a like
   or of the same essence. If homoousioi, it was on both sides admitted
   that they are one God; because if the same in substance they are equal
   in power and glory. Now it is expressly asserted that all men are not
   homoi- but homoousioi, and therefore, by parity of reasoning, they must
   constitute one man in the same sense as there is one God, and all be
   equal in every attribute of their nature. [88] Of course it is admitted
   that there is a legitimate sense of the word in which all men may be
   said to be homoousioi, when by homos (same) is meant similar, or of a
   like kind. In this sense the Greeks said that the bodies of men and of
   other animals were consubstantial, as all were made of flesh; and that
   angels, demons, and human souls, as spiritual beings, are also
   homoousioi. But this is not the sense in which the word is used by
   realists, when speaking either of the persons of the Trinity or of men.
   In both cases the word same means numerical oneness; men are of the
   same numerical essence in the same sense in which the Father and the
   Son and the Spirit are the same in substance. The difference, it is
   said, between the two cases does not relate to identity of essence,
   which is the same in both, but is found in this, that "the whole nature
   or essence is in the divine person; but the human person is only a part
   of the common human nature. Generation in the Godhead admits no
   abscission or division of substance; but generation in the instance of
   the creature implies separation or division of essence. A human person
   is an individualized portion of humanity." [89] It must, however, be
   remembered that humanity is declared to be a spiritual substance. It is
   the same in nature with the soul, which is called an individualized
   portion of human nature, possessing consciousness, reason, and will.
   But, if spiritual, it is indivisible. Divisibility is one of the
   primary properties of matter. Whatever is divisible is material. If
   therefore humanity, as a generic substance, admits of "abscission and
   division," it must be material. A part of reason, a piece of
   consciousness, or a fragment of will, are contradictory, or
   unintelligible forms of expression. If humanity is of the same essence
   as the soul, it no more admits of division than the soul. One part of a
   soul cannot be holy and another unholy; one part saved and the other
   lost. The objection to the theory under consideration, that it makes
   the relation between individual men identical with that between the
   persons of the Trinity, remains, therefore, in full force. It is not
   met by the answer just referred to, which answer supposes mind to be
   extended and divisible.

   Realism Inconsistent with what the Bible teaches of the Person and Work
   of Christ.

   6. It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the doctrine in
   question with what the Scriptures teach of the person and work of
   Christ. According to the Bible, the Son of God became man by taking to
   himself a true body and a reasonable soul. According to the realistic
   doctrine, he did not assume a reasonable soul, but generic humanity.
   What is this but the whole of humanity, of which, according to the
   advocates of this doctrine, individual men are the portions. Human
   nature as a generic life, humanity as a substance, and a whole
   substance, was taken into personal union with the Son of God. The Logos
   became incarnate in the race. This is certainly not the Scriptural
   doctrine. The Son of God became a man; not all men. He assumed an
   individual rational soul, not the general principle of humanity.
   Besides this, it is the doctrine of those who adopt this theory that
   humanity sinned and fell in Adam. The rational, moral, voluntary
   substance called human nature, is, or at least was, an agent. The sin
   of Adam was the sin not of an individual, but of this generic
   substance, which by that sin became the subject both of guilt and of
   depravity. By reason of this sin of human nature, the theory is, that
   all individual men, in their successive generations, in whom this
   nature is revealed, or in whom, as they express it, it is
   individualized, mine into the world in a state of guilt and pollution.
   We do not now refer to the numerous and serious difficulties connected
   with this theory as a method of accounting for original sin. We speak
   of it only in its relation to Christ's person. If human nature, as a
   generic life, a substance of which all men partake, became both guilty
   and polluted by the apostasy; and that generic humanity, as
   distinguished from a newly created and holy rational soul, was assumed
   by the Son of God, how can we avoid the conclusion that Christ was, in
   his human nature, personally guilty and sinful? This is a legitimate
   consequence of this theory. And this consequence being not only false
   but blasphemous, the theory itself must be false As the principle that
   humanity is one substance, and all men are homoousioi in the sense of
   partaking of the same numerical essence, involves consequences
   destructive of the Scriptural doctrines of the Trinity and of the
   person of Christ, so it might easily be shown that it overthrows the
   common faith of the Protestant churches on the doctrines of
   justification, regeneration, the sacraments, and the Church. It is
   enough for our present purpose to remark that, as a historical fact,
   the consistent and thorough-going advocates of this doctrine do teach
   an entirely different method of salvation. Many men adopt a principle,
   and do not carry it out to its legitimate consequences. But others,
   more logical, or more reckless, do not hesitate to embrace all its
   results. In the works of Morell and of Dr. Nevin, above referred to,
   the theological student may find a fearless pressing of the genuine
   principle of realism, to the utter overthrow of the Protestant, and, it
   may be added, of the Christian faith.

   7. Other objections to this theory may be more appropriately considered
   when we come to speak of the several doctrines to which it is applied.
   It is sufficient in the conclusion of the present discussion to say
   that what is said to be true of the genus homo, is assumed to be true
   of all genera and species in the animal and vegetable worlds. The
   individual in all cases is assumed to be only the manifestation or
   modus existendi of the generic substance. Thus there is a bovine, an
   equine, and a feline substance, having an objective existence of which
   all oxen, all horses, and all animals of the cat-race, are the
   manifestations. And so of all species, whether of plants or animals.
   This is almost inconceivable. Compared to this theory, the assumption
   of a naturgeist, or anima mundi, or of one universal substance, is
   simplicity itself. That such a theory should be set forth and made the
   foundation, or rather the controlling principle of all Christian
   doctrine, is most unreasonable and dangerous. This realistic doctrine,
   until recently, has been as much exploded as the eternal ideas of Plato
   or the forms of Aristotle.

   § 4. Another form of the Realistic Theory.

   There is, however, another phase of this doctrine, which it is
   necessary to mention. The doctrine that genera and species are real
   substances existing prior to individuals, and independent of them, is
   the old, genuine, and most intelligible form of Realism. It was
   expressed in the schools by saying that Universalia are ante rem. The
   other form of the doctrine asserts that the Universalia are in re. That
   is that the universals exist only in the individuals; and that the
   individuals alone are real. "L'identité des individus," says Cousin
   [90] in his exposition of this form of the doctrine, "d'un même genre
   ne vient pas de leur essence même, car cette essence est différente en
   chacun d'eux, mais de certains éléments qui se retrouvent dans tous ces
   individus sans aucune différence, indifferenter. Cette nouvelle théorie
   diffère de la première en ce que les universaux ne sont plus 1'essence
   de 1'être, la substance m--me des choses; mais elle s'en rapproche en
   ce que les universaux existent réellement, et qu'existant dans
   plusieurs individus sans différence, ils forment leur identité et par
   là leur genre." Again, [91] he says, "Le principe de la nouvelle
   théorie est que 1'essence de chaque chose est leur individualité, que
   les individus seuls existent, et qu'il n'y a point en dehors des
   individus d'essence appelèes les universaux, les espèces et les genres;
   mais que l'individu lui-même contient tout cela, selon les divers
   points de vue sous lequels on le considére." [92] Thus Socrates as an
   individual man has his own essence, which, with its peculiarities,
   makes him Socrates. Neglect those peculiarities and consider him as
   rational and mortal, then you have the idea of species; neglect
   rationality and mortality, and consider him as an animal, then you have
   the idea of the genus; neglect all these forms ("relictis omnibus
   formis"), and you have only the idea of substance. According to this
   view "les espèces et les genres, les plus élevés comme les plus
   inférieurs, sont les individus eux-mêmes, considérés sous divers point
   de vue." [93] This, according to the plain sense of the terms, amounts
   to the common doctrine. Individuals alone exist. Certain individuals
   have some distinguishing properties or attributes in common. They
   constitute a particular species. These and other individuals of
   different species have other properties common to them all, and they
   constitute a genus, and so orders, and classes, until we get to the
   highest category of being, which includes all. But if all beings are
   assumed to be one substance, which substance with certain added
   qualities or accidents constitutes a class, with certain other
   additions, an order, with still further modifications, a genus, a
   species, an individual, then we have the old theory back again, only
   extended so as to have a pantheistic aspect.

   Some scientific men, instead of defining species as a gi cm' of
   individuals having certain characteristics in common, say with
   Professor Dana, that it "corresponds to the specific amount or
   condition of concentred force, defined in the act or law of creation;"
   or with Dr. Morton, that it is "a primordial organic form;" or with
   Agassiz, that it is an original immaterial principle which determines
   the form or characteristics of the individuals constituting a distinct
   group. These are only different modes of accounting for the fact that
   all the individuals of a given species have certain characteristics or
   fundamental qualities in common. To such statements there is no
   objection. But when it is assumed that these original primordial terms,
   as in the case of humanity, for example, are by the law of propagation
   transmitted from generation to generation, so as to constitute all the
   individuals of the species essentially one, that is, one in essence or
   substance, so that the act of the first individual of the species (of
   Adam, for example) being the act of the substance numerically the same
   in all the members of that species, is the act of each individual
   member, then something essentially new is added to the above given
   scientific definition of species, and we return to the original and
   genuine form of Realism in its most offensive features. It would be
   easy to show, (1st.) that generation or the law of propagation both in
   plants and in animals is absolutely inscrutable; as much so as the
   nature of matter, mind, or life, in themselves considered. We can no
   more tell what generation is, than what matter is, or what mind is.
   (2d.) That it is therefore unreasonable and dangerous to make a given
   theory as to the nature of generation or the law of propagation the
   basis for the explanation of Christian doctrines. (3d.) That whatever
   may be the secret and inscrutable process of propagation, it does not
   involve the transmission of the same numerical essence, so that a
   progenitor and his descendants are one and the same substance. This
   assumption is liable to all the objections already urged against the
   original form of the realistic doctrine. The theory is moreover
   destitute of all evidence either from experience or analogy. There is
   no conceivable sense in which all the oaks now on the earth are
   identical as to their substance with the oaks originally created. And
   there is no conceivable sense in whirl. we and all mankind are
   identically the same substance with Adam. If a thousand candles are
   successively lighted from one candle they do not thereby become one
   candle. There is not a communication of the substance of the first to
   the second, and of the second to the others in their order, so as to
   make it in any sense true that the substance of the first is
   numerically the same with that of all the others. The simple fact is
   that by the laws of matter ordained by God, the state in which a
   lighted candle is, produces certain changes or movements in the
   constituent elements of the wick of another candle when the two are
   brought into contact. which movements induce other movements in the
   constituent particles of the surrounding atmosphere, which are
   connected with the evolution of light and heat. But there is no
   communication of substance involved in the process. An acorn which
   falls from an oak to-day, is composed not of the same particles of
   matter from which the original acorn was formed, but of matter of the
   same kind, and arranged in the same way. It may be said to be imbued
   with chemical and vital forces of the same kind with the original
   acorn, but not with numerically the same forces. So of all plants and
   animals. We are of the same nature with Adam in the same sense that all
   animals of one species are the same. The sameness does not consist in
   numerical identity of essence or of vital forces, or of reason or will,
   but in the sameness of kind and community of origin.

   Besides the origin and the nature of man, there are two other
   questions, which are more or less involved in what the Scriptures teach
   concerning mankind, and which demand attention before we turn to the
   moral and religious condition of the race. The first of these concerns
   the Origin of the Soul, and the second the Unity of the Race.

CHAPTER III.

  THE ORIGIN OF THE SOUL.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Theory of Preëxistence.

   Three theories have been advanced as to the origin of the soul. First,
   that of the Preëxistence of the soul; secondly, that of Traduction, or
   the doctrine that the soul of the child is derived from the soul of the
   parent; thirdly, that of immediate Creation, or the doctrine that the
   soul is not derived as the body is, but owes its existence to the
   creative power of God.

   The doctrine of the preëxistence of the soul has been presented in two
   forms. Plato held that ideas are eternal in the divine mind; that these
   ideas are not mere thoughts, but living entities; that they constitute
   the essence and life of all external things; the universe and all it
   contains are these ideas realized, clothed in matter, and developed in
   history. There was thus an ideal, or intelligible world, anterior to
   the world as actually existing in time. What Plato called ideas,
   Aristotle called forms. He denied that the ideal was anterior to the
   actual. Matter is eternal, and all things consist of matter and form --
   by form being meant that which gives character, or determines the
   nature of individual things. As in other respects, so also in this, the
   Platonic, or Aristo-Platonic philosophy, had much influence on
   Christian Theology. And some of the fathers and of the schoolmen
   approached more or less nearly to this doctrine of the preëxistence,
   not only of the soul, but of all things in this ideal world. St.
   Bernard, in his strenuous opposition to nominalism, adopted the
   Platonic doctrine of ideas, which he identified with genera and
   species. These ideas, he taught, were eternal, although posterior to
   God, as an effect is in the order of nature after its cause. Providence
   applies the idea to matter, which becomes animated and takes form, and
   thus ("du monde intelligible est sorti le monde sensible") "ex mundo
   intelligibili mundus sensibilis perfectus natus est ex perfecto." [94]
   Among modern writers, Delitzsch comes nearest to this Platonic
   doctrine. He says, "Es giebt nach der Schrift eine Präexistenz des
   Menschen und zwar eine ideale; . . . . eine Präexistenz . . . . vermöge
   welcher Mensch und Menschheit nicht blos ein fernzukünftiges Object
   göttlicher Voraussicht, sondern ein gegenwärtiges Object göttlicher
   Anschauung sind im Spiegel der Weisheit. . . . . Nicht bloss
   Philosophie und falchberühmte Gnosis, sondern auch die Schrift weiss
   und spricht von einer göttlichen Idealwelt, zu welcher sich die
   Zeitwelt wie die geschichtliche Verwirklichung eines ewigen Grundrisses
   verhält. [95] That is, "There is according to the Scriptures, an ideal
   preëxistence of man; a preëxistence in virtue of which man and humanity
   are contemplated by the divine omniscience not merely as objects lying
   far off in the future, but as present in the mirror of his wisdom. Not
   only philosophy and the so called Gnosis, but also the Scriptures
   recognize and avow a divine ideal world to which the actual world
   stands related as the historical development of an eternal conception."
   It is doubtful, however, whether Delitzsch meant much more by this than
   that the omniscience of God embraces from eternity the knowledge of all
   things possible, and that his purpose determined from eternity the
   futurition of all actual events, so that his decree or plan as existing
   in the divine mind is realized in the external world and its history.
   The mechanist has in his mind a clear conception of the machine which
   he is about to make. But it is only by a figure of speech that the
   machine can be said to preëxist in the artist's mind. This is very
   different from the Platonic and Realistic theory of preëxistence.

   Origen's Doctrine.

   Preëxistence, as taught by Origen, and as adopted here and there by
   some few philosophers and theologians, is not the Platonic doctrine of
   an ideal-world. It supposes that the souls of men had a separate,
   conscious, personal existence in a previous state; that having sinned
   in that preëxistent state, they are condemned to be born into this
   world in a state of sin and in connection with a material body. This
   doctrine was connected by Origen with his theory of an eternal
   creation. The present state of being is only one epoch in the existence
   of the human soul. It has passed through innumerable other epochs and
   forms of existence in the past, and is to go through other innumerable
   such epochs in the future. He held to a metempsychosis very similar to
   that taught by Orientals both ancient and modern. But even without the
   encumbrance of this idea of the endless transmutation of the soul, the
   doctrine itself has never been adopted in the Church. It may be said to
   have begun and ended with Origen, as it was rejected both by the Greeks
   and Latins, and has only been advocated by individual writers from that
   day to this. It does not pretend to be a Scriptural doctrine, and
   therefore cannot be an object of faith. The Bible never speaks of a
   creation of men before Adam, or of any apostasy anterior to his fall,
   and it never refers the sinfulness of our present condition to any
   higher source than the sin of our first parent. The assumption that all
   human souls were created at the same time that the soul of Adam was
   created, and remain in a dormant, unconscious state until united to the
   bodies for which they were designed, has been adopted by so few as
   hardly to merit a place in the history of theological opinion.

   It is a far more important question, whether the soul of each man is
   immediately created, or, whether it is generated by the parents. The
   former is known, in theology, as "Creationism," the latter as
   "Traducianism." The Greek Church from the first took ground in favour
   of creationism as alone consistent with the true nature of the soul.
   Tertullian in the Latin Church was almost a materialist, at least he
   used the language of materialism, and held that the soul was as much
   begotten as the body. Jerome opposed that doctrine. Augustine was also
   very adverse to it; but in his controversy with Pelagius on the
   propagation of sin, he was tempted to favour the theory of traduction
   as affording an easier explanation of the fact that we derive a corrupt
   nature from Adam. He never, however, could bring himself fully to adopt
   it. Creationism became subsequently the almost universally received
   doctrine of the Latin, as it had always been of the Greek, Church. At
   the time of the Reformation the Protestants as a body adhered to the
   same view. Even the Form of Concord, the authoritative symbol of the
   Lutheran Church, favours creationism. The body of the Lutheran
   theologians of the seventeenth century, however, adopted the theory of
   traduction. Among the Reformed the reverse was true. Calvin, Beza,
   Turrettin, and the great majority of the Reformed theologians were
   creationists, only here and there one adopted the ex traduce theory. In
   modern times discussion on this point has been renewed. Many of the
   recent German theologians, and such as are inclined to realism in any
   form, have become more or less zealously the advocates of traducianism.
   This, however, is far from being the universal opinion of the Germans.
   Perhaps the majority of the German philosophers agree with Günther:
   [96] "Traducianism has its functions in respect to the animal life of
   man; on the other hand, the province of Creationism is with the soul;
   and it would travel out of its province if it extended the immediate
   creative action of God to that animal life, which is the principle of
   his body's existence."

   § 2. Traducianism.

   'What is meant by the term traduction is in general sufficiently clear
   from the signification of the word. Traducianists on the one hand deny
   that the soul is created; and on the other hand, they affirm that it is
   produced by the law of generation, being as truly derived from the
   parents as the body. The whole man, soul and body, is begotten. The
   whole man is derived from the substance of his progenitors. Some go
   further than others in their assertions on this subject. Some affirm
   that the soul is susceptible of "abscission and division," so that a
   portion of the soul of the parents is communicated to the child. Others
   shrink from such expressions, and yet maintain that there is a true
   derivation of the one from the other. Both classes, however, insist on
   the numerical identity of essence in Adam and all his posterity both as
   to soul and as to body. The more enlightened and candid advocates of
   traducianism admit that the Scriptures are silent on the subject.
   Augustine had said the same thing a thousand years ago. "De re
   obscurissima disputatur, non adjuvantibus divinarum scripturarum certis
   clarisque documentis." The passages cited in support of the doctrine
   teach nothing decisive on the subject. That Adam begat a son in his own
   likeness, and after his own image, and called his name Seth, only
   asserts that Seth was like his father. It sheds no light on the
   mysterious process of generation, and does not teach how the likeness
   of the child to the parent is secured by physical causes. When Job
   asks, "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?" and when our
   Lord says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh," the fact is
   asserted that like begets like; that a corrupt nature is transmitted
   from parent to child. But that this can be done only by the
   transmission of numerically the same substance is a gratuitous
   assumption. More stress is laid on certain facts of Scripture which are
   assumed to favour this theory. That in the creation of the woman no
   mention is made of God's having breathed into her the breath of life,
   is said to imply that her soul as well as her body was derived from
   Adam. Silence, however, proves nothing. In Gen. i. 27, it is simply
   said, God treated man in his own image," just as it is said that He
   created "every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Nothing is
   there said of his breathing into man the breath of life, i.e., a
   principle of rational life. Yet we know that it was done. Its not being
   expressly mentioned in the case of Eve, therefore, is no proof that it
   did not occur. Again, it is said, that God's resting on the Sabbath,
   implies that his creating energy was not afterwards exerted. This is
   understood to draw the line between the immediate creation and the
   production of effects in nature by second causes under the providential
   control of God. The doctrine of creationism, on the other hand, assumes
   that God constantly, now as well as at the beginning, exercises his
   immediate agency in producing something out of nothing. But, in the
   first place, we do not know how the agency of God is connected with the
   operation of second causes, how far that agency is mediate, and how far
   it is immediate; and in the second place, we do know that God has not
   bound himself to mere providential direction; that his omnipresent
   power is ever operating through means and without means in the whole
   sphere of history and of nature. Of all arguments in favor of
   traducianism the most effective is that derived from the transmission
   of a sinful nature from Adam to his posterity. It is insisted that this
   can neither be explained nor justified unless we assume that Adam's sin
   was our sin and our guilt, and that the identical active, intelligent,
   voluntary substance which transgressed in him, has been transmitted to
   us. This is an argument which can be fully considered only when we come
   to treat of original sin. For the present it is enough to repeat the
   remark just made, that the fact is one thing and the explanation of the
   fact is another thing. The fact is admitted that the sin of Adam in a
   true and important sense is our sin, -- and that we derive from him a
   corrupt nature; but that this necessitates the adoption of the ex
   traduce doctrine as to the origin of the soul, is not so clear. It has
   been denied by the vast majority of the most strenuous defenders of the
   doctrine of original sin, in all ages of the Church. To call
   creationism a Pelagian principle is only an evidence of ignorance.
   Again, it is urged that the doctrine of the incarnation necessarily
   involves the truth of the ex traduce theory. Christ was born of a
   woman. He was the seed of the woman. Unless both as to soul and body
   derived from his human mother, it is said, He cannot truly be of the
   same race with us. The Lutheran theologians, therefore, say: "Si
   Christus non assumpsisset animam ab anima Mariæ, animam humanam non
   redemisset." This, however, is a simple non sequitur. All that is
   necessary is that Christ should be a man, a son of David, in the same
   sense as any other of the posterity of David, save only his miraculous
   conception. He was formed ex substantia matris suæ in the same sense in
   which every child born of a woman is born of her substance, but what
   that sense is, his birth does not determine. The most plausible
   argument in favour of traducianism is the undeniable fact of the
   transmission of the ethnical, national, family, and even parental,
   peculiarities of mind and temper. This seems to evince that there is a
   derivation not only of the body but also of the soul in which these
   peculiarities inhere. But even this argument is not conclusive, because
   it is impossible for us to determine to what proximate cause these
   peculiarities are due. They may all be referred, for what we know, to
   something peculiar in the physical constitution. That the mind is
   greatly influenced by the body cannot be denied. And a body having the
   physical peculiarities belonging to any race, nation, or family, may
   determine within certain limits the character of the soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Creationism.

   The common doctrine of the Church, and especially of the Reformed
   theologians, has ever been that the soul of the child is not generated
   or derived from the parents, but that it is created by the immediate
   agency of God. The arguments generally urged in favour of this view
   are, --

   1. That it is more consistent with the prevailing representations of
   the Scriptures. In the original account of the creation there is a
   marked distinction made between the body and the soul. The one is from
   the earth, the other from God. This distinction is kept up throughout
   the Bible. The body and soul are not only represented as different
   substances, but also as having different origins. The body shall return
   to dust, says the wise man, and the spirit to God who gave it. Here the
   origin of the soul is represented as different flap and higher than
   that of the body. The former is from God in a sense in which the latter
   is not. In like manner God is said to form "the spirit of man within
   him" (Zech. xii. 1) to give "breath unto the people upon" the earth,
   "and spirit to them that walk therein." (Is. xlii. 5.) This language
   nearly agrees with the account of the original creation, in which God
   is said to have breathed into man the breath of life, to indicate that
   the soul is not earthy or material, but had its origin immediately from
   God. Hence He is called "God of the spirits of all flesh." (Num. xvi.
   22.) It could not well be said that He is God of the bodies of all men.
   The relation in which the soul stands to God as its God and creator is
   very different from that in which the body stands to Him. And hence in
   Heb. xii. 9, it is said, "We have had fathers of our flesh which
   corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be
   in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?" The obvious
   antithesis here presented is between those who are the fathers of our
   bodies and him who is the Father of our spirits. Our bodies are derived
   from our earthly parents, our souls are derived from God. This is in
   accordance with the familiar use of the word flesh, where it is
   contrasted, either expressly or by implication, with the soul. Paul
   speaks of those who had not "seen his face in the flesh," of "the life
   he now lived in the flesh." He tells the Philippians that it was
   needful for them that he should remain "in the flesh;" he speaks of his
   "mortal flesh." The Psalmist says of the Messiah, "my flesh shall rest
   in hope," which the Apostle explains to mean that his flesh should not
   see corruption. In all these, and in a multitude of similar passages,
   flesh means the body, and "fathers of our flesh" means fathers of our
   bodies. So far, therefore, as the Scriptures reveal anything on the
   subject, their authority is against traducianism and in favour of
   creationism.

   Argument from the Nature of the Soul.

   2. The latter doctrine, also, is clearly most consistent with the
   nature of the soul. The soul is admitted, among Christians, to be
   immaterial and spiritual. It is indivisible. The traducian doctrine
   denies this universally acknowledged truth. It asserts that the soul
   admits of "separation or division of essence." [97] On the same ground
   that the Church universally rejected the Gnostic doctrine of emanation
   as inconsistent with the nature of God as a spirit, it has, with nearly
   the same unanimity, rejected the doctrine that the soul admits of
   division of substance. This is so serious a difficulty that some of the
   advocates of the ex traduce doctrine endeavour to avoid it by denying
   that their theory assumes any such separation Dr division of the
   substance of the soul. But this denial avails little. They maintain
   that the same numerical essence which constituted the soul of Adam
   constitutes our souls. If this be so, then either humanity is a general
   essence of which individual men are the modes of existence, or what was
   wholly in Adam is distributively, partitively, and by separation, in
   the multitude of his descendants. Derivation of essence, therefore,
   does imply, and is generally admitted to imply, separation or division
   of essence. And this must be so if numerical identity of essence in all
   mankind is assumed to be secured by generation or propagation.

   3. A third argument in favour of creationism and against traducianism
   is derived from the Scriptural doctrine as to the person of Christ. He
   was very man; He had a true human nature; a true body and a rational
   soul. He was born of a woman. He was, as to his flesh, the son of
   David. He was descended from the fathers. He was in all points made
   like as we are, yet without sin. This is admitted on both sides. But,
   as before remarked in reference to realism, this, on the theory of
   traducianism, necessitates the conclusion that Christ's human nature
   was guilty and sinful. We are partakers of Adam's sin both as to guilt
   and pollution, because the same numerical essence which sinned in him
   is communicated to us. Sin, it is said, is an accident, and supposes a
   substance in which it inheres, or to which it pertains. Community in
   sin supposes, therefore, community of essence. If we were not in Adam
   as to essence we did not sin in him, and do not derive a corrupt nature
   from him. But, if we were in him as to essence then his sin was our sin
   both as to guilt and pollution. This is the argument of traducianists
   repeated in every form. But they insist that Christ was in Adam as to
   the substance of his human nature as truly as we were. They say that if
   his body and soul were not derived from the body and soul of his virgin
   mother he was no true man, and cannot be the redeemer of men. What is
   true of other men must, consequently, be true of Him. He must,
   therefore, be as much involved in the guilt and corruption of the
   apostasy as other men. It will not do to affirm and deny the same
   thing. It s a contradiction to say that we are guilty of Adam's sin
   because we are partakers of his essence, and that Christ is not guilty
   of his sin nor involved in its pollution, although He is a partaker of
   his essence. If participation of essence involve community of guilt and
   depravity in the one case, it must also in the other. As this seems a
   legitimate conclusion from the traducian doctrine, and as this
   conclusion is anti-Christian, and false, the doctrine itself cannot be
   true.

   § 4. Concluding Remarks.

   Such are the leading arguments on both sides of this question. In
   reference to this discussion it may be remarked, --

   1. That while it is incumbent on us strenuously to resist any doctrine
   which assumes the divisibility, and consequent materiality, of the
   human soul, or which leads to the conclusion that the human nature of
   our blessed Lord was contaminated with sin, yet it does not become us
   to be wise above that which is written. We may confess that generation,
   the production of a new individual of the human race, is an inscrutable
   mystery. But this must be said of the transmission of life in all its
   forms. If theologians and philosophers would content themselves with
   simply denying the creation of the soul ex nihilo, without insisting on
   the division of the substance of the soul or the identity of essence in
   all human beings, the evil would not be so great. Some do attempt to be
   thus moderate, and say, with Frohschammer, [98] "Generare ist nicht ein
   traducere, sondern ein secundäres, ein creatürliches creare." They
   avail themselves of the analogy often referred to, "cum flamma accendit
   flammam, neque tota flamma accendens transit in accensam neque pars
   ejus in eam descendit: ita anima parentum generat animam filii, ei
   nihil de cedat." It must be confessed, however, that in this view the
   theory loses all its value as a means of explaining the propagation of
   sin.

   3. It is obviously most unreasonable and presumptuous, as well as
   dangerous, to make a theory as to the origin of the soul the ground of
   a doctrine so fundamental to the Christian system as that of original
   sin. Yet we see theologians, ancient and modern, boldly asserting that
   if their doctrine of derivation, and the consequent numerical sameness
   of substance in all men, be not admitted, then original sin is
   impossible. That is, that nothing can be true, no matter how plainly
   taught in the word of God, which they cannot explain. This is done even
   by those who protest against introducing philosophy into theology,
   utterly unconscious, as it would seem, that they themselves occupy,
   quoad hoc, the same ground with the rationalists. They will not believe
   in hereditary depravity unless they can explain the mode of its
   transmission. There can be no such thing, they say, as hereditary
   depravity unless the soul of the child is the same numerical substance
   as the soul of the parent. That is, the plain assertions of the
   Scriptures cannot be true unless the most obscure, unintelligible, and
   self-contradictory, and the least generally received philosophical
   theory as to the constitution of man and the propagation of the race be
   adopted. No man has a right to hang the millstone of his philosophy
   around the neck of the truth of God.

   3. There is a third cautionary remark which must not be omitted. The
   whole theory of traducianism is founded on the assumption that God,
   since the original creation, operates only through means. Since the
   "sixth day the Creator has, in this world, exerted no strictly creative
   energy. He rested from the work of creation upon the seventh day, and
   still rests." [99] The continued creation of souls is declared by
   Delitzsch [100] 2 to be inconsistent with God's relation to the world.
   He now produces only mediately, i.e., through the operation of second
   causes. This is a near approach to the mechanical theory of the
   universe, which supposes that God, having created the world and endowed
   his creatures with certain faculties and properties, leaves it to the
   operation of these second causes. A continued superintendence of
   Providence may be admitted, but the direct exercise of the divine
   efficiency is denied. What, then, becomes of the doctrine of
   regeneration? The new birth is not the effect of second causes. It is
   not a natural effect produced by the influence of the truth or the
   energy of the human will. It is due to the immediate exercise of the
   almighty power of God. God's relation to the world is not that of a
   mechanist to a machine, nor such as limits Him to operating only
   through second causes. He is immanent in the world. He sustains and
   guides all causes. He works constantly through them, with them, and
   without them. As in the operations of writing or speaking there is with
   us the union and combined action of mechanical, chemical, and vital
   forces, controlled by the presiding power of mind; and as the mind,
   while thus guiding the operations of the body, constantly exercises its
   creative energy of thought, so God, as immanent in the world,
   constantly guides all the operations of second causes, and at the same
   time exercises uninterruptedly his creative energy. Life is not the
   product of physical causes. We know not that its origin is in any case
   due to any cause other than the immediate power of God. If life be the
   peculiar attribute of immaterial substance, it may be produced
   agreeably to a fixed plan by the creative energy of God whenever the
   conditions are present under which He has purposed it should begin to
   be. The organization of a seed, or of the embryo of an animal, so far
   as it consists of matter, may be due to the operation of material
   causes guided by the providential agency of God, while the vital
   principle itself is due to his creative power. There is nothing in this
   derogatory to the divine character. There is nothing in it contrary to
   the Scriptures. There is nothing in it out of analogy with the works
   and working of God. It is far preferable to the theory which either
   entirely banishes God from the world, or restricts his operations to a
   concursus with second causes. The objection to creationism that it does
   away with the doctrine of miracles, or that it supposes God to sanction
   every act with which his creative power is connected, does not seem to
   have even plausibility. A miracle is not simply an event due to the
   immediate agency of God, for then every act of conversion would be a
   miracle. But it is an event, occurring in the external world, which
   involves the suspension or counteracting of some natural law, and which
   can be referred to nothing but the immediate power of God. The
   origination of life, therefore, is neither in nature nor design a
   miracle, in the proper sense of the word. This exercise of God's
   creative energy, in connection with the agency of second causes, no
   more implies approbation than the fact that He gives and sustains the
   energy of the murderer proves that He sanctions murder.

   4. Finally this doctrine of traducianism is held by those who contend
   for the old realistic doctrine that humanity is a generic substance or
   life. The two theories, however, do not seem to harmonize, and their
   combination produces great confusion and obscurity. According to the
   one theory the soul of the child is derived from the soul of its
   parents; according to the other theory there is no derivation. One
   magnet is not, or need not be derived from another; one Leyden jar is
   not derived from another; nor one galvanic battery from another. There
   is no derivation in the case. The general forces of magnetism,
   electricity and galvanism, are manifested in connection with given
   material combinations. And if a man be the manifestation of the general
   principle of humanity in connection with a given human body, his human
   nature is not derived from his immediate progenitors.

   The object of this discussion is not to arrive at certainty as to what
   is not clearly revealed in Scripture, nor to explain what is, on all
   sides, admitted to be inscrutable, but to guard against the adoption of
   principles which are in opposition to plain and important doctrines of
   the word of God. If traducianism teaches that the soul admits of
   abscission or division; or that the human race are constituted of
   numerically the same substance; or that the Son of God assumed into
   personal union with himself the same numerical substance which sinned
   and fell in Adam; then it is to be rejected as both false and
   dangerous. But if, without pretending to explain everything, it simply
   asserts that the human race is propagated in accordance with the
   general law which secures that like begets like; that the child derives
   its nature from its parents through the operation of physical laws,
   attended and controlled by the agency of God, whether directive or
   creative, as in all other cases of the propagation of living creatures,
   it may be regarded as an open question, or matter of indifference.
   Creationism does not necessarily suppose that there is any other
   exercise of the immediate power of God in the production of the human
   soul, than such as takes place in the production of life in other
   cases. It only denies that the soul is capable of division, that all
   mankind are composed of numerically the same essence and that Christ
   assumed numerically the same essence that sinned in Adam.

CHAPTER IV.

  UNITY OF THE HUMAN RACE.

   There is still another question which science has forced on theology,
   in relation to man, which cannot be overlooked. Have all mankind had a
   common origin? and have they a common nature? Are they all descended
   from one pair, and do they constitute one species? These questions are
   answered affirmatively in the Bible and by the Church universal. They
   are answered in the negative by a large and increasing class of
   scientific men. As the unity of the race is not only asserted in the
   Scriptures but also assumed in all they teach concerning the apostasy
   and redemption of man, it is a point about which the mind of the
   theologian should be intelligently convinced. As a mere theologian he
   may be authorized to rest satisfied with the declarations of the Bible;
   but as a defender of the faith he should be able to give an answer to
   those who oppose themselves.

   There are two points involved in this question: community of origin,
   and unity of species All plants and animals derived by propagation from
   the same original stock are of the same species but those of the same
   species need not be derived from a common stock. If God saw fit at the
   beginning, or at any time since, to create plants or animals of the
   same kind in large numbers and in different parts of the earth, they
   would be of the same species (or kind) though not of the same origin.
   The oaks of America and those of Europe are identical in species, even
   although not derived from one and the same parent oak. It may be
   admitted that the great majority of plants and animals were originally
   produced not singly or in pairs, but in groups, the earth bringing
   forth a multitude of individuals of the same kind. It is therefore in
   itself possible that all men may be of the same species, although not
   all descended from Adam. And such is the opinion of some distinguished
   naturalists. The Scriptural doctrine, however, concerning man is, that
   the race is not only the same in kind but the same in origin. They are
   all the children of a common parent, and have a common nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Meaning of the Word, or the Idea of Species.

   It is obviously essential to any intelligent answer to the question
   whether all the varieties of. men are of one species, that we should be
   able to tell what a species is. This is a point of very great
   difficulty. Naturalists not only differ in their definitions of the
   term, but they differ greatly in classification. Some assume a spot on
   the wing of a butterfly, or a slight diversity of plumage in a bird, as
   proof of difference of species. Some therefore divide into six or eight
   species what others comprehend in one. Nothing there-fore can be done
   until men come to a common understanding on this subject, and the true
   idea of species be determined and authenticated.

   General Characteristics of Species.

   Before considering the various definitions of the term, it is proper to
   remark that there are certain characteristics of species which at
   least, until of late, have been generally recognized and admitted. (1.)
   Originality, i.e., they owe their existence and character to immediate
   creation. They are not produced by physical causes, nor are they ever
   derived from other genera or species. They are original forms. This is
   admitted by naturalists of all classes. Such is the doctrine of Cuvier,
   Agassiz, Dr. Morton, and of those who hold that the varieties of the
   human race are so many distinct species. They mean by this that they
   had different origins, and are not all derived from a common stock.
   Every species therefore, by general consent, has had a single origin.
   (2.) Universality, i.e., all the individuals and varieties belonging to
   the same species have all its essential characteristics. Wherever you
   find the teeth of a carnivorous animal, you find a stomach able to
   digest animal food, and claws adapted to seize and hold prey. Wherever
   you find fins to effect motion in water, you find a breathing apparatus
   suited to the same element. The species is transmitted whole and
   entire. It is the same in all individuals belonging to it, and in that
   sense universal. (3.) Immutability, or permanence. By this is meant
   first, that one species is never lost or merged in another; and
   secondly, that two or more species never combine so as to produce a
   third. The rose cannot be merged into the tulip; nor can the rose and
   tulip be made to produce a new species, which is neither the one nor
   the other. The only permanent transmissible forms of organic life, are
   such as constitute distinct species. Immutability, therefore, or the
   power to perpetuate itself, is one of the indispensable characteristics
   of species. This, until recently, has been the universally admitted
   doctrine of naturalists. And notwithstanding the efforts of the
   advocates of the different theories of development, it still remains
   the general faith of the scientific world. The leading arguments in
   support of this doctrine have already been adverted to, when speaking
   of the theory of Mr. Darwin on the origin of species. Those arguments
   are briefly the following. (1.) The historical fact that all known
   species of plants and animals are now precisely what they were as far
   back as history reaches. The Bible and the records on the Egyptian
   monuments carry us back to a point thousands of years before the birth
   of Christ. During this whole period of five or six thousand years
   species have remained the same. (2.) If we are to receive the facts of
   geology as authenticated, it is clear that the same permanence has
   existed from the very beginning of life on our globe. As long as any
   species exists at all, it exists unchanged in all that is essential to
   it. (3.) There is an entire and acknowledged absence of all evidence of
   transmutation; none of the transition points or links of connection
   between one species and another is anywhere discoverable. (4.) If
   species were not thus immutable the animal and vegetable world instead
   of presenting the beautiful order everywhere visible, would exhibit a
   perfect chaos of all organic life. (5.) Notwithstanding the ingenious
   and long continued efforts to render hybrids prolific, such attempts
   have uniformly failed. The two greatest living authorities on this
   subject are Dr. Bachman of Charleston, South Carolina, and M. Flourens
   of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. "Either hybrids," says the latter,
   "born of the union of two distinct species, unite and soon become
   sterile, or they unite with one of the parent stocks and soon return to
   this type -- they in no case give what may be called a new species,
   that is to say, an intermediate durable species." "Les espèces ne
   s'altèrent point, ne changent point, ne passent point de l'une à
   l'autre; les espèces sont Fixes." [101] There is no natural law better
   authenticated or more generally admitted than that species are
   immutable and capable of indefinite propagation.

   Definitions of Species.

   No group of animals therefore can be regarded as a distinct species
   which has not existed as distinct from the beginning, and which is not
   immutable in its essential characteristics, and which is not capable of
   propagating itself indefinitely. These are important landmarks, but
   they are not sufficient to guide us in all cases to a satisfactory
   conclusion as to whether given individuals or varieties are of the same
   or of different species. (1.) Because the origin of these varieties
   cannot be historically traced. The Caucasian and the negro have existed
   with their present distinguishing characteristics for several thousands
   of years. But this does not prove that they differed from the
   beginning. (2.) Because certain varieties of the same species when once
   established become permanent, and are capable of indefinite
   continuance. Several varieties of dogs depicted on the Egyptian
   monuments centuries before Christ, are precisely what now exist.
   Naturalists therefore have sought for some precise definition of
   species, although these attempts have not been generally successful.
   Cuvier says: "We are under the necessity of admitting the existence of
   certain forms which have perpetuated themselves from the beginning of
   the world, without exceeding the limits first prescribed; all the
   individuals belonging to one of these forms constitute what is termed a
   species." De Candolle says: "We write under the designation of species
   all those individuals who mutually bear such close resemblance to each
   other as admits of our supposing they have arisen from a single pair."
   Agassiz [102] says: "Species is founded upon less important
   distinctions, such as color, size, proportions, sculpture, etc." The
   objections to these definitions are, (1.) That they do not enable us to
   distinguish between species and varieties. (2.) They refer almost
   exclusively to what is external or material, colour, size, proportion,
   etc., as the criteria, to the neglect of the higher constituents of the
   animal. Dr. Prichard says, that under the term species are included all
   those animals which are supposed to have arisen in the first instance
   from a single pair. And to the same effect Dr. Carpenter says: "When it
   can be shown that two races have had a separate origin, they are
   regarded as of different species; and, in the absence of proof; this is
   inferred when we find some peculiarity of organization characteristic
   of each, so constantly transmitted From parent to offspring, that the
   one cannot be supposed to have lost, or the other to have acquired it,
   through any known operation of physical causes." The objection to this
   view of the matter is that it makes community of origin, either proved
   or inferred, the criterion of sameness of species. But, in the first
   place, this community of origin cannot in a multitude of cases be
   established; and in the case of man, it is the very thing to be proved.
   The great question is, are Mongolians, Africans, and Caucasians all
   derived from a common parent? And in the second place, although
   community of origin would prove identity of species, diversity of
   origin would not prove diversity of species. All the varieties of the
   horse and dog would constitute one species for each class, although
   they had been created as they now are. Species means kind, and If two
   animals are of the same kind they are of the same species, no matter
   what their origin may have been. Had God created one pair of lions in
   Asia, another in North Africa, another in Senegal, they would all
   belong to one species. Their identity of kind would be precisely the
   same as though all were descended from one pair. Dr. Morton's
   definition of species as "a primordial organic form," has obtained
   general acceptance. It is, however, liable to objection on the ground
   of the ambiguity of the word form. If by "form" be understood external
   structure, the definition is unsatisfactory; if we understand the word
   in its scholastic sense of essential and formative principle, it
   amounts to the same thing which is more distinctly expressed in other
   terms. Agassiz gives another and much more satisfactory idea of the
   nature of species, when he refers to an immaterial principle as its
   essential element, and that to which the sameness of the individuals
   and varieties embraced within it is to be referred. [103] He says:
   "Besides the distinctions to be derived from the varied structure of
   organs, there are others less subject to rigid analysis, but no less
   decisive, to be drawn from the immaterial principle, with which every
   animal is endowed. It is this which determines the constancy of species
   from generation to generation, and which is the source of all the
   varied exhibitions of instinct and intelligence which we see displayed,
   from the simple impulse to receive the food which is brought within
   their reach, as observed in the polyps, through the higher
   manifestations, in the cunning fox, the sagacious elephant, the
   faithful dog, and the exalted intellect of man, which is capable of
   indefinite expansion." Again, he says: [104] "The constancy of species
   is a phenomenon dependent on the immaterial nature." "All animals," he
   says, "may be traced back in the embryo to a mere point upon the yolk
   of an egg, bearing no resemblance whatever to the future animal. But
   even here an immaterial principle which no external influence can
   prevent or modify, is present, and determines its future form; so that
   the egg of a hen can produce only a chicken, and the egg of a codfish
   only a cod." Professor Dana says: [105] "The units of the inorganic
   world are the weighed elements and their definite compounds or their
   molecules. The units of the organic are species, which exhibit
   themselves in their simplest condition in the germ-cell state. The
   kingdoms of life in all their magnificent proportions are made from
   these units." Again, [106] "When individuals multiply from generation
   to generation, it is but a repetition of the primordial type-idea; and
   the true notion of the species is not in the resulting group, but in
   the idea or potential element which is at the basis of every individual
   of the group." Here we reach solid ground. Unity of species does not
   consist in unity or sameness of organic structure, in sameness as to
   size, colour, or anything merely external; but in the sameness of the
   immaterial principle, or "potential idea," which constitutes and
   determines the sameness of nature. In the initial point on the yolk of
   the egg, there is no difference of form, no difference discernible by
   the microscope, or discoverable by chemical analysis, between one germ
   and another; between the initial cell of the bird and that of the fish.
   And yet the whole difference is there. The difference, therefore,
   cannot exist in what is external (although within certain limits and in
   further development it is manifested externally), but in what is
   immaterial. So that where the immaterial principle of Agassiz, or the
   potential idea of Dana, is the same, the species is the same; where the
   immaterial principle is different, the species is different.

   § 2. Evidence of Identity of Species.

   Such being the case, the only question is, how can we deter-mine
   whether the immaterial principle which constitutes and deter-mines the
   species, be the same or different. Aside from divine revelation, this
   can be ascertained: (1.) Partly from the organic structure. (2.) Partly
   from the phusis, or physical nature. (3.) Partly from the psuche, or
   psychological nature. (4.) Partly from permanence and capability of
   indefinite propagation.

   Organic Structure.

   The first evidence of the identity of species is to be sought in the
   soma, or the organic structure. The evidence of design is impressed won
   all the organized bodies in the universe, and especially upon the
   bodies of all animals. Those intended to live on the dry ground, those
   intended to live in water, and those intended to fly in the air, have
   their animal frame adapted to these severe, modes or conditions of
   existence. There is also clear evidence of the unity of this design.
   That is, it is carried out in all parts of the bodily organization.
   Those animals intended to live on dry ground have none of the
   structure, or organs, or members peculiarly suited to aquatic animals.
   The lion, tiger, ox, horse, etc., have neither the gills, the scales,
   the fins, nor the rudder-like tail of the fish. All parts of the animal
   harmonize. They are all related and adapted to one and the same end.
   The body of the fish is shaped so as to cleave the water with the least
   resistance; its fins are oars, its tail is adapted both for propulsion
   and guidance; its breathing apparatus is suited to separate the air
   from water; its digestive organs are adapted to the assimilation of the
   kind of food furnished by the element in which it lives. The same thing
   is obviously true of all terrestrial animals. Besides this general
   adaptation of animals for living in the air, in the water, and on the
   dry ground, there are innumerable more specific adaptations suiting the
   species of fishes, birds, and land animals for the particular modes of
   life for which they are designed. Some are intended to be carnivorous,
   and their bodies are harmoniously constructed with a view to that end.
   Others are intended to live on herbs, and in them we find everything
   adapted for that purpose. This adaptation refers to numerous and varied
   purposes. Hence the genera and the species of animals belonging to the
   different departments, classes, orders, and families into which the
   animal kingdom is divided, are exceedingly numerous, and each has its
   distinctive corporeal organization indicative of the specific end it is
   intended to subserve. So minute, and so fixed is the plan on which each
   species of animal is constructed, that a skilful naturalist, from the
   examination of a single bone, can tell not only the family, or genus,
   but the very species to which it belongs. Agassiz has, from a single
   scale of a fish, delineated its whole body as accurately as though the
   living animal had been photographed. And the correctness of his
   delineation has been afterwards verified by the discovery of a perfect
   specimen of the species portrayed. Now, the important principle
   deducible from these admitted facts is, that no diversity of colour,
   form, proportion, structure, etc., not indicative of design, or not
   proving a difference in the immaterial principle which determines the
   nature of the animal, can of itself be admitted as proof of diversity
   of species. The Italian greyhound and the English mastiff differ in all
   the respects just mentioned. The Shetland pony, the London dray-horse,
   and the Arabian or the Barb exhibit similar striking diversities. But
   when they come to be anatomically examined, it is found that they are
   constructed on the same plan. The bony structures, the distribution of
   the nerves, muscles, and blood-vessels, are all expressive of the same
   general intention. Hence, naturalists refer these varieties to the same
   species. And the correctness of this conclusion is confirmed by every
   other criterion of the identity of species. While it is admitted that
   such diversities do exist in the varieties belonging to the same
   species of the lower animals, it is surprising that far less
   diversities of the same kind among the varieties of the human family
   should be insisted upon, as evidence of difference of species. The wild
   dog wherever found is nearly of the same colour, and the same size,
   with ears, limbs and tail of the same form, and yet how endless are the
   permanent varieties derived from that original stock. It is well known
   that such varieties can be artificially produced. By skilful breeding
   almost any peculiarity of form, colour, or structure within the limits
   of the original idea of the species, can be produced and perpetuated;
   as is seen in the different breeds of horses, cattle, and sheep found
   even in so restricted a field of operation as Great Britain. It is
   certain, therefore, that no diversity of an external or material
   character, not indicative of diversity of design, plan, and intention
   can properly be assumed as indicative of diversity of species. The
   presence of a skin connecting the toes or claws of a bird, is in itself
   a comparatively small affair. It is insignificant as to the amount of
   material expended, and as to the effect on the general appearance
   compared to the points of difference between the greyhound and the
   mastiff, and yet it is indicative of design. It indicates that the
   animal is intended to live in the water; and everything else in its
   structure and nature is found to correspond with that intention. A
   small difference of structure indicative of design will prove
   difference of species, when much greater differences not thus
   indicative are perfectly consistent with unity of species.

   Physiological Argument.

   The second method of determining the identity of the immaterial
   principle in which the idea of species resides, is the examination of
   its phusis, or its physiology. To this department belongs all that
   relates to enervation or the distribution of the nerve power; to the
   circulation of the blood; to respiration; to calorification or
   production of animal heat; to the distribution of the muscles voluntary
   and involuntary; to the processes of digestion, assimilation,
   propagation, etc., etc. As to this point it is to be observed, (1.)
   That the phusis, or animal nature, is always in accordance with the
   soma, or corporeal structure. We never find the organs of an aquatic
   animal with the phusis of a land animal. Everything relating to the
   physiology of the animal is in harmony with its corporeal organization.
   (2.) That where in all respects the physical nature of individuals or
   varieties is the same, there the species is the same; where the phusis
   is different, the species is different. (3.) That the physiology of an
   animal is thus as easily ascertained, and is just as uniform and fixed,
   as its material structure, and in fact much more so. The material
   structure may, and as we have seen does, differ exceedingly in the
   different varieties included under the same species, but the phusis is
   always the same. The physiology of the greyhound is identical with that
   of the mastiff; and that of the Shetland pony is the same as that of
   the London dray-horse.

   Psychological Argument.

   The third criterion of the identity of species is to be sought in the
   psuche, or the psychological nature of the animal. The psuche is the
   immaterial principle which belongs to all animals, and is the same in
   kind in every distinct species. It is that in which the life resides;
   which is the seat of the instincts, and of that measure of
   intelligence, be it greater or less, which belongs to the animal. The
   psuche is the same in all the individuals of the same species, and it
   is permanent. The instincts and habits of the bee, the wasp, the ant,
   and the beaver; of the lion, tiger, wolf, fox, horse, dog, and ox; and
   of all the endless diversities of beasts, birds, fishes, and insects,
   are the same in all ages and in all parts of the world. This immaterial
   principle is of a higher order in some cases than in others, and admits
   of greater or less degrees of culture, as seen in the trained elephant
   or well-disciplined pointer. But the main thing is that each species
   has its own psuche, and that this is a higher element and more decisive
   evidence of identity than the corporeal structure or even the phusis,
   or animal nature. Where these three criteria concur, where the
   corporeal organization, in everything indicative of design, is the
   same; where the phusis and the psuche, the physical and psychological
   natures, are the same, there, beyond all reasonable doubt, the species
   is the same.

   The fourth criterion of species is found not only in its permanence but
   in the capacity of procreation and indefinite propagation which belongs
   to all the individuals and varieties which it includes. Animals of the
   same species can propagate their kind. Animals of different species
   cannot combine and perpetuate a new or mongrel species. This as we have
   seen is an admitted fact among all classes of naturalists, a few
   individuals excepted. It is a fact patent to all mankind and verified
   by the experience of all ages.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Application of these Criteria to Man.

   When we come to apply these several criteria to the human race, it is
   found beyond dispute that they all concur in proving that the whole
   human family are of one and the same species. In the first place the
   corporeal frame or external structure is the same in all the varieties
   of the race. There is the same number of bones in the skeleton; their
   arrangement and disposition are the same. There is the same
   distribution of the blood-vessels. The brain, the spinal marrow, and
   the nervous system are the same in all. They all have the same muscles
   amounting to many thousand in number. The organs for breathing,
   respiration, digestion, secretion, and assimilation, are the same in
   all. There are indeed indefinite diversities in size, complexion, and
   character, and colour of the hair, within the same variety of the race,
   and between the varieties themselves. Some of these diversities are
   variable, and some are fixed. The Caucasian, the Mongolian, the
   African, have each their peculiarities by which the one is easily
   distinguished from the other, and which descend from generation to
   generation without alteration. With regard to these peculiarities,
   however, it is to be remarked, first, that they are less important and
   less conspicuous than those which distinguish the different varieties
   of domestic animals all belonging to the same species. No two men, or
   no men of different races, differ from each other so much as the little
   Italian greyhound and the powerful mastiff or bull-dog. And secondly,
   none of these peculiarities are indicative of difference of design, or
   plan, and therefore they are not indicative of difference in the
   immaterial principle, which according to the naturalists of the highest
   class, determines the identity of species and secures its permanence.
   And thirdly, these peculiarities are all referrible to the differences
   of climate, diet, and mode of life, and to the effect of propagation in
   case of acquired peculiarities. The truth of this last statement as to
   the influence of these several causes in modifying and perpetuating
   varieties in the same species, is abundantly illustrated and confirmed
   in the case of all the lower animals. Such is the sameness of all the
   varieties of mankind as to their corporeal structure, that a system of
   anatomy written in Europe and founded on the examination of the bodies
   of Europeans exclusively, would be as applicable in Asia, Africa,
   America, and Australia, as in Europe itself.

   The second criterion of sameness of species is to be sought in the
   phusis, or physical nature. In this respect also all mankind are found
   to agree, so that the physiology of the Caucasian, Mongolian, and
   African is precisely the same. The laws which regulate the vital
   processes are the same in all; respiration, digestion, secretion, and
   propagation, are all conducted in the same way in every variety of the
   species.

   The third criterion is found in the psuche or psychological nature.
   This, as we have seen, is the highest test, for the psuche or
   immaterial principle is the most important element in the constitution
   of every living creature. Where that is the same, the species is the
   same. There can be no reasonable doubt that the souls of all men are
   essentially the same. They not only have in common all the appetites,
   instincts, and passions, which belong to the souls of the lower
   animals, but they all share in those higher attributes which belong
   exclusively to man. They all are endowed with reason, conscience, and
   free agency. They all have the same constitutional principles and
   affections. They all stand in the same relation to God as spirits
   possessing a moral and religious nature.

   The fourth criterion is permanence, and the ability of indefinite
   propagation. We have seen that it is a law of nature, recognized by all
   naturalists (with a few recent exceptions), that animals of different
   species do not cohabit, and cannot propagate. Where the species are
   nearly allied, as the horse and the ass, they may produce offspring
   combining the peculiarities of both parents. But there the process
   stops. Mules cannot continue the mongrel race. It is however an
   admitted fact that men of every race, Caucasian, Mongolian, and
   African, can thus cohabit, and their offspring can be indefinitely
   propagated and combined. "Were these units [species]," says Professor
   Dana, [107] capable of blending with one another indefinitely, they
   would no longer be units, and species could not be recognized. The
   system of life would be a maze of complexities; and whatever its
   grandeur to a being that could comprehend the infinite, it would be
   unintelligible chaos to man. . . . It would be to man the temple of
   nature fused over its whole surface, and through its structure, without
   a line the mind could measure or comprehend." As therefore the universe
   is constructed on a definite plan; as its laws are uniform; and as the
   constituent elements of the material world are permanent, it would be
   in strange contradiction with this universal analogy, if in the highest
   department of nature, in the organic and living world, everything
   should be unstable, so that species could mingle with species, and
   chaos take the place of order and uniformity. As therefore the
   different varieties of men freely unite and produce offspring
   permanently prolific, all those varieties must belong to one and the
   same species, or one of the most fixed of the laws of nature, is in
   their case reversed.

   The Evidence of Identity of Race Cumulative.

   It is to be observed that the strength of this argument for the unity
   of the human race does not depend upon any one of the above mentioned
   particulars separately. It is rather in their combination that the
   power of the argument lies. It is not simply because the corporeal
   structure is essentially the same in all men; nor simply because they
   have all the same physical, or the same psychological nature; or that
   they are capable of producing permanently prolific offspring; but
   because all these particulars are true in respect to the whole human
   family wherever found and through the whole course of its history. It
   becomes a mere matter of logomachy to dispute whether men are of the
   same species, if they have the same material organism, the same phusis
   and the same psuche. Whether of the same species or not, if these
   things be admitted which cannot be rationally denied, they are of the
   same nature, they are beings of the same kind. Naturalists may give
   what meaning they please to the word species. This cannot alter the
   facts of the case. All men are of the same blood, of the same race, of
   the same order of creation.

   "That the races of men," says Delitzsch, "are not species of one genus,
   but varieties of one species, is confirmed by the agreement in the
   psychological and pathological phenomena in them all, by similarity in
   the anatomical structure, in the fundamental powers and traits of the
   mind, in the limits to the duration of life, in the normal temperature
   of the body and the average rate of pulsation, in the duration of
   pregnancy, and in the unrestricted fruitfulness of marriages between
   the various races." [108]

   § 4. Philological and Moral Evidence.

   Besides the arguments above mentioned, which are all of a zoölogical
   character, there are others, not less conclusive, of a different kind.
   It is one of the infelicities which has attended this controversy, that
   it has been left too much in the hands of naturalists, of men trained
   to the consideration almost exclusively of what is material, or at most
   of what falls within the department of natural life. They thus become
   one-sided, and fail to take in all the aspects of the case, or to
   estimate duly all the data which enter into the solution of the
   problem. Thus Agassiz ignores all the facts connected with the
   languages, with the history, and with the mental, moral, and religious
   character and condition of man. He therefore comes to conclusions which
   a due consideration of those data would have rendered impossible.

   The science of comparative philology, is founded on laws which are as
   certain ant, as authoritative as the laws of nature. Language is not a
   fortuitous production. It is essentially different from instinctive
   cries, or inarticulate sounds. It is a production of the mind,
   exceedingly complex and subtle. It is impossible that races, entirely
   distinct, should have the same language. It is absolutely certain from
   the character of the French, Spanish, and Italian languages, that those
   nations are, in large measure, the common descendants of the Latin
   race. When therefore it can be shown that the languages of different
   races or varieties of men are radically the same, or derived from a
   common stock, it is impossible rationally to doubt their descent from a
   common ancestry. Unity of language, therefore, proves unity of species
   because it proves unity of origin. Diversity of language, however, does
   not prove diversity either of species or of origin; because that
   diversity may be otherwise accounted for; as by the confusion of
   tongues at Babel, or by the early and long-continued separation of
   different tribes. The point, however, now to be urged, is this. Such
   naturalists as Agassiz, on merely zoölogical principles, have decided
   that it is more probable (not that it is necessary or certain, but
   simply that it is more probable), that the different varieties of men,
   even down to different nations, have had different origins, and as
   Agassiz in his later writings maintains, are of different species;
   when, in many cases at least, it is absolutely certain, from the
   character of the languages which they speak, that they must have been
   derived from a common stock. Agassiz and others represent the Asiatic
   and European races as distinct in origin and species. But Alexander von
   Humboldt says, "The comparative study of languages shows us that races
   now separated by vast tracts of land, are allied together, and have
   migrated from one common primitive seat. . . . The largest field for
   such investigations into the ancient condition of language, and
   consequently into the period when the whole family of mankind was, in
   the strict sense of the word, to be regarded as one living whole,
   presents itself to the long chain of Indo-Germanic languages, extending
   from the Ganges to the Iberian extremity of Europe, and from Sicily to
   the North Cape." [109] Max Müller says, "The evidence of language is
   irrefragable, and it is the only evidence worth listening to, with
   regard to ante-historical periods There is not an English jury
   nowadays, which, after examining the hoary documents of language, would
   reject the claim of a common descent and a legitimate relationship
   between Hindu, Greek, and Teuton." [110] The Chevalier Bunsen says,
   "The Egyptian language attests an unity of blood with the great Aramaic
   tribes of Asia, whose languages have been comprised under the general
   expression of Semitic, of the languages of the family of Shem. It is
   equally connected by identity of origin with those still more numerous
   and illustrious tribes which occupy now the greatest part of Europe,
   and may, perhaps, alone or with other families, have a right to be
   called the family of Japhet." [111] This family, he says, includes the
   German nation, the Greeks and Romans, and the Indians and Persians. Two
   thirds of the human race are thus identified by these two classes of
   languages which have had a common origin. By the same infallible test
   Bunsen shows that the Asiatic origin of all the North American Indians,
   "is as fully proved as the unity of family among themselves." [112]
   Every day is adding some new language to this affiliated list, and
   furnishing additional evidence of the unity of mankind. The particular
   point to be now considered is, that the conclusions of the mere
   zoölogist as to the diversity of species and consequent diversity of
   origin of the different varieties of our race, are proved to be false
   by the certain testimony of the common origin of the languages which
   they speak.

   The Spiritual Relationship of Men.

   Besides the arguments already mentioned in favour of the unity of
   mankind, next to the direct assertion of the Bible, that which after
   all has the greatest force is the one derived from the present
   condition of our moral and spiritual nature. Wherever we meet a man, no
   matter of what name or nation, we not only find that he has the same
   nature with ourselves; that he has the same organs, the same senses,
   the same instincts, the same feelings, the same faculties, the same
   understanding, will, and conscience, and the same capacity for
   religious culture, but that he has the same guilty and polluted nature,
   and needs the same redemption. Christ died for all men, and we are
   commanded to prea0h the gospel to every creature under heaven.
   Accordingly nowhere on the face of the earth are men to he found who do
   not need the gospel or who are not capable of becoming partakers of the
   blessings which it offers. The spiritual relationship of men, their
   common apostasy, and their common interest in the redemption of Christ,
   demonstrate their common nature and their common origin beyond the
   possibility of reasonable or excusable doubt.

   Our attention has thus far been directed specially to the unity of
   mankind in species. Little need he said in conclusion as to their unity
   of origin. (1.) Because in the opinion of the most distinguished
   naturalists, unity of species is itself decisive proof of the unity of
   origin. (2.) Because even if this he denied, it is nevertheless
   universally admitted that when the species is the same the origin may
   he the same. If mankind differ as to species they cannot be descended
   from a common parent, but if identical in species there is no
   difficulty in admitting their common descent. It is indeed principally
   for the sake of disproving the Scriptural statement that all men are
   the children of Adam, and to break up the common brotherhood of man,
   that diversity of species is insisted upon. If therefore the latter be
   admitted, the former may he easily conceded. (3.) The common origin of
   the languages of the vast majority of men, proves, as we have seen,
   their community of origin, and as an inference their unity as to
   species. And as this community of origin is proved as to races which
   the mere zoölogist is disposed with the greatest confidence to
   represent as distinct, the insufficiency of the grounds of their
   classification is thereby demonstrated. (4.) It is, however, the direct
   testimony of the Scriptures on this subject, with which all known facts
   are consistent; and the common apostasy of the race, and their common
   need of redemption, which render it certain to all who believe the
   Bible or the testimony of their own consciousness as to the universal
   sinfulness of humanity, that all man are the descendants of one fallen
   progenitor.

CHAPTER V.

  ORIGINAL STATE OF MAN.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Scriptural Doctrine.

   The Scriptural doctrine on this subject includes the following
   particulars. First, That man was originally created in a state of
   maturity and perfection. By this, however, is not meant that humanity
   in Adam before the fall, existed in the highest state of excellence of
   which it is susceptible. It is altogether probable that our nature, in
   virtue of its union with the divine nature in the person of Christ, and
   in virtue of the union of the redeemed with their exalted Redeemer,
   shall hereafter be elevated to a dignity and glory far greater than
   that in which Adam was created or to which he ever could have attained.
   By the maturity of man as at first created is meant that he was not
   created in a state of infancy. It is a favourite assumption of sceptics
   that man at first both as to soul and body, was imbecile and
   unfurnished; slowly forming for himself an articulate language, and
   having his moral powers gradually awakened. This, however, is
   inconsistent not only with the Scriptural account of his creation, but
   also with the part he was designed to act, and in fact did act. By the
   perfection of his original state is meant, that he was perfectly
   adapted to the and for which the was made and to the sphere in which he
   was designed to move. This perfection as to his body consisted not only
   in the integrity and due proportion of all its parts, but also in its
   perfect adaptation to the nature of the soul with which it was united.
   It is commonly said by theologians that the body way created immortal
   and impassible. With regard to its immortality it is certain that if
   man had not sinned he would not have died. But whether the immortality
   which would then have been they destiny of the body, would have been
   the result of its original organization, or whether after its period of
   probation it would have undergone a change to adapt it to its
   everlasting condition, is a matter to be subsequently considered. By
   impassibility is not necessarily meant entire freedom from
   susceptibility to pain, for such susceptibility in our present earthly
   state, and perhaps in any conceivable earthly state, is a necessary
   condition of safety. It is a good and not an evil, a perfection and not
   a defect. All that need he meant by the term is that the body of Adam
   was free from the seeds of disease and death. There was nothing in its
   constitution inconsistent with the highest happiness and well-being of
   man in the state in which he was created, and the conditions under
   which he was to live.

   That the primitive state of our race was not one of barbarism from
   which men have raised themselves by a slow process of improvement, we
   know, First, from the authority of Scripture, which represents, as we
   have seen, the first man as created in the full perfection of his
   nature. This fact for all Christians is decisive. Secondly, the
   traditions of all nations treat of a golden age from which men have
   fallen. These wide-spread traditions cannot rationally be accounted
   for, except on the assumption that the Scriptural account of the
   primitive state of man is correct. Thirdly, the evidence of history is
   all on the side of the doctrine of the Bible on this subject. Egypt
   derived its civilization from the East; Greece from Phoenicia and
   Egypt; Italy from Phoenicia and Greece; the rest of Europe from Italy.
   Europe is now rapidly extending her civilizing influence over New
   Zealand, Australia, and the Islands of the Pacific Oceans. The affinity
   of languages proves that the early civilization of Mexico and South
   America had its source in Eastern Asia. On the other hand, there is no
   authentic account of a nation of savages rising by their own efforts
   from a state of barbarism to a civilized condition. The fact that Sir
   John Lubbock, and other advocates of the opposite doctrine, are obliged
   to refer to such obscure and really insignificant facts, as the
   superior culture of the modern Indians on this continent, is a proof of
   the dearth of historical evidence in support of the theory of primitive
   barbarism. Fourthly, the oldest records, written and monumental, give
   evidence of the existence of nations in a high state of civilization,
   in the earliest periods of human history. This fact is easily accounted
   for on the assumption of the truth of the Scriptural doctrine of the
   primitive state of man, but is unaccountable on the opposite
   hypothesis. It necessitates the gratuitous assumption of the existence
   of men for untold ages prior to these earliest historical periods.
   Fifthly, comparative philology has established the fact of the intimate
   relation of all of the great divisions of the human race. It has
   further proved that they all had their origin from a common centre, and
   that that centre was the seat of the earliest civilization.

   The theory that the race of man has passed through a stone, a bronze,
   and an iron age, stages of progress from barbarism to civilization, is,
   as before remarked, destitute of scientific foundation. It cannot be
   proved that the stone age prevailed contemporaneously in all parts of
   the earth. And unless this is proved it avails nothing to show that
   there was a period at which the inhabitants of Europe were destitute of
   a knowledge of the metals. The same may be proved of the Patagonians
   and of some African tribes of the present day.

   It has, therefore, been almost the universal belief that the original
   state of man was as the Bible teaches, his highest state, from which
   the nations of the earth have more or less deteriorated. This primitive
   state, however, was distinguished by the intellectual, moral, and
   religious superiority of men rather than by superiority in the arts or
   natural sciences. The Scriptural doctrine, therefore, is consistent
   with the admitted fact that separate nations, and the human race as a
   whole, have made great advances in all branches of knowledge and in all
   the arts of life. Nor is it inconsistent with the belief that the world
   under the influence of Christianity is constantly improving, and will
   ultimately attain, under the reign of Christ, millennial perfection and
   glory. All that is denied is, that men were originally savages in the
   lowest state of barbarism, from which they have gradually emerged.

   The late Archbishop Whately, in his work on "Political Economy," avowed
   his belief of the common doctrine on the primitive state of man. He
   says, "We have no reason to believe that any community ever did, or
   ever can emerge, unassisted by external helps, from a state of
   barbarism unto anything that can be called civilization." In opposition
   to this doctrine, Sir John Lubbock tries to show "That there are
   indications of progress even among savages," and, "That among the most
   civilized nations there are traces of original barbarism." [113] Before
   adducing proof of either of those propositions, he argues against the
   theory that any tribe has sunk from a higher to a lower condition, on
   the ground that there are certain arts which are so simple and so
   useful, that if once known, they could never be lost. If men had once
   been herdsmen and agriculturists, they would never become mere hurters;
   if acquainted with the use of metals, or the art of making earthenware,
   these acquisitions could not be lost. If once possessed of religious
   knowledge, that knowledge could never perish. As however, there are
   tribes now extant which have, as he says, no religion, and no knowledge
   of the arts, or of agriculture, he argues that they must have been
   barbarians from the beginning, and that barbarism must have been the
   original condition of man.

   To prove that savages may by their own exertions become civilized he
   refers to such facts as the following: The Australians had formerly
   bark-canoes, which they have abandoned for others, hollowed out of the
   trunk of a tree, "which they buy from the Malays." The Peruvians had
   domesticated the llama; the Polynesians made bark-cloth. "Another very
   strong case," he says, "is the boomerang of the Australians. This
   weapon is known to no other race of men," and therefore, he argues,
   cannot be a relic of a higher state of civilization. He lays great
   stress on the case of the Cherokees who have become agriculturists,
   having ploughs, horses, black-cattle, etc., ignoring the fact that they
   were surrounded by civilized Americans and had enjoyed for years the
   faithful teaching of Christian missionaries who instructed them in all
   the useful arts.

   He finds indications of the original barbarism of the race in the fact
   that flint implements are found not only in Europe, but also in Asia,
   the cradle of mankind; and in the gradual improvement of the relation
   between the sexes. [114] His book is designed to "describe the social
   and mental condition of savages, their art, their systems of marriage
   and of relationship, their religions, language, moral character and
   laws." This he does by a very copious collection of particulars under
   these several heads; and thence draws the following conclusions. "That
   existing savages are not the descendants of civilized ancestors. That
   the primitive condition of man was one of utter barbarism. That from
   this condition several races have independently raised themselves."
   [115] How these conclusion's follow from the facts detailed, it is
   impossible to see; especially as hey are in opposition not only to the
   Bible, but to all the teachings of history. That the lowest savage
   tribes have low ideas of God, is no proof that our first parents were
   fetich worshippers, when all history proves that the earliest religion
   of our race was pure Theism. As men lost the knowledge of the true God,
   they became more and more degraded in every other respect. And those
   who were driven away from the centres of civilization into inhospitable
   regions, torrid or arctic, sunk lower and lower in the scale of being.
   Certain it is that there is nothing in Sir John Lubbock's book that can
   shake the faith of a Christian child in the doctrine of the Bible as to
   the primitive state of man.

   § 2. Man Created in the Image of God.

   Secondly. Other animals, however, besides man, were created in maturity
   and perfection, each according to its kind. It was the distinguishing
   characteristic of man, that he was created in the image and likeness of
   God. Many of the early writers assumed that the word "image" had
   reference to the body, which they thought by its beauty, intelligence
   of aspect, and erect stature, was an adumbration of God, and that the
   word "likeness "referred to the intellectual and moral nature of man.
   According to Augustine, image relates to the cognitio veritatis, and
   likeness to the amor virtutis; the former to the intellectual, and the
   latter to the moral faculties. This was the foundation of the
   scholastic doctrine that the image of God includes the natural
   attributes of the soul; and the likeness our moral conformity to the
   divine Being. This distinction was introduced into the Romish theology.
   Bellarmin [116] says, "Imaginem in natura, similitudinem in probitate
   et justitia sitam esse." He also says, [117] "Ex his tot patrum
   testimoniis cogimur admittere, non esse omnino idem imaginem et
   similitudinem, sed imaginem ad naturam, similitudinem ad virtutes
   pertinere; proinde Adamum peccando non imaginem Dei, sed similitudinem
   perdidisse." Others again somewhat modified this view by making the
   image of God to consist in what was natural and concreated, and the
   likeness in what was acquired. Man was created in the image of God and
   fashioned himself into his likeness. That is, he so used his natural
   endowments as to become like God in character. All these distinctions,
   however, rest on a false interpretation of Gen. i. 26. The words tslm
   and dmvt are simply explanatory one of the other. Image and likeness,
   means an image which is like. The simple declaration of the Scripture
   is that man at his creation was like sod. Wherein that likeness
   consisted has been a matter of dispute. According to the Reformed
   theologians and the majority of the theologians of other divisions of
   the Church, man's likeness to God included the following points: --

   His intellectual and moral nature. God is a Spirit, the human soul is a
   spirit. The essential attributes of a spirit are reason, conscience,
   and will. A spirit is a rational, moral, and therefore also, a free
   agent. In making man after his own image, therefore, God endowed him
   with those attributes which belong to his own nature as a spirit. Man
   is thereby distinguished from all other inhabitants of this world, and
   raised immeasurably above them. He belongs to the same order of being
   as God Himself, and is therefore capable of communion with his Maker.
   This conformity of nature between man and God, is not only the
   distinguishing prerogative of humanity, so tar as earthly creatures are
   concerned, but it is also the necessary condition of our capacity to
   know God, and therefore the foundation of our religious nature. If we
   were not like God, we could not know Him. We should be as the beasts
   which perish. The Scriptures in declaring that God is the Father of
   spirits, and that we are his offspring, teach us that we are partakers
   of his nature as a spiritual being, and that an es3ential element of
   that likeness to God in which man was originally created consists in
   our rational or spiritual nature. On this subject, however, there have
   been two extreme opinions. The Greek theologians made the image of God
   in which man was created to consist exclusively in his rational nature.
   The majority of them taught that the eikon was en logike psuche; or as
   John of Damascus [118] expresses it: to kat' eikona, to noeron deloi
   kai autexousion. And Irenæus [119] says: "Homo vero rationabilis et
   secundum hoc similis Deo." The Remonstrants and Socinians were disposed
   to confine the image of God in which man was created to his dominion.
   Thus Limborch [120] says: "Illa imago aliud nihil est, quam eximia,
   quædam qualitas et excellentia, qua homo Deum speciatim refert: hæc
   autem est potestas et dominium, quod Deus homini dedit in omnia a se
   creata. . . . . Hoc enim dominio Deum proprie refert, estque quasi
   visibilis Deus in terra super omnes Dei creaturas constitutus." This
   dominion, however, was founded on man's rational nature, and therefore
   Limborch adds, that Adam's likeness to God pertained to his soul,
   "quatenus ratione instructa est, cujus ministerio, veluti sceptro
   quodam, omnia sibi subjicere potest." These views agree in excluding
   man's moral conformity to God from the idea of the divine image in
   which he was created.

   The Lutheran theologians were, in general, inclined to go to the
   apposite extreme. The image of God, according to them, was that which
   was lost by the fall, and which is restored by redemption. Thus Luther
   says: "So ist nun hier so viel gesagt, dass der Mensch am Anfang
   geschaffen ist ein Bild, das Gott ähnlich war, voll Weisheit, Tugend,
   Liebe and kurzum gleich wie Gott, also dass er voll Gottes war." And:
   "Das ist Gottes Bild, das eben also wie Gott gesinnet ist und sich
   immer nach ihm ahmet." [121] Calovius and other Lutheran theologians
   say expressly: "Anima ipsa rationalis non est imago divina, aut
   imaginis pars, quia anima non est amissa, at imago amissa est." And
   again: "Unde patet, conformitatem, quæ in substantia animæ reperitur
   aut corporis, ad imaginem Dei, stylo biblico descriptam, non pertinere,
   quia substantia animæ aut corporis per lapsum non est perdita, nec per
   renovationem restauratur." This, however, is rather a dispute about the
   Scriptural use of the phrase "image of God," as applied to man in his
   original estate, than about the fact itself; for the Lutherans did not
   deny that the soul as to its nature or substance is like God. Hollazius
   admits that "Ipsa substantia animæ humanæ quædam theia seu divina
   exprimit, et exemplar divinitatis refert. Nam Deus est spiritus
   immaterialis, intelligens, voluntate libera agens, etc., etc. Quæ
   prædicata de anima humana certo modo affirmari possunt." [122]

   The Reformed theologians take the middle ground between the extremes of
   making the image of God to consist exclusively in man's rational
   nature, or exclusively in his moral conformity to his Maker. They
   distinctly include both. Calvin [123] says, Imago Dei est "integra
   naturæ humanæ præstantia, quæ refulsit in Adam ante defectionem postea
   sic vitiata et prope deleta, ut nihil ex ruina nisi confusum, mutilum,
   labeque infectum supersit." H. à Diest [124] is more explicit: "Imago
   Dei fuit partim inamissibilis, partim amissibilis; inamissibilis, quæ
   post lapsum integra permansit, veluti animæ substantia spiritualis,
   immortalis, rationalis, cum potentiis intelligendi et libere volendi;
   amissibilis, quæ partim plane periit, partim corrupta est, manentibus
   tantum exiguis ejusdem reliquiis; veluti in intellectu insignis
   sapientia, in voluntate et affectibus vera justitia et sanctitas, in
   corpore immortalitas, sanitas, f'ortitudo, pulchritudo, dominium in
   animalia, copia omnium bonorum et jus utendi creaturis." Maresius [125]
   says: "Imago Dei spectavit, (1.) Animæ essentiam et conditionem
   spiritualem, intelligentem et volentem, quod contra Lutheranos
   pertendimus, quum post lapsum etiam rudera imaginis Dei adsint. (2.)
   Eluxit in accidentali animæ perfectione, mentis lumine, voluntatis
   sanctitate, sensuum et affectuum harmonia atque ad bonum promptitudine;
   (3.) conspicua fuit in dominio in omnia animalia." While, therefore,
   the Scriptures make the original moral perfection of man the most
   prominent element of that likeness to God in which he was created, it
   is no less true that they recognize man as a child of God in virtue of
   his rational nature. He is the image of God, and bears and reflects the
   divine likeness among the inhabitants of the earth, because he is a
   spirit, an intelligent, voluntary agent; and as such he is rightfully
   invested with universal dominion. This is what the Reformed theologians
   were accustomed to call the essential image of God, as distinguished
   from the accidental. The one consisting in the very nature of the soul,
   the other in its accidental endowments, that is, such as might be lost
   without the loss of humanity itself.

   § 3. Original Righteousness.

   In the moral image of God, or original righteousness, are included, --

   1. The perfect harmony and due subordination of all that constituted
   man. His reason was subject to God; his will was subject to his reason;
   his affections and appetites to his will; the body was the obedient
   organ of the soul. There was neither rebellion of the sensuous part of
   his nature against the rational, nor was there any disproportion
   between them needing to be controlled or balanced by ab extra gifts or
   influence.

   2. But besides this equilibrium and harmony in the original
   constitution of man, his moral perfection in which he resembled God,
   included knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. The two passages of
   the New Testament in which these elements of the divine image in which
   man was created, are distinctly mentioned, are Col. iii. 10, and Eph.
   iv. 24. In the former it is said, Ye "have put on the new man, which is
   renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:"
   endusamenoi ton neon, ton anakainoumenon eis epignosin kat' eikona tou
   ktisantos auton. New man (neon), agreeably to the ordinary distinction
   between neos and kainos, means recent, newly made, as opposed to
   (palaios) old. The moral quality or excellence of this recently formed
   man is expressed in the word anakainoumenon; as in Scriptural usage
   what is kainos is pure. This renovation is said to be eis epignosin,
   not in knowledge, much less by knowledge, but unto knowledge, so that
   he knows. Knowledge is the effect of the renovation spoken of. The word
   epignosin may be connected with the words which immediately follow
   (kat' eikona), knowledge according to the image of God, i.e. Knowledge
   like that which God possesses. It is more common and natural to take
   epignosin by itself; and connect kat' eikona with the preceding
   participle, "renewed after the image of God." The knowledge here
   intended is not mere cognition. It is full, accurate, living, or
   practical knowledge; such knowledge as is eternal life, so that this
   word here includes what in Eph. iv. 24 is expressed by righteousness
   and holiness. Whether the word ktisantos refers to God as the author of
   the original creation, or of the new creation of which the Apostle is
   here speaking, is matter of doubt. In the firmer case, the meaning
   would be, the believer is renewed after the image of his Creator. In
   the latter, the sense is that the renovation is after the image of the
   creator of the new man. According to the one mode of explanation the
   idea is more clearly expressed that man, as originally created, was
   endowed with true knowledge. According to the other interpretation this
   may be implied, but is not asserted. All that the Apostle in that case
   affirms is that the regenerated man is made like God in knowledge. But
   as the original man was also like God, and as knowledge is included in
   that likeness, the passage still proves that Adam was created in the
   possession of the knowledge of which the Apostle here speaks. As the
   word ktizein in the New Testament always refers to the original
   creation, unless some explanatory term be added, as new creation, or,
   unless the context forbids such reference; and as ktisantos does not
   express the continuous process of transformation, but the momentary act
   of creation as already past, it is more natural to understand the
   Apostle as speaking of the original likeness to God in which man was
   created, arid to which the believer is restored. The amen, therefore,
   is not to be understood of ton geon, but of anthropon; -- after the
   image of Him who created man. This is the old interpretation as given
   by Calovius and adopted by De Wette, Rückert. and other modern
   interpreters. Calovius says: "Per imaginem ejus, qui creavit ipsum,
   imago Dei, quæ in prima creatione nobis concessa vel concreata est,
   intelligitur, quæque in nobis reparatur per Spiritum Sanctum, quæ
   ratione intellectus consistebat in cognitione Dei, ut ratione
   voluntatis in justitia et sanctitate, Eph. iv. 24. Per verbum itaque
   tou ktisantos non nova creatio, sed vetus illa et primæva intelligitur,
   quia in Adamo conditi omnes sumus ad imaginem Dei in cognitione Dei."

   Ephesians iv. 24.

   The other passage above referred to is Eph. iv. 24: "Put on the new
   man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
   The new man, ton kainon anthropon, is said to be kata theon, i.e.,
   after the image of God; and that image or likeness to God is said to
   consist in righteousness and holiness. These words when used in
   combination are intended to be exhaustive; i.e., to include all moral
   excellence. Either term may be used in this comprehensive sense, but,
   when distinguished, dikaiosune means rectitude, the being and doing
   right, what justice demands; hosiotes, purity, holiness, the state of
   mind produced when the soul is full of God. Instead of true holiness,
   the words of the Apostle should be rendered "righteousness and holiness
   of the truth;" that is, the righteousness and holiness which are the
   effects or manifestations of the truth. By truth here, as opposed to
   the deceit (apate) mentioned in the twenty-second verse, is meant what
   in Col. iii. 10 is called knowledge. It is the divine light in the
   understanding, of which the Spirit of truth is the author, and from
   which, as their proximate cause, all right affections and holy acts
   proceed.

   It is plain from these passages that knowledge, righteousness, and
   holiness are elements of the image of God in which man was originally
   created. By knowledge is not meant merely the faculty of cognition, the
   ability to acquire knowledge, but the contents of that faculty. As
   knowledge may be innate, so it may be concreated. Adam, as soon as he
   began to be had self-knowledge; he was conscious of his own being,
   faculties, and states. He had also the knowledge of what was out of
   himself, or he had what the modern philosophy calls
   world-consciousness. He not only perceived the various material objects
   by which he was surrounded, but he apprehended aright their nature. How
   far this knowledge extended we are unable to determine. Some have
   supposed that our first parent had a more thorough knowledge of the
   external world, of its laws, and of the nature of its various
   productions, than human science has ever since attained. It is certain
   that he was able to give appropriate names to all classes of animals
   which passed in review before him, which supposes a due apprehension of
   their distinctive characteristics. On this point we know nothing beyond
   what the Bible teaches us. It is more important to remark that Adam
   knew God; whom to know is life eternal. Knowledge, of course, differs
   as to its objects. The cognition of mere speculative truths, as those
   of science and history, is a mere act of the understanding; the
   cognition of the beautiful involves the exercise of our æsthetic
   nature; of moral truths the exercise of our moral nature; and the
   knowledge of God the exercise of our spiritual and religious nature,
   The natural man, says the Apostle, receives not the things of the
   Spirit, neither can he k tow them. What is asserted of Adam is that, as
   he came from the hands of his Maker, his mind was imbued with this
   spiritual or divine knowledge.

   All that has been said with regard to the original state of man is
   involved in the account of the creation, which declares that he was
   made like God; and that he was pronounced to be good, good exceedingly.
   What the goodness is which belongs to man as a rational, immortal, and
   religious being, and which is necessary to fit him for the sphere in
   which he was to move, and the destiny for. which he was created, we
   learn partly from the express declarations of the Scriptures, partly
   from the nature of the case, and partly from what is involved in
   humanity as restored by Christ. From all these sources it is plain that
   the Protestant doctrine concerning the image of God and the original
   righteousness in which and with which Adam was created includes not
   only his rational nature, but also knowledge, righteousness, and
   holiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. Dominion over the Creatures.

   The third particular which enters into the dignity of man's original
   state, and into the image of God with which he was invested, was his
   dominion over the creatures. This arose from the powers with which he
   was invested, and from the express appointment of God. God constituted
   him ruler over the earth. He placed, as the Psalmist said, all things
   under his feet. In 1 Cor. xi. 7, the Apostle says that the man is the
   image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man. This he
   gives as the reason why the man should do nothing which implied the
   denial of his right to rule. It was therefore as a ruler that he bore
   God's image, or represented Him on earth. What is the extent of the
   dominion granted to man, or to which our race was destined, it is not
   easy to determine. Judging from the account given in Genesis, or even
   from the stronger language used in the eighth Psalm, we should conclude
   that his authority was to extend only over the inferior animals
   belonging to this earth. But the Apostle, in his exposition of the
   words of the Psalmist, teaches us that far more was intended. In 1 Cor.
   xv. 27, he says, "When he saith, All things are put under him, it is
   manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him." And
   in Heb. ii. 8, he says, "In that he put all in subjection under him, he
   left nothing that is not put under him." It was therefore an absolutely
   universal dominion, so far as creatures are concerned, with which man
   was to be invested. This universal dominion, as we learn from the
   Scriptures, has been realized and attained only by the incarnation and
   exaltation of the Son of God. But as God sees the end from the
   beginning, as his plan is immutable and all comprehending, this supreme
   exaltation of humanity was designed from the beginning, and included in
   the dominion with which man was invested.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 5. The Doctrine of the Romish Church.

   The doctrine of Romanists as to the original state of man agrees with
   that of Protestants, except in one important particular. They hold that
   man before the fall, was in a state of relative perfection; that is,
   not only free from any defect or infirmity of body, but endowed with
   all the attributes of a spirit, and imbued with knowledge,
   righteousness, and holiness, and invested with dominion over the
   creatures. Protestants include all this under the image of God; the
   Romanists understand by the image of God only the rational, and
   especially the voluntary nature of man, or the freedom of the will.
   They distinguish, therefore, between the image of God and original
   righteousness. The latter they say is lost, the former retained.
   Protestants, on the other hand, hold that it is the divine image in its
   most important constituents, that man forfeited by his apostasy. This,
   however, may be considered only a difference as to words. The important
   point of difference is, that the Protestants hold that original
   righteousness, so far as it consisted in the moral excellence of Adam,
   was natural, while the Romanists maintain that it was supernatural.
   According to their theory, God created man soul and body. These two
   constituents of his nature are naturally in conflict. To preserve the
   harmony between them, and the due subjection of the flesh to the
   spirit, God gave man the supernatural gift of original righteousness.
   It was this gift that man lost by his fall; so that since the apostasy
   he is in the state in which Adam was before he was invested with this
   supernatural endowment. In opposition to this doctrine, Protestants
   maintain that original righteousness was concreated and natural.
   Original righteousness, says Luther, [126] "Non fuisse quoddam donum,
   quod ab extra accederet, separatum a natura hominis. Sed fuisse vere
   naturalem, ita ut natura Adæ esset, diligere Deum, credere Deo,
   agnoscere Deum, etc. Hæc tam naturalia fuere in Adamo, quam naturale
   est, quod oculi lumen recipiunt." The Council of Trent does not speak
   explicitly on this point, but the language of the Roman Catechism is
   clearly in accordance with the more direct teachings of the theologians
   of the Church of Rome, to the effect that original righteousness is a
   supernatural gift. In describing the original state of man that
   Catechism says, [127] "Quod ad animam pertinet, eum ad imaginem et
   similitudinem suam formavit, liberumque ei arbitrium tribuit: omnes
   præterea motus animi atque appetitiones ita in eo temperavit, ut
   rationis imperio nunquam non parerent. Tum originalis justitiæ
   admirabile donum addidit, ac deinde cæteris animantibus præesse
   voluit." Bellarmin [128] states this doctrine in clearer terms:
   "Integritas illa, cum qua primus homo conditus fuit et sine qua post
   ejus lapsum homines omnes nascuntur, non fuit naturalis ejus conditio,
   sed supernaturalis evectio. . . . . [129] Sciendum est primo, hominem
   naturaliter constare ex carne, et spiritu, et ideo partim cum bestiis,
   partim cum angelis communicare naturam, et quidem ratione carnis, et
   communionis cum bestiis, habere propensionem quandam ad bonum
   corporale, et sensibile, in quod fertur per sensum et appetitum:
   ratione spiritus et communionis cum angelis, habere propensionem ad
   bonum spirituale et intelligibile, in quod fertur per intelligentiam,
   et voluntatem. Ex his autem diversis, vel contrariis propensionibus
   existere in uno eodemque homine pugnam quandam, et ex ea pugna ingentem
   bene agendi difficultatem, dum una propensio alteram impedit. Sciendum
   secundo, divinam providentiam initio creationis, ut remedium adhiberet
   huic morbo seu languori naturæ humanæ, qui ex conditione materiæ
   oriebatur, addidisse homini donum quoddam insigne, justitiam videlicet
   originalem, qua veluti aureo quodam fræno pars inferior parti
   superiori, et pars superior Deo facile subjecta contineretur."

   The question whether original righteousness was natural or supernatural
   cannot be answered until the meaning of the words be determined. The
   word natural is often used to designate that which constitutes nature.
   Reason is in such a sense natural to man that without it he ceases to
   be a man. Sometimes it designates what of necessity flows from the
   constitution of nature; as when we say it is natural for man to desire
   his own happiness; sometimes it designates what is concreated or innate
   as opposed to what is adventitious, accessory, or acquired; in this use
   of the word the sense of justice, pity, and the social affections, are
   natural to men. Original righteousness is asserted by Protestants to be
   natural, first, with the view of denying that human nature as at first
   constituted involved the conflicting principles of flesh and spirit as
   represented by Bellarmin, and that the pura naturalia, or simple
   principles of nature as they existed in Adam, were without moral
   character; and. secondly, to assert that the nature of man as created
   was good, that his reason was enlightened and his will and feelings
   were conformed to the moral image of God. It was natural in Adam to
   love God in the same sense as it was natural for him to love himself.
   It was as natural for him to apprehend the glory of God as it was for
   him to apprehend the beauties of creation. He was so constituted, so
   created, that in virtue of the nature which God gave him, and without
   any accessory ab extra gift, he was suited to fulfil the end of his
   being, namely, to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever.

   Objections to the Romish Doctrine.

   The obvious objections to the Romish doctrine that original
   righteousness was a supernatural gift, are, (1.) That it supposes a
   degrading view of the original constitution of our nature. According to
   this doctrine the seeds of evil were implanted in the nature of man as
   it came from the hands of God. It was disordered or diseased, there was
   about it what Bellarmin calls a morbus or languor, which needed a
   remedy. But this is derogatory to the justice and goodness of God, and
   to the express declarations of Scripture, that man, humanity, human
   nature, was good. (2.) This doctrine is evidently founded on the
   Manichean principle of the inherent evil of matter. It is because man
   has a material body, that this conflict between the flesh and spirit,
   between good and evil, is said to be unavoidable. But this is opposed
   to the word of God and the faith of the Church. Matter is not evil. And
   there is no necessary tendency to evil from the union of the soul and
   body which requires to be supernaturally corrected. (3.) This doctrine
   as to original righteousness arose out of the Semi-Pelagianism of the
   Church of Rome, and was designed to sustain it. The two doctrines are
   so related that they stand or fall together. According to the theory in
   question, original sin is the simple loss of original righteousness.
   Humanity since the fall is precisely what it was before the fall, and
   before the addition of the supernatural gift of righteousness.
   Bellarmin [130] says: "Non magis differt status hominis post lapsum Adæ
   a statu ejusdem in puris naturalibus, quam differat spoliatus a nudo,
   neque deterior est humana natura, si culpam originalem detrahas, neque
   magis ignorantia et infirmitate laborat, quam esset et laboraret in
   puris naturalibus condita. Proinde corruptio naturæ non ex alicujus
   doni naturalis carentia, neque ex alicujus malæ qualitatis accessu, sed
   ex sola doni supernaturalis ob Adæ peccatum amissione profluxit." The
   conflict between the flesh and spirit is normal and original, and
   therefore not sinful. Concupiscence, the theological term for this
   rebellion of the lower against the higher elements of our nature, is
   not of the nature of sin, Andradius [131] (the Romish theologian
   against whom Chemnitz directed his Examen of the Council of Trent) lays
   down the principle, "quod nihil habeat rationem peccati, nisi fiat a
   volente et sciente," which of course excludes concupiscence, whether in
   the renewed or unrenewed, from the category of sin. Hence, Bellarmin
   says: [132] "Reatus est omnino inseparabilis ab eo, quod natura sua est
   dignum æterna damnatione, qualem esse volunt concupiscentiam
   adversarii." This concupiscence remains after baptism, or regeneration,
   which Romanists say, removes all sin; and therefore, not being evil in
   its own nature, does not detract from the merit of good works, nor
   render perfect obedience, and even works of supererogation on the part
   of the faithful, impossible. This doctrine of the supernatural
   character of original righteousness as held by Romanists, is therefore
   intimately connected with their whole theological system; and is
   incompatible with the Scriptural doctrines not only of the original
   state of man, but also of sin and redemption. It will, however, appear
   in the sequel, that neither the standards of the Church of Rome nor the
   Romish theologians are consistent in their views of original sin and
   its relation to the loss of original righteousness.

   § 6. Pelagian and Rationalistic Doctrine.

   According to Pelagians and Rationalists man was created a rational free
   agent, but without moral character. He was neither righteous nor
   unrighteous, holy nor unholy. He had simply the capacity of becoming
   either. Being endowed with reason and free will, his character depended
   upon the use which he made of those endowments. If he acted right, he
   became righteous; if he acted wrong, he became unrighteous. There can
   be, according to their system, no such thing as concreated moral
   character, and therefore they reject the doctrine of original
   righteousness as irrational. This view of man's original state is the
   necessary consequence of the assumption that moral character can be
   predicated only of acts of the will or of the subjective consequences
   of such acts. This principle which precludes the possibility of
   original righteousness in Adam, precludes also the possibility of
   innate, hereditary depravity, commonly called original sin; and also
   the possibility of indwelling sin, and of habits of grace. It is a
   principle therefore which necessarily works an entire change in the
   whole system of Christian doctrine. It is not, however, an ultimate
   principle. It is itself an inference from the primary assumption that
   ability limits obligation; that a man can be neither praised nor
   blamed, neither rewarded nor condemned, except for his own acts and
   self-acquired character, which acts must be within the compass of his
   ability. What is either concreated or innate, inherent or infused, is
   clearly not within the power of the will, and therefore cannot have any
   moral character. As this principle is thus far-reaching it ought to be
   definitively settled.

   Consciousness proves that Dispositions as distinguished from Acts may
   have Moral Character.

   By the mere moral philosopher, and by theologians whose theology is a
   philosophy, it is assumed as an axiom, or intuitive truth, that a man
   is responsible only for what he has full power to do or to avoid.
   Plausible as this principle is, it is, --

   1. Opposed to the testimony of consciousness. It is a fact of
   consciousness that we do attribute moral character to principles which
   precede all voluntary action and which are entirely independent of the
   power of the will. And it is a fact capable of the clearest
   demonstration that such is not only the dictate of our own individual
   consciousness, but also the conviction of all men. If we examine our
   own consciousness as to the judgment which we pass upon ourselves, we
   shall find that we hold ourselves responsible not only for the
   deliberate acts of the will, that is, for acts of deliberate
   self-determination, which suppose both knowledge and volition, but also
   for emotional, impulsive acts, which precede all deliberation; and not
   only for such impulsive acts, but also for the principles,
   dispositions, or immanent states of the mind, by which its acts whether
   impulsive or deliberate, are determined. When a man is convinced of
   sin, it is not so much for specific acts of transgression that his
   conscience condemns him, as for the permanent states of his mind; his
   selfishness, worldliness, and maliciousness; his ingratitude, unbelief,
   and hardness of heart; his want of right affections, of love to God, of
   zeal for the Redeemer, and of benevolence towards men. These are not
   acts. They are not states of mind under the control of the will; and
   yet in the judgment of conscience, which we cannot silence or pervert,
   they constitute our character and are just ground of condemnation. In
   like manner whatever If right dispositions or principles we discover
   within ourselves, whatever there is of love to God, to Christ, or to
   his people; whatever of humility, meekness, forbearance, or of any
   other virtue the testimony of consciousness is, that these
   dispositions, which are neither the acts nor products of the will, as
   far as they exist within us, constitute our character in the sight of
   God and man. Such is not only the testimony of consciousness with
   regard to our judgments of ourselves, but also as to our judgments of
   other men. When we pronounce a man either good or bad, the judgment is
   not founded upon his acts, but upon his character as revealed by his
   acts. The terms good and bad, as applied to men, are not used to
   express the character of particular actions which they perform, but the
   character of the abiding principles, dispositions, or states of mind
   which determine their acts, and give assurance of what they will be in
   future. We may look on a good man and know that there is something in
   him which constitutes his character, and which renders it certain that
   he will not blaspheme, lie, or steal; but, on the contrary, that he
   will endeavour in all things to serve God and do good to men. In like
   manner we may contemplate a wicked man in the bosom of his family, when
   every evil passion is hushed, and when only kindly feelings are in
   exercise, and yet we know him to be wicked. That is, we not only know
   that he has perpetrated wicked actions, but that he is inherently
   wicked; that there is in him an evil nature, or abiding state of the
   mind, which constitutes his real character and determines his acts.
   When we say that a man is a miser, we do not mean simply that he hoards
   money, or grinds the face of the poor, but we mean that he has a
   disposition which in time past has led to such acts and which will
   continue to produce them so long as it rules in his heart. The Pelagian
   doctrine, therefore, that moral character can be predicated only of
   voluntary acts, is contrary to the testimony of consciousness.

   Argument from the General Judgment of Men.

   2. It may, however, be said that our consciousness or moral judgments
   are influenced by our Christian education. It is there-fore important
   to observe, in the second place, that this judgment of our individual
   consciousness is confirmed by the universal judgment of our fellow-men.
   This is plain from the fact that in all known languages there are words
   to distinguish between dispositions, principles, or habits, as
   permanent states of the mind, and voluntary acts. And these
   dispositions are universally recognized as being either good or bad.
   Language is the product of the common consciousness of men. There could
   not be such terms as benevolence, justice, integrity, and fidelity,
   expressing principles which determine acts, and which are not
   themselves acts, if men did not intuitively recognize the fact that
   principles as well as acts may have moral character.

   The Moral Character of Acts determined by the Principles whence they
   flow.

   3. So far from its being true that in the judgment of men the voluntary
   act alone constitutes character, the very opposite is true. The
   character of the act is decided by the nature of the principle by which
   it is determined. If a man gives alms, or worships God from a selfish
   principle, under the control of a disposition to secure the applause of
   men, those acts instead of being good are instinctively recognized as
   evil. Indeed, if this Pelagian or Rationalistic principle were true,
   there could be no such thing as character; not only because individual
   acts have no moral quality except such as is derived from the principle
   whence they flow, but also because character necessarily supposes
   something permanent and controlling. A man without character is a man
   without principles; i.e., in whom there is nothing which gives security
   as to what his acts will be.

   Argument from Scripture.

   4. The Scriptures in this, as in all cases, recognize the validity of
   the intuitive and universal judgments of the mind. They everywhere
   distinguish between principles and acts, and everywhere attribute moral
   character to the former, and to acts only sc far as they proceed from
   principles. This is the doctrine of our Lord when he says, "Either make
   the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and
   his fruit corrupt: for a tree is known by his fruit." (Matt. xii. 33.)
   "A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree
   bring forth good fruit." (Matt. vii. 18.) It is the inward, abiding
   character of the tree that determines the character of the fruit. The
   fruit reveals, but does not constitute, the nature of the tree. So it
   is, he tells us, with the human heart. "How can ye, being evil, speak
   good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
   A good man out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good
   things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil
   things." (Matt. xii. 34, 35.) A good man, therefore, is one who is
   inwardly good: who has a good heart, or nature, something within him
   which being good in itself, produces good acts. And an evil man is one,
   whose heart, that is, the abiding, controlling state of has mind, being
   in itself evil, habitually does evil. It is out of the heart proceed
   evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false
   witness, and blasphemies. These terms include all voluntary acts, not
   only in the sense of deliberate self-determination, but also in the
   sense of spontaneous acts. They moreover include all conscious states
   of the mind. It is, therefore, expressly asserted by our Lord, that
   moral character attaches to what lies deeper than any acts of the will,
   in the widest sense of those words, but also to that which lies lower
   than consciousness. As the greater part of our knowledge is treasured
   up where consciousness does not reach, so the greater part of what
   constitutes our character as good or evil, is lower not only than the
   will but even than consciousness itself. It is not only however by
   direct assertion that this doctrine is taught in the Bible. It is
   constantly assumed, and is involved in some of the most important
   doctrines of the word of God. It is taken for granted in what is taught
   of the moral condition in which men are born into this world. They are
   said to be conceived in sin. They are children of wrath by nature. That
   which is born of the flesh is flesh, i.e., carnal, morally corrupt. The
   Bible also speaks of indwelling sin; of sin as a principle which brings
   forth fruit unto death. It represents regeneration not as an act of the
   soul, but as the production of a new nature, or holy principle, in the
   heart. The denial, therefore, that dispositions or principles as
   distinguished from acts, can have a moral character, subverts some of
   the most plainly revealed doctrines of the sacred Scriptures.

   The Faith of the Church on this Subject.

   5. It is fair on this subject to appeal to the universal faith of the
   Church. Even the Greek Church, which has the lowest form of doctrine of
   any of the great historical Christian communities, teaches that men
   need regeneration as soon as they are born, and that by regeneration a
   change of nature is effected, or a new principle of life is infused
   into the soul. So also the Latin Church, however inconsistently,
   recognizes the truth of the doctrine in question in all her teachings.
   All who die unbaptized, according to Romanists, perish; and by baptism
   not Only the guilt, but also the pollution of sin is removed, and new
   habits of grace are infused into the soul. It is needless to remark
   that the Lutheran and Reformed churches agree in holding this important
   doctrine, that moral character does not belong exclusively to voluntary
   acts, but extends to dispositions, principles, or habits of the mind.
   This is involved in all their authoritative decisions concerning
   original righteousness, original sin, regeneration, and sanctification.

   The Moral Character of Dispositions depends on their Nature and not on
   their Origin.

   The second great principle involved in the Scriptural doctrine on this
   subject is, that the moral character of dispositions or habits depends
   on their nature and not on their origin. There are some who endeavour
   to take a middle ground between the rationalistic and the evangelical
   doctrines. They admit that moral character may be predicated of
   dispositions as distinguished from voluntary acts, but they insist that
   this can only be done when such dispositions have been self-acquired.
   They acknowledge that the frequent repetition of certain acts has a
   tendency to produce an abiding disposition to perform them. This is
   acknowledged to be true not only in regard to the indulgence of sensual
   appetites, but also in regard to purely mental acts. Not only does the
   frequent use of intoxicating liquors produce an inordinate craving for
   them, but the frequent exercise of pride or indulgence of vanity,
   confirms and strengthens a proud and vainglorious spirit, or state of
   mind; which state of mind, when thus produced, it is admitted, goes to
   determine or constitute the man's moral character. But they deny that a
   man can be responsible for any disposition, or state of mind, which is
   not the result of his own voluntary agency. In opposition to this
   doctrine, and in favour of the position that the moral character of
   dispositions, or principles, does not depend upon their origin, that
   whether concreated, innate, infused, or self-acquired they are good or
   bad according to their nature, the arguments are the same in kind as
   those presented under the preceding head.

   1. The first is derived from our consciousness. In our judgments of
   ourselves the question is what we are, and not how we became what we
   know ourselves to be. If conscious that we do not love God as we ought;
   that we are worldly, selfish, proud, or suspicious, it is no relief to
   the consciousness, that such has been our character from the beginning.
   We may know that we were born with these evil dispositions, but they
   are not on that account less evil in the sight of conscience. We groan
   under the burden of hereditary, or of indwelling sin, as deeply and as
   intelligently as under the pressure of our self-acquired evil
   dispositions. So also in our instinctive judgments of other men. if a
   man be addicted to frivolous pursuits, we pronounce him a frivolous
   man, without sopping to inquire whether his disposition be innate,
   derived by inheritance from his ancestors, or whether it was acquired.
   On the contrary, if he manifests from his youth a disposition for the
   acquisition of knowledge, he is an object of respect, no matter whence
   that disposition was derived. The same is true with regard to amiable
   or unamiable dispositions. It cannot be denied that there is a great
   difference in men in this respect. Some are morose, irritable, and
   unsocial in their dispositions, others are directly the reverse. The
   one class is attractive, the other repulsive; the one the object of
   affection; the other, of dislike. The instinctive judgment of the mind
   is the same with regard to dispositions more clearly moral in their
   nature. One man is selfish, another generous; one is malicious, another
   benevolent; one is upright and honourable, another deceitful and mean.
   They may be born with these distinctive traits of character, and such
   traits beyond doubt are in numerous cases innate and often hereditary,
   and yet we are conscious that our judgment regarding them and those to
   whom they belong is entirely independent of the question whether such
   dispositions are natural or acquired. It is admitted that nations as
   well as tribes and families, have their distinctive characteristics,
   and that these characteristics are not only physical and mental, but
   also social and moral. Some tribes are treacherous and cruel. Some are
   mild and confiding. Some are addicted to gain, others to war. Some are
   sensual, some intellectual. We instinctively judge of each according to
   its character; we like or dislike, approve or disapprove, without
   asking ourselves any questions as to the origin of these distinguishing
   characteristics. And if we do raise that question, although we are
   forced to answer it by admitting that these dispositions are innate and
   hereditary, and that they are not self-acquired by the individual whose
   character they constitute, we nevertheless, and none the less, approve
   or condemn them according to their nature. This is the instinctive and
   necessary, and therefore the correct, judgment of the mind.

   This the Common Rule of Judgment.

   2. As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. What
   we find revealed in our own consciousness we find manifested as the
   consciousness of our fellow men. It is the Instinctive or intuitive
   judgment of all men that moral dispositions derive their character from
   their nature, and not from their origin. In the ordinary language of
   men, to say that a man is naturally proud or malicious is not an
   extenuation, but an aggravation. The more deeply these evil principles
   are seated in his nature, and the less they depend upon circumstances
   or voluntary action, the more profound is our abhorrence and the more
   severe is our condemnation. The Irish people have always been
   remarkable for their fidelity; the English for honesty; the Germans for
   truthfulness. These national traits, as revealed in individuals, are
   not the effect of self-discipline. They are innate, hereditary
   dispositions, as obviously as the physical, mental, or emotional
   peculiarities by which one people is distinguished from another. And
   yet by the common judgment of men this fact in no degree detracts from
   the moral character of these dispositions.

   The Testimony of Scripture.

   3. This also is the plain doctrine of the Bible. The Scriptures teach
   that God made man upright; that the angels were created holy, for the
   unholy angels are those which kept not their first estate; that since
   the fall men are born in sin; that by the power of God, and not by the
   power of the will, the heart is changed, and new dispositions are
   implanted in our nature; and yet the Bible always speaks of the sinful
   as sinful and worthy of condemnation, whether, as in the case of Adam,
   that sinfulness was self-acquired, or, as in the case of his posterity,
   it is a hereditary evil. It always speaks of the holy as holy, whether
   so created as were the angels, or made so by the supernatural power of
   the Spirit in regeneration and sanctification. And in so doing the
   Bible, as we have seen, does not contradict the intuitive judgment of
   the human mind, but sanctions and confirms that judgment.

   The Faith of the Church.

   4. It need hardly be added that such also is the faith of the Church
   universal. All Christian churches receive the doctrines of original in
   and regeneration in a form which involves not only the principle that
   dispositions, as distinguished from acts, may have a moral character,
   but also that such character belongs to them whether they be innate,
   acquired, or infused. It is, therefore, most unreasonable to assume the
   ground that a man can be responsible only for his voluntary acts, or
   for their subjective effects, when our own consciousness, the universal
   judgment of men, the word of God, and the Church universal, so
   distinctly assert the contrary. It is a matter of surprise how subtle
   is the poison of the principle which has now been considered. It is not
   only the fundamental principle of Pelagianism, but it is often asserted
   by orthodox theologians who do not carry it out to its legitimate
   results, but who, nevertheless, allow it injuriously to modify their
   views of some of the most important doctrines of the Bible. On the
   assumption that no man can be judged, can be either justified or
   condemned except on to ground of his self-acquired personal character,
   they teach that there can be no immediate imputation of the sin of Adam
   or of the righteousness of Christ; that the only ground of condemnation
   must be our self-acquired sinfulness, and the only ground of
   justification our subjective righteousness; thus subverting two of the
   main pillars of evangelical truth.

   Objections Considered.

   The difficulty on this subject arises in great measure from
   con-founding two distinct things. It is one thing that a creature
   should be treated according to his character; and quite another thing
   to account for his having that character. If a creature is holy he will
   be regarded and treated as holy. If he is sinful, he will be regarded
   and treated as sinful. If God created Adam holy He could not treat him
   as unholy. If He created Satan sinful, He would regard him as sinful;
   and if men are born in sin they cannot be regarded as free from sin.
   The difficulty is not in God's treating his creatures according to
   their true character, but in reconciling with his holiness and justice
   that a sinful character should be acquired without the creature's
   personal agency. If God had created Satan sinful he would be sinful,
   but we should not know how to reconcile it with the character of God
   that he should be so created. And if men are born in sin the difficulty
   is not in their being regarded and treated as sinful, but in their
   being thus born. The Bible teaches us the solution of this difficulty.
   It reveals to us the principle of representation, on the ground of
   which the penalty of Adam's sin has come upon his posterity as the
   reward of Christ's righteousness comes upon his people. In the one case
   the penalty brings subjective sinfulness, and in the other the reward
   brings subjective holiness.

   It is a common objection to the doctrine that holiness can be
   concreated and sinfulness hereditary, that it makes sin and holiness
   substances. There is nothing in the soul, it is said, but its substance
   and its acts. If sin or holiness be predicated of anything but the acts
   of the soul it must be predicated of its substance; and thus we have
   the doctrine of physical holiness and physical depravity. The
   assumption on which this objection rests is not only an arbitrary one,
   but it is obviously erroneous. There are in the soul, (1.) Its
   substance. (2.) Its essential properties or attributes, as reason,
   sensibility, and will, without which it ceases to be a human soul. (3.)
   Its constitutional dispositions, or natural tendencies to exercise
   certain feelings and volitions, such as self-love, the sense of
   justice, the social principle, parental and filial affection. These,
   although not essential to man, are nevertheless found in all men,
   before and after the tall. (4.) The peculiar dispositions of individual
   men, which are accidental, that is, they do not belong to humanity as
   such. They may be present or absent; they may be innate or acquired.
   Such are the taste for music, painting, or poetry; and the skill of the
   artist or the mechanist; such also are covetousness, pride, vanity, and
   the like; and such, too, are the graces of the Spirit, humility,
   meekness, gentleness, faith, love, etc. As the taste for music is
   neither an act nor a substance, so pride is neither the one nor the
   other. Nor is the maternal instinct an act; nor is benevolence or
   covetousness. These are immanent, abiding states of the mind. They
   belong to the man, whether they are active or dormant, whether he is
   awake or asleep. There is something in the sleeping artist which
   renders it certain that he will enjoy and execute what other men can
   neither perceive nor do. And that something is neither the essence of
   his soul nor an act. It is a natural or acquired taste and skill. So
   there is something in the sleeping saint which is neither essence nor
   act, which renders it certain that he will love and serve God. As
   therefore there are in the soul dispositions, principles, habits, and
   tastes which cannot be regarded as mere acts, and yet do not belong to
   the essence of the soul, it is plain that the doctrine of original or
   concreated righteousness is not liable to the objection of making moral
   character a substance.

   Pelagians teach that Man was created Mortal.

   The second distinguishing feature of the Pelagian or Rationalistic
   doctrine as to man's original state, is that man was created mortal. By
   this it is meant to deny that death is the consequence or penalty of
   transgression; and to affirm that Adam was liable to death, and
   certainly would have died in virtue of the original constitution of his
   nature. The arguments urged in support of this doctrine are, (1.) That
   the corporeal organization of Adam was not adapted to last forever. It
   was in its very nature perishable. It required to be constantly
   refreshed by sleep and renewed by food, and would by a natural and
   inevitable process have grown old and decayed. (2.) That all other
   animals living on the earth evince in their constitution and structure
   that they were not intended by their Creator to live on indefinitely.
   They were created male and female, designed to propagate their race.
   This proves that a succession of individuals, and not the continued
   existence of the same individuals, was the plan of the Creator. As this
   is true of man as well as of other animals, it is evident, they say,
   that man also was from the beginning, and irrespective of sin, destined
   to die. (3.) An argument is drawn from what the Apostle teaches in 1
   Cor. xv. 42-50. It is there said that the first man is of the earth
   earthy; that he had a natural body (a soma psuchikon) as opposed to a
   spiritual body (the soma pneumatikon); that the former is not adapted
   to immortality, that flesh and blood, i.e., the soma psuchikon, such as
   Adam had when created, cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven. From this
   account it is inferred that Adam was not created for immortality, but
   was originally invested with a body from its nature destined to decay.

   Answer to the Pelagian Arguments.

   With regard to this subject it is to be remarked that there are two
   distinct points to be considered. First, whether Adam would have died
   had he not sinned; and second, whether his body as originally formed
   was adapted to an immortal state of existence. As to the former there
   can be no doubt. It is expressly asserted in Scripture that death is
   the wages of sin. In the threatening, "In the day that thou eatest
   thereof thou shalt surely die," it is plainly implied that if he did
   not eat he should not die. It is clear therefore from the Scriptures
   that death is the penal consequence of sin and would not have been
   inflicted, had not our first parents transgressed. The second point is
   much less clear, and less important. According to one view adopted by
   many of the fathers, Adam was to pass his probation in the earthly
   paradise, and if obedient, was to be translated to the heavenly
   paradise, of which the earthly was the type. According to Luther, the
   effect of the fruit of the tree of life of which our first parents
   would have been permitted to eat had they not sinned, would have been
   to preserve their bodies in perpetual youth. According to others, the
   body of Adam and the bodies of his posterity, had he maintained his
   integrity, would have undergone a change analogous to that which, the
   Apostle teaches us, awaits those who shall be alive at the second
   coming of Christ. They shall not die, but they all shall be changed;
   the corruptible shall put on incorruption, and the mortal shall put on
   immortality. Two things are certain, first, that if Adam had not sinned
   he would not have died; and secondly, that if the Apostle, when he says
   we have borne the image of the earthly, means that our present bodies
   are like the body of Adam as originally constituted, then his body no
   less than ours, required to be changed to fit it for immortality.

CHAPTER VI.

  COVENANT OF WORKS.

   God having created man after his own image in knowledge, righteousness,
   and holiness, entered into a covenant of life with him, upon condition
   of perfect obedience, forbidding him to eat of the tree of knowledge of
   good and evil upon the pain of death.

   According to this statement, (1.) God entered into a covenant with
   Adam. (2.) The promise annexed to that covenant was life. (3.) The
   condition was perfect obedience. (4.) Its penalty was death.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. God entered into Covenant with Adam.

   This statement does not rest upon any express declaration of the
   Scriptures. It is, however, a concise and correct mode of asserting a
   plain Scriptural fact, namely, that God made to Adam a promise
   suspended upon a condition, and attached to disobedience a certain
   penalty. This is what in Scriptural language is meant by a covenant,
   and this is all that is meant by the term as here used. Although the
   word covenant is not used in Genesis, and does not elsewhere, in any
   clear passage, occur in reference to the transaction there recorded,
   yet inasmuch as the plan of salvation is constantly represented as a
   New Covenant, new, not merely in antithesis to that made at Sinai, but
   new in reference to all legal covenants whatever, it is plain that the
   Bible does represent the arrangement made with Adam as a truly federal
   transaction. The Scriptures know nothing of any other than two methods
   of attaining eternal life: the one that which demands perfect
   obedience, and the other that which demands faith. If the latter is
   called a covenant, the former is declared to be of the same nature. It
   is of great importance that the Scriptural form of presenting truth
   should be retained. Rationalism was introduced into the Church under
   the guise of a philosophical statement of the truths of the Bible free
   from the mere outward form in which the sacred writers, trained in
   Judaism, had presented them. On this ground the federal system, as it
   was called, was discarded. On the same ground the prophetic, priestly,
   and kingly offices of Christ were pronounced a cumbrous and
   unsatisfactory form under which to set forth his work as our Redeemer.
   And then the sacrificial character of his death, and all idea of
   atonement were rejected as mere Jewish drapery. Thus, by the theory of
   accommodation, every distinctive doctrine of the Scriptures was set
   aside, and Christianity reduced to Deism. It is, therefore, far more
   than a mere matter of method that is involved in adhering to the
   Scriptural form of presenting Scriptural truths.

   God then did enter into a covenant with Adam. That covenant is
   sometimes called a covenant of life, because life was promised as the
   reward of obedience. Sometimes it is called the covenant of works,
   because works were the condition on which that promise was suspended,
   and because it is thus distinguished from the new covenant which
   promises life on condition of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. The Promise.

   The reward promised to Adam on condition of his obedience, was life.
   (1.) This is involved in the threatening: "In the day that thou eatest
   thereof, thou shalt surely die." It is plain that this involved the
   assurance that he should not die, if he did not eat. (2.) This is
   confirmed by innumerable passages and by the general drift of
   Scripture, in which it is so plainly and so variously taught, that life
   was, by the ordinance of God, connected with obedience. "This do and
   thou shalt live." "The man that doeth them shall live by them." This is
   the uniform mode in which the Bible speaks of that law or covenant
   under which man by the constitution of his nature and by the ordinance
   of God, was placed. (3.) As the Scriptures everywhere present God as a
   judge or moral ruler, it follows of necessity from that representation,
   that his rational creatures will be dealt with according to the
   principles of justice. If there be no transgression there will be no
   punishment. And those who continue holy thereby continue in the favour
   and fellowship of him whose favour is life, and whose loving kindness
   is better than life. (4.) And finally, holiness, or as the Apostle
   expresses it, to be spiritually minded, is life. There can therefore be
   no doubt, that had Adam continued in holiness, he would have enjoyed
   that life which flows from the favour of God.

   The life thus promised included the happy, holy, and immortal existence
   of the soul and body. This is plain. (1.) Because time life promised
   was that suited to the being to whom the promise was made. But the life
   suited to man as a moral and intelligent being, composed of soul and
   body, includes tile happy, holy, and immortal existence of his whole
   nature. (2.) The life of which the Scriptures everywhere speak as
   connected with obedience, is that which, as just stated, flows from the
   favour and fellowship of God, and includes glory, honour, and
   immortality, as the Apostle teaches us in Romans ii. 7. (3.) The life
   secured by Christ for his people was the life forfeited by sin. But the
   life which the believer derives from Christ is spiritual and eternal
   life, the exaltation and complete blessedness of his whole nature, both
   soul and body.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Condition of the Covenant.

   The condition of the covenant made with Adam is said in this symbols of
   our church to be perfect obedience. That that statement is correct may
   be inferred (1.) From the nature of the case and from the general
   principles clearly revealed in the word of God. Such is the nature of
   God, and such the relation which He sustains to his moral creatures,
   that sin, the transgression of the divine law, must involve the
   destruction of the fellowship between man and his Creator, and the
   manifestation of the divine displeasure. The Apostle therefore says,
   that he who offends in one point, who breaks one precept of the law of
   God, is guilty of the whole. (2.) It is everywhere assumed in the
   Bible, that the condition of acceptance under the law is perfect
   obedience. "Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things
   written in the book of the law to do them." This is not a peculiarity
   of the Mosaic economy, but a declaration of a principle which applies
   to all divine laws. (3.) The whole argument of the Apostle in his
   epistles to the Romans and to the Galatians, is founded on the
   assumption that the law demands perfect obedience. If that be not
   granted, his whole argument falls to the ground.

   The specific command to Adam not to eat of a certain tree, was
   therefore not the only command he was required to obey. It was given
   simply to be the outward and visible test to determine whether he was
   willing to obey God in all things. Created holy, with all his
   affections pure, there was the more reason that the test of his
   obedience should be an outward and positive command; something wrong
   simply because it was forbidden, and not evil in its own nature. It
   would thus be seen that Adam obeyed for the sake of obeying. His
   obedience was more directly to God, and not to his own reason.

   The question whether perpetual, as well as perfect obedience was the
   condition of the covenant made with Adam, is probably to be answered in
   the negative. It seems to be reasonable in itself and plainly implied
   in the Scriptures that all rational creatures have a definite period of
   probation. If faithful during that period they are confirmed in their
   integrity, and no longer exposed to the danger of apostasy. Thus we
   read of the angels who kept not their first estate, and of those who
   did. Those who remained faithful have continued in holiness and in the
   favour of God. It is therefore to be inferred that had Adam continued
   obedient during the period allotted to his probation, neither he nor
   any of his posterity would have been ever exposed to the danger of
   sinning.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. The Penalty.

   The penalty attached to the covenant is expressed by the comprehensive
   term death. "In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely
   die." That this does not refer to the mere dissolution of the body, is
   plain. (1.) Because the word death, as used in Scripture in reference
   to the consequences of transgression, includes all penal evil. The
   wages of sin is death. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. Any and
   every form of evil, therefore, which is inflicted as the punishment of
   sin, is comprehended under the word death (2.) The death threatened was
   the opposite of the life promised But the life promised, as we have
   seen, includes all that is involved in the happy, holy, and immortal
   existence of the soul and body; and therefore death must include not
   only all the miseries of this life and the dissolution of the body, but
   also all that is meant by spiritual and eternal death. (3.) God is the
   life of the soul. His favour and fellowship with him, are essential to
   its holiness and happiness. If his favour be forfeited, the inevitable
   consequences are the death of the soul, i.e., its loss of spiritual
   life, and unending sinfulness and misery. (4.) The nature of the
   penalty threatened is .earned from its infliction. The consequences of
   Adam's sin were the loss of the image and favour of God and all the
   evils which flowed from that loss. (5.) Finally, the death which was
   incurred by the sin of our first parents, is that from which we are
   redeemed by Christ. Christ, however, does not merely deliver the body
   from the grave, he saves the soul from spiritual and eternal death; and
   therefore spiritual and eternal death, together with the dissolution of
   the body and all the miseries of this life, were included in the
   penalty originally attached to the covenant of works. In the day in
   which Adam ate the forbidden fruit he did die. The penalty threatened
   was not a momentary infliction but permanent subjection to all the
   evils which flow from the righteous displeasure of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 5. The Parties to the Covenant of Works.

   It lies in the nature of a covenant that there must be two of more
   parties. A covenant is not of one. The parties to the original covenant
   were God and Adam. Adam, however, acted not in his individual capacity
   but as the head and representative of his whole race. This is plain.
   (1.) Because everything said to him had as much reference to his
   posterity as to Adam himself. Everything granted to him was granted to
   them. Everything promised to him was promised to them. And everything
   threatened against him, in case of transgression, was threatened
   against them. God did not give the earth to Adam for him alone, but as
   the heritage of his race. The dominion over the lower animals with
   which he was invested belonged equally to his descendants. The promise
   of life embraced them as well as him; and the threatening of death
   concerned them as well as him. (2.) In the second place, it is an
   outstanding undeniable fact, that the penalty which Adam incurred has
   fallen upon his whole race. The earth is cursed to them as it was to
   him. They must earn their bread by the sweat of their brows. The pains
   of childbirth are the common heritage of all the daughters of Eve. All
   men are subject to disease and death. All are born in sin, destitute of
   the moral image of God. There is not an evil consequent on the sin of
   Adam which does not affect his race as much as it affected him. (3.)
   Not only did the ancient Jews infer the representative character of
   Adam from the record given in Genesis, but the inspired writers of the
   New Testament give this doctrine the sanction of divine authority. In
   Adam, says the Apostle, all died. The sentence of condemnation, he
   teaches us, passed on all men for one offence. By the offence of one
   all were made sinners. (4.) This great fact is made the ground on which
   the whole plan of redemption is founded. As we full in Adam, we are
   saved in Christ. To deny the principle in the one case, is to deny it
   in the other; for the two are inseparably united in the representations
   of Scripture. (5.) The principle involved in the headship of Adam
   underlies all the religious institutions ever ordained by God for men;
   all his providential dealings with our race; and even the distributions
   of the saving influences of his Spirit. It is therefore one of the
   fundamental principles both of natural and of revealed religion. (6.)
   What is thus clearly revealed in the word and providence of God, finds
   a response in the very constitution of our nature. All men are led as
   it were instinctively to recognize the validity of this principle of
   representation. Rulers represent their people; parents their children,
   guardians their wards. All these considerations are in place here, when
   the nature of the covenant of works, and the parties to that covenant
   are under discussion, although of course they must come up again to be
   more fully examined, when we have to speak of the effects of Adam's sin
   upon his posterity. Men may dispute as to the grounds of the headship
   of Adam, but the fact itself can hardly be questioned by those who
   recognize the authority of the Scriptures. It has therefore entered
   into the faith of all Christian churches, and is more or less clearly
   presented in all their authorized symbols.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 6. Perpetuity of the Covenant of Works.

   If Adam acted not only for himself but also for his posterity, that
   fact determines the question, Whether the covenant of works be still in
   force. In the obvious sense of the terms, to say that men are still
   under that covenant, is to say that they are still on probation; that
   the race did not fall when Adam fell. But if Adam acted as the head of
   the whole race, then all men stood their probation in him, and fell
   with him in his first transgression. The Scriptures, therefore, teach
   that we come into the world under condemnation. We are by nature, i.e.,
   as we were born, the children of wrath. This fact is assumed in all the
   provisions of the gospel and in all the institutions of our religion.
   Children are required to be baptized for the remission of sin. But
   while the Pelagian doctrine is to be rejected, which teaches that each
   man comes into the world free from sin and free from condemnation, and
   stands his probation in his own person, it is nevertheless true that
   where there is no sin there is no condemnation. Hence our Lord said to
   the young man, "This do and thou shalt live." And hence the Apostle in
   the second chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, says that God will
   reward every man according to his works. To those who are good, He will
   give eternal life; to those who are evil, indignation and wrath. This
   is only saying that the eternal principles of justice are still in
   force. If any man can present himself before the bar of God and prove
   that he is free from sin, either imputed or personal, either original
   or actual, he will not be condemned. But the fact is that the whole
   world lies in wickedness. Man is an apostate race. Men are all involved
   in the penal and natural consequences of Adam's transgression. They
   stood their probation in him, and do not stand each man for himself.

CHAPTER VII.

  THE FALL.

   The Scriptural Account.

   The Scriptural account of the Fall, as given in the look of Genesis,
   is, That God placed Adam in "the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep
   it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
   garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good
   and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest
   thereof thou shalt surely die Now the serpent was more subtile than any
   beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the
   woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the
   garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
   the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the
   midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither
   shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye
   shall not surely die. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof,
   then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods (as God),
   knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good
   for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
   desired to make wise; she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and
   gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat."

   The consequences of this act of disobedience were, (1.) An immediate
   sense of guilt and shame. (2.) The desire and effort to hide themselves
   from the face of God. (3.) The denunciation and immediate execution of
   the righteous judgment of God upon the serpent, upon the man, and upon
   the woman. (4.) Expulsion from the garden of Eden and prohibition of
   access to the Tree of Life.

   That this account of the probation and fall of man is neither an
   allegory nor a myth, but a true history, is evident, (1.) From internal
   evidence. When contrasted with the mythological accounts of the
   creation and origin of man as found in the records of early heathen
   nations, whether Oriental, Grecian, or Etruscan, the difference is at
   once apparent. The latter are evidently the product of rude
   speculation, the Scriptural account is simple, intelligible, and
   pregnant with the highest truths. (2.) From the fact not only that it
   is presented as a matter of history in a book which all Christians
   recognize as of divine authority, but that it also forms an integral
   part of the book of Genesis, which is confessedly historical. It is the
   first of the ten divisions into which that book, in its internal
   structure, is divided, and belongs essentially to its plan. (3.) It is
   no only an essential part of the book of Genesis, but it is also an
   essential part of Scriptural history as a whole, which treats of the
   origin, apostasy, and development of the human race, as connected with
   the plan of redemption. (4.) We accordingly find that both in the Old
   and New Testaments the facts here recorded are assumed, and referred to
   as matters of history. (5.) And finally, these facts underlie the whole
   doctrinal system revealed in the Scriptures Our Lord and his Apostles
   refer to them not only as true, but as furnishing the ground of all the
   subsequent revelations and dispensations of God. It was because Satan
   tempted man and led him into disobedience that he became the head of
   the kingdom of darkness; whose power Christ came to destroy, and from
   whose dominion he redeemed his people. It was because we died in Adam
   that we must be made alive in Christ. So that the Church universal has
   felt bound to receive the record of Adam's temptation and fall as a
   true historical account.

   There are many who, while admitting the historical character of this
   account, still regard it as in a great measure figurative. They
   understand it as a statement not so much of external events as of an
   internal process of thought; explaining how it was that Eve came to eat
   of the forbidden tree and to induce Adam to join in her transgression.
   They do not admit that a serpent was the tempter, or that he spoke to
   Eve, but assume that she was attracted by the beauty of the forbidden
   object, and began to question in her own mind either the fact or the
   justice of the prohibition. But there is not only no valid reason for
   departing from the literal interpretation of the passage, but that
   interpretation is supported by the authority of time writers of the New
   Testament. They recognize the serpent as present, and as the agent in
   the temptation and fall of our first parents.

   The Tree of Life.

   According to the sacred narrative, there were two trees standing side
   by side in the garden of Eden which had a peculiar symbolical or
   sacramental character. The one was called the Tree of Life, the other
   the Tree of Knowledge. The former was the symbol of life, and its fruit
   was not to be eaten except on the condition of man's retaining his
   integrity. Whether the fruit of that tree had inherent virtue to impart
   life, i.e., to sustain the body of man in its youthful vigour and
   beauty, or gradually to refine it until it should become like to what
   the glorified body of Christ now is, or whether the connection between
   eating its fruit and immortality was simply conventional and
   sacramental, we cannot determine. It is enough to know that partaking
   of that tree secured in some way the enjoyment of eternal life. That
   this was the fact is plain, not only because man after his
   transgression was driven from paradise "lest he put forth his hand, and
   take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever" (Gen. iii.
   22); but also because Christ is called the Tree of Life. He is so
   called because that tree was typical of Him, and the analogy is, that
   as He is the source of life, spiritual and eternal, to his people, so
   that tree was appointed to be the source of life to the first parents
   of our race and to all their descendants, had they not rebelled against
   God. Our Lord promises (Rev. ii. 7) to give to them who overcome, to
   eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
   In heaven there is said (Rev. xxii. 2) to be a tree of life, whose
   leaves are for the healing of the nations; and again (verse 14),
   "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to
   the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."
   The symbolical and typical import of the tree of life is thus clear. As
   paradise was the type of heaven, so the tree which would have secured
   immortal life to obedient Adam in that terrestrial paradise is the type
   of Him who is the source of spiritual and eternal life to his people in
   the paradise above.

   The Tree of Knowledge.

   The nature and significancy of the tree of knowledge of good and evil
   are not so clear. By the tree of knowledge, indeed, it is altogether
   probable, we are to understand a tree the fruit of which would impart
   knowledge. This may be inferred, (1.) From analogy As the tree of life
   sustained or imparted life, so the tree of knowledge was appointed to
   communicate knowledge. (2.) From the suggestion of the tempter, who
   assured the woman that eating of the fruit of that tree would open her
   eyes. (3.) She so understood the designation, for she regarded the tree
   as desirable to render wise. ( 4.) The effect of eating of the
   forbidden fruit was that the eyes of the transgressors were opened. And
   (5.), in the twenty-second verse, we read that God said of fallen man,
   "Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil." Unless
   this be understood ironically, which in this connection seems
   altogether unnatural, it must mean that Adam had, by eating the
   forbidden fruit, attained a knowledge in some respects analogous to the
   knowledge of God, however different in its nature and effects. This,
   therefore, seems plain from the whole narrative, that the tree of
   knowledge was a tree the fruit of which imparted knowledge. Not indeed
   from any inherent virtue, it may be, in the tree itself, but from the
   appointment of God. It is not necessary to suppose that the forbidden
   fruit had the power to corrupt either the corporeal or moral nature of
   man, and thus produce the experimental knowledge of good and evil. All
   that the text requires is that knowledge followed the eating of that
   fruit.

   The words "good and evil" in this connection admit of three
   interpretations. In the first place, in Scripture, the ignorance of
   infancy is sometimes expressed by saying that a child cannot tell its
   right hand from its left; sometimes by saying, that he cannot discern
   between the evil and the good. Thus in Deut. i. 39, it is said, "Your
   children . . . had no knowledge between good and evil," and in Is. vii.
   16, "Before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the
   good." On the other hand maturity, whether in intellectual or spiritual
   knowledge, is expressed by saying that one has power to distinguish
   between good and evil. Thus the perfect or mature believer has his
   "senses exercised to discern both good and evil," Heb. v. 14. Agreeably
   to the analogy of these passages, the tree of knowledge of good and
   evil, is simply the tree of knowledge. The one expression is fully
   equivalent to the other. This interpretation relieves the passage of
   many difficulties. It is sustained also by the language of Eve, who
   said it was a tree desirable to make wise. Before he sinned, Adam had
   the ignorance of happiness and innocence. The happy do not know what
   sorrow is, and the innocent do not know what sin is. When he ate of the
   forbidden tree he attained a knowledge he never had before. But, in the
   second place the words, "good and evil" may be taken in a moral sense.
   If this is so, the meaning cannot be that the fruit of that tree was to
   lead Adam to a knowledge of the distinction between right and wrong,
   and thus awaken his dormant moral nature. That knowledge he must have
   had from the beginning, and was a good not to be prohibited. Some
   suppose that by the knowledge of good and evil is meant the knowledge
   of what things are good and what are evil. This is a point determined
   for us by the revealed will of God. Whatever He commands is good, and
   what. ever He forbids is evil. The question is determined by authority.
   We cannot answer it from the nature of things, nor by considerations of
   expediency. Instead of submitting to the authority or Jew of God as the
   rule of duty, it is assumed that Adam aspired to know for himself what
   was good and what evil. It was emancipation from the trammels of
   authority that he sought. To this however, it may be objected that this
   was not the knowledge which he attained by eating the forbidden fruit.
   He was told that his eyed should be opened, that he should know good
   and evil; and his eyes were opened; the promised knowledge was
   attained. That knowledge, however, was not the ability to determine for
   himself between right and wrong. He had less of that knowledge after
   than before his fall. In the third place, "good and evil" may be taken
   in a physical sense, for happiness and misery. Eating of the forbidden
   tree was to determine the question of Adam's being happy or miserable.
   It led to an experimental knowledge of the difference. God knew the
   nature and effects of evil from his omniscience. Adam could know them
   only from experience, and that knowledge he gained when he sinned.
   Whichever of these particular interpretations be adopted, they all are
   included in the general statement that the tree of knowledge gave Adam
   a knowledge which he had not before; he came to an experimental
   knowledge of the difference between good and evil.

   The Serpent.

   It may be inferred from the narrative, that Adam was present with Eve
   during the temptation. In Gen. iii. 6, it is said the woman gave of the
   fruit of the tree to her husband who was "with her." He was therefore a
   party to the whole transaction. When it is said that a serpent
   addressed Eve, we are bound to take the words in their literal sense.
   The serpent is neither a figurative designation of Satan; nor did Satan
   assume the form of a serpent. A real serpent was the agent of the
   temptation, as it is plain from what is said of the natural
   characteristics of the serpent in the first verse of the chapter, and
   from the curse pronounced upon the animal itself, and the enmity which
   was declared should subsist between it and man through all time. But
   that Satan was the real tempter, and that he used the serpent merely as
   his organ or instrument, is evident, -- (1.) From the nature of the
   transaction. What is here attributed to the serpent far transcends the
   power of any irrational creature. The serpent maybe the most subtile of
   all the beasts of the field, but he has not the high intellectual
   faculties which the tempter here displays. (2.) In the New Testament it
   is both directly asserted, and in various forms assumed, that Satan
   seduced our first parents into sin. In Rev. xii. 9, it is said, "The
   great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and
   Satan, which deceiveth the whole world." And in xx. 2, "He laid hold on
   the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan." In 2 Cor.
   xi. 3, Paul says, "I fear lest . . . . as the serpent beguiled Eve
   through his subtilty, so also your minds should be corrupted from the
   simplicity that is in Christ." But that by the serpent he understood
   Satan, is plain from v. 14, where he speaks of Satan as the great
   deceiver; and what is said in Rom. xvi. 20, "The God of peace shall
   bruise Satan under your feet," is in obvious allusion to Gen. iii. 15.
   In John viii. 44, our Lord calls the devil a murderer from the
   beginning, and the father of lies, because through him sin and death
   were introduced into the world. Such was also the faith of the Jewish
   Church. In the Book of Wisdom ii. 24, it is said, that "Through the
   envy of Satan came death into the world." In the later Jewish writings
   this idea is often presented. [133]

   As to the serpent's speaking there is no more difficulty than in the
   utterance of articulate words from Sinai, or the sounding of a voice
   from heaven at the baptism of our Lord, or in the speaking of Balaam's
   ass. The words uttered were produced by the power of Satan, and of such
   effects produced by angelic beings good and evil there are numerous
   instances in the Bible.

   The Nature of the Temptation.

   The first address of the tempter to Eve was designed to awaken distrust
   in the goodness of God, and doubt as to the truth of the prohibition.
   "Hath God indeed said, ye shall net eat of every tree of the garden?"
   or, rather, as the words probably mean, "Has God said, ye shall not eat
   of any tree of the garden?" The next address was a direct assault upon
   her faith. "Ye shall not surely die;" but on the contrary, become as
   God himself in knowledge. To this temptation she yielded, and Adam
   joined in the transgression. From this account it appears that doubt,
   unbelief, and pride were the principles which led to this fatal act of
   disobedience. Eve doubted God's goodness; she disbelieved his
   threatening; she aspired after forbidden knowledge.

   The Effects of the First Sin.

   The effects of sin upon our first parents themselves, were, (1.) Shame,
   a sense of degradation and pollution. (2.) Dread of the displeasure of
   God; or, a sense of guilt, and the consequent desire to hide from his
   presence. These effects were unavoidable. They prove the loss not only
   of innocence but of original righteousness, and with it of the favour
   and fellowship of God. The state therefore to which Adam was reduced by
   his disobedience, so far as his subjective condition is concerned, was
   analogous to that of the fallen angels. He was entirely and absolutely
   ruined. It is said that no man becomes thoroughly depraved by one
   transgression. In one sense this is true. But one transgression by
   incurring the wrath and curse of God and the loss of fellowship with
   Him, as effectually involves spiritual death, as one perforation of the
   heart causes the death of the body; or one puncture of the eyes
   involves us in perpetual darkness. The other forms of evil consequent
   on Adam's disobedience were merely subordinate. They were but the
   expressions of the divine displeasure and the consequences of that
   spiritual death in which the threatened penalty essentially consisted.

CHAPTER VIII.

  SIN.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Nature of the Question to be Considered.

   Our first parents, we are told, fell from the estate wherein they were
   created by sinning against God. This presents the question, which is
   one of the most difficult and comprehensive whether in morals or in
   theology, What is sin? The existence of sin is an undeniable fact. No
   man can examine his own nature, or observe the conduct of his fellow
   men, without having the conviction forced upon him that there is such
   an evil as sin. This is not a purely moral or theological question. It
   falls also within the province of philosophy, which assumes to explain
   all the phenomena of human nature as well as of the external world.
   Philosophers, therefore, of every age and of every school, have been
   compelled to discuss this subject. The philosophical theories, as to
   the nature of sin, are as numerous as the different schools of
   philosophy. This great question comes under the consideration of the
   Christian theologian with certain limitations. He assumes the existence
   of a personal God of infinite perfection, and he assumes the
   responsibility of man. No theory of the nature or origin of sin which
   conflicts with either of these fundamental principles, can for him be
   true. Before entering upon the statement of any of the theories which
   have been more or less extensively adopted, it is important to
   ascertain the data on which the answer to the question, What is sin? is
   to be determined; or the premises from which that answer is to be
   deduced. These are simply the declarations of the word of God and the
   facts of our own moral nature. Ignoring either wholly or in part these
   two sources of knowledge, many philosophers and even theologians, have
   recourse to the reason, or rather to the speculative understanding, for
   the decision of the question. This method, however, is unreasonable,
   and is sure to lead to false conclusions. In determining the nature of
   sensation we cannot adopt the à priori method, and argue from the
   nature of a thing how it ought to affect our organs of sense. We must
   assume the facts of sense consciousness as the phenomena to be
   explained. We cannot say that such is the nature of light that it
   cannot cause the phenomena of vision; or of acids that they cannot
   affect the organs of taste; or that our sensations are deceptive which
   lead ns to refer them to such causes. Nor can we determine
   philosophically the principles of beauty, and decide what men must
   admire and what they must dislike. All that philosophy can do is take
   the facts of our æsthetic nature and from them deduce the laws or
   principles of beauty. In like manner the facts of our moral
   consciousness must he assumed as true and trustworthy. We cannot argue
   that such is the constitution of the universe, such the relation of the
   individual to the whole, that there can be no such thing as sin,
   nothing for which we should feel remorse or on the ground of which we
   should apprehend punishment. Nor can we adopt such a theory of moral
   obligation as forbids our recognizing as sin what the conscience forces
   us to condemn. Any man who should adopt such a theory of the sublime
   and beautiful, as would demonstrate that Niagara and the Alps were not
   sublime objects in nature; or that the Madonna del Sisti or the
   Transfiguration by Raphael are not beautiful productions of art; or
   that the "Iliad" and "Paradise Lost" are not worthy of the admiration
   of ages, would lose his labour. And thus the man who ignores the facts
   of our moral nature in his theories of the origin and nature of sin,
   must labour in vain. This, however, is constantly done. It will be
   found that all the anti-theistic and antichristian views of this
   subject are purely arbitrary speculations, at war with the simplest and
   most undeniable facts of consciousness.

   With regard to the nature of sin, it is to be remarked that there are
   two aspects in which the subject may be viewed. The first concerns its
   metaphysical, and the second, its moral nature. What is that which we
   call sin? Is it a substance, a principle, or an act? Is it privation,
   negation, or defect? Is it antagonism between mind and matter, between
   soul and body? Is it selfishness as a feeling, or as a purpose? All
   these are questions which concern the metaphysical nature of sin, what
   it is as a res in natura. Whereas such questions as the following
   concern rather its moral nature, namely, What gives sin its character
   as moral evil? How does it stand related to law? What law is it to
   which sin is related? What is its relation to the justice of God? What
   is its relation to his holiness? What has, or can have the relation of
   sin to law; is it acts of deliberation only, or also impulsive acts and
   affections, emotions and principles, or dispositions? It is obvious
   that these are moral, rather than metaphysical questions. In some of
   the theories on the nature of sin it is viewed exclusively in one of
   these aspects; and in some, exclusively in the other; and in some both
   views are combined. It is not proposed to attempt to keep these views
   distinct as both are of necessity involved in the theological
   discussion of the subject.

   § 2. Philosophical Theories of the Nature of Sin.

   The first theory in the order of time, apart from the primitive
   doctrine of the Bible, as to the origin and nature of sin, is the
   dualistic, or that which assumes the existence of an eternal principle
   of evil. This doctrine was widely disseminated throughout the East, and
   in different forms was partially introduced into the Christian church.
   According to the doctrine of the Parsis this original principle was a
   personal being; according to the Gnostics, Marcionites, and Manicheans,
   it was a substance, an eternal hule or matter. Augustine says, "Iste
   [Manes] duo principia inter se diversa atque adversa, eademque æterna
   et coæterna, hoc est semper fuisse, composuit: duasque naturas atque
   substantias, boni scilicet et mali, sequens alios antiquos hæreticos,
   opinatus est." [134] These two principles are in perpetual conflict. In
   the actual world they are intermingled. Both enter into the
   constitution of man. He has a spirit (pneuma) derived from the kingdom
   of light; and a body with its animal life (soma and psuche) derived
   from the kingdom of darkness. Sin is thus a physical evil; the
   defilement of the spirit by its union with a material body; and is to
   be overcome by physical means, i.e., by means adapted to destroy the
   influence of the body on the soul. Hence the efficacy of abstinence and
   austerities. [135]

   This theory obviously is: (1.) Inconsistent with Theism, in making
   something out of God eternal and independent of his will. He ceases to
   be an infinite Being and an absolute sovereign. He is everywhere
   limited by a coeternal power which He cannot control. (2.) It destroys
   the nature of sin as a moral evil, in making it a substance, and in
   representing it as inseparable from the nature of man as a creature
   composed of matter and spirit. (3.) It destroys, of course, human
   responsibility, not only by making moral evil necessary from the very
   constitution of man, and by referring its origin to a source, eternal
   and necessarily operative; but by making it a substance, which destroys
   its nature as This theory is so thoroughly anti-theistic and
   anti-Christian, that although long prevailing as a heresy in the
   Church, it never entered into any living connection with Christian
   doctrine.

   Sin regarded as a mere Limitation of Being.

   The second anti-Christian theory of the nature of sin is that which
   makes it a mere negation, or limitation of being. Being, substance, is
   good. "Omne quod est, in quantum aliqua substantia est, et bonum
   [est]," [136] says Augustine. God as the absolute substance is the
   supreme good. The absolute evil would be nothing. Therefore the less of
   being, the less of good; and all negation, or limitation of being is
   evil, or sin. Spinoza [137] says, "Quo magis unusquisque, suum utile
   quærere, hoc est suum esse conservare conatur et potest, eo magis
   virtute præditus est; contra quatenus unusquisque suum utile, hoc est
   suum esse conservare negligit, eatenus est impotens." In his
   demonstration of that proposition he makes power and goodness
   identical, potentia and virtus are the same. Hence the want of virtue,
   or evil, is weakness, or limitation of being. Still more distinctly,
   does Professor Baur of Tübingen, present this view of the nature of
   sin. [138] He says, "Evil is what is finite; for the finite is
   negative; the negation of the infinite. Everything finite is relatively
   nothing; a negativity which, in the constant distinction of plus and
   minus of reality, appears in different forms." Again, "If freedom from
   sin is the removal of all limitation, so is it clear, that only an
   endless series of gradations can bring us to the point where sin is
   reduced to a vanishing minimum. If this minimum should entirely
   disappear, then the being, thus entirely free from sin, becomes one
   with God, for God only is absolutely sinless. But if other beings than
   God are to exist, there must be in them, so far as they are not
   infinite as God is, for that very reason, a minimum of evil." The
   distinction between good and evil, is, therefore, merely quantitative,
   a distinction between more or less. Being is good, the limitation of
   being is evil. This idea of sin lies in the nature of the Pantheistic
   system. If God be the only substance, the only life, the only agent,
   then He is the sum of all that is, or, rather all that is, is the
   manifestation of God; the form of his existence. Consequently, if evil
   exists it is as much a form of the existence of God as good; and can be
   nothing but imperfect development, or mere limitation of being.

   This theory, it is clear, (1.) ignores the difference between the malum
   metaphysicum and the malum morale, between the physical and the moral
   between a stunted tree and a wicked man. Instead of explaining sin, it
   denies its existence. It is therefore in conflict with the clearest of
   intuitive truths and the strongest of our instinctive convictions.
   There is nothing of which we are more sure, not even our own existence,
   than we are of the difference between sin and limitation of being,
   between what is morally wrong and what is a mere negation of power.
   (2.) This theory assumes the truth of the pantheistic system of the
   universe, and therefore is at variance with our religious nature, which
   demands and assumes the existence of a personal God. (3.) In destroying
   the idea of sin, it destroys all sense of moral obligation, and gives
   unrestrained liberty to all evil passions. It not only teaches that all
   that is, is right; that everything that exists or happens has a right
   to be, but that the only standard of virtue is power. The strongest is
   the best. As Cousin says, the victor is always right; the victim is
   always wrong. The conqueror is always more moral than the vanquished.
   Virtue and prosperity, misfortune and vice, he says, are in necessary
   harmony. Feebleness is a vice (i.e., sin), and therefore is always
   punished and beaten. [139] This principle is adopted by all such
   writers as Carlyle, who in their hero worship, make the strong always
   the good; and represent the murderer, the pirate, and the persecutor,
   as always more moral and more worthy of admiration than their victims.
   Satan is far more worthy of homage than the best of men, as in him
   there is more of being and power, and he is the seducer of angels and
   the destroyer of men. A more thoroughly demoniacal system than this,
   the mind of man has never conceived. Yet this system has not only its
   philosophical advocates, and its practical disciples, but it percolates
   through much of the popular literature both of Europe and America.

   Leibnitz's Theory of Privation.

   Nearly allied in terms, but very different in spirit and purpose from
   this doctrine of Spinoza and his successors, is the theory of Leibnitz,
   who also resolves sin into privation, and refers it to the necessary
   limitation of being. Leibnitz, however, was a theist, and his object in
   his "Théodicée" was to vindicate God by proving that the existence of
   sin is consistent with his divine perfections. His work is religious in
   its spirit and object, however erroneous and dangerous in some of its
   principles. He assumed that this is the best possible world. As sin
   exists in the world, it must be necessary or unavoidable. It is not to
   be referred to the agency of God. But as God is the universal agent
   according to Leibnitz's philosophy, sill must be a simple negation or
   privation for which no efficient cause is needed. These are the two
   points to be established, First, that sin is unavoidable; and secondly,
   that it is not due to the agency of God. It is unavoidable, because it
   arises out of the necessary limitation of the creature. The creature
   cannot be absolutely perfect. His knowledge and power must be limited.
   But if limited, they must not only be liable to error, but error or
   wrong action is unavoidable, or you would have absolutely perfect
   action from a less than absolutely perfect agent; the effect would
   transcend the power of the cause. Evil, therefore, according to
   Leibnitz, arises "par la suprême necessité des vérités éternelles."
   [140] "Le franc-arbitre va au bien, et s'il rencontre le mal, c'est par
   accident, c'est que le mal est caché sous le bien et comme masqué." The
   origin of evil is thus indeed referred to the will, but the will is
   unavoidably, or of necessity led into error, by the limitations
   inseparable from the nature of a creature. If, therefore, God created a
   world at all, He must create one from which sin could not be excluded.
   Such being the origin and nature of sin, it follows that God is not its
   author. Providence, according to Leibnitz, is a continued creation (at
   least this is the view presented in some parts of his "Théodicée" [141]
   ), therefore all that is positive and real must be due to his agency.
   But sill being merely negation, or privation, is nothing positive, and
   therefore does not need an efficient, but simply a deficient cause to
   account for its existence. The similarity in mode of statement between
   this doctrine and the Augustinian doctrine which makes all sin defect,
   and which reconciles its existence with the holiness of God on the same
   principle as that adopted by Leibnitz, is obvious to all. It is however
   merely a similarity in the mode of expression. The two doctrines are
   essentially different, as we shall see when the Augustinian theory
   comes to be considered. With Augustine, defect is the absence of a
   moral good which the creature should possess; with Leibnitz, negation
   is the necessary limitation of the powers of the creature.

   The objections to this theory which makes sin mere privation, and
   refers it to the nature of creatures as finite beings, are
   substantially the same as those already presented as bearing against
   the other theories before mentioned. (1.) In the first place, it makes
   sin a necessary evil. Creatures are of necessity imperfect or finite;
   and if sin be the unavoidable consequence of such imperfection, or
   limitation of being, sin also becomes a necessary evil. (2.) It makes
   God after all the author of sin in so far as it throws upon Him the
   responsibility for its existence. For even admitting that it is a mere
   negation, requiring no efficient cause, nevertheless God is the author
   of the limitation in the creature whence sin of necessity flows. He has
   so constituted the works of his hand, that they cannot but sin, just as
   the child cannot but err in its judgments. Reason is so feeble even in
   the adult man that mistakes as to the nature and causes of things are
   absolutely unavoidable. And if sin be equally unavoidable from the very
   constitution of the creature, God, who is the author of that
   constitution, becomes responsible for its existence. This is not only
   derogatory to the character of God, but directly opposed to the
   teachings of his Word. The Bible never refers the origin of sin,
   whether in angels or in men, to the necessary limitations of their
   being as creatures, but to the perverted and inexcusable use of their
   own free agency. The fallen angels kept not their first estate; and
   man, being left to the freedom of his own will, fell from the estate in
   which he was created. (3.) This theory tends to obliterate the
   distinction between moral and physical evil. If sin be mere privation,
   or if it be the necessary consequence of the feebleness of the
   creature, it is the object of pity rather than of abhorrence. In the
   writings of the advocates of this theory the two senses of the words
   good and evil, the moral and the physical, are constantly interchanged
   and confounded; because evil according to their views is really little
   more than a misfortune, an unavoidable mistake as to what is really
   good. The distinction, however, between virtue and vice, holiness and
   sin, as revealed in our consciousness and in the word of God, is
   absolute and entire. Both are simple ideas. We know what pain is from
   experience; we know what sin is from the same source. We know that the
   two are as different as day and night, as light and sound. Any theory,
   therefore, which tends to confound them, must be false. Accordingly, in
   the Scriptures while mere suffering is always presented as an object of
   commiseration, sin is presented as an object of abhorrence and
   condemnation. The wrath and curse of God are denounced against all sin
   as its just desert. (4.) This doctrine, therefore, necessarily tends
   not only to lessen our sense of the evil or pollution of sin, but also
   to destroy the sense of guilt. Our sins are our misfortunes, our
   infirmities. They are not what conscience pronounces them to be, crimes
   calling for condign punishment. Sin, however, reveals itself in our
   consciousness not as a weakness, but as a power. It is greatest in the
   strongest. It is not the feeble-minded who are the worst of men; but
   those great in intellect have been, in many cases, the greatest in
   iniquity. Satan, the worst of created beings, is the most powerful of
   creatures. (5.) If this theory be correct, sin must be everlasting. As
   we can never be free from the limitations of our being, we can never be
   free from sin to which those limitations unavoidably give rise. The
   soul, therefore, as has been said, is the asymptote of God, forever
   approaching but never reaching the state of absolute sinlessness.

   Sin necessary Antagonism.

   Still another theory obviously inconsistent with the facts of
   consciousness and the teachings of the Bible, is that which accounts
   for sin on the law of necessary opposition, or antagonism. All life, it
   is said, implies action and reaction. Even in the material universe the
   same law prevails. The heavenly bodies are kept in their orbits by the
   balance of centrifugal and centripetal forces There is polarity in
   light, and in magnetism and electricity. All chemical changes are
   produced by attraction and repulsion. Thus in the animal world there is
   no strength without obstacles to be overcome; no rest without fatigue;
   no life without death. So also the mind is developed by continual
   struggles, by constant conflict with what is within and without. The
   same law, it is urged, must prevail in the moral world. There can be no
   good without evil. Good is the resistance or the overcoming of evil.
   What the material universe would be, had matter but one property; if
   everything were oxygen or everything carbon; what life would be without
   action and reaction; what the mind would he without the struggle with
   error and search after truth; such, it is said, the moral world would
   be without sin; a stagnant, lifeless pool. So far as creatures are
   concerned, it is maintained, that it is a law of their constitution,
   that they should be developed by antagonism, by the action of contrary
   forces, or opposing principles; so that a moral world without sin is an
   impossibility. Sin is the necessary condition of the existence of
   virtue.

   This general theory is of early origin and wide dissemination In its
   latest form, as presented by Blasche and Rosenkranz, the universe
   itself, as a product of the self-development of the infinite and
   absolute Being, involving a separation or difference from the pure and
   simple one in which was no distinction, is evil. It comes into
   existence by a fall or apostasy. Thus, as Professor Müller in his work
   on "Sin," says, Instead of Pantheism we have a system which nearly
   approaches Pansatanism. Apart however from this dreadful extreme of the
   doctrine, in any form it destroys the very nature of sin. What is so
   called is the universal law of all finite existence. There cannot be
   action without reaction. There cannot be life without diversity and
   antagonism of operations. And if good cannot exist without evil, evil
   ceases to be something to be abhorred and condemned. Men cease to be
   responsible for what is inseparable from their very nature as
   creatures, and therefore there is nothing which the conscience can
   condemn or which God can punish. Our whole moral nature, on this
   theory, is a delusion, and all the denunciations of Scripture against
   sin are the ravings of fanaticism.

   Schleiermacher's Theory of Sin.

   Schleiermacher's doctrine of sin is so related to his whole
   philosophical and theological system that one cannot be understood
   without some knowledge of the other. His philosophy is pantheistic. His
   theology is simply the interpretation of human consciousness in
   accordance with the fundamental principles of his philosophy. It is
   called Christian theology because it is the interpretation of the
   religious consciousness of Christians; i.e., of those who know and
   believe the facts recorded concerning Christ. The leading principles of
   his system are the following:

   1. God is the absolute Infinity (die einfache and absolute
   Unendlichkeit), not a person, but simple being with the single
   attribute of omnipotence. Other attributes which we ascribe to the
   Infinite Being express not what is in Him (or rather in It), but the
   effects produced in us. Wisdom, goodness, holiness in God, mean simply
   the causality in Him which produces those attributes in us.

   Absolute power means all power. God, or the absolutely powerful being,
   is the only cause. Everything that is and everything that occurs are
   due to his efficiency.

   3. This infinite power produces the world. Whatever the relation
   between the two, whether it is the substance of which the world is the
   phenomenon, or whether the world is the substance of which God is the
   life, the world in some sense is. There is a finite as well as an
   infinite.

   4. Man, as an integral part of the world, consists of two elements, or
   stands related both to the finite and infinite, God and nature. There
   is in man self-consciousness, or a consciousness which is affected by
   the world. He is in the world and of the world, and is acted upon by
   the world. On the other hand, he has what Schleiermacher calls
   Gottesbewusstseyn, or God-consciousness. This is not merely a
   consciousness of God, but is God in us in the form of consciousness.

   5. The normal, or ideal, state of man consists in the absolute and
   uninterrupted control of the God-consciousness, or of God in us. These
   two principles he sometimes distinguishes as flesh and spirit. But by
   flesh he does not mean the body; nor what St. Paul commonly means by
   it, our corrupt fallen nature; but our whole nature so far as it stands
   related to the world. It is tantamount, in the terminology of
   Schleiermacher, to self-consciousness. And by spirit he does not mean
   the reason, nor what the Bible means by the spirit in man, i.e., the
   Holy Ghost, but the (Gottesbewusstseyn) God-consciousness, or God in
   us.

   6. Religion consists in the feeling of absolute dependence. That is, in
   the recognition of the fact that God, or the absolute Being, is the
   only cause, and that we are merely the form in which his causality is
   revealed or exercised.

   7. The original state of man was not a normal or ideal state. That is,
   the God-consciousness or divine principle was not strong enough
   absolutely to control the self-consciousness. That was a state to be
   reached by progress or development.

   8. The feeling which arises from the want of this absolute control of
   the higher principle is the sense of sin; and the conviction that the
   higher principle ought to rule is the sense of guilt. With this feeling
   of sin and guilt arises the sense of the need of redemption.

   9. This redemption consists in giving to the God-consciousness complete
   control; and is effected through Christ, who is the normal or ideal
   man. That is, He is the man in whom the God-consciousness, the divine
   nature, God (these, in this system, are interchangeable terms), was
   from the beginning completely dominant. We become like Him, i.e., are
   redeemed, partly by the recognition of his true character as sinless,
   and partly by communion with Him through his Church.

   It is plain that this system precludes the possibility of sin in the
   true Scriptural sense of the term, --

   1. Because it precludes the idea of a personal God. If sin be want of
   conformity to law, there must be a lawgiver, one who prescribes the
   rule of duty to his creatures. But in this system there is no
   self-conscious, personal ruler who is the moral governor of men.

   2. Because the system denies all efficiency, and of course all liberty
   to the creature. If the Infinite Being is the only agent, then all that
   is, is due to his direct efficiency; and sin, therefore, is either his
   work or it is a mere negation.

   3. Because what, according to this theory, is called sin is absolutely
   universal and absolutely necessary. It is the unavoidable consequence
   or condition of the existence of such a being as man. That is, of a
   being with a self-consciousness and a God-consciousness, in such
   proportions and relation that the dominance of the latter can be
   attained only gradually.

   4. Because what are called sin and guilt are only such in our
   consciousness, or in our subjective apprehension of them. Certain
   things produce in us the sense of pain, others the feeling of pleasure;
   some the feeling of approbation, others of disapprobation; and that by
   the ordinance, so to speak, of God. But pain and pleasure, right and
   wrong, are merely subjective states. They have no objective reality. We
   are sinful and guilty only in our own feelings, not in the sight or
   judgment of God. [142] How entirely this view of the subject destroys
   all true sense of sin; how inconsistent it is with all responsibility;
   how it conflicts with the testimony of our own consciousness and with
   the teachings of Scripture, must be apparent to all who have not
   yielded themselves to the control of the pantheistic principles on
   which this whole system is founded.

   The Sensuous Theory.

   A sixth theory places the source and seat of sin in the sensuous nature
   of man. We are composed of body and spirit. Whatever may be the
   relation of the two, they cannot fail to be recognized as in some sense
   distinct elements of our nature. All attempts to identify them not only
   lead to the contradiction of self-evident truths, but to the
   degradation of the spiritual. If the mind be the product of the body,
   or the highest function of matter, or if the body be the product of the
   mind, or the external form in which mind exists, in either way the mind
   is materialized. "It is," says Müller, [143] "the undeniable teaching
   of history that the obliterating the. distinction between spirit and
   nature always ends in naturalizing spirit, and never in spiritualizing
   nature." It is a fact of consciousness and of common consent that man
   consists of soul and body. It is no less certain that by the body he is
   connected with the external world or nature, and by the soul with the
   spiritual world and God; that he has wants, desires, appetites, and
   affections, which find their objects in the material world, and that he
   has other instincts, affections, and powers which find their objects in
   the spiritual world. It is self-evident that the latter are higher and
   ought to be uniformly and always dominant; it is a fact of experience
   that the reverse is the case; that the lower prevail over the higher;
   that men are universally to a greater or less extent, and always to an
   extent that is degrading and sinful, governed by their sensuous nature.
   They prefer the seen and temporal to the unseen and eternal. They seek
   the gratification which is to be found in material objects, rather than
   the blessedness which is to be found in the things of the Spirit.
   Herein, according to this theory, consists the source and essence of
   sin. This doctrine, which has prevailed in every age of the Church, has
   existed in different forms, (1.) In that of the Manichæan system, which
   teaches the essential evil of matter. (2.) In that of the later
   Romanism, which teaches that man as originally created was so
   constituted that the soul was subject to the body, his higher powers
   being subordinate to his lower or sensuous nature. This original evil
   in his constitution was, in the case of Adam, according to the
   Romanists, corrected by the supernatural gift of original
   righteousness. When that righteousness was lost by the fall, the
   sensuous element in man's nature became ascendent. Therein consists his
   habitual sinfulness, and this is the source of all actual
   transgressions. (3.) The more common form of this theory is essentially
   the same with the Romish doctrine, except that it does not refer the
   predominance of the body aver the soul to the loss of original
   righteousness. The fact that men are governed by the lower rather than
   by the higher elements of their nature, as a matter of experience, is
   accounted for in different ways. (1.) Some say it arises from the
   relative weakness of the higher powers. This amounts to the Leibnitzian
   doctrine that sin is due to the limitations of our nature, or the
   feebleness and liability to error belonging to our constitution as
   creatures. (2.) Others appeal to the liberty of the will. Man as a free
   agent has the power either to resist or to submit to the enticements of
   the flesh. If he submits, it is his own fault and sin. There is no
   necessity and no coercion in the case. But if this submission is
   universal and uniform it must have a universal and adequate cause. That
   cause is not found in the mere liberty of man, or in his ability to
   submit. It must be that the cause is uniform and abiding, and such a
   cause can only be found in the very constitution of man, at least in
   his present state, which renders the sensuous element in man more
   powerful than the spiritual. (3.) Others again, while not denying the
   plenary ability of man to resist the allurements of sense, account for
   the universal ascendency of the lower powers by a reference to the
   order of development of our nature. We are so constituted, or we come
   into the world in such a state that the lower or sensuous part of our
   nature invariably and of necessity attains strength before the
   development of the higher powers. The animal propensities of the child
   are strong, while reason and con science are weak. Hence the lower gain
   such an ascendency over the higher that it is ever afterwards
   maintained.

   It is obvious, however, that this theory in any of its forms fails to
   bring out the real nature of sin, or satisfactorily to account for its
   origin.

   1. Sin is not essentially the state or act of a sensuous nature. The
   creatures presented in Scripture as the most sinful are the fallen
   spirits, who have no bodies and no sensual appetites.

   2. In the second place, the sins which are the most offensive in man,
   and which most degrade him, and most burden his conscience, have
   nothing to do with the body. Pride, malice, envy, ambition, and, above
   all, unbelief and enmity to God, are spiritual sins. They may not only
   exist in beings who have no material organization, but in the soul when
   separated from the body, and when its sensuous nature is extinct.

   3. This theory tends to lower our sense of sin and guilt. All moral
   evil becomes mere weakness, the yielding of the feebler powers of the
   spirit to the stronger forces of the flesh. If sin invariably, and by a
   law which controls men in their present state of existence, arises from
   the very constitution of their nature as sentient beings, then the
   responsibility for sin must be greatly lessened, if not entirely
   destroyed.

   4. If the body be the seat and source of sin, then whatever tends to
   weaken the body or to reduce the force of its desires must render men
   more pure and virtuous. If this be so then monkery and asceticism have
   a foundation in truth. They are wisely adapted to the elevation of the
   soul above the influence of the flesh and of the world, and of all
   forms of evil. All experience, however, proves the reverse. Even when
   those who thus seclude themselves from the world, and macerate the
   body, are sincere, and faithfully adhere to their principles, the whole
   tendency of their discipline is evil. It nourishes pride,
   self-righteousness, formality, and false religion. The Pharisees, in
   the judgment of Christ, with all their strictness of living and
   constant fasting, were further from the kingdom of heaven than
   publicans and harlots.

   5. On the assumption involved in this theory, the old should be good.
   In them the lusts of the flesh become extinct. They lose the power to
   enjoy what pleases the eyes or pampers the tastes of the young. The
   world to them has lost its attractions. The body becomes a burden. It
   is in the state to which the youthful ascetic endeavours to reduce his
   corporeal frame by abstinence and austerity; and yet the older the man,
   unless renewed by the grace of God, the worse the sinner. The soul is
   more dead, more insensible to all that is elevating and spiritual, and
   more completely alienated from God; less grateful for his mercies, less
   afraid of his wrath, and less affected by all the manifestations of his
   glory and love. It is not the body, therefore, that is the cause of
   sin.

   6. This theory is opposed to the doctrine of the Bible. The Scriptures
   do indeed refer a large class of sins to the sensual nature of man; and
   they represent the flesh (or sarx) as the seat of sin and the source of
   all its manifestations in our present state. They moreover, use the
   word sarkikos, carnal, as synonymous with corrupt or sinful. All this,
   however, does not prove that they teach that man's animal or sensuous
   nature is the seat and source of his sinfulness. All depends on the
   sense in which the sacred writers use the words sarx and sarkikos as
   antithetical to pneuma and pneumatikos. According to one
   interpretation, sarx means the body with its animal life, its instincts
   and appetites. Or as Bretschneider defines it: [144] "Natura visibilis
   seu animalis tanquam appetituum naturalium fons et sedes, et quidem in
   malam partem, quatenus hæc natura animalis, legi divinæ non adstricta,
   appetit contra legem, igiturque cupiditatum et peccatorum est mater."
   If such be the meaning of sarx, then sarkikos is means animal and
   psuchikos sensuous. On the other hand, according to this view, pneuma
   means reason, and pneumatikos, the reasonable, that is, one governed by
   the reason. According to this view, the sarkikoi are those who are
   controlled by their senses and animal nature; and the pneumatikoi,
   those who are governed by their reason and higher powers. According to
   the other interpretation of these terms, sarx means the fallen nature
   of man, his nature as it now is; and pneuma the Holy Ghost. Then the
   sarkikoi are the unrenewed or natural men, i.e., those destitute of the
   grace of God, and the pneumatikoi, are those in whom the Holy Spirit
   dwells. It is of course admitted that the word sarx is often used in
   Scripture and especially in St. Paul's writings, for the body; then for
   what is external and ritual; then for what is perishing. Mankind when
   designated as flesh are presented as earthly, feeble, and transient.
   Besides these common and admitted meanings of the word, it is also used
   in a moral sense. It designates man, or humanity, or human nature as
   apostate from God. The works of the flesh, therefore, are not merely
   sensual works, but sinful works, everything in man that is evil.
   Everything that is a manifestation of his nature as fallen, is included
   under the works of the flesh. Hence to this class are referred envy,
   malice, pride, and contentions; as well as rioting and drunkenness,
   Gal. v. 19-21. To walk after the flesh; to be carnally minded; to be in
   the flesh, etc., etc. (see Rom. viii. 1-13), are all Scriptural modes
   of expressing the state, conduct, and life of the men of the world of
   every class. The meaning of flesh, however, as used in Paul's writings,
   is most clearly determined by its antithesis to Spirit. That the pneuma
   of which he speaks is the Holy Spirit, is abundantly clear. He calls it
   the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God, the Spirit which is to quicken
   our mortal bodies; which witnesses with our spirits that we are the
   children of God; whose dwelling in believers makes them the temple of
   God. The pneumatikoi, or spiritual, are those in whom the Holy Spirit
   dwells as the controlling principle of their lives. The Scriptures,
   therefore, are directly opposed to the theory which makes the body or
   the sensuous nature of man the source of sin, and its essence to
   consist in yielding to our appetites and worldly affections, instead of
   obeying the reason and conscience.

   The Theory that all Sin consists in Selfishness.

   There is another doctrine of the nature of sin which belongs to the
   philosophical, rather than to the theological theories on the subject.
   It makes all sin to consist in selfishness. Selfishness is not to be
   confounded with self-love. The latter is a natural and original
   principle of our nature and of the nature of all sentient creatures,
   whether rational or irrational. Belonging to their original
   constitution, and necessary to their preservation and well-being, it
   cannot be sinful. It is simply the desire of happiness which is
   inseparable from the nature of a sentient being. Selfishness,
   therefore, is net mere self-love, but the undue preference of our own
   happiness to the happiness or welfare of other. According to some, this
   preference is of the nature of a desire or feeling; according to
   others, it is of the nature of a purpose. In the latter view, all sin
   consists in the purpose to seek our own happiness rather than the
   general good, or happiness, as it is commonly expressed, of the
   universe. In either view, sin is the undue preference of ourselves.

   This theory is founded on the following principles, or is an essential
   element in the following system of doctrine: (1.) Happiness is the
   greatest good. Whatever tends to promote the greatest amount of
   happiness is for that reason good, and whatever has the opposite
   tendency is evil. (2.) As happiness is the only and ultimate good,
   benevolence, or the disposition or purpose to promote happiness, must
   be the essence and sum of virtue. (3.) As God is infinite, He must be
   infinitely benevolent, and therefore it must be his desire and purpose
   to produce the greatest possible amount of happiness. (4.) The universe
   being the work of God must be designed and adapted to secure that end,
   and is therefore the best possible world or system of things. (5.) As
   sin exists in the actual world, it must be the necessary means of the
   greatest good, and therefore it is consistent, as some say, with the
   holiness of God to permit and ordain its existence; or, as others say,
   to create it. (6.) There is no more sin in the world than is necessary
   to secure the greatest happiness of the universe.

   The first and most obvious objection to this whole theory has already
   been presented, namely, that it destroys the very idea of moral good.
   It confounds the right with the expedient. It thus contradicts the
   consciousness and intuitive judgments of the mind. It is intuitively
   true that the right is right in its own nature, independently of its
   tendency to promote happiness. To make holiness only a means to an end;
   to exalt enjoyment above moral excellence, is not only a perversion and
   a degradation of the higher to the lower, but it is the utter
   destruction of the principle. This is a matter which, properly
   speaking, does not admit of proof. Axioms cannot be proved. They can
   only be affirmed. Should a man deny that sweet and bitter differ, it
   would be impossible to prove that there is a difference between them.
   We can only appeal to our own consciousness and affirm that we perceive
   the difference. And we can appeal to the testimony of all other men,
   who also affirm the same thing. But after all this is only an assertion
   of a fact first by the individual, and then by the mass of mankind. In
   like manner if any man says that there is no difference between the
   good and the expedient, that a thing is good simply because it is
   expedient; or, if he should say that there is no difference between
   holiness and sin, we can only refer to our own consciousness and to the
   common consciousness of men, as contradicting his assertion. We know,
   therefore, from the very constitution of our nature that the right and
   the expedient are not identical ideas; that the difference is essential
   and immutable. And we know from the same source, and with, equal
   assurance or certainty, that happiness is not the highest good; but on
   the contrary, that holiness is as much higher than happiness, as heaven
   is higher than the earth, or Christ than Epicurus. (2.) This theory is
   as much opposed to our religious, as it is to our moral nature. Our
   dependence is upon God; our allegiance is to Him; we are bound to do
   His will irrespective of all consequences; and we are exalted and
   purified just in proportion as we are lost in Him, adoring his divine
   perfections, seeking to promote his glory, and recognizing that in fact
   and of right all things are by Him, through Him, and for Him. According
   to this theory, however, our allegiance is to the universe of sentient
   beings. We are bound to promote their happiness. This is our highest
   and our only obligation. There can therefore be no religion in the
   proper sense of the word. Religion is the homage and allegiance of the
   soul to an infinitely perfect personal Being, to whom we owe our
   existence, who is the source of all good, and for whom all things
   consist. To substitute the universe for this Being, and to resolve all
   duty into the obligation to promote the happiness of the universe, is
   really to render all religion impossible. The universe is not our God.
   It is not the universe that we love; it is not the universe that we
   adore; it is not the universe that we fear. It is not the favour of the
   universe that .s our life, nor is its disapprobation our death. (3.) As
   this theory is thus opposed to our moral and religious nature, it is
   evil in its practical effects. It is a proverb, a maxim founded on the
   nature of things and on universal experience, that the world is
   governed by ideas. It is doubtful whether history furnishes any more
   striking illustration of the truth of this maxim than that furnished by
   the operation of the theory that all virtue is founded in expediency
   that holiness is that which tends to produce happiness. When the
   individual man adopts that principle, his whole inward and outward life
   is determined by it. Every question which comes up for decision, is
   answered, not by a reference to the law of God, or to the instincts of
   his moral nature, but by the calculations of expediency. And when a
   people come under the control of this theory they invariably and of
   necessity become calculating. If happiness be the greatest good, and
   whatever seems to us adapted to promote happiness is right, then God
   and the moral law are lost sight of. Our own happiness is apt to become
   the chief good for us, as it is for the universe. (4.) It need hardly
   be remarked that we are incompetent to determine what course of conduct
   will issue in the greatest amount of physical good, and therefore can
   never tell what is right and what is wrong. It may be said that we are
   not left to our own sagacity to decide that question. The law of God as
   revealed in his word, is a divine rule by which we can learn what tends
   to happiness and what to misery. But this not only degrades the moral
   law into a series of wise maxims, but it changes the motive of
   obedience. We obey not out of regard to the authority of God, but
   because He knows better than we what will promote the greatest good.
   Besides this, in the questions which daily present them. selves for
   decision, we are forced to judge for ourselves what is right and wrong,
   in the light of conscience and of the general principles contained in
   the Scriptures. And if these principles all resolve themselves into the
   one maxim, that that is right which promotes happiness, we are obliged
   to resort to the calculations of expediency, for which in our
   short-sighted wisdom we are utterly incompetent. (5.) Besides all this,
   the theory assumes that sin, and the present awful amount of sin, are
   the necessary means of the greatest good. What then becomes of the
   distinction between good and evil? If that is good which tends to
   promote the greatest happiness, and if sin is necessary to secure the
   greatest happiness, then sin ceases to be sin, and becomes a good. Then
   also it must be right to do evil that good may come. How, asks the
   Apostle, on this principle, can God judge the world? If the sins of men
   not only in fact promote the highest end, but if a man in sinning has
   the purpose and desire to coöperate with God in producing the greatest
   amount of happiness, how can he be condemned? If virtue or holiness is
   right simply because it tends to produce the greatest happiness, and if
   sin also tends to the same result, then the man who sins with a view to
   the greatest good is just as virtuous as the man who practices holiness
   with the same end in view. It may be said that it is a contradiction to
   say that a man sins with a truly benevolent purpose; for the essence of
   virtue is to purpose the greatest good, and therefore whatever is done
   in the execution of that purpose, is virtuous. Exactly so. The
   objection itself shows that right becomes wrong and wrong right,
   according to the design with which it is committed or performed. And
   therefore, if a man lies, steals, or murders with a design to promote
   the good of society, of the church, or of the universe, he is a
   virtuous man. It was principally for the adoption of, and the carrying
   into practice this doctrine, that the Jesuits became an abomination in
   the sight of Christendom and were banished from all civilised
   countries. Jesuits were however, unhappily not its only advocates. The
   principle has been widely disseminated in books on morals, and has been
   adopted by theologians as the foundation of their whole system of
   Christian doctrine. (6.) If happiness be not the highest good, then
   benevolence is not the sum of all excellence, and selfishness as the
   opposite of benevolence, cannot be the essence of sin. On this point,
   again, appeal may be safely made to our own consciousness and to the
   common consciousness of men. Our moral nature teaches us, on the one
   hand, that all virtue cannot be resolved into benevolence: justice,
   fidelity, humility, forbearance, patience, constancy, spiritual
   mindedness, the love of God, gratitude to Christ, anti zeal for his
   glory, do not reveal themselves in consciousness as forms of
   benevolence. They are as distinct to the moral sense, as red, blue, and
   green are distinct to the eye. On the other hand, unbelief, hardness of
   heart, ingratitude, impenitence, malice, and enmity towards God, are
   not modifications of selfishness. These attempts at simplification are
   not only unphilosophical, but also dangerous; as they lead to
   confounding things which differ, and, as we have seen, to denying the
   essential nature of moral distinctions.

   The doctrine which makes all sin to consist in selfishness, as it has
   been generally held, especially in this country, considers selfishness
   as the opposite of benevolence agreeably to the theory which has just
   been considered. There are others, however, that mean by it the
   opposite to the love of God. As God is the proper centre of the soul
   and the sum of all perfection, apostasy from Him is the essence of sin;
   apostasy from God involves, it is said, a falling back into ourselves,
   and making self the centre of our being. Thus Müller, [145] Tholuck,
   [146] and many others, make alienation from God the primary principle
   of sin. But dethroning God necessitates the putting an idol in his
   place. That idol, Augustine and after him numerous writers of different
   schools, say, is the creature; as the Apostle concisely describes the
   wickedness of men, by saying, that they "worshipped and served the
   creature more than the Creator." But Müller argues that as it is self
   the sinner seeks in the creature, the real principle of sin consists in
   putting self in the place of God, and making it the highest end of life
   and its gratification or satisfaction the great object of pursuit. It
   of course is not denied, that selfishness, it some of its forms,
   includes a large class of the sins of which men are guilty. What is
   objected to is, the making selfishness the essence of all sin, or the
   attempt to reduce all the manifestations of moral evil to this one
   principle. This, cannot be done. There is disinterested sin as well as
   disinterested benevolence. A man may as truly and as deliberately
   sacrifice himself in sinning, as in doing good. Many parents have
   violated the law of God not for their own benefit, but for the benefit
   of their children. It may be said that this is only a form of
   selfishness, because the happiness of their children is their
   happiness, and the sin is committed for the gratification of their
   parental feelings. To this, however, it may be answered, first, that it
   is contradictory to say that what is done for another is done for
   ourselves. When a mother sacrifices wealth and life for her child,
   although she acts under the impulse of the maternal instinct, she acts
   disinterestedly. The sacrifice consists in preferring her child to
   herself. In the second place, if an act ceases to be virtuous when its
   performance meets and satisfies some demand of our nature, then no act
   can be virtuous. When a man does any good work, he satisfies his
   conscience. If lie does an act of kindness to the poor, if he devotes
   himself to the relief of the sick or the prisoner, he gratifies his
   benevolent feelings. If he seeks the favour and fellowship of God, and
   consecrates himself to his service, he gratifies the noblest principles
   of his nature, and experiences the highest enjoyment of which he is
   susceptible. It is not necessary therefore, in order that an act,
   whether right or wrong, should be disinterested, that it should not
   minister to our gratification. All depends on the motive for which it
   is done. If that motive be the happiness of another and not our own,
   the act is disinterested. It is contrary, therefore, to the testimony
   of every man's consciousness to say that selfishness is the essential
   element of sin. There is no selfishness in malice, nor in enmity to
   God. These are far higher forms of evil than mere selfishness. The true
   nature of sin is alienation from God and opposition to his character
   and will. it is the opposite of holiness and does not admit of being
   reduced to any one principle, either the love of the creature or the
   love of self.

   § 3. The Doctrine of the Early Church.

   The theories already considered are called philosophical, either
   because they concern the metaphysical nature of sin, or because they
   are founded on some philosophical principle. The moral at theological
   doctrines on the subject are so designated because they are founded on
   what are assumed to be the teachings of our moral nature or of the word
   of God. So far as the early Church is concerned, the doctrine
   respecting sin was stated only in general terms. In almost all cases
   the explicit and discriminating doctrinal affirmations received their
   form as counter statements to erroneous views, So long as the truth was
   not denied the Church was content to hold and state it in the simple
   form in which it is presented in the Bible. But when positions were
   assumed which were inconsistent with the revealed doctrine, or when one
   truth was so stated as to contradict some other truth, it became
   necessary to be more explicit, and to frame such an expression of the
   doctrine as should comprehend all that God had revealed on the subject.
   This process in the determination, or rather in the definition of
   doctrines was of necessity a gradual one. It was only as one error
   after another arose in the Church, that the truth came to be
   distinguished from them severally by more explicit and guarded
   statements. As the earliest heresies were those of Gnosticism and
   Manicheism in which, in different forms, sin was represented as a
   necessary evil having its origin in a cause independent of God and
   beyond the control of the creature, the Church was called upon to deny
   those errors, and to assert that sin was neither necessary nor eternal,
   but had its origin in the free will of rational creatures. In the
   struggle with Manicheism the whole tendency of the Church was to exalt
   the liberty and ability of man, in order to maintain the essential
   doctrine, then so variously assailed, that sin is a moral evil for
   which man is to be condemned, and not a calamity for which he is to be
   pitied. It was the unavoidable consequence of the unsettled state of
   doctrinal formulas, that conflicting statements should be made even by
   those who meant to be the advocates of the truth, -- not only different
   writers, but the same writer, would on different occasions, present
   inconsistent statements. In the midst of these inconsistencies the
   following points were constantly insisted upon. (1.) That all men in
   their present state are sinners. (2.) That this universal sinfulness of
   men had its historical and causal origin in the voluntary apostasy of
   Adam. (3.) That such is the present state of human nature that
   salvation can be attained in no other way than through Christ, and by
   the assistance of his Spirit. (4.) That even infants as soon as born
   need regeneration and redemption, and can be saved only through the
   merit of Christ, These great truths, which lie at the foundation of the
   gospel, entered into the general faith of the Church before they were
   so strenuously asserted by Augustine in his controversy with Pelagius.
   It is true that many assertions may be quoted from the Greek fathers
   inconsistent with some of the prepositions above stated. But the same
   writers in other passages avow their faith in these primary Scriptural
   truths; and they are implied in the prayers and ordinances of the
   Church, and were incorporated at a later period, in the public
   confessions of the Greeks, as well as of the Latins. Clemens
   Alexandrinus [147] says: to gar examartanein pasin emphuton kai koinon.
   Justin says, [148] To genos ton anthropon apo tou Adam hupo thanaton
   kai planen ten tou opheos epeptokei, although he adds, para ten idian
   aitian ekastou auton ponereusamenou. Origen says, [149] "Si Levi
   . . . . in lumbis Abrahæ fuisse perhibetur, multo magis omnes homines
   qui in hoc mundo nascuntur et nati sunt, in lumbis erant Adæ, cum adhuc
   esset in Paradiso; et omnes homines cum ipso vel in ipso expulsi sunt
   de Paradiso." Athanasius says, [150] Pantes oun oi ex Adam genomenoi en
   hamartiais sullambanontai te tou propatoros katadike -- deiknusin hos
   ex arches he anrthropon phusis upo ten amartian peptoken hupo tes en
   Eua para baseos, kai hupo kataran he gennesis gegonen. Ambrose says,
   [151] "Manifestum itaque in Adam omnes peccasse quasi in massa: ipse
   enim per peccatum corruptus, quos genuit omnes nati sunt sub peccato.
   Ex eo igitur cuncti peccatores, quia ex ipso sumus omnes." Cyprian
   says: [152] "Si . . . . baptismo atque a gratia nemo prohibetur; quanto
   magis prohiberi non debet infans, qui recens natus nihil peccavit, nisi
   quod secundum Adam carnaliter natus, contagium mortis antiquæ prima
   nativitate contraxit? qui ad remissam peccatorum accipiendam hoc ipso
   facilius accedit, quod illi remittuntur non propria, sed aliena
   peccata." Again he says: "Fuerant et ante Christum viri insignes, sed
   in peccatis concepti et nati, nec originali nec personali caruere
   delicto." These writers, says Gieseler, [153] taught that through
   Christ and his obedience on the tree was healed the original
   disobedience of man in reference to the tree of knowledge; that as we
   offended God in the first Adam by transgression, so through the second
   Adam we are reconciled to God; that Christ has freed us from the power
   of the devil to which we were subjected by the sin of Adam; that Christ
   has regained for us life and immortality. [154] It is not maintained
   that the Greek fathers held the doctrine of original sin in the form in
   which it was afterwards developed by Augustine, but they nevertheless
   taught that the race fell in Adam, that they all need redemption, and
   that redemption can only be obtained through the Lord Jesus Christ.

   § 4. Pelagian Theory.

   In the early part of the fifth century, Pelagius, Coelestius, and
   Julian, introduced a new theory as to the nature of sin and the state
   of man since the fall, and of our relation to Adam. That their doctrine
   was an innovation is proved by the fact that it was universally
   rejected and condemned as soon as it was fully understood. They were
   all men of culture, ability, and exemplary character. Pelagius was a
   Briton, whether a native of Brittany or of what is now called Great
   Britain, is a matter of doubt. He was by profession a monk, although a
   layman. Coelestius was a teacher and jurist; Julian an Italian bishop.
   The radical principle of the Pelagian theory is, that ability limits
   obligation. "If I ought, I can," is the aphorism on which the whole
   system rests. Augustine's celebrated prayer, "Da quod jubes, et jube
   quod vis," was pronounced by Pelagius an absurdity, because it assumed
   that God can demand more than man render, and what man must receive as
   a gift. In opposition to this assumption he laid down the principle
   that man must have plenary ability to do and to be whatever can be
   righteously required of him. "Iterum quærendum est, peccatum voluntatis
   an necessitatis est? Si necessitatis est, peccatum non est; si
   voluntatis, vitari potest. Iterum quærendum est, utrumne debeat homo
   sine peccato esse? Procul dubio debet. Si debet potest; si non potest,
   ergo non debet. Et si non debet homo esse sine peccato, debet ergo cum
   peccato esse, et jam peccatum non erit, si illud deberi constiterit."
   [156]

   The intimate conviction that men can be responsible for nothing which
   is not in their power, led, in the first place, to the Pelagian
   doctrine of the freedom of the will. It was not enough to constitute
   free agency that the agent should be self-determined, or that all his
   volitions should be determined by his own inward states. It was
   required that he should have power over those states. Liberty of the
   will, according to the Pelagians, is plenary power, at all times and at
   every moment, of choosing between good and evil, and of being either
   holy or unholy. Whatever does not thus fall within the imperative power
   of the will can have no moral character. "Omne bonum ac malum, quo vel
   laudabiles vel vituperabiles sumus, non nobiscum oritur, sed agitur a
   nobis: capaces enim utriusque rei, non pleni nascimur, et ut sine
   virtute, ita et sine vitio procreamur: atque ante actionem propriæ
   voluntatis, id solum in homine est, quod Deus condidit." [157] Again,
   "Volens namque Deus rationabilem creaturam voluntarii boni munere et
   liberi arbitrii potestate donare, utriusque partis possibilitatem
   homini inserendo proprium ejus fecit, esse quod velit; ut boni ac mali
   capax, natural iter utrumque posset, et ad alterumque voluntatem
   deflecteret."

   2. Sin, therefore, consists only in the deliberate choice of evil. It
   presupposes knowledge of what is evil, as well as the full power of
   choosing or rejecting it. Of course it follows, --

   3. That there can be no such thing as original sin, or inherent
   hereditary corruption. Men are born, as stated in the foregoing
   quotation, ut sine virtute, ita sine vitio. In other words men are born
   into the world since the fall in the same state in which Adam was
   created. Julian says: [158] "Nihil est peccati in homine, si nihil est
   propriæ voluntatis, vel assensionis. Tu autem concedis nihil fuisse in
   parvulis propriæ voluntatis: non ego, sed ratio concludit; nihil igitur
   in eis esse peccati." This was the point on which the Pelagians
   principally insisted, that it was contrary to the nature of sin that it
   should be transmitted or Inherited. If nature was sinful, then God as
   the author of nature must be the author of sin. Julian [159] therefore
   says: "Nemo naturaliter malus est; sed quicunque reus est, moribus, non
   exordiis accusatur."

   4. Consequently Adam's sin injured only himself. This was one of the
   formal charges presented against the Pelagians in the Synod of
   Diospolis. Pelagius endeavored to answer it, by saying that the sin of
   Adam exerted the influence of a bad example, and in that sense, and to
   that degree, injured his posterity. But he denied that there is any
   causal relation between the sin of Adam and the sinfulness of his race,
   or that death is a penal evil. Adam would have died from the
   constitution of his nature, whether he had sinned or not; and his
   posterity, whether infant or adult, die from like necessity of nature.
   As Adam was in no sense the representative of his race, as they did not
   stand their probation in him, each man stands a probation for himself;
   and is justified or condemned solely on the ground of his own
   individual personal acts.

   5. As men come into the world without the contamination of original
   sin, and as they have plenary power to do all that God requires, they
   may, and in many cases do, live without sin; or if at any time they
   transgress, they may turn unto God and perfectly obey all his
   commandments. Hence Pelagius taught that some men had no need for
   themselves to repeat the petition in the Lord's prayer, "Forgive us our
   trespasses." Before the Synod of Carthage one of the grounds on which
   he was charged with heresy was, that he taught, "et ante adventum
   Domini fuerunt homines impeccabiles, id est, sine peccato."

   6. Another consequence of his principles which Pelagius unavoidably
   drew was that men could be saved without the gospel. As free will in
   the sense of plenary ability, belongs essentially to man as much as
   reason, men whether Heathen, Jews, or Christians, may fully obey the
   law of God and attain eternal life. The only difference is that under
   the light of the Gospel, this perfect obedience is rendered more easy.
   One of his doctrines, therefore, was that "lex sic mittit ad regnum
   coelorum, quomodo et evangelium."

   7. The Pelagian system denies the necessity of grace in the sense of
   the supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit. As the Scriptures,
   however, speak so fully and constantly of the grace of God as
   manifested and exercised in the salvation of men, Pelagius could not
   avoid acknowledging that fact. By grace, however, he understood
   everything which we derive from the goodness of God. Our natural
   faculties of reason and free will, the revelation of the truth whether
   in his works or his word, all the providential blessings and advantages
   which men enjoy, fall under the Pelagian idea of grace. Augustine says,
   Pelagius represented grace to be the natural endowments of men, which
   inasmuch as they are the gift of God are grace. "Ille (Pelagius) Dei
   gratiam non appellat nisi naturam, qua libero arbitrio conditi sumus."
   [160] And Julian, he says, includes under the term all the gifts of
   God. "Ipsi gratiæ, beneficiorum quæ nobis præstare non desinit,
   augmenta reputamus." [161]

   8. As infants are destitute of moral character, baptism in their case
   cannot either symbolize or effect the remission of sin. It is,
   according to Pelagius, only a sign of their consecration to God. He
   believed that none but the baptized were at death admitted into the
   kingdom of heaven, in the Christian sense of that term, but held that
   unbaptized infants were nevertheless partakers of eternal life. By that
   term was meant what was afterwards called by the schoolmen, limbos
   infantum. This was described as that mesos topos kolaseos kai
   paradeisou, eis hon kai ta abaptista brephe metat themena zen makarios.
   [162] Pelagius and his doctrines were condemned by a council at
   Carthage, A.D. 412. He was exonerated at the Synods of Jerusalem and
   Diospolis, in 415; but condemned a second time in a synod of sixty
   bishops at Carthage in 416. Zosimus, bishop of Rome, at first sided
   with the Pelagians and censured the action of the African bishops; but
   when their decision was confirmed by the general council of Carthage in
   418, at which two hundred bishops were present, he joined in the
   condemnation and declared Pelagius and his friends excommunicated. In
   431 the Eastern Church joined in this condemnation of the Pelagians, in
   the General Synod held at Ephesus. [163]

   Arguments against the Pelagian Doctrine.

   The objections to the Pelagian views of the nature of sin will of
   necessity come under consideration, when the Scriptural and Protestant
   doctrine comes to be presented. It is sufficient for the present to
   state, --

   1. That the fundamental principle on which the whole system is founded
   contradicts the common consciousness of men. It is not true, as our own
   conscience teaches us, that our obligation is limited by our ability.
   Every man knows that he is bound to be better than he is, and better
   than he can make himself by any exertion of his We are bound to love
   God perfectly, but we know that such perfect love is beyond our power.
   We recognize the obligation to be free from all sin, and absolutely
   conformed to the perfect law of God. Yet no man is so infatuated or so
   blinded to his real character as really to believe that he either is
   thus perfect, or has the power to make himself so. It is the daily and
   hourly prayer or aspiration of every saint and of every sinner to be
   delivered from the bondage of evil. The proud and malignant would
   gladly be humble and benevolent; the covetous would rejoice to be
   liberal; the infidel longs for faith, and the hardened sinner for
   repentance. Sin is in its own nature a burden and a torment, and
   although loved and cherished, as the cups of the drunkard are
   cherished, yet, if emancipation could be effected by an act of the
   will, sin would cease to reign in any rational creature. There is no
   truth, therefore, of which men are more intimately convinced than that
   they are the slaves of sin; that they cannot do the good they would;
   and that they cannot alter their character at will. There is no
   principle, therefore, more at variance with the common consciousness of
   men than the fundamental principle of Pelagianism that our ability
   limits our obligation, that we are not bound to be better than we can
   make ourselves by a volition.

   2. It is no less revolting to the moral nature of man to assert, as
   Pelagianism teaches, that nothing is sinful but the deliberate
   transgression of known law; that there is no moral character in
   feelings and emotions; that love and hatred, malice and benevolence,
   considered as affections of the mind, are alike indifferent; that the
   command to love God is an absurdity, because love is not under the
   control of the will. All our moral judgments must be perverted before
   we can assent to a system involving such consequences.

   3. In the third place, the Pelagian doctrine, which confounds freedom
   with ability, or which makes the liberty of a free agent to consist in
   the power to determine his character by a volition, is contrary to
   every man's consciousness. We feel, and cannot but acknowledge, that we
   are free when we are self determined; while at the same time we are
   conscious that the controlling states of the mind are not under the
   power of the will, or, in other words, are not under our own power. A
   theory which is founded on identifying things which are essentially
   different, as liberty and ability, must be false.

   4. The Pelagian system leaves the universal sinfulness of men, a fact
   which cannot be denied, altogether unaccounted for. To refer it to the
   mere free agency of man is to say that a thing always is simply because
   it may be.

   5. This system fails to satisfy the deepest and most universal
   necessities of our nature. In making man independent of God by assuming
   that God cannot control free agents without destroying their liberty,
   it makes all prayer for the controlling grace of God over ourselves and
   others a mockery, and throws man back completely on his own resources
   to grapple with sin and the powers of darkness without hope of
   deliverance.

   6. It makes redemption (in the sense of a deliverance from sin)
   unnecessary or impossible. It is unnecessary that there should be a
   redeemer for a race which has not fallen, and which has full ability to
   avoid all sin or to recover itself from its power. And it is
   impossible, if free agents are independent of the control of God.

   7. It need hardly be said that a system which asserts, that Adam's sin
   injured only himself; that men are born into the world in the state in
   which Adam was created; that men may, and often do, live without sin;
   that we have no need of divine assistance in order to be holy; and that
   Christianity has no essential superiority over heathenism or natural
   religion, is altogether at variance with the word of God. The
   opposition indeed between Pelagianism and the gospel is so open and so
   radical that the former has never been regarded as a form of
   Christianity at all. It has, in other words, never been the faith of
   any organized Christian church. It is little more than a form of
   Rationalism.

   § 5. Augustinian Doctrine.

   The Philosophical Element of Augustine's Doctrine.

   There are two elements in Augustine's doctrine of sin: the one
   metaphysical or philosophical, the other moral or religious. The one a
   speculation of the understanding, the other derived from his religious
   experience and the teaching of the Holy Spirit. The one has passed
   away, leaving little more trace on the history of doctrine than other
   speculations, whether Aristotelian or Platonic. The other remains, and
   has given form to Christian doctrine from that day to this. This is not
   to be wondered at. Nothing is more uncertain and unsatisfactory than
   the speculations of the understanding or philosophical theories.
   Whereas nothing is more certain and universal than the moral
   consciousness of men and the truths which it reveals. And as the
   Scriptures, being the work of God, do and must conform their teachings
   to what God teaches in the constitution of our nature, doctrines
   founded on the twofold teaching of the Spirit, in his word and in the
   hearts of his people, remain unchanged from generation to generation,
   while the speculations of philosophy or of philosophical theologians
   pass away as the leaves of the forest. No man now concerns himself
   about the philosophy of Origen, or of the new Platonists, or of
   Augustine, while the language of David in the fifty-first Psalm is used
   to express the experience and convictions of all the people of God in
   all ages and in all parts of the world.

   The metaphysical element in Augustine's doctrine of sin arose from his
   controversy with the Manicheans. Manes taught that in was a substance.
   This Augustine denied. With him it was a maxim that "Omne esse bonum
   est." But if esse (being) is good, and if evil is the opposite of good,
   then evil must be the opposite of being, or nothing, i.e., the negation
   or privation of being. Thus he was led to adopt the language of the new
   Platonists and of Origen, who, by a different process, were brought to
   define evil as the negation of being, as Plotinus calls it, steresis
   tou ontos; and Origen says, pasa he kakia ouden estin, and evil itself
   he says is esteresthai tou ontos. In thus making being good and the
   negation of being evil, Augustine seems to have made the same mistake
   which other philosophers have so often made, -- of confounding physical
   and moral good. When God at the beginning declared all things, material
   and immaterial, which He had made, to be very good, He simply declared
   them to be suited to the ends for which they were severally made. He
   did not intend to teach us that moral goodness could be predicated of
   matter or of an irrational animal. In other cases the word good means
   agreeable, or adapted to give pleasure. In others again, it means
   morally right. To infer from time fact that everything which God made
   is good, or that every esse is bonum, that therefore moral evil being
   the negation of good must be the negation of being, is as illogical as
   to argue that because honey is good (in the sense of being agreeable to
   the taste) therefore worm-wood is bad, in the sense of being sinful.
   Although Augustine held the language of those philosophers who, both
   before and since, destroy the very nature of sin in making it mere
   limitation of being, yet he was very far from holding the same system.
   (1.) They made sin necessary, as arising from the very nature of a
   creature. He made it voluntary. (2.) They made it purely physical. He
   made it moral. With him it includes pollution and guilt. With them it
   included neither. (3.) With Augustine this negation was not merely
   passive, it was not the simple want of being, it was such privation as
   tended to destruction. (4.) Evil with Augustine, therefore, as was more
   fully and clearly taught by his followers, was not mere privation, nor
   simply defect. That a stone cannot see, involves the negation of the
   power of vision. But it is not a defect, because the power of vision
   does not belong to stones. Blindness is a defect in an animal, but not
   sin. The absence of love to God in a rational creature is sin, because
   it is the absence of something which belongs to such a creature, and
   which he ought to have. In the true Augustinian sense, therefore, sin
   is negation only as it is the privation of moral good, -- the privatio
   boni, or as it was afterwards generally expressed, a want of conformity
   to the law or standard of good.

   Augustine's Reasons for making Sin a Negation.

   In thus making sin negation, Augustine had principally two ends in
   view. (1.) To show that sin is not necessary. If it were something
   existing of itself, or something created by the power of God, it was
   beyond the power of man. He was its victim, not its author. (2.) He
   desired to show that it was not due to the divine efficiency. According
   to his theory of God's relation to the world, not only all that is,
   every substance, is created and upheld by l rod, but all activity or
   power, all energy by which positive effects are produced, is the energy
   of God. If sin, therefore, was anything in itself, anything more than a
   defect, or a want of conformity to a rule, God must be its author. He,
   therefore, took such a view of the psychological nature of sin, that it
   did not require an efficient, but as he often said only a deficient
   cause. If a man, to use the old Augustinian illustration, strike the
   cords of an untuned harp, he is the cause of the sound but not of the
   discord. So God is the cause of the sinner's activity but not of the
   discordance between his acts and the laws of eternal truth and right.
   [164]

   The Moral Element of His Doctrine.

   The true Augustinian doctrine of sin was that which the illustrious
   father drew from his own religious experience, as guided and determined
   by the Spirit of God. He was, (1.) Conscious of sin. He recognized
   himself as guilty and polluted, as amenable to the justice of God and
   offensive to his holiness. (2.) He felt himself to be thus guilty and
   polluted not only because of deliberate acts of transgression, but also
   for his affections, feelings, and emotions. This sense of sin attached
   not only to these positive and consciously active states of mind, but
   also to the mere absence of right affections, to hardness of heart, to
   the want of love, humility, faith, and other Christian virtues, or to
   their feebleness and inconstancy. (3.) He recognized the fact that he
   had always been a sinner. As far back as consciousness extended it was
   the consciousness of sin. (4.) He was deeply convinced that he had no
   power to change his moral nature or to make himself holy; that whatever
   liberty he possessed, however free he was in sinning, or (after
   regeneration) in holy acting, he had not the liberty of ability which
   Pelagians claimed as an essential prerogative of humanity. (5.) It was
   involved in this consciousness of sin as including guilt or just
   liability to punishment, as well as pollution, that it could not be a
   necessary evil, but must have its origin in the free act of man, and be
   therefore voluntary. Voluntary: (a.) In having its origin in an act of
   the will; (b.) In having its seat in the will; (c.) In consisting in
   the determination of the will to evil: the word will being here, as by
   Augustine generally, taken in its widest sense for everything in man
   that does not fall under the category of the understanding. (6.) What
   consciousness taught him to be true with regard to himself he saw to be
   true in regard to others. All men showed themselves to be sinners. They
   all gave evidence of sinfulness as soon as they gave evidence of
   reason. They all appeared not only as transgressors of the law of God,
   but as spiritually dead, devoid of all evidence of spiritual life. They
   were the willing slaves of sin, entirely unable to deliver themselves
   from their bondage to corruption. No man had ever given proof of
   possessing the power of self-regeneration. All who gave evidence of
   being regenerated, with one voice ascribed the work not to themselves,
   but to the grace of God. From these facts of consciousness and
   experience Augustine drew the inevitable conclusion, (1.) That if men
   are saved it cannot be by their own merit, but solely through the
   undeserved love of God. (2.) That the regeneration of the soul must be
   the exclusive and supernatural work of the Holy Ghost; that the sinner
   could neither effect the work nor coöperate in its production. In other
   words, that grace is certainly efficacious or irresistible. (3.) That
   salvation is of grace or of the sovereign mercy of God, (a.) In that
   God might justly have left men to perish in their apostasy without any
   provision for their redemption. (b.) In that men, being destitute of
   the power of doing anything holy or meritorious, their justification
   cannot be by works, but must be a matter of favour. (c.) In that it
   depends not on the will of the persons saved, but on the good pleasure
   of God, who are to be made partakers of the redemption or Christ. In
   other words, election to eternal life must be founded In the sovereign
   pleasure of God, and not on the foresight of good works. (4.) A fourth
   inference from the principles of Augustine was the perseverance of the
   saints. If God of his own good pleasure elects some to eternal life,
   they cannot fail of salvation. It thus appears that as all the
   distinguishing doctrines of the Pelagians are the logical consequences
   of their principle of plenary ability as the ground and limit of
   obligation, so the distinguishing doctrines of Augustine are the
   logical consequences of his principle of the entire inability of fallen
   man to do anything spiritually good.

   Taught by his own experience that he was from his birth guilty and
   polluted, and that he had no power to change his own nature, and seeing
   that all men are involved in the same sinfulness and helplessness, he
   accepted the Scriptural solution of these facts of consciousness and
   observation, and therefore held, (1.) That God created man originally
   in his own image and likeness in knowledge, righteousness, and
   holiness, immortal, and invested with dominion over the creatures. He
   held also that Adam was endowed with perfect liberty of the will, not
   only with spontaneity and the power of self-determination, but with the
   power of choosing good or evil, and thus of determining his own
   character. (2.) That being left to the freedom of his own will, Adam,
   under the temptation of the Devil, voluntarily sinned against God, and
   thus fell from the estate in which he was created. (3.) That the
   consequences of this sin upon Adam were the loss of the divine image,
   and the corruption of his whole nature, so that he became spiritually
   dead, and thus indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all spiritual
   good. Besides this spiritual death, he became mortal, liable to all the
   miseries of this life, and to eternal death. (4.) Such was the union
   between Adam and his descendants, that the same consequences of his
   transgression came on them that fell upon him. They are born the
   children of wrath, i.e., in a state of condemnation, destitute of the
   image of God, and morally depraved. (5.) This inherent, hereditary
   depravity is truly and properly of the nature of sin, involving both
   guilt and corruption. In its formal nature it consists in the privation
   of original righteousness and (concupiscence) inordinatio naturæ,
   disorder of the whole nature. It is of the nature of a habitus as
   distinguished from an act, activity or agency. It is voluntary, in the
   sense mentioned above, especially in that it did not arise from
   necessity of nature, or from the efficiency of God, but from the free
   agency of Adam. (6.) That the loss of original righteousness and the
   corruption of nature consequent on the fall of Adam are penal
   inflictions, being the punishment of his first sin. (7.) That
   regeneration, or effectual calling, is a supernatural act of the Holy
   Spirit, in which the soul is the subject and not the agent; that it is
   sovereign, granted or withheld according to the good pleasure of God;
   and consequently that salvation is entirely of grace.

   This is the Augustinian system in all that is essential. It is this
   which has remained, and been the abiding form of doctrine among the
   great body of evangelical Christians from that day to this. It is of
   course admitted that Augustine held much connected with the several
   points above mentioned, which was peculiar to the man or to the age in
   which he lived, but which does not belong to Augustinianism as a system
   of doctrine. As Lutheranism does not include all the individual
   opinions of Luther, and as Calvinism does not include all the personal
   views of Calvin, so there is much taught by Augustine which does not
   belong to Augustinianism. He taught that all sin is the negation of
   being; that liberty is ability, so that in denying to fallen man
   ability to change his own heart, he denies to him freedom of the will;
   that concupiscence (in the lower sense of the word), as an instinctive
   feeling, is sinful; that a sinful nature is propagated by the very law
   of generation; that baptism removes the guilt of original sin; and that
   all unbaptized infants (as Romanists still teach and almost all
   Protestants deny) are lost. These, and other similar points are not
   integral parts of his system, and did not receive the sanction of the
   Church when it pronounced in favour of his doctrine as opposed to that
   of the Pelagians. In like manner it is a matter of minor importance how
   he understood the nature of the union between Adam and his posterity;
   whether he held the representative, or the realistic theory; or whether
   he ultimately sided for Traducianism as against Creationism, or for the
   latter as against the former. On these points his language is confused
   and undecided. It is enough that he held that such was the union
   between Adam and his race, that the whole human family stood their
   probation in him and fell with him in his first transgression, so that
   all the evils which are the consequences of that transgression,
   including physical and spiritual death, are the punishment of that sin.
   On this point he is perfectly explicit. When it was objected by Julian
   that sin cannot be the punishment of sin, he replied that we must
   distinguish three things, that we must know, "aliud esse peccatum,
   aliud poenam, peccati, aliud utrumque, id est, ita peccatum, ut ipsum
   sit etiam poena peccati, . . . . pertinet originale peccatum ad hoc
   genus tertium, ubi sic peccatum est, ut ipsum sit et poena peccati."
   [165] Again he says: "Est [peccatum] . . . . non solum voluntarium
   atque possibile unde liberum est abstinere; verum etiam necessarium
   peccatum, unde abstinere liberum non est, quod jam non solum peccatum,
   sed etiam poena peccati est." [166] Spiritual death (i.e., original sin
   or inherent corruption), says Wiggers, is, according to Augustine, the
   special and principal penalty of Adam's first transgression, which
   penalty has passed on all men. [167] This is in exact accordance with
   the doctrine of the Apostle, who says: "In Adam all die," 1 Cor. xv.
   22; and that a sentence of condemnation (krima eis katakrima) for one
   offence passed on all men, Rom. v. 16, 17. This Augustine clung to as a
   Scriptural doctrine, and as a historical tact. This, however, is a
   doctrine which men have ever found it hard to believe, and a fact which
   they have ever been slow to admit. Pelagius said: [168] "Nulla ratione
   concedi ut Deus, qui propria peccata remittit, imputet aliena." And
   Julian vehemently exclaims, "Amolire te itaque cum tali Deo tuo de
   Ecclesiarum medio: non est ipse, cui Patriarchæ, cui Prophetæ, cui
   Apostoli crediderunt, in quo speravit et sperat Ecclesia primitivorum,
   quæ conscripta est in coelis; non est ipse quem credit judicem
   rationabilis creatura; quem Spiritus sanctus juste judicaturum esse
   denuntiat. Nemo prudentium, pro tali Domino suum unquam sanguinem
   fudisset: nec enim merebatur dilectionis affectum, ut suscipiendæ pro
   se onus imponeret passionis. Postremo iste quem inducis, si esset
   uspiam, reus convinceretur esse non Deus; judicandus a vero Deo meo,
   non judicaturus pro Deo." [169] To this great objection Augustine gives
   different answers. (1.) He refers to Scriptural examples in which men
   have been punished for the sins of others. (2.) He appeals to the fact
   that God visits the sins of parents upon their children. (3.) Sometimes
   he says we should rest satisfied with the assurance that the judge of
   all the earth must do right, whether we can see the justice of his ways
   or not. (4.) At others he seems to adopt the realistic doctrine that
   all men were in Adam, and that his sin was their sin, being the act of
   generic humanity. As Levi was in the loins of Abraham, and was tithed
   in him, so we were in this loins of Adam, and sinned in him. (5.) And,
   finally, he urges that as we are justified by the righteousness of
   Christ, it is not incongruous that we should be condemned for the sin
   of Adam. [170] It will be observed that some of these grounds are
   inconsistent with others. If one be valid, the others are invalid. If
   we reconcile the condemnation of men on account of the sin of Adam, on
   the ground that he was our representative, or that he sustained the
   relation which all parents bear to their children, we renounce the
   ground of a realistic union. If the latter theory be true, then Adam's
   sin was our act as truly as it was his. If we adopt the representative
   theory, his act was not our act in any other sense than that in which a
   representative acts for his constituents. From this it is plain, (1.)
   That Augustine had no clear and settled conviction as to the nature of
   the union between Adam and his race which is the ground of the
   imputation of his sin to his posterity, any more than he had about the
   origin of the soul; and (2.) That no particular theory on that point,
   whether the representative or realistic, can properly be made an
   element of Augustinianism, as a historical and church form of doctrine.

   § 6. Doctrine of the Church of Rome.

   This is a point very difficult to decide. Romanists themselves are as
   much at variance as to what their Church teaches concerning original
   sin as those who do not belong to their communion. The sources of this
   difficulty are, (1.) First, the great diversity of opinions on this
   subject prevailing in the Latin Church before the authoritative
   decisions of the Council of Trent and of the Romish Catechism. (2.) The
   ambiguity and want of precision or fulness in the decisions of that
   council. (3.) The different interpretations given by prominent
   theologians of the true meaning of the Tridentine canons.

   Diversity of Sentiment in the Latin Church.

   As to the first of these points it may be remarked that there were
   mainly three conflicting elements in the Latin Church before the
   Reformation, in relation to the whole subject of sin. (1.) The doctrine
   of Augustine. (2.) That of the Semi-Pelagians, and (3.) That of those
   of the schoolmen who endeavoured to find a middle ground between the
   other two systems. The doctrine of Augustine, as exhibited above, was
   sanctioned by the Latin Church, and pronounced to be the true orthodox
   faith. But even during the lifetime of Augustine, and to a greater
   extent in the following century, serious departures from his system
   began to prevail. These departures related to all the intimately
   connected doctrines of sin, grace, and predestination. Pelagianism was
   universally disclaimed and condemned. It was admitted that the race of
   man fell in Adam; that his sin affected injuriously his posterity as
   well as himself; that men are born in s state of alienation from God;
   that they need the power of the Holy Spirit in order to their
   restoration to holiness. But what is the nature of original sin, or of
   that depravity or deterioration of our nature derived from Adam? And,
   What are the remains of the divine image which are still preserved, or
   what is the power fur good which fallen men still possess? And What is
   to be understood by the grace of God and the extent of its influence?
   And What is the ground on which God brings some and not others to the
   enjoyment of eternal life? These were questions which received very
   different answers. Augustine, as we have seen, answered the first of
   these questions by saying that original sin consists not only in the
   loss of original righteousness, but also in concupiscence, or disorder,
   or corruption of nature, which is truly and properly sin, including
   both guilt and pollution. The second question he answered by saying
   that fallen man has no power to effect what is spiritually good; he ran
   neither regenerate himself, prepare himself for regeneration, nor
   coöperate with the grace of God in that work. These principles
   necessarily lead to the doctrines of efficacious or irresistible grace
   and of sovereign election, as was seen and universally admitted. It was
   these necessary consequences, rattler than the principles themselves,
   which awakened opposition. But to get rid of the consequences it was
   necessary that the principles should be refuted. This opposition to,
   Augustinianism arose with the monks and prevailed principally among
   them. This, as Gieseler [171] says, was very natural. Augustine taught
   that man could do nothing good of himself, and could acquire no merit
   in the sight of God. The monks believed that they could do not only
   all, but more than all that God required of them. Else why submit to
   their vows of celibacy, poverty, and obedience? The party thus formed
   against the orthodox or established doctrine was called Semi-Pelagian,
   because it held a middle ground between Pelagius and Augustine.

   The Semi-Pelagians.

   The principal leaders of this party were John Cassianus, an Eastern
   monk and disciple of Chrysostom; Vincentius Lerinensis, and Faustus of
   Rhegium. The most important work of Cassian was entitled "Collationes
   Patrum," which is a collection of dialogues on various subjects. He was
   a devout rather than a speculative writer, relying on the authority of
   Scripture for the support of his doctrine. Educated in the Greek Church
   and trained in a monastery, all his prepossessions were adverse to
   Augustinianism. And when he transferred his residence to Marseilles in
   the south of France, and found himself in the midst of churches who
   bowed to the authority of Augustine, he set himself to modify and
   soften, but not directly to oppose the distinguishing doctrines of that
   father. [172] Vincent of Lerins was a man of a different spirit and of
   higher powers. His reliance was on tradition. He held the highest
   doctrine concerning the Church, and taught that communion with her in
   faith and ordinances was the one essential condition of salvation. He
   was the author of the celebrated formula as to the rule of faith, quod
   ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus creditum est. His principal work
   is entitled "Commonitorium," or Remembrancer, a collection mainly of
   extracts. This work was long considered a standard among Romanists, and
   has been held in high repute by many Protestants for the ability which
   it displays. It was intended as a guard against heresy, by exhibiting
   what the leaders of the Church had taught against heretics, and to
   determine the principle on which the authority of the fathers was to be
   admitted. A single father, even though a bishop, confessor, or martyr,
   might err, and his teachings be properly disregarded, but when he
   concurred with the general drift of ecclesiastical teaching, i.e., with
   tradition, he was to be fully believed. [173]

   The ablest and most influential of the leaders of the Semi-Pelagian
   party was Faustus of Rhegium, who secured the condemnation of Lucidus,
   an extreme advocate of the Augustinian doctrine, in the Synod of Arles,
   475, A.D.; and who was called upon by the council to write the work "De
   gratia Dei et humanæ mentis libero arbitrio," which attained great
   celebrity and authority. The Semi-Pelagians, however, were far from
   agreeing among themselves either as to sin or as to grace. Cassian
   taught that the effects of Adam's sin on his posterity were, (1.) That
   they became mortal, and subject to the physical infirmities of this
   life. (2.) That the knowledge of nature and of the divine law which
   Adam originally possessed, was in a great measure preserved until the
   sons of Seth intermarried with the daughters of Cain, when the race
   became greatly deteriorated. (3.) That the moral effects of the fall
   were to weaken the soul in all its power for good, so that men
   constantly need the assistance of divine grace. (4.) What that grace
   was, whether the supernatural influence of the Spirit, the providential
   efficiency of God, or his various gifts of faculties and of knowledge,
   he nowhere distinctly explains. He admitted that men could not save
   themselves; but held that they were not spiritually dead; they were
   sick; and constantly needed the aid of the Great Physician. He taught
   that man sometimes began the work of conversion; sometimes God; and
   sometimes, in a certain sense, God saves the unwilling. [174] Vincent
   evidently regarded the Augustinian doctrine of original sin as making
   God the author of evil; for, he says, it assumes that God has created a
   nature, which acting according to its own laws and under the impulse of
   an enslaved will, can do nothing but sin. [175] And he pronounces
   heretical those who teach that grace saves those who do not ask, seek,
   or knock, in evident allusion to the doctrine of Augustine that it is
   not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God who
   showeth mercy. Faustus admitted a moral corruption of nature as the
   consequence of the fall of Adam, which he called original sin
   (originale delictum). In his letter to Lucidus he anathematizes the
   doctrine of Pelagius that man is born "without sin." [176] From this
   deteriorated, infirm state, no man can deliver himself. He needs the
   grace of God. But what that grace was is doubtful. From some passages
   of his writings there would seem to be meant by it only, or
   principally, the moral influence of the truth as revealed by the Spirit
   in the Scriptures. He says God draws men to him, but "Quid est
   attrahere nisi prædicare, nisi scripturarum consolationibus excitare,
   increpationibus deterrere, desideranda proponere, intentare metuenda,
   judicium comminari, præmium polliceri?" [177] Semi-Pelagians agreed,
   however, in rejecting the Pelagian doctrine that Adam's sin injured
   only himself; they admitted that the effects of that sin passed on all
   men, affecting both the soul and body. It rendered the body mortal, and
   liable to disease and suffering; and the soul it weakened, so that it
   became prone to evil and incapable, without divine assistance, of doing
   anything spiritually good. But as against Augustine they held, at least
   according to the statements of Prosper and Hilary, the advocates of
   Augustinianism in the south of France, (1.) That the beginning of
   salvation is with man. Man begins to seek God, and then God aids him.
   (2.) That this incipient turning of the soul towards God is something
   good, and in one sense meritorious. (3.) That the soul, in virtue of
   its liberty of will or ability for good, coöperates with the grace of
   God in regeneration as well as in sanctification. That these charges
   were well founded may be inferred from the decisions of the councils of
   Orange and Valence, A.D. 529, in which the doctrines of Augustine were
   again sanctioned. As the decisions of those councils were ratified by
   the Pope they were, according to the papal theory, declared to be the
   faith of the Church. Among the points thus pronounced to be included in
   the true Scriptural doctrine, are, (1.) That the consequence of Adam's
   sin is not confined to the body, or to the lower faculties of the soul,
   but involves the loss of ability to spiritual good. (2.) The sin
   derived from Adam is spiritual death. (3.) Grace is granted not because
   men seek it, but the disposition to seek is a work of grace and the
   gift of God. (1.) The beginning of faith and the disposition to believe
   is not from the human will, but from the grace of God. (5.) Believing,
   willing, desiring, seeking, asking, knocking at the door of mercy, are
   all to be referred to the work of the Spirit and not to the good which
   belongs to the nature of fallen man. The two great points, therefore,
   in dispute between the Augustinians and Semi-Pelagians were decided in
   favour of the former. Those points were (1.) That original sin, or the
   corruption of nature derived from Adam, was not simply a weakening of
   our power for good, but was spiritual death; really sin, incapacitating
   the soul for ally spiritual good. And (2.) That in the work of
   conversion it is not man that begins, but the Spirit of God. The sinner
   has no power to turn himself unto God, but is turned or renewed by
   divine grace before he can do anything spiritually good. [178]

   The decisions of the councils of Orange and Valence in favour of
   Augustinianism, did not arrest the controversy. The Semi-Pelagian party
   still continued numerous and active, and so far gained the ascendency,
   that in the ninth century Gottschalk was condemned for teaching the
   doctrine of predestination in the sense of Augustine. From this period
   to the time of the Reformation and the decisions of the Council of
   Trent, great diversity of opinion prevailed in the Latin Church on all
   the questions relating to sin, grace, and predestination. It having
   come to be generally admitted that original righteousness was a
   supernatural gift, it was also generally held that the effect of Adam's
   sin upon himself and upon his posterity was the loss of that
   righteousness. This was its only subjective effect. The soul,
   therefore, is left in the state in which it was originally created, and
   in which it existed, some said a longer, others a shorter, period, or
   no perceptible period at all, before the receipt of the supernatural
   endowment. It is in this state that met are born into the world since
   the apostasy of Adam.

   The Doctrine of Anselm.

   This loss of original righteousness was universally regarded as a penal
   evil. It was the punishment of the first sin of Adam which came equally
   upon him and upon all his descendants. The question now is, What is the
   moral state of a soul destitute of original righteousness considered as
   a supernatural gift? It was the different views taken as to the answer
   to that question, which gave rise to the conflicting views of the
   nature and consequences of original sin.

   1. Some said that this negative state was itself sinful. Admitting that
   original sin is simply the loss of original righteousness, it was
   nevertheless truly and properly sin. This was the ground taken by
   Anselm, the father of the scholastic philosophy and theology. In his
   work, "De Conceptu Virginali et Originali Peccato," he says of
   children, [179] "Quod in illis non est justitia, quam debent habere,
   non hoc fecit illorum, voluntas personalis, sicut in Adam, sed egestas
   naturalis, quam ipsa natura accepit ab Adam -- facit natura personas
   infantium peccatrices. Nullam infantibus injustitiam super prædictam
   nuditatem justitiæ. [180] Peccatum originale aliud intelligere nequeo,
   nisi ipsam--factam per inobedientiam Adæ justitiæ debitæ nuditatem."
   [181] This original sin, however, even in infants, although purely
   negative, is nevertheless truly and properly sin. Anselm says, "Omne
   peccatum est injustitia, et originale peccatum est absolute peccatum,
   unde sequitur quod est injustitia. Item si Deus non damnat nisi propter
   injustitiam; damnat autem aliquem propter originale peccatum, ergo non
   est aliud originale peccatum quam injustitia. Quod si ita est,
   originale peccatum non est aliud quam injustitia, i.e., absentia debitæ
   justitiæ." [182]

   Doctrine of Abelard.

   2. The ground taken by others of the schoolmen was that the loss of
   original righteousness left Adam precisely in the state in which he was
   created, and therefore in puris naturalibus (i.e., in the simple
   essential attributes of his nature). And as his descendants share his
   fate, they are born in the same state. There is no inherent hereditary
   corruption, no moral character either goon or bad. The want of a
   supernatural gift not belonging to the nature of man, and which must be
   bestowed as a favour, cannot be accounted to men as sin. Original sin,
   therefore, in the posterity of Adam can consist in nothing but the
   imputation to them of his first transgression. They suffer the
   punishment of that sin, which punishment is the loss of original
   righteousness. According to this view, original sin is poena but not
   culpa. It is true that the inevitable consequence of this privation of
   righteousness is that the lower powers of man's nature gain the
   ascendency over the higher, and that he grows up in sin. Nevertheless
   there is no inherent or subjective sin in the new-born infant. There is
   a natural proneness to sin arising out of the original and normal
   constitution of cur nature, and the absence of original righteousness
   which was a frenum, or check by which the lower powers were to be kept
   in subjection. But this being the condition in which Adam came from the
   hands of his Creator, it cannot be in itself sinful. Sin consists in
   assent and purpose. And, therefore, until the soul assents to this
   dominion of its lower nature and deliberately acts in accordance with
   it, it cannot be chargeable with any personal, inherent sin. There is
   therefore no sin of nature, as distinguished from actual sin. It is
   true, as the advocates of this theory taught, in obedience to the
   universal faith of the Church and the clear doctrine of the Bible, that
   men are born in sin. But this is the guilt of Adam's first sin, and not
   their own inherent corruption. They admitted the correctness of the
   Latin version of Romans v. 12, which makes the Apostle say that all men
   sinned in Adam (in quo omnes peccaverunt). But they understood that
   passage to teach nothing more than the imputation of Adam's first sin,
   and not any hereditary inherent corruption of nature. This was the
   theory of original sin adopted by Abelard, who held that nothing was
   properly of the nature of sin but an act performed with an evil
   intention. As there can be no such intention in infants there can be,
   properly speaking, no sin in them. There is a proneness to sin which he
   calls vitium; but sin consists in consent to this inclination, and not
   in the inclination itself. "Vitium itaque est, quo ad peccandum proni
   efficimur, hoc est inclinamur ad consentiendum ei, quod non convenit,
   ut illud scilicet faciamus aut dimittamus. Hunc vero consensum proprie
   peccatum nominamus, hoc est culpam animæ, qua damnationem meretur."
   [183] He admitted original sin as a punishment, or as the guilt of
   Adam's sin, but this was external and not inherent. [184] This view of
   the subject was strenuously maintained by some of the theologians of
   the Roman Church at the time of the Reformation, especially by
   Catharinus and Pighius. The latter, according to Chemnitz, [185] thus
   states his doctrine: "Quod nec carentia justitiæ originalis, nec
   concupiscentia habeat rationem peccati, sive in parvulis, sive adultis,
   sive ante, sive post baptismum. Has enim affectiones non esse vitia,
   sed naturæ conditiones in nobis. Peccatum igitur originis non esse
   defectum, non vitium aliquod non depravationem aliquam, non habitum
   corruptum, non qualitatem vitiosam hærentem in nostra substantia, ut
   quæ sit sine omni vitio et depravatione, sed hoc tantum esse peccatum
   originis, quod actualis transgressio Adæ reatu, tantum et poena
   transmissa et propagata sit ad posteros sine vitio aliquo et pravitate
   hærente in ipsorum substantia: et reatum hunc esse; quod propter Adæ
   peccatum extorres facti sumus regni coelorum, subjecti regno mortis et
   æternæ damnationi, et omnibus humanæ naturæ miseriis involuti. Sicut ex
   servis, qui proprio vitio libertatem amiserunt, nascuntur servi: non
   suo, sed parentum vitio. Et sicut filius scorti, sustinet infamiam
   matris, sine proprio aliquo in se hærente vitio." [186]

   Doctrine of Thomas Aquinas.

   3. The third form of doctrine which prevailed during this period was
   that proposed by Thomas Aquinas (A.D. 1224-74) a Dominican monk, the
   Doctor Angelicus of the schoolmen, and by far the most influential
   theologian in the Latin Church since the days of Augustine. His "Summa
   Theologiæ" was long regarded as a standard work among Romanists, and is
   still referred to as an authority both by Romanists and Protestants.
   Thomas approached much nearer to Augustine than the other theologians
   of his age. He taught (1.) That original righteousness was to Adam a
   supernatural gift. (2.) That by his transgression he forfeited that
   gift for himself and his posterity. (3.) That original righteousness
   consisted essentially in the fixed bias of the will towards God, or the
   subjection of the will to God. (4.) That the inevitable consequence or
   adjunct of the loss of this original righteousness, this conversion of
   the will towards God, is the aversion of the will from God. (5.) That
   original sin, therefore, consists in two things, first, the loss of
   original righteousness and second, the disorder of the whole nature.
   The one he called the formale the other the materiale of original sin.
   To use his own illustration, a knife is iron; the iron is the material,
   the form is that which makes the material a knife. So in original sin
   this aversion of the will from God (as a habit), is the substance of
   original sin, it owes its existence and nature to the loss of original
   righteousness. (6.) The soul, therefore, after the loss of its primal
   rectitude, does not remain in puris naturalibus, but is in a state of
   corruption and sin. This state he sometimes calls inordinatio virium
   animæ; sometimes a deordinatio; sometimes aversio voluntatis a bono
   incommunicabili; sometimes a corrupt disposition, as when he says,
   [187] "Causa hujus corruptæ dispositionis, quæ dicitur originale
   peccatum, est una tantum, scilicet privatio originalis justitiæ, per
   quam sublata est subjectio humanæ mentis ad Deum." Most frequently, in
   accordance with the usus loquendi of his own and of subsequent periods,
   this positive part of original sin is called concupiscence. This is a
   word which it is very important to understand, because it is used in
   such different senses even in relation to the same subject. Some by
   concupiscence mean simply the sexual instinct; others, what belongs to
   our sensuous nature in general; others, everything in man which has the
   seen and temporal for its object; and others still, for the wrong bias
   of the soul, by which, being averse to God, it turns to the creature
   and to evil. Everything depends therefore on the sense in which the
   word is taken, when it is said that original sin consists, positively
   considered, in concupiscence. If by concupiscence is meant merely our
   sensuous nature, then original sin is seated mainly in the body and in
   the animal affections, and the higher powers of the soul are unaffected
   by its contamination. By Thomas Aquinas the word is taken in its widest
   sense, as is obvious from its equivalents just mentioned, aversion from
   God, corrupt disposition, disorder, or deformity, of the powers of the
   soul. It is in this sense, he says, "Originale peccatum concupiscentia
   dicitur." (7.) As to the constituent elements of this original
   corruption, or as he expresses it, the wounds under which our fallen
   nature is suffering, he says, they include, (a.) Ignorance and want of
   the right knowledge of God in the intelligence. (b.) An aversion in the
   will from the highest good. (c.) In the feelings or affections, or
   rather in that department of our nature of which the feelings are the
   manifestations, a tendency to delight in created things. The seat of
   original sin, therefore, with him is the whole soul. (8.) This
   concupiscence or inherent corruption, is not an act, or agency, or
   activity, but a habit, i.e., an immanent inherent disposition of the
   mind. [188] (9.) Finally original sin is a penal evil. The loss of
   original righteousness and the consequent disorder of our nature, are
   the penalty of Adam's first transgression. So far the doctrine of
   Thomas is in strict accordance with that of Augustine. His discussion
   of the subject might be framed into an exposition of the answer in the
   "Westminster Catechism" which declares the sinfulness of that estate
   into which men fell, to consist in the guilt of Adam's first sin, the
   want of original righteousness, and the corruption of his whole nature.
   The point of difference relates to the degree of injury received from
   the apostasy of Adam, or the depth of that corruption of nature derived
   from him. This Thomas calls a languor or weakness. Men in consequence
   of the fall are utterly unable to save themselves, or to do anything
   really good in the sight of God without the aid of divine grace. But
   they still have the power to coöperate with that grace. They cannot, as
   the Semi-Pelagians taught, begin the work of turning unto God, and
   therefore need preventing grace (gratia præveniens), but with that
   grace they are enabled to coöperate. This makes the difference between
   the effectual (irresistible) grace of Augustine, and the synergism
   which enters into all other systems.

   Doctrine of the Scotists.

   4. Duns Scotus, a Franciscan, Professor of Theology at Oxford, Paris,
   and Cologne, where he died A.D. 1308, was the great opponent of Thomas
   Aquinas. So far as the subject of original sin is concerned, he sided
   with the Semi-Pelagians. He made original sin to consist solely in the
   loss of original righteousness, and as this was purely a. supernatural
   gift, not pertaining to the nature of man, its loss left Adam and his
   posterity after him, precisely in tile state in which man was
   originally created. Whatever of disorder is consequent on this loss of
   righteousness is not of the nature of sin. "Peccatum originale," he
   says, "non potest esse aliud quam ista privatio [justitiæ originalis].
   Non enim est concupiscentia: tum quia illa est naturalis, tum quia ipsa
   est in parte sensitiva, ubi non est peccatum." [189] Men, therefore,
   are born into the world in puris naturalibus, not in the Pelagian
   sense, as Pelagians do not admit any supernatural gift of righteousness
   to Adam, but in the sense that they possess all the essential
   attributes of their nature uninjured and uncontaminated. As free will,
   i.e., the ability to do and to be whatever is required of man by his
   Maker, belongs essentially to his nature, this also remains since the
   fall. It is indeed weakened and beset with difficulties, as the balance
   wheel of our nature, original righteousness, is gone, but still it
   exists. Man needs divine assistance. He cannot do good, or make himself
   good without the grace of God. But the dependence of which Scotus
   speaks is rather that of the creature upon the creator, than that of
   the sinner upon the Spirit of God. His endeavour seems to have been to
   reduce the supernatural to the natural; to confound the distinction
   constantly made in the Bible and by the Church, between the
   providential efficiency of God everywhere present and always operating
   in and with natural causes, and the efficiency of the Holy Ghost in the
   regeneration and sanctification of the soul. [190]

   The Dominicans and Franciscans became, and long continued the two most
   powerful orders of monks in the Roman Church. As they were antagonistic
   on so many other points, they were also opposed in doctrine. The
   Dominicans, as the disciples of Thomas Aquinas, were called Thomists,
   and the Franciscans, as followers of Duns Scotus, were called Scotists.
   The opposition between these parties, among other doctrinal points,
   embraced as we have seen, that of original sin. The Thomists were
   inclined to moderate Augustinianism, the Scotists to Semi-Pelagianism.
   All the theories however above mentioned, variously modified, had their
   zealous advocates in the Latin Church, when the Council of Trent was
   assembled to determine authoritatively the true doctrine and to erect a
   barrier to the increasing power of the Reformation.

   Tridentine Doctrine on Original Sin.

   The Council of Trent had a very difficult task to perform. In the first
   place, it was necessary to condemn the doctrines of the Reformers. But
   the Protestants, as well Lutheran as Reformed, had proclaimed their
   adherence to the Augustinian system in its purity and fulness; and that
   system had received the sanction of councils and popes and could not be
   directly impugned. This difficulty was surmounted by grossly
   misrepresenting the Protestant doctrine, and making it appear
   inconsistent with the doctrine of Augustine. This method has been
   persevered in to the present day. Moehler in his "Symbolik" represents
   the doctrine of the Protestants, and especially that of Luther, on
   original sin, as a form of Manicheism. The other, and more serious
   difficulty, was the great diversity of opinion existing in the Church
   and in the Council it self. Some were Augustinians; some held that
   original sin consisted simply in the want of original righteousness,
   but that that want is sin. Others admitted no original sin, but the
   imputation of Adam's first transgression. Others, with the Dominicans,
   insisted that the disorder of all the powers consequent on the loss of
   original righteousness, i.e., concupiscence, is truly and properly sin.
   This the Franciscans denied. Under these circumstances the pontifical
   legates, who attended the Council, exhorted the assembled fathers, that
   they should decide nothing as to the nature of original sin, reminding
   them that they were not called together o teach doctrines, but to
   condemn errors. [191] This advice the Council endeavoured to follow,
   and hence its decisions are expressed in very general terms.

   1. The Synod pronounces an anathema on those who do not confess that
   Adam, when he transgressed in paradise the commandment of God, did
   immediately lose the holiness and righteousness in which he had been
   constituted (constitutus fuerat, or positus erat); and that by that
   offence he incurred the wrath and indignation of God, and thus also
   death and subjection to him who has the power of death, that is, the
   devil; and that the whole Adam by the offence of his transgression was
   as to the body and the soul. changed for the worst.

   The effects of Adam's first sin upon himself therefore was: (1.) The
   loss of original righteousness. (2.) Death and captivity to Satan. (3.)
   The deterioration of his whole nature both soul and body.

   2. The Synod also anathematizes those who say that the sin of Adam
   injured himself only, and not his posterity; or that he lost the
   holiness and righteousness which he received from God, for himself only
   and not also for us, or that he transmitted to the whole human race
   only death and corporeal pains (poenas corporis), and not sin, which is
   the death of the soul.

   It is here taught that the effects of Adam's sin upon his posterity
   are: (1.) The loss of original righteousness. (2.) Death and the
   miseries of this life; and (3.) Sin, or spiritual death (peccatum, quod
   est mors animæ). This is a distinct condemnation of Pelagianism, and
   the clear assertion of original sin, as something transmitted to all
   men. The nature of that however, is not further stated than that it is
   the death of the soul, which may be differently explained.

   3. Those also are condemned who say that this sin of Adam, which is
   conveyed to all (omnibus transfusum), and inheres in every one as his
   own sin (inest unicuique proprium), can be removed by the powers of
   human nature, or by any other remedy than the merit of our one
   Mediator, the Lord Jesus Christ, who hath reconciled us to God by his
   blood, and who is made unto us righteousness, sanctification, and
   redemption.

   It is here asserted: (1.) That original sin is conveyed by propagation
   and not, as the Pelagians say, by imitation. (2.) That it belongs to
   every man and inheres in him. (3.) That it cannot be removed by any
   other means than the blood of Christ.

   4. The Synod condemns all who teach that new-born children should not
   be baptized; or, that although baptized for the remission of sins, they
   derive nothing of original sin from Adam, which needs to be expiated in
   the laver of regeneration in order to attain eternal life, so that
   baptism, in their case, would not be true but false. Children,
   therefore, who cannot have committed sin, in their own persons, are
   truly baptized for the remission of sins, that what they had contracted
   in generation, may be purged away in regeneration.

   From this it appears that according to the Council of Trent there is
   sin in new-born infants which needs to be remitted and washed away by
   regeneration.

   5. The fifth canon asserts that through the grace of our Lord Jesus
   Christ conferred in baptism, the guilt of original sin is remitted, and
   everything is removed which has the true and proper nature of sin. It
   is admitted that concupiscence (vel fomes) remains in the baptized,
   against which believers are to contend, but it is declared that this
   concupiscence, although sometimes (as is admitted) called sin by the
   Apostle, is not truly and properly sin in the regenerated.

   This is all that the Council teaches under the caption of original sin,
   except to say that they do not intend their decisions to apply to the
   Virgin Mary. Whether she was the subject of original sin, as the
   Dominicans, after Thomas Aquinas, maintained, or whether she was
   immaculately conceived, as zealously asserted by the Franciscans after
   Duns Scotus, the Synod leaves undecided.

   In the sixth session when treating of justification (i.e., regeneration
   and sanctification), the Council decides several points, which go to
   determine the view its members took of the nature of original sin. In
   the canons adopted in that session, it is among other things, declared:
   (1.) That men cannot without divine grace through Jesus Christ, by
   their own works, i.e., works performed in their own strength, be
   justified before God. (2.) That grace is not given simply to render
   good works more easy. (3.) That men cannot believe, hope, love, or
   repent so as to secure regenerating grace without the preventing grace
   of God (sine prævenienti Spiritus inspiratione, atque ejus adjutorio).
   (4.) Men can coöperate with this preventing grace, can assent to, or
   reject it. (5.) Men have not lost their liberum arbitrium, ability to
   good or evil by the fall. (6.) All works done before regeneration are
   not sinful.

   From all this it appears that while the Council of Trent rejected the
   Pelagian doctrine of man's plenary ability since the fall, and the
   Semi-Pelagian doctrine that men can begin the work of reformation and
   conversion; it no less clearly condemns the Augustinian doctrine of the
   entire inability of man to do anything spiritually good, whereby he may
   prepare or dispose himself for conversion, or merit the regenerating
   grace of God.

   The True Doctrine of the Church of Rome.

   What was the true doctrine of the Church of Rome as to original sin,
   remained as much in doubt after the decisions of this Council as it had
   been before. Each party interpreted its canons according to their own
   views. The Synod declares that all men are born infected with original
   sin; but whether that sin consisted simply in the guilt of Adam's first
   sin; or in the want of original righteousness; or in concupiscence, is
   left undecided. And therefore all these views continued to be
   maintained by the theologians of the Romish Church. The older
   Protestants generally regarded the canons of the Council of Trent as
   designed to obscure the subject, and held that the real Doctrine of the
   Church involved the denial of any original sin in the sense of sin,
   subjective or inherent. In this view, many, if not the majority of
   modern theologians concur. Winer (in his "Comparative Darstellung,")
   Guericke (in his "Symbolik"), Koellner (in his "Symbolik"), Baur (in
   his "Answer to Moehler"), and Dr. Shedd, in his "History of Christian
   Doctrine," all represent the Church of Rome as teaching that original
   sin is merely negative, the want of original righteousness, and is
   denying that there is anything subjective in the state of human nature
   as men are born into the world, which has the proper nature of sin. The
   reasons which favour this view of the subject, are, --

   1. The prevailing doctrine of the schoolmen and of the Romish
   theologians as to the nature of sin. According to Protestants,
   "Quidquid a norma justitiæ in Deo dissidet, et cum ea pugnat, habet
   rationem peccati." [192] To this the Romanists oppose from Andradius
   the definition: "Quod nihil habeat rationem peccati nisi fiat a volente
   et sciente." If this be so, then it is impossible that there should be
   any inherent or innate sin. As infants are not "knowing and willing,"
   in the sense of moral agents, they cannot have sin. Bellarmin [193]
   says: "Non satis est ad culpam, ut aliquid sit voluntarium habituali
   voluntate, sed requiritur, ut processerit ab actu etiam voluntario:
   Alioqui voluntarium illud, habituale voluntate, naturale esset, et
   misericordia non reprehensione dignum." He says, that if a man were
   created in puris naturalibus, without grace, and with this opposition
   of the flesh to the reason, he would not be a sinner. With the loss of
   original righteousness there is unavoidably connected this rebellion of
   the lower against the higher nature of man. With the loss of the bias
   of the will toward God, is of necessity connected aversion to God. This
   obliquity of the will which attends original sin, is not sin in itself,
   yet it is sin in us. For Bellarmin says, there is a "perversio
   voluntatis et obliquitas unicuique inhærens, per quam peccatores
   proprie et formaliter dicimur, cum primum homines esse incipimus." This
   certainly appears contradictory. The perversion of the will, or
   concupiscence, consequent on the loss of original righteousness, is not
   itself sinful. Nevertheless, it constitutes us properly and formally
   sinners, as soon as we begin to exist. Nothing is of the nature of sin
   but voluntary action, or what proceeds from it, and yet infants are
   sinners from their birth. He attempts to reconcile these contradictions
   by saying: "Peccatum in Adamo actuale et personale in nobis
   originaliter dicitur. Solus enim ipse actuali voluntate illud commisit,
   nobis vero communicatur per generationem eo modo, quo communicari
   potest id, quod transiit, nimirum per imputationem. Omnibus enim
   imputatur, qui ex Adamo nascuntur, quoniam omnes in lumbis Adami
   existentes in eo et per eum peccavimus, cum ipse peccavit." That is,
   the voluntary act of Adam was at the same time the act of the will of
   all his descendants. Thus original sin is sin in us, although nothing
   is sin in any creature which does not consist in an act of his own
   will, or which does not flow from such act. To this, however, Baur
   properly remarks: "What is an act of a non-existing will, an act to
   which the nature of sin is attributed, although it lies entirely out.
   side of the individual consciousness? Can any meaning be attached to
   such a representation? Does it not destroy the idea of guilt and sin,
   that it is imputed only because it is transmitted in ordinary
   generation?" [194] If a man or a church hold a theory of the nature of
   sin which is incompatible with the doctrine of original sin, it is
   argued, the existence of any such sin is thereby denied. (2.) Another
   reason urged in favour of the position that the Church of Rome denies
   original sin, is drawn from what that Church teaches of original
   righteousness. If original righteousness be a supernatural gift not
   belonging to the integrity of man's nature, its loss leaves him in the
   state in which he came from the hands of his Maker. And that state
   cannot be sinful unless God be the author of sin. Even Bellarmin, who
   contends for original sin, in a certain sense, still says that man
   since the fall is in the same state that Adam was as he was created.
   "Non magis differt status hominis post lapsum Adæ a statu ejusdem in
   puris naturalibus, quam differat spoliatus a nudo, neque deterior est
   humana natura, si culpam originalem detrahas, neque magis ignorantia et
   infirmitate laborat, quam esset et laboraret in puris naturalibus
   condita. Proinde corruptio naturæ non ex alicujus doni naturalis
   carentia, neque ex alicujus malæ qualitatis accessu, sed ex sola doni
   supernaturalis ob Adæ peccatum amissione profluxit. [195] (3.) The
   Council of Trent expressly declares that concupiscence in the baptized,
   i.e., the regenerated, is not of the nature of sin. Then it cannot be
   in the unbaptized; for its nature is not changed by baptism.

   On the other hand, however, it may be urged, (1.) That the Council of
   Trent expressly declares against the Pelagian doctrine, that Adam's sin
   injured only himself, and asserts that our whole nature, soul, and
   body, was thereby changed for the worse. (2.) They assert that we
   derived from Adam not merely a mortal nature, but sin which is the
   death of the soul. (3.) That new-born infants need baptism for the
   remission of sin, and that what is removed in the baptism of infants,
   veram et propriam peccati rationem habet. (4.) The Roman Catechism
   teaches [196] that "we are born in sin," that we are oppressed with
   corruption of nature (naturæ vitio premimur) and, [197] that we nihil
   simus, nisi putida caro; that the virus of sin penetrates to the very
   bones, i.e., rationem, et voluntatem, quæ maxime solidæ sunt animæ
   partes. This last passage does not refer expressly to original sin, but
   to the state of men generally as sinners. Nevertheless, it indicates
   the view taken by the Roman Church as to the present condition of human
   nature. (5.) Bellarmin, who is often quoted to prove that Romanists
   make original sin merely the loss of original righteousness, says: "Si
   privationem justitiæ originalis ita velit esse effectum peccati, ut non
   sit etiam ipsa vere proprieque peccatum, Concilio Tridentino manifeste
   repugnat, neque distingui potest a sententia Catharini" (who made
   original sin to consist solely in the imputation of Adam's first sin).

   From all this it appears that although the doctrine of the Roman Church
   is neither logical nor self-consistent, it is nevertheless true that
   that Church does teach the doctrine of original sin, in the sense of a
   sinful corruption of nature, or of innate, hereditary sinfulness. It is
   also to be observed that all parties in the Roman Church, before and
   after the Council of Trent, however much they differed in other points,
   united in teaching the imputation of Adam's sin; i.e., that for that
   sin the sentence of condemnation passed upon all men.

   § 7. Protestant Doctrine of Sin.

   The Protestant Churches at the time of the Reformation did not attempt
   to determine the nature of sin philosophically. They regarded it
   neither as a necessary limitation; not as a negation of being; nor as
   the indispensable condition of virtue; nor as having its seat in man's
   sensuous nature; nor as consisting in selfishness alone; nor as being,
   like pain, a mere state of consciousness, and not an evil in the sight
   of God. Founding their doctrine on their moral and religious
   consciousness and upon the Word of God, they declared sin to be the
   transgression of, or want of conformity to the divine law. In this
   definition all classes of theologians, Lutheran and Reformed, agree.
   According to Melancthon, "Peccatum recte definitur anomia, seu
   discrepantia a lege Dei, h. e., defectus naturæ et actionum pugnans cum
   lege Dei, easdemque ex ordine justitiæ divinæ ad poenam obligans."
   Gerhard says: [198] "Peccatum" seu "anomia" est "aberratio a lege, sive
   non congruentia cum lege, sive ea in ipsa natura hærat, sive in dictis,
   factis ac concupiscentiæ motibus, inveniatur." Baier says: [199]
   "Carentia conformitatis cum lege." Vitringa says: [200] "Forma peccati
   est disconvenientia actus habitus, aut status hominis cum divina lege."

   It is included in these definitions, (1.) That sin is a specific evil,
   differing from all other forms of evil. (2.) That sin stands related to
   law. The two are correlative, so that where there is no law, there can
   be no sin. (3.) That the law to which sin is thus related, is not
   merely the law of reason, or of conscience, or of expediency, but the
   law of God. (4.) That sin consists essentially in the want of
   conformity on the part of a rational creature, to the nature or law of
   God. (5.) That it includes guilt and moral pollution.

   Sin is a Specific Evil.

   Sin is a specific evil. This we know from our own consciousness. None
   but a sentient being can know what feeling is. We can neither determine
   à priori what the nature of a sensation is, nor can we convey the idea
   to any one destitute of the organs of sense. Unless we had felt pain or
   pleasure, we should not be able to understand what those words mean. If
   born blind, we cannot know light. If born deaf, we can have no idea of
   what hearing is. None but a rational creature can know what is meant by
   folly. Only creatures with an æsthetic nature can have the perception
   of beauty or of deformity. In like manner only moral beings can know
   what sin or holiness is. Knowledge in all these cases is given
   immediately in the consciousness. It would be in vain to attempt to
   determine à priori, what pain, pleasure, sight, and hearing are; much
   less to prove that there are no such sensations; or that they do not
   differ from each other and from every other form of our experience.
   Every man in virtue of his being a moral creature, and because he is a
   sinner, has therefore in his own consciousness the knowledge of sin, he
   knows that when he is not what he ought to be, when he does what he
   ought not to do, or omits what he ought to do, he is chargeable with
   sin. He knows that sin is not simply limitation of his nature; not
   merely a subjective state of his own mind, having no character in the
   sight of God; that it is not only something which is unwise, or
   derogatory to his own dignity; or simply inexpedient because hurtful to
   his own interests, or injurious to the welfare of others. He knows that
   it has a specific character of its own, and that it includes both guilt
   and pollution.

   Sin has Relation to Law.

   A second truth included in our consciousness of sin is, that it has
   relation to law. As moral and rational beings we are of necessity
   subject to the law of right. This is included in the consciousness of
   obligation. The word ought would otherwise have no meaning. To say we
   ought, is to say we are bound; that we are under authority of some
   kind. The word law, in relation to moral and religious subjects, is
   used in two senses. First, it sometimes means a controlling power, as
   when the Apostle says that he had a law in his members warring against
   the law of his mind. Secondly, it means, that which binds, a command of
   one in authority. This is the common sense of the term in the New
   Testament. As the rule which binds the conscience of men, and
   prescribes what they are to do and not to do, has been variously
   revealed in the constitution of our nature, in the Decalogue, in the
   Mosaic institutions, and in the whole Scriptures, the word is sometimes
   used in a sense to include all these forms of revelation; sometimes in
   reference exclusively to one of them, and sometimes exclusively in
   reference to another. In all cases the general idea is retained. The
   law is that which binds the conscience.

   Sin is Related to the Law of God.

   The great question is, What is that law which prescribes to man what he
   ought to be and to do? (1.) Some say it is our own reason, or the
   higher powers of the soul. Those powers have the prerogative to rule.
   Man is autonomic. He is responsible to himself. He is bound to subject
   his life, and especially his lower powers, to his reason and
   conscience. Regard to his own dignity is the comprehensive obligation
   under which he lies, and he fulfills all his duties when he lives
   worthily of himself. To this theory it is obvious to object, (a.) That
   law is something outside of ourselves and over us; entirely independent
   of our will or reason. We can neither make nor alter it. If our reason
   and conscience are perverted, and determine that to be right which is
   in its nature wrong, it does not alter the case. The law remains
   unchanged in its demands and in its authority. (b.) On this theory
   there could be no sense of guilt. When a man acts against the dictates
   of his reason, or in a manner derogatory to the dignity of his nature,
   he may feel ashamed, or degraded, but not guilty. There can be no
   conviction that he is amenable to justice, nor any of that fearful
   looking for of judgment, which the Apostle says is inseparable from the
   commission of sin. (2.) Others say the law is to be found in the moral
   order of the universe, or in the eternal fitness of things. These
   however are mere abstractions. They can impose no obligation, and
   inflict no penalty on transgression. This theory again leaves out of
   view, and entirely unaccounted for, some of the plainest facts of the
   universal consciousness of men. (3.) Others again say that an
   enlightened regard to the happiness of the universe is the only law to
   which rational creatures are subject. (4.) Others take a still lower
   view, and say that it is an enlightened regard to our own happiness
   which alone has authority over men. It is evident, however, that these
   theories deny the specific character of moral obligation. There is no
   such thing as sin, as distinguished from the unwise or the inexpedient.
   There can be no sense of guilt, no responsibility to justice, except
   for violations of rules of expediency. (5.) It is clear from the very
   constitution of our nature that we are subject to the authority of a
   rational and moral being, a Spirit, whom we know to be infinite,
   eternal, and immutable in his being and perfections. All men, in every
   age and in every part of time world, under all forms of religion, and
   of every degree of culture, have felt and acknowledged that they were
   subject to a personal being higher than themselves. No forms of
   speculative philosophy, however plausible or however widely diffused or
   confidently held in the schools or in the closet, have ever availed to
   invalidate this instinctive or intuitive judgment of the mind. Men
   ignorant of the true God have fashioned for themselves imaginary gods,
   whose wrath they have deprecated and whose favour they have endeavoured
   to propitiate. But when the Scriptural idea of God, as an infinitely
   perfect personal Being, has been once presented to the mind, it can
   never be discarded. It commends itself to the reason and the
   conscience. It solves all the enigmas of our nature. It satisfies all
   our desires and aspirations; and to this Being, to him and to his will,
   we feel ourselves bound to be conformed, and know ourselves to be
   responsible for our character and conduct. This allegiance we cannot
   possibly throw off. The law of gravitation no more inexorably binds the
   earth to its orbit than our moral nature binds us to our allegiance and
   responsibility to God. It would be as unreasonable to deny the one as
   the other, and as useless to argue against the one as against the
   other. This is clearly the doctrine of the Apostle in the passage just
   referred to. He was speaking of the most debased and vicious of the
   heathen world, men whom God had given up to a reprobate mind; and yet
   he asserts that they not only knew God, but knew his righteous
   judgment; that they who commit sin were worthy of death; that is, that
   they were rightfully subject to the authority, and inevitably exposed
   to the wrath and indignation, of moral ruler. This is a fact therefore
   given in the universal consciousness of men. Sin is related to law, and
   that law is not one of our own enacting, it is not a mere idea or
   abstraction, it is not mere truth or reason, or the fitness of things,
   but the nature and will of God. Law, as it reveals itself in the
   conscience, implies a law-giver, a being of whose will it is the
   expression, and who has the power and the purpose to enforce all its
   demands. And not only this, but one who, from the very perfection of
   his nature, must enforce them. He can no more pass by transgression
   than he can love evil. It is in vain to argue against these
   convictions. It is in vain to say, There is no God, no Being on whom we
   are dependent, and to whom we are responsible for our character and
   conduct.

   The Extent of the Law's Demands.

   The next question is, What does this law demand? This is the point on
   which there has been most diversity of opinion, and systems of theology
   as well as of morals are founded on the different answers which it has
   received. The answer given by the unsophisticated and enlightened
   conscience of men, and by the word of God, is that the law demands
   complete perfection, or the entire conformity of the moral nature and
   conduct of a rational creature with the nature and will of God. We are
   commanded to love God with all the heart, with all the soul, with all
   the strength, and with all the mind, and our neighbour as ourselves.
   This implies entire congeniality with God; the unreserved consecration
   of all our powers to his service, and absolute submission to his will.
   Nothing more than this can be required of any creature. No angel or
   glorified saint can be or do more than this, and this is what the law
   demands of every rational creature, at all times, and in every state of
   his being. In one sense this obligation is limited by the capacity (not
   the ability, in the modern theological sense of that term) of the
   creature. The capacity of a child is less than that of an adult
   Christian or of an angel. He can know less. He can contain less. He is
   on a lower stage of being. But it is the absolute moral perfection of
   the child, of the adult, or of the angel that the law demands. And this
   perfection includes the entire absence of all sin, and the entire
   conformity of nature to the image and will of God. As this is the
   doctrine of the Bible. so also it is the teaching of conscience. Every
   man, at least every Christian, feels that he sins or is sinful whenever
   and howsoever he comes short of full conformity to the image of God. He
   feels that languor, coldness of affection, defect of zeal, and the want
   of due humility, gratitude, meekness, forbearance, and benevolence are
   in him of the nature of sin. The old maxim, omne minus bonum habet
   rationem mali, authenticates itself in the conscience of every
   unsophistical believer. This was the doctrine of Augustine, who in his
   letter to Jerome, [201] says: "Plenissima (caritas) quæ jam non possit
   augeri, quamdiu hic homo vivit, est in nemine; quamdiu autem augeri
   potest, profecto illud, quod minus est quam debet, ex vitio est." The
   Lutheran and Reformed theologians assert the same principle. [202] If
   this principle be correct, if the law demands entire conformity to the
   nature and will of God, it follows: --

   1. That there can be no perfection in this life. Every form of
   perfectionism which has ever prevailed in the Church is founded either
   on the assumption that the law does not demand entire freedom from
   moral evil, or upon the denial that anything is of the nature of sin,
   but acts of the will. But if the law is so extensive in its demands as
   to pronounce all defect in any duty, all coming short in the purity,
   ardour, or constancy of holy affections, sinful, then there is an end
   to the presumption that any mere maim since the fall has ever attained
   perfection.

   2. It follows also from this principle that there can never be any
   merit of good works attributable to men in this world. By merit,
   according to the Scriptural sense of that word, is meant the claim upon
   reward as a matter of justice, founded on the complete satisfaction of
   the demands of the law. But if those demands never have been perfectly
   fulfilled by any fallen man, no such man can either be justified for
   his works, or have, as the Apostle expresses it, any kauchema, any
   claim founded on merit in the sight of God. He must always depend on
   mercy and expect eternal life as a free gift of God.

   3. Still more obviously does it follow from the principle in question
   that there can be no such thing as works of supererogation. If no man
   in this life can perfectly keep the commandments of God, it is very
   plain that no man can do more than the law demands. The Romanists
   regard the law as a series of specific enactments. Besides these
   commands which bind all men there are certain things which they call
   precepts, which are not thus universally binding, such as celibacy,
   poverty, and monastic obedience, and the like. These go beyond the law.
   By adding to the fulfilment of the commands of God, the observance of
   these precepts, a man may do more than required of him, and thus
   acquire an amount of merit greater than he needs for himself, and which
   in virtue of the communion of saints, belongs to the Church, and may be
   dispensed, through the power of the keys, for the benefit of others.
   The whole foundation of this theory is of course removed, if the law
   demands absolute perfection, to which, even according to their
   doctrine, no man evem attains in this life. He always is burdened with
   venial sins, which God in mercy does not impute as real sins, but which
   nevertheless are imperfections.

   Sin not Confined to Acts of the Will.

   4. Another conclusion drawn from the Scriptural doctrine as to the
   extent of the divine law, as held by all Augustinians, is that sin is
   not confined to acts of the will. There are three senses in which the
   word voluntary is used in connection with this subject. The first and
   strictest sense makes nothing an act of the will but an act of
   deliberate self-determination, something that is performed, sciente et
   volente. Secondly, all spontaneous, impulsive exercises of the feelings
   and affections are in a sense voluntary. And, thirdly, whatever inheres
   in the will as a habit or disposition, is called voluntary as belonging
   to the will. The doctrine of the Romish Church on these points, as
   shown in the preceding section, is a matter of dispute among Romanists
   themselves. The majority of the schoolmen and of the Roman theologians
   deny that anything is of the nature of sin, but voluntary acts in the
   first sense of the word voluntary above mentioned. How they endeavour
   to reconcile the doctrine of hereditary, inherent corruption, or
   original sin, with that principle has already been stated. Holding that
   principle, however, they strenuously deny that mere impulses, the motus
   primo primi, as they are called, of evil dispositions are of the nature
   of sin. To this doctrine they are forced by their view of baptism. In
   that ordinance, according to their theory, everything of the nature of
   sin is removed. But concupiscence with its motions remains. These,
   however, if not deliberately assented to and indulged, are not sinful.
   Whether they are or not, of course depends on the extent of the law.
   Nothing is sinful but what is contrary to the divine law. If that law
   demands perfect conformity to the image of God, then these impulses of
   evil are clearly sinful. But if the law takes cognizance only of
   deliberate acts they are not. The Protestant doctrine which pronounces
   these impulsive acts to be of the nature of sin is confirmed by the
   consciousness of the believer. He recognizes as evil in their own
   nature the first risings of malice, envy, pride, or cupidity. He knows
   that they spring from an evil or imperfectly sanctified nature They
   constitute part of the burden of corruption which he hopes to lay down
   in the grave; and he knows that as he shall be free from them in
   heaven, they never disturbed the perfectly holy soul of his blessed
   Lord, to whose image he is even now bound to be conformed.

   5. It follows from the principle that the law condemns all want of
   conformity to the nature of God, that it condemns evil dispositions or
   habits, as well as all voluntary sins, whether deliberate or impulsive.
   According to the Bible and the dictates of conscience there is a
   sinfulness as well as sins; there is such a thing as character as
   distinguished from transient acts by which it is revealed; that is, a
   sinful state, abiding, inherent, immanent forms of evil, which are
   truly and properly of the nature of sin. All sin, therefore, is not an
   agency, activity, or act; it may be and is also a condition or state of
   the mind. This distinction between habitual and actual sin has been
   recognized and admitted in the Church from the beginning. Our Lord
   teaches us this distinction when He speaks of an evil heart as
   distinguished from evil exercises, which are as distinct as a tree and
   its fruits. The Apostle speaks of sin as a law, or controlling
   principle regulating or determining his acts even in despite of his
   better nature. He says sin dwells in him. He complains of it as a
   burden too heavy to be borne, from which he groans to be delivered. And
   his experience in this matter is the experience (we do not say the
   theory) of all the people of God. They know there is more in them of
   the nature of sin than mere acts and exercises; that their heart is not
   right in the sight of God; that the fountain from which the waters flow
   is itself bitter; that the tree is known by its fruits.

   Sin is Want of Conformity to the Law of God.

   Protestants teach not only that sin is a specific evil, that it has
   relation to law, that that law is the nature and will of God, and that
   it takes cognizance of and condemns all forms and degrees of moral evil
   or want of moral excellence, but also that the formal nature of sin is
   the want of conformity to the divine law or standard of excellence.
   This want of conformity is not a mere negation, such as may be
   predicated of a stone or of a brute, of whom it may be said they are
   not conformed to the image of God. The want of conformity to the divine
   law which constitutes sin is the want of congeniality of one moral
   nature with another; of the dependent and created nature with the
   infinitely holy nature, which of necessity is not only the sum but the
   standard of all excellence. Herein is sin that we are not like God. As
   the opposite of reason is unreason, the opposite of wisdom is folly,
   and the opposite of good is evil; so the opposite of the divine
   holiness is sin. It matters not of what exercises or states in the
   nature of a moral being this opposition may be predicated; of
   deliberate acts, of merely impulsive acts, or of dispositions or
   habits; if opposed to the divine nature it is sin, hateful in itself
   and worthy of condemnation. There is a positive element, therefore, in
   all sin. That is, it is not merely the privation of righteousness, but
   it is positive unrighteousness. Because the absence of the one in a
   moral nature is the other. The want of congeniality with God is
   alienation from God, and, as the Scriptures say, enmity towards Him.
   The Protestant symbols and theologians, therefore, in defining sin, not
   merely as selfishness or the love of the creature or the love of the
   world, which are only modes of its manifestation, but as the want of
   conformity of an act, habit, or state of a man with the divine law,
   which is the revelation of the divine nature, have in their support
   both reason and conscience. This doctrine of the nature of sin is fully
   sustained by the authority of Scripture. The Apostle John says that all
   want of conformity to law is sin. The two ideas hamartia and anomia are
   coextensive. Whatever is the one, is the other. It seems that some in
   the Apostle's day were disposed to limit the demands of the divine law,
   and regard certain things not specifically forbidden as lawful. In
   opposition to this, the Apostle tells them that everything evil is
   unlawful; for the very nature of evil is want of conformity to law: pas
   ho poion ten hamartian kai ten anomian poiei, he who commits sin
   commits anomia, for he hamartia estin he anomia, for all want of
   conformity to law is sin. (1 John iii. 4.) With this agree also all the
   representations of Scripture. The words there used for sin in all its
   forms, express the idea of non-conformity to a standard. And besides
   this the Bible everywhere teaches that God is the source and standard
   of all good. His favour is the life of the soul. Congeniality with Him,
   conformity to his will and nature, is the idea and perfection of all
   excellence; and the opposite state, the want of this congeniality and
   conformity, is the sum and essence of all evil.

   Sin includes Guilt and Pollution.

   Sin includes guilt and pollution; the one expresses its relation to the
   justice, the other to the holiness of God. These two elements of sin
   are revealed in the conscience of every sinner. He knows himself to be
   amenable to the justice of God and offensive in his holy eyes. He is to
   himself even, hateful and degraded and self-condemned. There are,
   however, two things included in guilt. The one we express by the words
   criminality, demerit, and blame worthiness; the other is the obligation
   to suffer the punishment due to our offences. These are evidently
   distinct, although expressed by the same word. The guilt of our sins is
   said to have been laid upon Christ, that is, the obligation to satisfy
   the demands of justice on account of them. But He did not assume the
   criminality, the demerit, or blameworthiness of our transgressions.
   When the believer is justified, his guilt, but not his demerit, is
   removed. He remains in fact, and in his own eyes, the same unworthy,
   hell-deserving creature, in himself considered, that he was before. A
   man condemned at a human tribunal for any offence against the
   community, when he has endured the penalty which the law prescribes, is
   no less unworthy, his demerit as much exists as it did from the
   beginning; but his liability to justice or obligation to the penalty of
   the law, in other words, his guilt in that sense of the word, is
   removed. It would be unjust to punish him a second time for that
   offence. This distinction theologians are accustomed to express by the
   terms reatus culpæ and reatus poenæ. Culpa is (strafwürdiger Zustand)
   blameworthiness; and reatus culpæ is guilt in the form of inherent
   ill-desert: whereas the reatus poenæ is the debt we owe to justice.
   That guilt, in the comprehensive sense of the word, and pollution enter
   into the nature of sin, or are inseparable from it, is not only
   revealed in our own consciousness, but is everywhere assumed in
   Scripture. The Bible constantly declares that sin and all sin,
   everything which bears its nature, is not only hateful in the sight of
   a holy God, but is the object of his wrath and indignation, the just
   ground for the infliction of punishment.

   This is admitted, and cannot be denied. The only question is, What is
   necessary in order to the sense of guilt as it exists in the
   conscience? Or, What is required to constitute anything a just ground
   of punishment in the sight of God? Is it sufficient that the thing
   itself should be sinful? Or, Is it necessary that it should be due to
   our own voluntary act? This latter ground is taken not only by
   Pelagians, and by all who define sin to be the voluntary transgression
   of known law, but also by many who hold to habitual, as distinguished
   from actual sin, and who even acknowledge that men are born in sin.
   They still insist that even evil innate, inherent sin, must be
   referrible to our own voluntary agency, or it cannot be guilt in us.
   But this is, --

   1. Contrary to our own consciousness. The existence of sin in the
   heart, the presence of evil dispositions, without regard to their
   origin, is unavoidably attended by a sense of pollution an guilt. These
   dispositions being evil in their own nature must include whatever is
   essential to that nature. And, as has been acknowledged, guilt is
   essential to the nature of sin. Nothing is sinful which does not
   involve guilt. The consciousness, or the conviction of sin, must
   therefore include the conviction of guilt. And consequently if we are
   convinced from the declarations of Scripture and from the state of our
   nature that we are born in sin we must be convinced that guilt attaches
   to innate corruption of nature. Besides this, habitual or indwelling
   sin is not voluntary in the sense of being designed or intended, or in
   the sense of being under the power of the will, and yet all Christians
   admit that such indwelling sin is a dreadful load of guilt; a load more
   burdensome to the heart and conscience than all our actual
   transgressions.

   2. The principle in question is no less opposed to the common judgments
   of men. All men instinctively judge a man for what he is. If he is good
   they so regard him. If he is bad, they pronounce him to be bad. This
   judgment is just as inevitable or necessary as that he is tall or
   short, learned or unlearned. The question as to the origin of the man's
   character does not enter into the grounds of this judgment. If born
   good, if he made himself good, or if he received his goodness as a gift
   from God, does not materially affect the case. He is good, and must be
   so regarded and treated. In like manner all that is necessary in order
   to justify and necessitate the judgment that a man is bad is that he
   should be so. This is the principle on which we judge ourselves, and on
   which men universally judge each other. The principle, therefore, must
   be sound.

   3. The doctrine that sin in order to include guilt must be referrible
   to our own voluntary action, is contrary to analogy. It is not so with
   holiness. Adam was created holy. His holiness as truly constituted his
   character as though it had been self-acquired, and had it been
   retained, it would have continued to be, and so long as it was retained
   it was an object of complacency and the ground of reward in the sight
   of God. Habitual grace, as it is called, or the new principle of
   spiritual life, imparted to the soul in regeneration, is not
   self-produced. It is due to the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit,
   nevertheless it constitutes the believer's character. The only reason
   why it is not meritorious, is that it is so imperfect, and because it
   cannot cancel the debt we already owe to the justice of God. The soul,
   however, if perfectly sanctified by the Holy Ghost is just as pure,
   just as much an object of approbation and delight in the sight of God
   as an unfallen angel.

   4. The doctrine in question contradicts the faith of the Church
   Universal. A distinction must be made between the faith of the Church
   and the speculations (or even the doctrines) of theologians. These are
   often divergent. The former is determined by the Scriptures and the
   inward teachings of the Spirit; the latter are greatly modified by the
   current philosophy of the age in which those theologians lived, and by
   the idiosyncrasies of their own minds. During the Middle Ages, for
   example, the speculations of the schoolmen and the faith of the Church,
   had very little in common. The faith of the Church is to be found in
   its creeds, prayers, and forms of devotion generally. In all these,
   through every age, the Church has shown that she regards all men as
   burdened with original sin, as belonging to a polluted and guilty race,
   polluted and guilty from the first moment of existence. It cannot be
   said that the Church believed original sin to be due to the agency of
   each individual man, or to the act of generic humanity. These are
   thoughts foreign to the minds of common believers. The conviction
   therefore must have existed in the Church always and everywhere that
   guilt may be present which does not attach to the voluntary agency of
   the guilty. Infants have always been baptized for the remission of sin,
   and men have ever been regarded by the Church as born in sin.

   5. The explanation given of the undeniable fact of innate pollution and
   guilt, by those who admit the fact, and yet maintain that this original
   sin is referrible to our own agency, is altogether unsatisfactory. That
   explanation is that we acted thousands of years before we existed, that
   is, that the substance which constitutes our individual souls,
   committed, in the person of Adam, the sin of disobeying God in
   paradise. This explanation of course presupposes the fact to be
   explained. The fact remains whatever becomes of the explanation. Men
   are born in a state of guilt and pollution All that follows from the
   rejection of the explanation is, that sin may exist, which is not
   referrible to the voluntary agency of those in whom it inheres. This
   consequence is far easier of admission, in the judgment of the vast
   majority of men, than the doctrine that we are personally chargeable
   with eating the forbidden fruit as our own act.

   6. The Bible in everywhere teaching that men are born in sin, that they
   come into the world the children of wrath, does thereby teach that
   there can be, and that there is sin (pollution and guilt) which is
   inherited and derived, which is inherent and innate, and therefore not
   referrible to our own agency. As the Scriptures nowhere teach that we
   actually sinned before we existed, they assert the fact which enters
   into the common faith of the Church, that guilt attaches to all sin
   however that sin originates.

   § 8. The Effects of Adam's Sin upon his Posterity.

   That the sin of Adam injured not himself only but also all descending
   from him by ordinary generation, is part of the faith of the whole
   Christian world. The nature and extent of the evil thus entailed upon
   his race, and the ground or reason of the descendants of Adam being
   involved in the evil consequences of his transgression, have ever been
   matter of diversity and discussion. As to both of these points the
   common Augustinian doctrine is briefly stated in the Symbols of our
   Church. According to our standards, "the sinfulness of that estate
   whereinto man fell consists in the guilt of Adam's first sin, the want
   of original righteousness, and the corruption of his whole nature,
   which is commonly called original sin, together within all actual
   transgressions which proceed from it." This corruption of nature is in
   the Confession of Faith declared to be "both in itself and in all
   motions thereof, truly and properly sin." And in virtue of this
   original corruption men are "utterly indisposed, disabled, and made
   opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil." As to the
   ground of these evils, we are taught that "the covenant being made with
   Adam not only for himself, but for his posterity, all mankind
   descending from him by ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell
   with him in his first transgression." Or, as it is expressed in the
   Confession, "Our first parents, being the root of all mankind, the
   guilt of their sin was imputed, and the same death in sin and corrupted
   nature were conveyed to all their posterity, descending from them by
   ordinary generation."

   In this view of the relation of mankind to Adam, and of the
   consequences of his apostasy, the three leading subjects included, are
   the imputation of Adam's first sin; the corruption of nature derived
   from him; and the inability of fallen man to any spiritual good.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 9. Immediate Imputation.

   It being admitted that the race of man participates in the evil
   consequences of the fall of our first parent, that fact is accounted
   for on different theories.

   1. That which is adopted by Protestants generally, as well Lutherans as
   Reformed, and also by the great body of the Latin Church is, that in
   virtue of the union, federal and natural, between Adam and his
   posterity, his sin, although not their act, is so imputed to them that
   it is the judicial ground of the penalty threatened against him coming
   also upon them. This is the doctrine of immediate imputation.

   2. Others, while they admit that a corrupt nature is derived from Adam
   by all his ordinary posterity, yet deny, first, that this corruption or
   spiritual death is a penal infliction for his sin; and second, that
   there is any imputation to Adam's descendants of the guilt of his first
   sin. All that is really imputed to them is their own inherent,
   hereditary depravity. This is the doctrine of mediate imputation.

   3. Others discard entirely the idea of imputation, so far as Adam's sin
   is concerned, and refer the hereditary corruption of men to the general
   law of propagation. Throughout the vegetable and animal kingdoms, like
   begets like. Man is not an exception to that law. Adam having lost his
   original righteousness and corrupted his nature by his apostasy,
   transmits that despoiled and deteriorated nature to all his
   descendants. To what extent man's nature is injured by the fall, is
   left undetermined by this theory. According to some it is so
   deteriorated as to be in the true Scriptural sense of the term,
   spiritually dead, while according to others, the injury is little if
   anything more than a physical infirmity, an impaired constitution which
   the first parent has transmitted to his children.

   4. Others again adopt the realistic theory, and teach that as generic
   humanity existed whole and entire in the persons of Adam and Eve, their
   sin was the sin of the entire race. The same numerical rational and
   voluntary substance which acted in our first parents, having been
   communicated to us, their act was as truly and properly our act, being
   the act of our reason and will, as it was their act. It is imputed to
   us therefore not as his, but as our own. We literally sinned in Adam,
   and consequently the guilt of that sin is our personal guilt and the
   consequent corruption of nature is the effect of our own voluntary act.

   5. Others, finally, deny any causal relation, whether logical or
   natural, whether judicial or physical, between the sin of Adam and the
   sinfulness of his race. Some who take this ground say that it was a
   divine constitution, that, if Adam sinned, all men should sin. The one
   event was connected with the other only in the divine purpose. Others
   say that there is no necessity to account for the fact that all men are
   sinners, further than by referring no their liberty of will. Adam
   sinned, and other men sin. That is all. The one fact us as easily
   accounted for as the other.

   Statement of the Doctrine of Immediate Imputation.

   The first of the above mentioned doctrines is that presented in the
   Symbols of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches, and by the great body of
   the theologians of those great historical branches of the Protestant
   community. [203] What that doctrine is may be stated in few words. To
   impute is simply to attribute to, as we are said to impute good or bad
   motives to anyone. In the juridical and theological sense of the word,
   to impute is to attribute anything to a person or persons, upon
   adequate grounds, as the judicial or meritorious reason of reward or
   punishment, i.e., of the bestowment of good or the infliction of evil.
   The most elaborate discussion of the Hebrew word chsv and the Greek
   logizomai, used in Scripture in relation to this subject, gives nothing
   beyond the simple result above mentioned.

   1. To impute is to reckon to, or to lay to one's account. So far as the
   meaning of the word is concerned, it makes no difference whether the
   thing imputed be sin or righteousness; whether it is our own
   personally, or the sin or righteousness of another.

   2. To impute sin, in Scriptural and theological language, is to impute
   the guilt of sin. And by guilt is meant not criminality or moral
   ill-desert, or demerit, much less moral pollution, but the judicial
   obligation to satisfy justice. Hence the evil consequent on the
   imputation is not an arbitrary infliction; not merely a misfortune or
   calamity; not a chastisement in the proper sense of that word, but a
   punishment, i.e., an evil inflicted in execution of the penalty of law
   and for the satisfaction of justice.

   3. A third remark in elucidation of what is meant by the imputation of
   Adam's sin is, that by all theologians, Reformed and Lutheran, it is
   admitted, that in the imputation of Adam's sin to us, of our sins to
   Christ, and of Christ's righteousness to believers, the nature of
   imputation is the same, so that the one case illustrates the others.
   When it is said that our sins were imputed to Christ, or that He bore
   our sins, it is not meant that he actually committed our sins, or that
   He was morally criminal on account of them, or that the demerit of them
   rested upon Him. All that is meant is that He assumed, in the language
   of the older theologians, "our law-place." He undertook to answer the
   demands of justice for the sins of men, or, as it is expressed by the
   Apostle, to be made a curse for them. In like manner, when it is said
   that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, it does not
   mean that they wrought out that righteousness, that they were the
   agents of the acts of Christ in obeying the law; nor that the merit of
   his righteousness is their personal merit; nor that it constitutes
   their moral character; it simply means that his righteousness, having
   been wrought out by Christ for the benefit of his people, in their
   name, by Him as their representative, it is laid to their account, so
   that God can be just in justifying the ungodly. Much of the difficulty
   on this subject arises from the ambiguity of language. The words
   righteous and unrighteous have two distinct meanings. Sometimes they
   express moral character. A righteous man is an upright or good man. At
   other times, these words do not express moral character, but simply
   relation to justice. In this sense a righteous man is one with regard
   to whom the demands of justice are satisfied. He may be personally
   unrighteous (or ungodly) and legally righteous. If this were not so, no
   sinner could be saved. There is not a believer on earth who does not
   feel and acknowledge himself to be personally unrighteous,
   ill-deserving, meriting the wrath and curse of God. Nevertheless he
   rejoices in the assurance that the infinitely meritorious righteousness
   of Christ, his full atonement for all sin, constitutes Him legally, not
   morally, righteous in the sight of divine justice. When, therefore, God
   pronounces the unrighteous to be righteous, He does not declare them to
   be what they are not. He simply declares that their debt to justice has
   been paid by another. And when it is said that the sin of Adam is
   imputed to his posterity, it is not meant that they committed his sin,
   or were the agents of his act, nor is it meant that they are morally
   criminal for his transgression; that it is for them the ground of
   remorse and self-reproach; but simply that in virtue of the union
   between him and his descendants, his sin is the judicial ground of the
   condemnation of his race, precisely as the righteousness of Christ is
   the judicial ground of the justification of his people. So much for the
   statement of the question.

   It is no less a doctrine of Scripture than a fact of experience that
   mankind are a fallen race. Men universally, under all the circumstances
   of their being in this world, are sinful, and exposed to innumerable
   evils. Many of these, and that in many instances the most appalling,
   come upon the children of men in early infancy anterior to any possible
   transgressions of their own. This is a fact which cannot be denied; and
   for which the human mind has tortured itself to find a solution. The
   Scriptural solution of this fearful problem is, that God constituted
   our first parent the federal head and representative of his race, and
   placed him on probation not only for himself, but also for all his
   posterity. Had he retained his integrity, he and all his descendants
   would have been confirmed in a state of holiness and happiness forever.
   As he fell from the estate in which he was created, they fell with him
   in his first transgression, so that the penalty of that sin came upon
   them as well as upon him. Men therefore stood their probation in Adam.
   As he sinned, his posterity come into the world in a state of sin and
   condemnation. They are by nature the children of wrath. The evils which
   they suffer are not arbitrary impositions, nor simply the natural
   consequences of his apostasy, but judicial inflictions. The loss of
   original righteousness, and death spiritual and temporal under which
   they commence their existence, are the penalty of Adam's first sin. We
   do not say that this solution of the problem of man's sinfulness and
   misery, is without its difficulties; for the ways of God are past
   finding out. But it may be confidently asserted, first, that it is the
   Scriptural solution of that problem; and secondly, that it is far more
   satisfactory to the reason, the heart, and the conscience, than any
   other solution which the ingenuity of man has ever suggested. This is
   proved by its general acceptance in the Christian Church.

   The Ground of the Imputation of Adam's Sin.

   The ground of the imputation of Adam's sin, or the reason why the
   penalty of his sin has come upon all his posterity, according to the
   doctrine above stated, is the union between us and Adam. There could of
   course be no propriety in imputing the sin of one man to another unless
   there were some connection between them to explain and justify such
   imputation. The Scriptures never speak of the imputation of the sins of
   angels either to men or to Christ, or of his righteousness to them;
   because there is no such relation between men and angels, or between
   angels and Christ, as to involve the one in the judicial consequences
   of the sin or righteousness of the other. The union between Adam and
   his posterity which is the ground of the imputation of his sin to them,
   is both natural and federal. He was their natural head. Such is the
   relation between parent and child, not only in the case of Adam and his
   descendants, but in all other cases, that the character and conduct of
   the one, of necessity to a greater or less degree affect the other. No
   fact in history is plainer than that children bear the iniquities of
   their fathers. They suffer for their sins. There must be a reason for
   this; and a reason founded in the very constitution of our nature. But
   there was something peculiar in the case of Adam. Over and beyond this
   natural relation which exists between a man and his posterity, there
   was a special divine constitution by which he was appointed the head
   and representative of his whole race.

   Adam the Federal Head of his Race.

   1. The first argument, therefore, in favour of the doctrine of
   imputation is that the Scriptures present Adam as not only the natural,
   but also the federal head of his posterity. This is plain, as already
   remarked, from the narrative given in Genesis. Everything there said to
   Adam was said to him in his representative capacity. The promise of
   life was for him and for his seed after him. The dominion within which
   he was invested, belonged to his posterity as well as to himself. All
   the evils threatened against him in case of transgression, included
   them, and have in fact come upon them. They are mortal; they have to
   earn their bread by the sweat of their brows; they are subject to all
   the inconveniences and sufferings arising from the banishment of our
   first parents from paradise and from the curse pronounced for man's
   sake upon the earth. They no less obviously are born into the world
   destitute of original righteousness and subject to spiritual death. The
   full penalty, therefore, threatened against Adam, has been inflicted
   upon them. It was death with the promise of redemption. Now that these
   evils are penal in our case as well as in his, is plain, because
   punishment is suffering inflicted in execution of a threatening, and
   for the satisfaction of justice. It matters not what that suffering may
   be. Its character as penalty depends not on its nature, but upon the
   design of its infliction. One man, as before remarked, may be shut up
   in a prison to protect him from popular violence; another, in execution
   of a legal sentence. In one case the imprisonment is a favour, in the
   other, it is a punishment. As therefore, the evils which men suffer on
   account of the sin of Adam, are inflicted in execution of the penalty
   threatened against him, they are as truly penal in our case as they
   were in his; and he was consequently treated as the federal head and
   representative of his race. Besides the plain assumption of the truth
   of this federal relation, it is expressly asserted in the Word of God.
   The parallel drawn by the Apostle between Adam and Christ relates
   precisely to this point. Adam was the type of Him who was to come,
   because as the one was the representative of his race, so the other is
   the representative of his people. And the consequences of the relation
   are shown to be in like manner analogous. It was because Adam was the
   representative of his race, that his sin is the judicial ground of
   their condemnation; and it is because Christ is the representative of
   his people, that his righteousness is the judicial ground of the
   justification of believers.

   The Representative Principle in the Scriptures.

   2. This representative principle pervades the whole Scriptures. The
   imputation of Adam's sin to his posterity is not an isolated fact. It
   is only an illustration of a general principle which characterizes the
   dispensations of God from the beginning of the world. God declared
   himself to Moses to be, "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
   long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for
   thousands, forgiving iniquity amid transgression, and sin, and that
   will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers
   upon the children, and upon the children's children unto the third and
   to the fourth generation." (Ex. xxxiv. 6, 7.) Jeremiah says: "Thou
   showest loving-kindness unto thousands. and recompensest the iniquities
   of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them. The Great,
   the Mighty God, the Lord of Hosts, is his name." (Jer. xxxii. 18.) The
   curse pronounced on Canaan fell upon his posterity. Esau's selling his
   birthright, shut out his descendants from the covenant of promise. The
   children of Moab and Ammon were excluded from the congregation of the
   Lord forever, because their ancestors opposed the Israelites when they
   came out of Egypt. In the case of Dathan and Abiram, as in that of
   Achan, "their wives, and their sons, and their little children"
   perished for the sins of their parents. God said to Eli that the
   iniquity of his house should not be purged with sacrifice and offering
   forever. To David it was said, "The sword shall never depart from thy
   house; because thou hast despised me, and mast taken the wife of Uriah
   the Hittite to be thy wife." To the disobedient Gehazi it was said:
   "The leprosy of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed
   forever." The sin of Jereboam and of the men of his generation
   determined the destiny of the ten tribes for all time. The imprecation
   of the Jews, when they demanded the crucifixion of Christ. "His blood
   be on us and on our children," still weighs down the scattered people
   of Israel. Our Lord himself said to the Jews of his generation that
   they built the sepulchres of the prophets whom their fathers had slain,
   and thus acknowledged themselves to be the children of murderers, and
   that therefore the blood of those prophets should be required at their
   hands. This principle runs through the whole Scriptures. When God
   entered into covenant with Abraham, it was not for himself only but
   also for his posterity. They were bound by all the stipulations of that
   covenant. They shared its promises and its threatenings, and in
   hundreds of cases the penalty of disobedience came upon those who had
   no personal part in the transgressions. Children suffered equally with
   adults in the judgments, whether famine, pestilence, or war, which came
   upon the people for their sins. In like manner, when God renewed and
   enlarged the Abrahamic covenant at Mount Sinai, it was made with the
   adults of that generation as representing their descendants to the
   remotest generations. And the Jews to this day are suffering the
   penalty of the sins of their fathers for their rejection of Him of whom
   Moses and the prophets spoke. The whole plan of redemption rests on
   this same principle. Christ is the representative of his people, and on
   this ground their sins are imputed to Him and his righteousness to
   them. In like manner, in the baptismal covenant, the parent acts for
   the child, and binds him without the child's consent, and the destiny
   of the child is, as a general rule, suspended on the fidelity of the
   parent. No man who believes the Bible, can shut his eyes to the fact
   that it everywhere recognizes the representative character of parents,
   and that the dispensations of God have from the beginning been founded
   on the principle that children bear the iniquities of their fathers.
   This is one of the reasons which infidels assign for rejecting the
   divine origin of the Scriptures. But infidelity furnishes no relief.
   History is as full of this doctrine as the Bible is. The punishment of
   the felon involves his family in his disgrace and misery. The
   spendthrift and drunkard entail poverty and wretchedness upon all
   connected within them. There is no nation now existing on the face of
   the earth, whose condition for weal or woe is not largely determined by
   the character and conduct of their ancestors. If, unable to solve the
   mysteries of Providence, we plunge into Atheism, we only increase a
   thousand fold the darkness by which we are surrounded. It is easier to
   believe that all things are guided by infinite reason and goodness, and
   are certain to result in the highest glory of God, and in the highest
   blessedness of the universe, than to believe that this vast aggregate
   of sin and misery is the working of blind force without purpose and
   without end.

   If the fact be admitted that we bear the consequences of Adam's sin,
   and that children suffer for the iniquities of their fathers, it may be
   said that this is not to be referred to the justice of God, but to the
   undesigned working of a general law, which in despite of incidental
   evil, is on the whole beneficent. The difficulty on that assumption
   instead of being lessened, is only increased. On either theory the
   nature and the degree of suffering are the same. The innocence of the
   sufferers is the same. The only difference relates to the question, Why
   they suffer for offences of which they are not personally guilty? The
   Bible says these sufferings are judicial; they are inflicted as
   punishment for the support of law. Others say, they are merely natural
   consequences, or arbitrary inflictions of a sovereign. If a king should
   put the children of a rebel to death, would it relieve his conduct from
   reproach to say that it was an act of arbitrary sovereignty? If the
   prevention of crime be one important end of punishment (although not
   its primary end), would it not be a relief to say, that the death of
   the children was designed to prevent other parents from rebelling? That
   the execution of the children of a criminal by a human sovereign would
   be a cruel and unjust punishment, may be admitted, while it is, and
   must be denied, that it is unjust in God that he should visit the
   iniquities of the fathers upon their children. In the first place no
   human sovereign has the right over his subjects which belongs to God
   over his creatures as their Creator. And in the second place, no human
   sovereign has the power and wisdom to secure the highest good from the
   penalties which he attaches to the violations of law. We cannot infer
   that because a course of action would be wrong in man, therefore it
   must be unjust in God. No man could rightfully send pestilence or
   famine through a land, but God does send such visitations not only
   righteously, but to the manifestation of his own glory and to the good
   of his creatures.

   The same Principle involved in other Doctrines.

   That the sin of Adam is imputed to his posterity is proved not only
   (1.) From the fact that he was their natural head and representative;
   and (2.) From the fact that this principle of representation pervades
   the Scriptures; and (3.) From the fact that it is the ground on which
   the providence of God is administered. (4.) From the fact that evils
   consequent on the apostasy of Adam are expressly declared in Scripture
   to be penal inflictions put also (5.) From the fact that the principle
   of imputation is involved in other great doctrines of the Bible. The
   assumption that one man cannot righteously, under the government of
   God, be punished for the sins of another, is not only contrary, as we
   have seen to the express declarations of Scripture and to the
   administration of the divine government from the beginning, but it is
   subversive of the doctrines of atonement and justification. The idea ot
   the transfer of guilt or of vicarious punishment lies at the foundation
   of all the expiatory offerings under the Old Testament, and of the
   great atonement under the new dispensation. To bear sin, is in
   Scriptural language to bear the penalty of sin. The victim bore the sin
   of the offerer. Hands were imposed upon the head of the animal about to
   be slaughtered, to express the transfer of guilt. That animal must be
   free from all defect or blemish to make it the more apparent that its
   blood was shed not for its own deficiencies but for the sin of another.
   All this was symbolical and typical. There could be no real transfer of
   guilt made to an irrational animal, and no real atonement made by its
   blood. But these services were significant. They were intended to teach
   these great truths: (1.) That the penalty of sin was death. (2.) That
   sin could not be pardoned without an atonement. (3.) That atonement
   consists in vicarious punishment. The innocent takes the place of the
   guilty and bears the penalty in his stead. This is the idea attached to
   expiatory offerings in all ages and among all nations. This is the idea
   inculcated in every part of the Bible. And this is what the Scriptures
   teach concerning the atonement of Christ. He bore our sins; He was made
   a curse for us; He suffered the penalty of the law in our stead. All
   this proceeds on the ground that the sins of one man can be justly, on
   some adequate ground, imputed to another. In justification the same
   radical idea is included. Justification is not a subjective change in
   the moral state of the sinner; it is not mere pardon; it is not simply
   pardon and restoration to favour, as when a rebel is forgiven and
   restored to the enjoyment of his civil rights. It is a declaration that
   the demands of justice have been satisfied. It proceeds on the
   assumption that the righteousness which the law requires belongs either
   personally and inherently, or by imputation, to the person who is
   justified, or declared to be just. There is a logical connection,
   therefore, between the denial of the imputation of Adam's sin, and the
   denial of the Scriptural doctrines of atonement and justification. The
   objections urged against the former bear equally against the latter
   doctrines. And it is a matter of history that those who reject the one,
   reject also the others.

   Argument from Romans v. 12-21.

   The Apostle in Romans v. 12-21 teaches this doctrine in the most formal
   and explicit manner. The design of that passage is to illustrate the
   method of salvation. The Apostle had taught that all men are sinners,
   and the whole world guilty before God. All men being under the
   condemnation of the law, it is impossible that they should be justified
   by the law. The same law cannot both justify and condemn the same
   persons. As therefore no flesh can be justified by the works of the
   law, God sent his Son for our salvation. He assumed our nature, took
   our place, and obeyed and suffered in our stead, and thus wrought out
   for us a perfect and infinitely meritorious righteousness. On the
   ground of that righteousness, God can now be just in justifying the
   ungodly, if, renouncing their own righteousness, they receive and trust
   upon this righteousness of God, freely offered to them in the Gospel.
   The fundamental doctrine of the Epistle to the Romans, as it is the
   fundamental doctrine of the Gospel, is, therefore, that the
   righteousness of one man, even Christ, can be and is so imputed to
   believers as to be the meritorious ground of their justification at the
   bar of God. To make this doctrine the more plain to his readers, the
   Apostle refers to the analogous case of the condemnation of the human
   race for the sin of Adam; and shows that as the sin of Adam is the
   judicial ground of the condemnation of all who were in him, i.e., of
   all represented by him, so the obedience of Christ is the judicial
   ground of the justification of all who are in Him. In the prosecution
   of his plan he first asserts the imputation of Adam's sin to his
   posterity. He then proves it. He then comments upon it. He then applies
   it; and finally draws inferences from it. Thus in every possible way,
   as it would seem, he sets forth the doctrine as part of the revelation
   of God. The assertion of the doctrine is contained in the twelfth verse
   of the chapter. It was by one man, He says, that sin and death passed
   upon all men; because all sinned. They sinned through, or in, that one
   man. His sin was the sin of all in virtue of the union between them and
   him. The proof of this doctrine is contained in verses thirteen and
   fourteen. The Apostle argues thus: Punishment supposes sin; sin
   supposes law; for sin is not imputed where there is no law. All men are
   punished; they are all subject to penal evils. They are, therefore, all
   chargeable with sin, and consequently are all guilty of violation of
   law. That law cannot be the law of Moses, for men died (i.e., were
   subject to the penalty of the law) before that law was given. It cannot
   be the law as written on the heart; for those die who have never
   committed any personal sin. There are penal evils, therefore, which
   come upon all mankind prior to anything in their state or conduct to
   merit such infliction. The ground of that infliction must therefore be
   sought out of themselves, i.e., in the sin of their first parent. Hence
   Adam is the type of Christ. As the one is the head and representative
   of his race, so the other is the head and representative of his people.
   As the sin of the one is the ground of the condemnation of his
   posterity, so the righteousness of the other is the ground of the
   justification of all who are in him. But although there is this grand
   analogy between the fall and the redemption of man, there are
   nevertheless certain points of difference, all in favour of the scheme
   of redemption. If we die for the offence of one man, much more shall
   grace abound unto many through one man. If for one offence the sentence
   of condemnation passed on all, the free justification is from many
   offences. If condemned for a sin in which we had no personal and
   voluntary participation, how much more shall we live on account of a
   righteousness, which we cordially receive. Wherefore, continues the
   Apostle, in the application of his illustration, if all men (in union
   with Adam) are condemned by the offence of one man, so also all (in
   union with Christ) shall be justified on the ground of the
   righteousness of one man. As one man's disobedience constituted us
   sinners, so the obedience of one man constitutes us righteous, (verses
   18 and 19). From these premises the Apostle draws two conclusions:
   First, that the law was not designed for justification, but that sin
   might abound in the knowledge and consciousness of men; and secondly,
   that where sin hath abounded grace shall much more abound. The benefits
   and blessings of redemption shall far exceed all the evils of the
   apostasy.

   Whatever may be thought of the details of this exposition, there can
   hardly he a doubt that it expresses the main idea of the passage. Few
   can doubt, and few ever have doubted, that the Apostle does here
   clearly teach that the sin of Adam is the judicial ground of the
   condemnation of his race. With this agrees not only, as we have already
   seen, the Scriptural account of the fall, but also what the Apostle
   teaches in 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22. "For since by man came death, by man came
   also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in
   Christ shall all be made alive." Union with Adam is the cause of death;
   union with Christ is the cause of life.

   Argument from General Consent.

   The imputation of Adam's sin has been the doctrine of the Church
   universal in all ages. It was the doctrine of the Jews, derived from
   the plain teaching of the Old Testament Scriptures. It was and is the
   doctrine of the Greek, Latin, Lutheran, and Reformed churches. Its
   denial is a novelty. It is only since the rise of Arminianism that any
   considerable body of Christians have ventured to set themselves in
   opposition to a doctrine so clearly taught in the Bible, and sustained
   by so many facts of history and experience. The points of diversity in
   reference to this subject do not relate to the fact that Adam's sin is
   imputed to his posterity, but either to the grounds of that imputation
   or to its consequences. In the Greek Church the lowest views prevalent
   among Christians were adopted. The theologians of that church generally
   held that natural death, and a deterioration of our nature, and a
   change for the worse in the whole state of the world, were the only
   penal evils which the race of mankind suffer on account of Adam's sin.
   In the Latin Church during the Middle Ages, as we have already seen,
   great diversity of opinion obtained as to the nature and extent of the
   evils brought upon the world by the apostasy of our first parent. The
   Council of Trent declared those evils to be death, the loss of original
   righteousness, and sin which is pronounced to be the death of the soul.
   The Lutherans and Reformed held the same doctrine with more consistency
   and earnestness. But in all this diversity it was universally admitted,
   first, that certain evils are inflicted upon all mankind on account of
   Adam's sin; and, secondly, that those evils are penal. Men were
   universally, so far as the Church was concerned, held to bear in a
   greater or less degree the punishment of the sin of their first parent.

   Objections to the Doctrine.

   The great objection to this doctrine, that it is manifestly unjust that
   one man should be punished for the sin of another, has already been
   incidentally referred to. What is punishment? It is evil on suffering
   inflicted in support of law. Wherein is the injustice that one man
   should, on the ground of the union between them, be punished for the
   sin of another? If there be injustice in the case it must be in the
   infliction of suffering anterior to or irrespective of personal ill
   desert. It does not consist in the motive of the infliction. The
   infliction of suffering to gratify malice or revenge is of course a
   crime. To inflict it in mere caprice is no less obviously wrong. To
   inflict it for the attainment of some right and desirable end may be
   not only just but benevolent. Is not the support of the divine law such
   an end? The fact that all mankind do suffer on account of Adam's sin no
   believer in the Bible can or does deny. It cannot be denied that these
   sufferings were designed. They arc included in the threatenings made in
   the beginning. They were expressly declared to be penal in the Bible.
   The sentence of condemnation is said to have passed on all men for the
   offence of one man. A part of the penalty threatened against sin in the
   great progenitor of the race was that his posterity should suffer the
   consequences of his transgression. They do thus suffer. It is vain,
   therefore, to deny the fact, and no relief is obtained by denying that
   those sufferings are inflicted in execution of the penalty of the law
   and for the infinitely important object of sustaining its authority.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [203] As at the time of the Reformation an influential party in the
   Romish Church held, after some of the schoolmen, that original sin
   consists solely in the imputation of Adam's first sin, and as the
   Confessions of the Reformers were designed not only as an exhibition of
   the truth but as a protest against the errors of the Church of Rome, it
   will be observed that the Protestants frequently assert that original
   sin is not only the imputation of Adam's sin but also hereditary
   corruption of nature; and the Reformed theologians often made the
   latter more prominent than the former, because the one was admitted by
   their adversaries, but the other denied.

   § 10. Mediate Imputation.

   About the middle of the seventeenth century Amyraut, Cappel, and La
   Place (or Placæus), three distinguished professors in the French
   theological school at Saumur, introduced several modifications of the
   Augustinian or Reformed doctrine on the decrees, election, the
   atonement, and the imputation of Adam's sin. La Place taught that we
   derive a corrupt nature from Adam, and that that corrupt nature, and
   not Adam's sin, is the ground of the condemnation which has come upon
   all mankind. When it was objected to this statement of the case that it
   left out of view the guilt of Adam's first sin, he answered that he did
   not deny the imputation of that sin, but simply made it dependent on
   our participation of his corrupted nature. We are inherently depraved,
   and therefore we are involved in the guilt of Adam's sin. There is no
   direct or immediate imputation of Adam's sin to his posterity, but only
   an indirect or mediate imputation of it, founded on the fact that we
   share his moral character. These views were first presented by La Place
   in a disputation, "De statu hominis lapsi ante gratiam," published in
   the "Theses Salmurienses," and afterwards more elaborately in a
   treatise, "De imputatione primi peccati Adami." This doctrine was
   formally condemned by the National Synod of France in 1644-45; [204] by
   the Swiss churches in the "Formula Consensus;" and by the theologians
   of Holland. Jæger, a Lutheran divine, in his "Ecclesiastical History,"
   [205] is justified in saying, "Contra doctrinam Plactæi -- tota Gallia
   reformata, quin et Theologi reformati in Hollandiâ surrexêre." The
   decree of the French Synod of Charenton on this subject is as follows:
   "Cum relatum esset ad Synodum, scripta quædam . . . . prodisse, quæ
   totam rationem peccati originalis solâ corruptione hæreditariâ in
   omnibus hominibus inhærente definiunt, et primi peccati Adami
   imputationem negant: Damnavit Synodus doctrinam ejusmodi, quatenus
   peccati originalis naturam ad corruptionem hæreditariam posterum Adæ
   ita restringit, ut imputationem excludat primi illius peccati, quo
   lapsus est Adam: Adeoque censuris omnibus ecclesiasticis subjiciendos
   censuit pastores, professores, et quoscunque alios, qui in hujus
   quæstionis disceptatione a communi sententia recesserit Ecclesiarum
   Protestantium, quæ omnes hactenus et corruptionem illam, et
   imputationem hanc in omnes Adami posteros descendentem agnoverunt."

   It was to evade the force of this decision that Placæus proposed the
   distinction between mediate and immediate imputation. He said he did
   not deny the imputation of Adam's sin, but only that it preceded the
   view of hereditary corruption. But this is the very thing which the
   Synod asserted. Hereditary corruption, or spiritual death is the
   penalty, or, as expressed by the Lutheran confessions, by Calvin, and
   by the Protestants generally, it was an evil inflicted by "the just
   judgment of God, on account of Adam's sin (propter peccatum Adami)."
   The Formula Consensus Ecclesiarum Helveticarum was set forth 1675, in
   opposition to the doctrine of Amyraut on universal grace, to the
   doctrine of Placæus on mediate imputation, and to that of others
   concerning the active obedience of Christ. [206] In that Formula it is
   said: "Censemus igitur (i.e., because the covenant of works was made
   not only with Adam, but also in him, with the whole human race)
   peccatum Adami omnibus ejus posteris, judicio Dei arcano et justo,
   imputari. Testatur quippe Apostolus in Adamo omnes peccasse:' Unius
   hominis inobedientia peccatores multos constitui;' in eodem omnes
   mori.' Neque vero ratio apparet, quemadmodum hæreditaria corruptio,
   tanquam mors spiritualis, in universum genus humanum justo Dei judicio
   cadere possit, nisi ejusdem generis humani delictum aliquod, mortis
   illius reatum inducens, præcesserit. Cum Deus justissimus totius terræ
   judex nonnisi sontem puniat." [207]

   Rivet, one of the professors of the University of Leyden, published a
   treatise in support of the decision of the French Synod, entitled
   "Decretum Synodi Nationalis Ecclesiarum Reformatarum Galliæ initio anni
   1645, de Imputatione primi Peccati omnibus Adami posteris, cum
   Ecclesiarum et Doctorum Protestantium consensu, ex scriptis eorum ab
   Andrea Riveto collecto." This treatise is contained in the third volume
   of the folio edition of his works. His colleagues in the University
   published their formal endorsement of his work, and earnestly commended
   it as an antidote to the new doctrine of Placæus. The theologians of
   the other universities of Holland joined in this condemnation of the
   doctrine of mediate imputation. They call it the heurema Imputationis
   Mediatæ a "ficulneum nuditatis indecentis tegumentum," and insist that
   the imputation of Adam's sin is no more founded on our inherent
   corruption than the imputation of Christ's righteousness is founded on
   our inherent holiness. "Quomodo et justitia Christi electis imputatur,
   non mediate per renovationem et obedientiam horum propriam, sed
   immediate, ad quam hæc ipsa propria eorum obedientia demum
   subsequitur." [208] These two great doctrines were regarded as
   inseparably united. The Protestant theologians agree in holding that
   "Imputatio justitiæ Christi et culpæ Adami pari passu ambulant, et vel
   utraque ruit, vel utraque agnosci debet." [209]

   Mediate Imputation outside of the French Church.

   Although the doctrine of mediate imputation was thus generally
   condemned both by the Reformed and Lutheran Churches, it found some
   distinguished advocates beyond the pale of the French Church. The
   younger Vitringa, Venema, and Stapfer, in his "Polemical Theology,"
   gave it their sanction. From the last named author it was adopted by
   President Edwards, in one chapter of his work on "Original Sin." It
   appears there, however, merely as an excrescence. It was not adopted
   into his system so as to qualify his theological views on other
   doctrines. Although President Edwards does clearly commit himself to
   the doctrine of Placæus, as he says, [210] "that the evil disposition
   is first, and the charge of guilt consequent," nevertheless he
   expressly teaches the doctrine of immediate imputation formally and at
   length in other portions of that work. (1.) He argues through a whole
   section to prove the federal headship of Adam. (2.) He holds that the
   threatening of death made to Adam included the loss of original
   righteousness and spiritual death. (3.) That that threatening included
   his posterity, and that the evils which they suffer in consequence of
   his sin are truly penal. If this be so, if the loss of original
   righteousness and inherent depravity are penal, they suppose antecedent
   guilt. That is, a guilt antecedent, and not consequent to the existence
   and view of the depravity. (4.) In his exposition of Rom. v. 12-21, he
   expressly teaches the common doctrine, and says, "As this place in
   general is very full and plain, so the doctrine of the corruption of
   nature, as derived from Adam, and also the imputation of his first sin,
   are both clearly taught in it. The imputation of Adam's one
   transgression, is indeed most directly and frequently asserted. We are
   here assured that by one man's sin death passed on all; all being
   adjudged to this punishment as having sinned (so it is implied) in that
   one man's sin. And it is repeated, over and over, that all are
   condemned, many are dead, many made sinners, etc., by one man's
   offence, by the disobedience of one, and by one offence." [211] As
   guilt precedes punishment, if, as Edwards says, depravity or spiritual
   death is a punishment, then the imputation of the guilt of Adam's first
   sin precedes depravity, and is not consequent upon it. This is the
   current representation throughout the work on Original Sin. It is only
   when in answer to the objection that it is unjust that we should be
   punished for the sin of Adam, that he enters on an abstruse
   metaphysical discussion on the nature of oneness or identity, and tries
   to prove [212] that Adam and his posterity are one, and not distinct
   agents. It is, therefore. after all, realism, rather than mediate
   imputation, that Edwards for the the adopted. Placæus and his
   associates, in order to defend the ground which they had taken,
   appealed to many passages in the writings of earlier theologians which
   seemed to ignore the immediate imputation of Adam's sin, and to place
   the condemnation of the race mainly, if not exclusively, upon the
   hereditary depravity derived from our first parent. Such passages were
   easily to be found, and they are easily accounted for without assuming,
   contrary to the clearest evidence, that the direct imputation of Adam's
   sin was either doubted or denied. Before Arius arose with the direct
   denial of the true divinity of Christ and of the doctrine of the
   Trinity, the language of ecclesiastical writers was confused and
   contradictory. In like manner, even in the Latin Church, and in the
   writings of Augustine himself, much may be found, before the rise of
   the Pelagian controversy, which it is hard to reconcile with the
   Augustinian system. Augustine was obliged to publish a volume of
   retractions, and in many cases where he had nothing to retract, he
   found much to modify and explain, It is not wonderful, therefore, that
   before anyone openly denied the doctrine of immediate imputation, and
   especially when the equally important doctrine of hereditary depravity
   was openly rejected by an influential party in the Romish Church, the
   Protestant theologians should apparently ignore a doctrine which no one
   denied, and devote their attention principally to the points which were
   then in controversy. Rivet, however, clearly shows that although not
   rendered prominent, the immediate imputation of Adam's sin as
   universally assumed. This is plain from the fact that all the evil
   consequences of Adam's apostasy, mortality, the loss of original
   righteousness, corruption of nature or spiritual death, etc., etc.,
   were of the nature of punishment. What the Reformers were anxious to
   maintain was, that original hereditary depravity (concupiscence, in the
   language of the Latin Church) was of the nature of sin, and
   consequently that men do not perish eternally solely propter peccatum
   alienum, but also propter peccatum proprium. This was specially the
   case with Calvin. In the Confession of Faith which he drew up for the
   school in Geneva, it is said, "Singuli nascuntur originali peccato
   infecti . . . et a Deo damnati, non propter alienum delictum duntaxat,
   sed propter improbitatem, quæ intra eos est." And elsewhere he says:
   "Dicimus Deum justo judicio nobis in Adamo maledixisse, ac voluisse nos
   ob illius peccatum corruptos nasci, ut in Christo instauremur." Again:
   "Peccavit unus, omnes ad poenam trahuntur, neque id modo, sed ex unius
   vitio, contagionem omnes contrahunt." Again: "Si quæratur causa
   maledictionis, quæ incumbit omnibus posteris Adæ, dicitur esse alienum
   peccatum, et cujusque proprium." To the same effect, Beza says: [213]
   "Tria sunt quæ hominem reum constitunut coram Deo, (1.) Culpa promanans
   ex eo quod omnes peccavimus in proto lapso (Rom. v. 12). (2.) Corruptio
   quæ est pæna istius culpæ, impositam tam Adamo, quam posteris. (3.)
   Peccata quæ perpetrant homines adulti." [214] Principal Cunningham
   [215] calls attention to the fact that the doctrine of immediate
   imputation of Adam's sin is much more explicitly stated in the
   Westminster Larger and Shorter Catechisms than in the Confession of
   Faith. This he very naturally accounts for by the supposition that the
   denial of that doctrine by Placæus had not attracted attention in
   England when the Confession was framed (1646), but did become known
   before the Catechisms were completed.

   Objections to the Doctrine of Mediate Imputation.

   The leading objections against the doctrine of mediate imputation are,
   --

   1. That it denies what the Scriptures assert. The Scriptures assert
   that the sentence of condemnation has passed upon all men for the sin
   of one man. This the doctrine of mediate imputation denies, and affirms
   that the ground of that condemnation is inherent depravity. We are
   accounted partakers of Adam's sin only because we derive a corrupt
   nature from him. According to the Scriptures, however, the reason why
   we are depraved is, that we are regarded as partakers of his sin, or
   because the guilt of that sin is imputed to us. The guilt in the order
   of nature and fact precedes the spiritual death which is its penal
   consequent.

   2. This doctrine denies the penal character of the hereditary
   corruption in which all men are born. According to the Scriptures and
   to the faith of the church universal, mortality, the loss of original
   righteousness, and hereditary corruption are inflicted upon mankind in
   execution of the threatening made against Adam, and are included in the
   comprehensive word, death, by which the threatened penalty was
   expressed. This is as emphatically taught by President Edwards as by
   any other of the Reformed theologians. He devotes a section of his work
   to prove that the death mentioned in Genesis, and of which the Apostle
   speaks in Rom. v. 12, included spiritual death, and that the posterity
   of Adam were included in that penalty. He says: "The calamities which
   come upon them in consequence of his sin, are brought on them as
   punishments." [216] He moreover says, it destroys the whole scope of
   the Apostle's argument "to suppose that the death of which he here
   speaks as coming on mankind by Adams sin, comes not as a punishment."
   [217] And again: "I do not suppose the natural depravity of the
   posterity of Adam is owing to the course of nature only; it is also
   owing to the just judgment of God." [218] But punishment supposes
   guilt; if the loss of righteousness and the consequent corruption of
   nature are punishments, they suppose the antecedent imputation of
   guilt; and therefore imputation is immediate and not mediate; it is
   antecedent and not consequent to or upon inherent depravity. The view
   which the Reformed theologians uniformly present on this subject is,
   that God constituted Adam the head and representative of his race. The
   penalty attached to the covenant made with him, and which included his
   posterity, was the loss of the divine favour and fellowship. The
   consequences of the forfeiture of the divine favour in the case of Adam
   were, (1.) The loss of original righteousness; (2.) The consequent
   corruption of his whole nature; and, (3.) Exposure to eternal death.
   These consequences come on his posterity in the same order: first, the
   loss or rather destitution of original righteousness; and secondly,
   corruption of nature; and thirdly, exposure to eternal death; so that
   no child of Adam is exposed to eternal death irrespective of his own
   personal sinfulness and ill-desert. On this point Turrettin says:
   "Poena quam peccatum Adami in nos accersit, vel est privativa, vel
   positiva. Prior est carentia et privatio justitiæ originalis; posterior
   est mors tum temporalis, tum æterna, et in genere mala omnia, quæ
   peccatoribus immittuntur. Etsi secunda necessario sequitur primam ex
   natura rei, nisi intercedat Dei misericordia, non debet tamen cum ea
   confundi. Quoad primam dicimus Adami peccatum nobis imputari immediate
   ad poenam privativam, quia est causa privationis justitiæ originalis,
   et sic corruptionem antecedere debet saltem ordine naturæ; sed quoad
   posteriorem potest dici imputari mediate quoad poenam positivam, quia
   isti poenæ obnoxii non sumus, nisi postquam nati et corrupti sumus."
   [219] Vogelsang [220] says: "Certe neminem sempiterna subire supplicia
   propter inobedientiam protoplasti, nisi mediante cognata perversitate."
   And Mark [221] says that if Placæus and others meant nothing more by
   mediate imputation than that "hominum natorum actualem punitionem
   ulteriorem non fieri nudo intuitur Adamicæ transgressionis absque
   interveniente etiam propria corruptione et fluentibus hinc sceleribus
   variis, neminem orthodoxum possent habere obloquentem." But he adds,
   they obviously meant much more. They deny the imputation of the first
   sin of Adam as the cause of this inherent corruption. As Adam by his
   apostasy became subject to eternal death, but through the intervention
   of redeeming grace was doubtless saved from it, so also although all
   his posterity become liable to the same dreadful penalty through their
   own inherent corruption, yet we have every reason to believe and hope
   that no human being ever actually perishes who does not personally
   incur the penalty of the law by his actual transgression. This however
   is through the redemption of Christ. All who die in infancy are
   doubtless saved, but they are saved by grace. It is nevertheless
   important that the real views of the Reformed Churches, on the doctrine
   of immediate imputation, should be clearly understood. Those churches
   do not teach that the first sin of Adam is the single and immediate
   ground of the condemnation of his posterity to eternal death, but that
   it is the ground of their forfeiture of the divine favour from which
   flows the loss of original righteousness and corruption of our whole
   nature, which in their turn become the proximate ground of exposure to
   final perdition, from which, however, as almost all Protestants
   believe, all are saved who have no other sins to answer for.

   Mediate Imputation increases the Difficulties to be accounted for.

   3. It is a further objection to the doctrine of mediate imputation that
   it increases instead of relieving the difficulty of the case. It denies
   that a covenant was made with Adam. It denies that mankind ever had a
   probation. It assumes that in virtue of a natural law of propagation
   when Adam lost the image of God and became sinful, his children inherit
   his character, and on the ground of that character are subject to the
   wrath and curse of God. All the evils therefore which the Scriptural
   and Church doctrine represent as coming upon the posterity of Adam as
   the judicial punishment of his first sin, the doctrine of mediate
   imputation represents as sovereign inflictions, or mere natural
   consequences. What the Scriptures declare to be a righteous judgment,
   Placæus makes to be an arbitrary dispensation.

   Inconsistent with the Apostle's Argument in Rom. v. 12-21.

   4. It is a still more serious objection that this doctrine destroys the
   parallel between Adam and Christ on which the Apostle lays so much
   stress in his Epistle to the Romans. The great point which he there
   labours to teach and to illustrate, and which he represents as a
   cardinal element of the method of salvation, is that men are justified
   for a righteousness which is not personally their own. To illustrate
   and confirm this great fundamental doctrine, he refers to the fact that
   men have been condemned for a sin which is not personally their own. He
   over and over insists that it was for the sin of Adam, and not for our
   own sin or sinfulness, that the sentence of death (the forfeiture of
   the divine favour) passed upon all men. It is on this ground he urges
   men the more confidently to rely upon the promise of justification on
   the ground a righteousness which is not inherently ours. This parallel
   destroyed, the doctrine and argument of the Apostle are overturned, if
   it be denied that the sin of Adam, as antecedent to any sin or
   sinfulness of our own is the ground of our condemnation. If we are
   partakers of the penal consequences of Adam's sin only because of the
   corrupt nature derived by a law of nature from him, then we are
   justified only on the ground of our own inherent holiness derived by a
   law of grace from Christ. We have thus the doctrine of subjective
   justification, which overthrows the great doctrine of the Reformation,
   and the great ground of the peace and confidence of the people of God,
   namely, that a righteousness not within us but wrought out for us, --
   the righteousness of another, even the eternal Son of God, and
   therefore an infinitely meritorious righteousness, -- is the ground of
   our justification before God. Any doctrine which tends to invalidate or
   to weaken the Scriptural evidence of this fundamental article of our
   faith is fraught with evil greater than belongs to it in itself
   considered. This is the reason why the Reformed theologians so
   strenuously opposed the doctrine of La Place. They saw and said that on
   his principles the doctrine of the imputation of Christ's righteousness
   antecedent to our santification could not be defended.

   The Doctrine founded on a False Principle.

   5. Perhaps, however, the most serious objection against the doctrine of
   mediate imputation is drawn from the principle on which it rests, and
   the arguments of its advocates in its support. The great principle
   insisted upon in support of this doctrine is that one man cannot justly
   be punished for the sin of another. If this be so then it is unjust in
   God to visit the iniquities of the fathers upon their children. Then it
   was unjust in Christ to declare that the blood of the prophets slain
   from the beginning should come upon the men of his generation. Then it
   is unjust that the Jews of the present day, and ever since the
   crucifixion of our Lord, should be scattered and peeled, according to
   the predictions of the prophets, for the rejection of the Messiah.
   Then, also, were the deluge sent in wrath upon the world, and the
   destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the extermination of the
   Canaanites, in which thousands of children perished innocent of the
   offences for which those judgments were inflicted, all acts of
   stupendous injustice. If this principle be sound, then the
   administration of the divine government over the world, God's dealings
   with nations and with the Church, admit of no defence. He has from the
   beginning and through all time held children responsible for the
   conduct of parents, included them without their consent in the
   covenants made with their fathers, and visited upon them the
   consequences of the violations of such covenants of which they were not
   personally guilty, as well as bestowed upon them rich blessings secured
   by the fidelity of their progenitors without anything meritorious on
   their part. Moreover, if the principle in question be valid, then the
   whole Scriptural doctrine of sacrifice and expiation is a delusion. And
   then, also, we must adopt the Socinian theory which makes the death of
   Christ instead of a penal satisfaction for sin, a mere symbolical
   inculcation of a truth -- a didactic and not an expiatory service. The
   Reformed theologians of the seventeenth century expressed their deep
   regret that men professing orthodoxy should adopt from Pelagianis et
   Pelagianizantibus, against the doctrine of immediate imputation,
   "exceptiones" et "objectiones . . . . petitas a Dei justitia et
   veritate, ab actus et personæ Adamicæ singularitate, ex sceleris longe
   ante nos præterito tempore, ex posterum nulla scientia vel consensione
   in illud, ex non imputatis aliis omnibus factis et fatis Adami, etc.,"
   which had so often been answered in the controversies with the
   Socinians and Remonstrants. [222] It is very clear that if no such
   constitution can be righteously established between men, even by God,
   that one man may justly bear the iniquity of another, then the Bible
   and Providence become alike unintelligible, and the great doctrines of
   the Christian faith are overthrown.

   The Theory of Propagation.

   The theory of those who deny all imputation of Adam's sin to his
   posterity, whether mediate or immediate, and who account for the
   corruption of the race consequent on his apostasy, on the general law
   of propagation, that like begets like, differs only in terms from the
   doctrine of La Place. All he meant by mediate imputation was that the
   descendants of Adam, derived from him a corrupt nature, have the same
   moral character, and therefore are adjudged worthy of the same
   condemnation. This the advocates of the theory just mentioned are
   willing to admit. Their doctrine therefore is liable to all the
   objections which bear against the doctrine of mediate imputation, and
   therefore does not call forth a separate consideration.

   § 11. Preëxistence.

   The principle that a man can be justly held responsible or regarded as
   guilty only for his own voluntary acts and for then subjective
   consequences, is so plausible that to many minds it has the authority
   of an intuitive truth. It is, however, so clearly the doctrine of the
   Bible and the testimony of experience that men are born in sin, that
   they come into the world in a state of guilt and of moral pollution,
   that a necessity arises of reconciling this fact with what they regard
   as self-evidently true. Two theories have been proposed to effect this
   reconciliation. The first is that of preexistence. Origen, and after
   him here and there one in the history of the Church, down to the
   present day, assumed that men existed in another state of being before
   their birth in this world, and having voluntarily sinned against God in
   that previous state of being, they come into this world burdened with
   the guilt and pollution due to their own voluntary act. This view of
   the subject never having been adopted by any Christian church, it does
   not properly belong to Christian theology. It is sufficient to remark
   concerning it: --

   1. That it does not pretend to be taught in the Scriptures, and
   therefore cannot be an article of faith. Protestants unite in teaching
   that "The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for his
   own glory, and man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set
   down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced
   from Scripture, unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether
   by new revelations of the Spirit, or the traditions of men." As the
   doctrine of the preexistence of souls is neither expressly set down in
   the Bible, nor deducible from it, as is admitted, it cannot be received
   as one of the formative principles of Christian doctrine. All that its
   Christian advocates claim is that it is not contradicted in Scripture,
   and therefore that they are free to hold it.

   2. But even this cannot be conceded. It is expressly contrary to the
   plain teachings of the Word of God. According to the history of the
   creation, man was formed in the image of God. His body was fashioned
   out of the dust of the earth, and his soul was derived immediately from
   God, and was pronounced by him "very good." This is utterly
   inconsistent with the idea that Adam was a fallen spirit. The Bible
   also teaches that Adam was created in the image of God in knowledge,
   righteousness, and holiness, and fell from that state here in this
   life, and not in a previous and higher state of being. The Scriptures
   also, as we have seen, say that it was by one man that sin entered into
   the world, and death by sin, because all sinned in that one man. There
   is a causal relation between the sin of Adam and the condemnation and
   sinfulness of his posterity. This contradicts the theory which refers
   the present sinfulness of men, not to the act of Adam, but to the
   voluntary act of each individual man, in a previous state of existence.

   3. This doctrine is as destitute of all support from the testimony of
   consciousness as from the authority of Scripture. No man has any
   reminiscences of a previous existence. There is nothing in his present
   state which connects him with a former state of being. It is a simple,
   pure assumption, without the slightest evidence from any known facts.

   4. The theory, if true, affords no relief. Sins of which we know
   nothing; which were committed by us before we were born; which cannot
   be brought home to the conscience as our own sins, can never be the
   righteous grounds of punishment, any more than the acts of an idiot. It
   is unnecessary however to pursue this subject further, as the
   objections against the realistic theory, in most instances, bear with
   equal force against the theory of preexistence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 12. Realistic Theory.

   Those who reject the untenable doctrine of preexistence and yet hold to
   the principle that guilt can attach only to what is due to our agency,
   are driven to assume that Adam and his race are in such a sense one,
   that his act of disobedience was literally the act of all mankind. And
   consequently that they are as truly personally guilty on account of it,
   as Adam himself was; and that the inherent corruption flowing from that
   act, belongs to us in the same sense and in the same way, that it
   belonged to him. His sin, it is therefore said, "Is ours not because it
   is imputed to us; but it is imputed to us, because it is truly and
   properly our own." We have constantly to contend with the ambiguity of
   terms. There is a sense in which the above proposition is perfectly
   true, and there is a sense in which it is not true. It is true that the
   righteousness of Christ is imputed to us because it is ours according
   to the terms of the covenant of grace; because it was wrought out for
   us by our great head and representative, who obeyed and suffered in our
   stead. But it is not true that it is ours in the sense that we were the
   agents by whom that righteousness was effected, or the persons in whom
   it inheres. In like manner, Adam's sin may be said to be imputed to us
   because it is ours, inasmuch as it is the sin of the divinely
   constituted head and representative of our race. But it is not ours in
   the same sense in which it was his. It was not our act, i.e., an act in
   which our reason, will, and conscience were exercised. There is a sense
   in which the act of an agent is the act of the principal. It binds him
   in law, as effectually as he could bind himself. But he is not, on that
   account, the efficient agent of the act. The sense in which many assert
   that the act of Adam was our act, is, that the same numerical nature or
   substance, the same reason and will which existed and acted in Adam,
   belong to us; so that we were truly and properly the agents of his act
   of apostasy.

   President Edwards' Theory of Identity.

   The assumption which President Edwards undertakes to controvert, is,
   "That Adam and his posterity are not one, but entirely distinct
   agents." [223] The theory on which he endeavours to prove that Adam and
   his posterity were one agent, is not exactly the old realistic theory,
   it is rather a theory of his own, and depends on his seculiar views of
   oneness or identity. According to him, all oneness depends upon "the
   arbitrary constitution of God." The only reason why a full grown tree
   is the same with its first germ; or that the body of an adult man is
   the same with his infant frame; is that God so wills to regard them. No
   creature is one and the same in the different periods of its existence,
   because it is numerically one and the same substance, or life, or
   organism; but simply because God "treats them as one, by communicating
   to them like properties, relations, and circumstances; and so leads us
   to regard and treat them as one." [224] "If the existence," he says,
   "of created substance, in each successive moment, be wholly the effect
   of God's immediate power in that moment, without any dependence on
   prior existence, as much as the first creation out of nothing, then
   what exists at this moment, by this power, is a new effect; and simply
   and absolutely considered, not the same with any past existence, though
   it be like it, and follows it according to a certain established
   method. And there is no identity or oneness in the case, but what
   depends on the arbitrary constitution of the Creator; who, by his wise
   and sovereign establishment so unites successive new effects, that he
   treats them as one." [225] He uses two illustrations which make his
   meaning perfectly plain. The brightness of the moon seems to us a
   permanent thing, but is really a new effect produced every moment. It
   ceases, and is renewed, in every successive point of time, and so
   becomes altogether a new effect at each instant. It is no more
   numerically the same thing with that which existed in the preceding
   moment, than the sound of the wind that blows now, is individually the
   same sound of the wind which blew just before. What is the of the
   brightness of the moon, he says, must be true also of its solidity, and
   of everything else belonging to its substance. Again, images of things
   placed before a mirror seem to remain precisely the same, with a
   continuing perfect identity. But it is known to be otherwise. These
   images are constantly renewed by the impression and reflection of new
   rays of light. The image which exists this moment is not at all derived
   from the image which existed the last preceding moment. It is no more
   numerically the same, than if painted anew by an artist with colours
   which vanish as soon as they are put on. The obvious fallacy of these
   illustrations is, that the cases are apparently, but not really alike.
   The brightness of the moon and the image on a mirror, are not
   substances having continued existence; they are mere effects on our
   visual organs. Whereas the substances which produce those effects are
   objective existences or entities, and not subjective states of our
   sensibility. Edwards, however, says that what is true of the images,
   must be true of the bodies themselves. "They cannot be the same, with
   an absolute identity, but must be wholly renewed every moment, if the
   case be as has been proved, that their present existence is not,
   strictly speaking, at all the effect of their past existence; but is
   wholly, every instant, the effect of a new agency or exertion of the
   powerful cause of their existence." [226] As therefore, there is no
   such thing as numerical identity of substance in created things, and as
   all oneness depends on "the arbitrary constitution of God," and things
   are one only because God so regards and treats them, there is "no solid
   reason," Edwards contends, why the posterity of Adam should not be
   "treated as one with him for the derivation . . . . of the loss of
   righteousness, and consequent corruption and guilt." [227] According to
   this doctrine of identity, everything that exists, even the soul of
   man, is, and remains one, not because of any continuity of life and
   substance, but as a series of new effects produced in every successive
   moment by the renewed efficiency of God. The whole theory resolves
   itself into the doctrine that preservation is continued creation. The
   argument of Edwards in proof of that point is, that "the existence of
   every created substance, is a dependent existence, and therefore is an
   effect and must have some cause; and the cause must be one of these
   two; either the antecedent existence of the same substance, or else the
   power of the Creator." It cannot be the antecedent existence of the
   same substance, and therefore must be the power of God. His conclusion
   is that God's upholding of created substance "is altogether equivalent
   to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment." [228]

   Objections to the Edwardian Theory.

   The fatal consequences of this view of the nature of preservation were
   presented under the head of Providence. All that need be here remarked,
   is, --

   1. That it proceeds upon the assumption that we can understand the
   relation of the efficiency of God to the effects produced in time.
   Because every new effect which we produce is due to a new exercise of
   our efficiency, it is assumed that such must be the case with God. He,
   however, inhabits eternity. With him there is no distinction between
   the past and future. All things are equally present to Him. As we exist
   in time and space, all our modes of thinking are conditioned by these
   circumstances of our being. But as God is not subject to the
   limitations of time or space, we have no right to transfer these
   limitations to Him. This only proves that we cannot understand how God
   produces successive effects. We do not know that it is by successive
   acts, and therefore it is most unreasonable and presumptuous to make
   that assumption the ground of explaining great Scriptural doctrines. It
   is surely just as conceivable or intelligible that God should will the
   continuous existence of the things which He creates, as that He should
   create them anew at every successive moment.

   2. This doctrine of a continued creation destroys the Scriptural and
   common sense distinction between creation and preservation. The two are
   constantly presented as different, and they are regarded as different
   by the common judgment of mankind. By creation, God calls things into
   existence, and by preservation He upholds them in being. The two ideas
   are essentially distinct. Any theory, therefore, which confounds them
   must be fallacious. God wills that the things which He has created
   shall continue to be; and to deny that He can cause continuous
   existence is to deny his omnipotence.

   3. This doctrine denies the existence of substance. The idea of
   substance is a primitive idea. It is given in the constitution of our
   nature. It is an intuitive truth, as is proved by its universality and
   necessity. One of the essential elements of that idea is uninterrupted
   continuity of being. Substance is that which stands; which remains
   unchanged under all the phenomenal mutations to which it is subjected.
   According to the theory of continued creation there is and can be no
   created substance. God is the only substance in the universe.
   Everything out of God is a series of new effects; there is nothing
   which has continuous existence, and therefore there is no substance.

   4. It necessarily follows that if God is the only substance He is the
   only agent in the universe. All things out of God being every moment
   called into being out of nothing, are resolved into modes of God's
   efficiency. If He creates the soul every successive instant, He creates
   all its states. thoughts, feelings, and volitions. The soul is only a
   series of divine acts. And therefore there can be no free agency, no
   sin, no responsibility, no individual existence. The universe is only
   the self-manifestation of God. This doctrine, therefore, in its
   consequences, is essentially pantheistic.

   5. In resolving all identity into an "arbitrary constitution of God,"
   it denies that there is any real identity in any created things.
   Edwards expressly says, They are not numerically the same. They cannot
   be the same with an absolute identity. They are one only because God so
   regards them, and because they are alike, so that we look upon them as
   the same. This being the case, there seems to be no foundation even for
   guilt and pollution in the individual soul as flowing from its own
   acts, because there is nothing but an apparent, not a real connection
   between the present and the past in the life of the soul. It is not the
   same soul that is guilty today of the sin committed yesterday. Much
   less can such an arbitrary or assumed and merely apparent identity
   between Adam and his race be a just ground of their bearing the guilt
   of his first sin. In short, this doctrine subverts all our ideas. It
   assumes that things which, as the human soul, are really one, are not
   one in the sense of numerical sameness; and that things which are not
   identical, as Adam and his posterity, are one in the same sense that
   the soul of a man is one, or that identity can be predicated of any
   creature. This doctrine, therefore, which would account for the guilt
   and native depravity of men on the assumption of an arbitrary divine
   constitution of God, by which beings which are really distinct
   subsistences are declared to be one, is not only contrary to the
   Scriptures and to the intuitive convictions of men, but it affords no
   satisfactory solution of the facts which it is intended to explain. It
   does not bring home to any human conscience that the sin of Adam was
   his sin in the sense in which our sins of yesterday are our guilt of
   today.

   The Proper Realistic Theory.

   The strange doctrine of Edwards, above stated, agrees with the
   realistic theory so far as that he and the realists unite in saying
   that Adam and his race are one in the same sense in which a tree is one
   during its whole progress from the germ to maturity, or in which the
   human soul is one during all the different periods of its existence. It
   essentially differs, however, in that Edwards denies numerical sameness
   in any case. Identity, according to him, does not in any creature
   include the continued existence of one and the same substance. The
   realistic doctrine, on the contrary, makes the numerical sameness of
   substance the essence of identity. Every genus or species of plants or
   animals is one because all the individuals of those genera and species
   are partakers of one and the same substance. In every species there is
   but one substance of which the individuals are the modes of
   manifestation. According to this theory humanity is numerically one and
   the same substance in Adam and in all the individuals of his race. The
   sin of Adam was, therefore, the sin of all mankind, because committed
   by numerically the same rational and voluntary substance which
   constitutes us men. It was our sin in the same sense that it was sin,
   because it was our act (the act of our reason and will) as much as it
   was his. There are two classes of objections to this theory which might
   here properly come under consideration. First, those which bear against
   realism as a theory; and, secondly, those which relate to its
   application to the relation of the union between us and Adam as a
   solution of the problems of original sin.

   Recapitulation of the Objections to the Realistic Theory.

   The objections to the realistic doctrine were presented when the nature
   of man was under consideration. It was then stated, (1.) That realism
   is a mere hypothesis; one out of many possible assumptions. Possibility
   is all that can be claimed for it. It cannot be said to be probable,
   much less certain; and therefore cannot legitimately be made the basis
   of other doctrines. (2.) That it has no support from the Scriptures.
   The Bible indeed does say that Adam and his race are one; but it also
   says that Christ and his people are one; that all the multitudes of
   believers of all ages and in heaven and earth are one. So in common
   life we speak of every organized community as one. The visible Church
   is one. Every separate state or kingdom is one. Everything depends on
   the nature of this oneness. And that is to be determined by the nature
   of the thing spoken of, and the usus loquendi of the Bible and of
   ordinary life. As no man infers from the fact that the Scriptures
   declare Christ and his people to be one, that they are numerically the
   same substance; or from the unity predicated of believers as
   distinguished from the rest of mankind, that they are one substance and
   the rest of men of a different substance; so we have no right to infer
   from the fact that the Bible says that Adam and his posterity are one
   that they are numerically the same substance. Neither do the Scriptures
   so describe the nature and effects of the union between us and Adam as
   to necessitate or justify the realistic doctrine. The nature and
   effects of our oneness with Adam are declared in all essential points
   to be analogous to the nature and effects of our oneness with Christ.
   As the latter is not a oneness of substance, so neither is the other.
   (3.) It was shown that realism has no support from the consciousness of
   men, but on the contrary, that it contradicts the teachings of
   consciousness as interpreted by the vast majority of our race, learned
   and unlearned. Every man is revealed to himself as an individual
   substance. (4.) Realism, as argued above, contradicts the doctrine of
   the Scriptures in so far that it is irreconcilable with the Scriptural
   doctrine of the separate existence of the soul. (5.) It subverts the
   doctrine of the Trinity in so far that it makes the Father, Son, and
   Spirit one God only in the sense in which all men are one man. The
   persons of the Trinity are one God, because they are one in essence or
   substance; and all men are one man because they are one in essence. The
   answers which Trinitarian realists give to this objection are
   unsatisfactory, because they assume the divisibility, and consequently
   the materiality of Spirit. (6.) It is difficult, if not impossible, to
   reconcile the realistic theory with the sinlessness of Christ. If the
   one numerical essence of humanity became guilty and polluted in Adam,
   and if we are guilty and polluted because we are partakers of that
   fallen substance, how can Christ's human nature have been free from sin
   if He took upon Him the same numerical essence which sinned in Adam.
   (7.) The above objections are theological or Scriptural; others of a
   philosophical character have availed to banish the doctrine of realism
   from all modern schools of philosophy, except so far as it has been
   merged in the higher forms of pantheistic monism.

   Realism no Solution of the Problem of Original Sin.

   The objections which bear against this theory as a solution of the
   problems of original sin are no less decisive. There are two things
   which realism proposes to explain. First, the fact that we are punished
   for the sin of Adam; and, secondly, that hereditary depravity is in us
   truly and properly sin, involving guilt as well as pollution. The
   former is accounted for on the ground that Adam's sin was our own act;
   and the latter on the ground that native depravity is the consequence
   of our own voluntary action. As a man is responsible for his character
   or permanent state of mind produced by his actual transgressions, so we
   are responsible for the character with which we come into the world,
   because it is the result of our voluntary apostasy from God. To this it
   is an obvious objection, --

   1. That admitting realism to be true; admitting that humanity is
   numerically one and the same substance, of which individual men are the
   modes of manifestation; and admitting that this generic humanity sinned
   in Adam, this affords no satisfactory solution of either of the facts
   above stated. Two things are necessary in order to vindicate the
   infliction of punishment for actual sin on the ground of personal
   responsibility. First, that the sin be an act of conscious
   self-determination. Otherwise it cannot be brought home upon the
   conscience so as to produce the sense of criminality. And suffering
   without the sense of criminality or blameworthiness, so far as the
   sufferer is concerned, is not punishment, but wanton cruelty. And,
   secondly, to vindicate punishment in the eye of justice, in the case
   supposed, there must be personal criminality manifest to all
   intelligent beings cognizant of the case. If a man should commit an
   offence in a state of somnambulism or of insanity, when he did not know
   what he did, and all recognition of which on his restoration to a
   normal condition is impossible, it is plain that such an offence could
   not justly be the ground of punishment. Suffering inflicted on such
   ground would not be punishment in the view of the sufferer, or
   righteous in the view of others. It is no less plain that if a man
   should commit a crime in a sound state of mind, and afterwards become
   insane, he could not justly be punished so long as he continued insane.
   The execution of a maniac or idiot for any offence committed prior to
   the insanity or idiocy would be an outrage. If these principles are
   correct then it is plain that, even admitting all that realists claim,
   it affords no relief. It gives no satisfactory solution either of our
   being punished for Adam's sin or for the guilt which attaches to our
   inherent hereditary depravity. A sin of which it is impossible that we
   should be conscious as our voluntary act, can no more be the ground of
   punishment as our act, than the sin of an idiot, of a madman, or of a
   corpse. When the body of Cromwell was exhumed and gibbeted, Cromwell
   was not punished; and the act was, in the sight of all mankind, merely
   a manifestation of impotent revenge.

   2. But the realistic theory cannot be admitted. The assumption that we
   acted thousands of years before we were born, so as to be personally
   responsible for such act, is a monstrous assumption. It is, as Baur
   says, an unthinkable proposition; that is, one to which no intelligible
   meaning can be attached. We can understand how it may be said that we
   died in Christ and rose with Him; that his death was our death and his
   resurrection our resurrection, in the sense that He acted for us as our
   substitute, head, and representative. But to say that we actually and
   really died and rose in Him; that we were the agents of his acts,
   conveys no idea to the mind. In like manner we can understand how it
   may be said that we sinned in Adam and fell with him in so far as he
   was the divinely appointed head and representative of his race. But the
   proposition that we performed his act of disobedience is to our ears a
   sound without any meaning. It is just as much an impossibility as that
   a nonentity should act. We did not then exist. We had no being before
   our existence in this world; and that we should have acted before we
   existed is an absolute impossibility. It is to be remembered that an
   act implies an agent; and the agent of a responsible voluntary act must
   be a person. Before the existence of the personality of a man that man
   cannot perform any voluntary action. Actual sin is an act of voluntary
   self-determination; and therefore before the existence of the self,
   such determination is an impossibility. The stuff or substance out of
   which a man is made may have existed before he came into being, but not
   the man himself. Admitting that the souls of men are formed out of the
   generic substance of humanity, that substance is no more the man than
   the dust of the earth out of which the body of Adam was fashioned was
   his body. Voluntary agency, responsible action, moral character, and
   guilt can be predicated only of persons, and cannot by possibility be
   predicable of them, or really belong to them before they exist. The
   doctrine, therefore, which supposes that we are personally guilty of
   the sin of Adam on the ground that we were the agents of that act, that
   our will and reason were so exercised in that action as to make us
   personally responsible for it and for its consequences, is absolutely
   inconceivable.

   3. It is a further objection to this theory that it assigns no reason
   why we are responsible for Adam's first sin and not for his subsequent
   transgressions. If his sin is ours because the whole of humanity, as a
   generic nature, acted in him, this reason applies as well to all his
   other sins as to his first act of disobedience, at least prior to the
   birth of his children. The genus was no more individualized and
   concentrated in Adam when he was in the garden, than after he was
   expelled from it. Besides, why is it the sin of Adam rather than, or
   more than the sin of Eve for which we are responsible? That mankind do
   bear a relation to the sin of Adam which they do not sustain to the sin
   of Eve is a plain Scriptural fact. We are said to bear the guilt of his
   sin, but never to bear the guilt of hers. The reason is that Adam was
   our representative. The covenant was made with him; just as in after
   generations the covenant was made with Abraham and not with Sarah. On
   this ground there is an intelligible reason why the guilt of Adam's sin
   should be imputed to us, which does not apply to the sin of Eve. But on
   the realistic theory the reverse is the case. Eve sinned first. Generic
   humanity as individualized in her, apostatized from God, before Adam
   had offended; and therefore it was her sin rather than his, or more
   than his, which ruined our common nature. But such is not the
   representation of Scripture.

   4. The objection urged against the doctrine of mediate imputation, that
   it is inconsistent with the Apostle's doctrine of justification, and
   incompatible with his argument in Rom. v. 12-21, bears with equal force
   against the realistic theory. What the Apostle teaches, what he most
   strenuously insists upon, and what is the foundation of every
   believer's hope, is that we are justified for acts which were not our
   own; of which we were not the agents, and the merit of which does not
   attach to us personally and does not constitute our moral character.
   This he tells us is analogous to the case of Adam. We were not the
   agents of his act. His sin was not our sin. Its guilt does not belong
   to us personally. It is imputed to us as something not our own, a
   peccatum alienum, and the penalty of it, the forfeiture of the divine
   favour, the loss of original righteousness, and spiritual death, are
   its sad consequences. Just as the righteousness of Christ is not our
   own but is imputed to us, and we have a title in justice on the ground
   of that righteousness, if we accept and trust it, to all the benefits
   of redemption. This, which is clearly the doctrine of the Apostle and
   of the Protestant churches, the realistic doctrine denies. That is, it
   denies that the sin of Adam as the sin of another is the ground of our
   condemnation; and in consistency it must also deny (as in fact the
   great body of Realists do deny) that the righteousness of Christ, as
   the righteousness of another, is the ground of our justification. What
   makes this objection the more serious, is that the reasons assigned for
   denying that Adam's sin, if not our own, can justly be imputed to us,
   bear with like force against the imputation of a righteousness which is
   not personally our own. The great principle which is at the foundation
   of the realistic, as of other false theories concerning original sin,
   is, that a man can be responsible only for his own acts and for his
   self-acquired character. If this be so, then, according to the Apostle,
   unless we can perfectly fulfill the law, and restore our nature to the
   image of God, by our own agency, we must perish forever.

   5. Finally, the solution presented by Realists to explain our relation
   to Adam and to solve the problems of original sin, ought to be
   rejected, because Realism is a purely philosophical theory. It is
   indeed often said that the doctrine of our covenant relation to Adam,
   and of the immediate imputation of his sin to his posterity, is a
   theory. But this is not correct. It is not a theory, but the simple
   statement of a plain Scriptural fact. The Bible says, that Adam's sin
   was the cause of the condemnation of his race. It tells us that it is
   not the mere occasional cause, but the judicial ground of that
   condemnation; that it was for, or on account of, his sin, that the
   sentence of condemnation was pronounced upon all men. This is the whole
   doctrine of immediate imputation. It is all that that doctrine
   includes. Nothing is added to the simple Scriptural statement. Realism,
   however, is a philosophical theory outside of the Scriptures, intended
   to account for the fact that Adam's sin is the ground of the
   condemnation of our race. It introduces a doctrine of universals, of
   the relation of individuals to genera and species, concerning which the
   Scriptures teach nothing, and it makes that philosophical theory an
   integral part of Scripture doctrine. This is adding to the word of God.
   It is making the truth of Scriptural doctrines to depend on the
   correctness of philosophical speculations. It is important to bear in
   mind the relation which philosophy properly sustains to theology. (1.)
   The relation is intimate and necessary. The two sciences embrace nearly
   the same spheres and are conversant with the same subjects. (2.) There
   is a philosophy which underlies all Scriptural doctrines; or which the
   Scriptures assume in all their teachings. (3.) As the doctrines of the
   Bible are from God, and therefore infallible and absolutely true, no
   philosophical principle can be admitted as sound, which does not accord
   within those doctrines. (4.) Therefore the true office and sphere of
   Christian philosophy, or of philosophy in the hands of a Christian, is
   to ascertain and teach those facts and principles concerning God, man,
   and nature, which are in accordance with the divine word. A Christian
   cannot assume a certain theory of human freedom and by that theory
   determine what the Bible teaches of foreordination and providence; but
   on the contrary, he should allow the teachings of the Bible to
   determine his theory of liberty. And so of all other doctrines; and
   this may be done in full assurance that the philosophy which we are
   thus led to adopt, will be found to authenticate itself as true at the
   bar of enlightened reason. The objection to Realism is, that it inverts
   this order. It assumes to control Scripture, instead of being
   controlled by it. The Bible says we are condemned for Adam's sin.
   Realism denies this, and says no man is or can be condemned except for
   his own sin.

   § 13. Original Sin.

   The effects of Adam's sin upon his posterity are declared in our
   standards to be, (1.) The guilt of his first sin. (2.) The loss of
   original righteousness. (3.) The corruption of our whole nature, which
   (i.e., which corruption), is commonly called original sin. Commonly,
   but not always. Not unfrequently by original sin is meant all the
   subjective evil consequences of the apostasy of our first parent, and
   it therefore includes all three of the particulars just mentioned. The
   National Synod of France, therefore, condemned the doctrine of Placæus,
   because he made original sin to consist of inherent, hereditary
   depravity, to the exclusion of the guilt of Adam's first sin.

   This inherent corruption in which all men since the fall are born, is
   properly called original sin, (1.) Because it is truly of the nature of
   sin. (2.) Because it flows from our first parents as the origin of our
   race. (3.) Because it is the origin of all other sins; and (4.) Because
   it is in its nature distinguished from actual sins.

   The Nature of Original Sin.

   As to the nature of this hereditary corruption, although the faith of
   the Church Catholic, at least of the Latin, Lutheran, and Reformed
   churches, has been, in all that is essential, uniform, yet diversity of
   opinion has prevailed among theologians. (1.) According to many of the
   Greek fathers, and in later times, of the extreme Remonstrants or
   Arminians, it is a physical, rather than a moral evil. Adam's physical
   condition was deteriorated by his apostasy, and that deteriorated
   natural constitution has descended to his posterity. (2.) According to
   others, concupiscence, or native corruption, is such an ascendency of
   man's sensuous, or animal nature over his higher attributes of reason
   and conscience, as involves a great proneness to sin, but is not itself
   sinful. Some of the Romish theologians distinctly avow this doctrine,
   and some Protestants, as we have seen, maintain that this is the
   symbolical doctrine of the Roman Church itself. The same view has been
   advocated by some divines of our own age and country. (3.) Others hold
   a doctrine nearly allied to that just mentioned. They speak of inherent
   depravity; and admit that it is of the nature of a moral corruption,
   but nevertheless deny that it brings guilt upon the soul, until it is
   exercised, assented to, and cherished. (4.) The doctrine of the
   Reformed and Lutheran churches upon this subject is thus presented in
   their authorized Confessions: --

   The "Augsburg Confession." [229] "Docent quod post lapsum Adæ omnes
   homines, secundum naturam propagati, nascantur cum peccato, hoc est,
   sine metu Dei, sine fiducia erga Deum, et cum concupiscentia."

   "Articuli Smalcaldici." [230] "Peccatum hæreditarium tam profunda et
   tetra est corruptio naturæ, ut nullius hominis ratione intelligi
   possit, sed ex Scripturæ patefactione agnoscenda, et credenda sit."

   "Formula Corcordiæ." [231] "Credendum est . . . . quod sit per omnia
   totalis carentia, defectus seu privatio concreatæ in Paradiso justitiæ
   originalis seu imaginis Dei, ad quam homo initio in veritate,
   sanctitate atque justitia creatus fuerat, et quod simul etiam sit
   impotentia et inaptitudo, adunamia et stupiditas, qua homo ad omnia
   divina seu spiritualia sit prorsus ineptus. . . . . Præterea, quod
   peccatum originale in humana natura non tantummodo sit ejusmodi totalis
   carentia, seu defectus omnium bonorum in rebus spiritualibus ad Deum
   pertinentibus: sed quod sit etiam, loco imaginis Dei amissæ in homine,
   intima, pessima, profundissima (instar cujusdam abyssi), inscrutabilis
   et ineffabilis corruptio totius naturæ et omnium virium, imprimis vero
   superiorum et principalium animæ facultatum, in mente, intellectu,
   corde et voluntate."

   "Constat Christianos non tantum actualia delicta . . . peccata esse
   agnoscere et definire debere, sed etiam . . . hæreditarium morbum . . .
   imprimis pro horribili peccato, et quidem pro principio et capite
   omnium peccatorum (e quo reliquæ transgressiones, tanquam e radice
   nascantur . . .) omnino habendum esse." [232]

   "Confessio Helvetica II." [233] "Qualis (homo Adam) factus est a lapsu,
   tales sunt omnes, qui ex ipso prognati sunt, peccato inquam, morti,
   variisque obnoxii calamitatibus. Peccatum autem intelligimus esse
   nativam illam hominis corruptionem ex primis illis nostris parentibus
   in nos omnes derivatam vel propagatam, qua concupiscentiis pravis
   immersi et a bono aversi, ad omne vero malum propensi, pleni omni
   nequitia, diffidentia, contemptu et odio Dei, nihil boni ex nobis ipsis
   facere, imo ne cogitare quidem possumus."

   "Confessio Gallicana." [234] "Credimus hoc vitium (ex propagatione
   manans) esse vere peccatum."

   "Articuli XXXIX." [235] "Peccatum originis . . . est vitium et
   depravatio naturæ cujuslibet hominis ex Adamo naturaliter propagati,
   qua fit ut ab originali justitia quam longissime distet; ad malum sua
   natura propendeat et caro semper adversus spiritum concupiscat, unde in
   unoquoque nascentium iram Dei atque damnationem meretur."

   "Confessio Belgica." [236] "Peccatum originis est corruptio totius
   naturæ et vitium hæreditarium, quo et ipsi infantes in matris utero
   polluti sunt: quodque veluti noxia quædam radix genus omne peccatorum
   in homine producit, estque tam foedum atque execrabile coram Deo, ut ad
   universi generis humani condemnationem sufficiat."

   "Catechesis Heidelbergensis." (Pravitas humanæ naturæ existit) "ex
   lapsu et inobedientia primorum parentum Adami et Evæ. Hinc natura
   nostra ita est depravata, ut omnes in peccatis concipiamur et
   nascamur." [237]

   By nature in these Confessions it is expressly taught, we are not to
   understand essence or substance (as was held by Matthias Flacius, and
   by him only at the time of the Reformation). On this point the Form of
   Concord says: That although original sin corrupts our whole nature, yet
   the essence or substance of the soul is one thing, and original sin is
   another. "Discrimen igitur retinendum est inter naturam nostram, qualis
   a Deo creata est, hodieque conservatur, in qua peccatum originale
   habitat, et inter ipsum peccatum originis, quod in natura habitat. Hæc
   enim duo secundum sacræ Scripturæ regulam distincte considerari, doceri
   et credi debent et possunt." [238]

   "The Westminster Confession." [239] "By this sin they (our first
   parents) fell from their original righteousness and communion with God,
   and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and
   parts of soul and body. They being the root of all mankind, the guilt
   of this sin was imputed, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature
   conveyed to all their posterity, descending from them by ordinary
   generation. From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly
   indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly
   inclined to all evil, do proceed all actual transgressions. This
   corruption of nature, during this life, doth remain in those that are
   regenerated; and although it be through Christ pardoned and mortified,
   yet both itself, and all the motions thereof, are truly and properly
   sin."

   Statement of the Protestant Doctrine.

   From the above statements it appears that, according to the doctrine of
   the Protestant churches, original sin, or corruption of nature derived
   front Adam, is not, (1.) A corruption of the substance or essence of
   the soul. (2.) Neither is it an essential element infused into the soul
   as poison is mixed with wine. The Forum of Concord, for example, denies
   that the evil dispositions of our fallen nature are "conditiones, seu
   concreatæ essentiales naturæ proprietates." Original sin is declared to
   be an "accidens, i.e., quod non per se subsistit, sed in aliqua
   substantia est, et ab ea discerni potest." The affirmative statements
   on this subject are (1.) That this corruption of nature affects the
   whole soul. (2.) That it consists in the loss or absence of original
   righteousness, and consequent entire moral depravity of our nature,
   including or manifesting itself in an aversion from all spiritual good,
   or from God, and an inclination to all evil. (3.) That it is truly and
   properly of the nature of sin, involving both guilt and pollution. (4.)
   That it retains its character as sin even in the regenerated. (5.) That
   it renders the soul spiritually dead, so that the natural, or unrenewed
   man, is entirely unable of himself to do anything good in the sight of
   God.

   This doctrine therefore stands opposed, --

   1. To that which teaches that the race of man is uninjured by the fall
   of Adam.

   2. To that which teaches that the evils consequent on the fall are
   merely physical.

   3. To the doctrine which makes original sin entirely negative,
   consisting in the want of original righteousness.

   4. To the doctrine which admits a hereditary depravity of nature, and
   makes it consist in an inclination to sin, but denies that it is itself
   sinful. Some of the orthodox theologians made a distinction between
   vitium and peccatum. The latter term they wished to confine to actual
   sin, while the former was used to designate indwelling and hereditary
   sinfulness. There are serious objections to this distinction: first,
   that vitium, as thus understood, is really sin; it includes both guilt
   and pollution, and is so defined by Vitringa and others who make the
   distinction. Secondly, it is opposed to established theological usage.
   Depravity, or inherent hereditary corruption, has always been
   designated peccatum, and therefore to say that it is not peccatum, but
   merely vitium, produces confusion and leads to error. Thirdly, it is
   contrary to Scripture for the Bible undeniably designates indwelling or
   hereditary corruption, or vitium, as hamartia. This is acknowledged by
   Romanists who deny that such concupiscence after regeneration is of the
   nature of sin. [240]

   5. The fifth form of doctrine to which the Protestant faith stands
   opposed, is that which admits a moral deterioration of our nature,
   which deserves the displeasure of God, and which is therefore truly
   sin, and yet denies that the evil is so great as to amount to spiritual
   death, and to involve the entire inability of the natural man to what
   is spiritually good.

   6. And the doctrine of the Protestant churches is opposed to the
   teachings of those who deny that original sin affects the whole man,
   and assert that it has its seat exclusively in the affections or the
   heart, while the understanding and reason are uninjured or
   uninfluenced.

   In order to sustain the Augustinian (or Protestant) doctrine of
   original sin, therefore, three points are to be established:  I. That
   all mankind descending from Adam by ordinary generation are born
   destitute of original righteousness, and the subjects of a corruption
   of nature which is truly and properly sin.  II. That this original
   corruption affects the whole man; not the body only to the exclusion of
   the soul; not the lower faculties of the soul to the exclusion of the
   higher; and not the heart to the exclusion of the intellectual powers.
    III. That it is of such a nature as that before regeneration fallen
   men are "utterly indisposed, disabled, and opposed to all good."

   Proof of the Doctrine of Original Sin.

   First Argument from the Universality of Sin.

   The first argument in proof of this doctrine is drawn from the
   universal sinfulness of men. All men are sinners. This is undeniably
   the doctrine of the Scriptures. It is asserted, assumed, and proved.
   The assertions of this fact are too numerous to be quoted. In 1 Kings
   viii. 46, it is said, "There is no man that sinneth not." Eccl. vii.
   20, "There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth
   not." Is. liii. 6, "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned
   every one to his own way." lxiv. 6, "We are all as an unclean thing,
   and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Ps. cxxx. 3, "If thou,
   Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?" Ps. cxliii.
   2, "In thy sight shall no man living be justified." Rom. iii. 19, "The
   whole world (pas ho kosmos) is guilty before God." Verses 22, 23,
   "There is no difference: for all have sinned and come short of the
   glory of God." Gal. iii. 22, "The Scripture hath concluded all under
   sin;" i.e., hath declared all men to be under the power and
   condemnation of sin. James iii. 2, "In many things we offend all." 1
   John i. 8, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
   the truth is not in us." Verse 10, "If we say that we have not sinned,
   we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 1 John v. 19, "The whole
   world lieth in wickedness." Such are only a few of the assertions of
   the universal sinfulness of men with which the Scriptures abound.

   But in the second place, this melancholy fact is constantly assumed in
   the Word of God. The Bible everywhere addresses men as sinners. The
   religion which it reveals is a religion for sinners. All the
   institutions of the Old Testament, and all the doctrines of the New,
   take it for granted that men universally are under the power and
   condemnation of sin. "The world," as used in Scripture, designates the
   mass of mankind, as distinguished from the church, or the regenerated
   people of God, and always involves in its application the idea of sin.
   The world hateth you. I am not of the world. I have chosen you out of
   the world. All the exhortations of the Scriptures addressed to men
   indiscriminately, calling them to repentance, of necessity assume the
   universality of sin. The same is true of the general threatenings and
   promises of the Word of God. In short, if all men are not sinners, the
   Bible is not adapted to their real character and state.

   But the Scriptures not only directly assert and everywhere assume the
   universality of sin among men, but this is a point which perhaps more
   than any other is made the subject of a formal and protracted argument.
   The Apostle, especially in his Epistle to the Romans, begins with a
   regular process of proof, that all, whether Jews or Gentiles, are under
   sin. Until this fact is admitted and acknowledged, there is no place
   for and no need of the Gospel, which is God's method of saving sinners.
   Paul therefore begins by asserting God's purpose to punish all sin. He
   then shows that the Gentiles are universally chargeable with the sin of
   impiety; that although knowing God, they neither worship him as God,
   nor are thankful. The natural, judicial, and therefore the unavoidable
   consequence of impiety, according to the Apostle's doctrine, is
   immorality. Those who abandon Him, God gives up to the unrestrained
   dominion of evil. The whole Gentile world therefore was sunk in sin.
   With the Jews, he tells us, the case was no better. They had more
   correct knowledge of God and of his law, and many institutions of
   divine appointment, so that their advantages were great every way.
   Nevertheless they were as truly and as universally sinful as the
   Gentiles. Their own Scriptures, which of course were addressed to them,
   expressly declare, There is none righteous, no not one. There is none
   that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all
   gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is
   none that doeth good, no not one. Therefore, he concludes, The whole
   world is guilty before God. Jews and Gentiles are all under sin.
   Therefore by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified. This is
   the foundation of the Apostle's whole doctrinal system, and of the
   religion of the Bible. Jesus Christ came to save his people from their
   sins. If men are not sinners Christ is not the Salvator Hominum.

   What the Scriptures so clearly teach is taught no less clearly by
   experience and history. Every man knows that he himself is a sinner. He
   knows that every human being whom he ever saw, is in the same state of
   apostasy from God. History contains the record of no sinless man, save
   the Man Christ Jesus, who, by being sinless, is distinguished from all
   other men. We have no account of any family, tribe, or nation free from
   the contamination of sin. The universality of sin among men is
   therefore one of the most undeniable doctrines of Scripture, and one of
   the most certain facts of experience.

   Second Argument from the Entire Sinfulness of Men.

   This universal depravity of men is no slight evil. The whole human
   race, by their apostasy from God, are totally depraved. By total
   depravity, is not meant that all men are equally wicked; nor that any
   man is as thoroughly corrupt as it is possible for a man to be; nor
   that men are destitute of all moral virtues. The Scriptures recognize
   the fact, which experience abundantly confirms, that men, to a greater
   or less degree, are honest in dealings, kind in their feelings, and
   beneficent in their conduct. Even the heathen, the Apostle teaches us,
   do by nature the things of the law. They are more or less under the
   dominion of conscience, which approves or disapproves their moral
   conduct. All this is perfectly consistent with the Scriptural doctrine
   of total depravity, which includes the entire absence of holiness; the
   want of due apprehensions of the divine perfections, and of our
   relation to God as our Creator, Preserver, Benefactor, Governor, and
   Redeemer. There is common to all men a total alienation of the soul
   from God so that no unrenewed man either understands or seeks after
   God; no such man ever makes God his portion, or God's glory the end of
   his being. The apostasy from God is total or complete. All men worship
   and serve the creature rather than, and more than the Creator. They are
   all therefore declared in Scripture to be spiritually dead. They are
   destitute of any principle of spiritual life. The dreadful extent and
   depth of this corruption of our nature are proved, --

   1. By its fruits; by the fearful prevalence of the sins of the flesh,
   of sins of violence, of the sins of the heart, as pride, envy, and
   malice; of the sins of the tongue, as slander and deceit; of the sins
   of irreligion, of ingratitude, profanity, and blasphemy; which have
   marked the whole history of our race, and which still distinguish the
   state of the whole world.

   2. By the consideration that the claims of God on our supreme
   reverence, love, and obedience, which are habitually and universally
   disregarded by unrenewed men, are infinitely great. That is, they are
   so great that they cannot be imagined to be greater. These claims are
   not only ignored in times of excitement and passion, but habitually and
   constantly. Men live without God. They are, says the Apostle, Atheists.
   This alienation from God is so great and so universal, that the
   Scriptures say that men are the enemies of God; that the carnal mind,
   i.e., that state of mind which belongs to all men in their natural
   state, is enmity against God. This is proved not only by neglect and
   disobedience, but also by direct rebellion against his authority, when
   in his providence he takes away our idols; or when his law, with its
   inexorable demands and its fearful penalty, is sent home upon the
   conscience, and God is seen to be a consuming fire.

   3. A third proof of the dreadful evil of this hereditary corruption is
   seen in the universal rejection of Christ by those whom He came to
   save. He is in himself the chief among ten thousand, and altogether
   lovely; uniting in his own person all the perfections of the Godhead,
   and all the excellences of humanity. His mission was one of love, of a
   love utterly incomprehensible, unmerited, immutable, and infinite.
   Through love He not only humbled himself to be born of a woman, and to
   be made under the law, but to live a life of poverty, sorrow, and
   persecution; to endure inconceivably great sufferings for our sakes,
   and finally to bear our sins in his own body on the tree. He has
   rendered it possible for God to be just and yet justify the ungodly. He
   therefore offers blessings of infinite value, without money and without
   price, to all who will accept them. He has secured, and offers to us
   wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; to make us kings
   and priests unto God, and to exalt us to an unending state of
   inconceivable glory and blessedness. Notwithstanding all this;
   notwithstanding the divine excellence of his person, the greatness of
   his love, the depth of his sufferings, and the value of the blessings
   which He has provided, and without which we must perish eternally, men
   universally, when left to themselves, reject Him. He came to his own
   and his own received Him not. The world hated, and still hates Him;
   will not recognize Him as their God and Saviour; will not accept of his
   offers; will neither love nor serve Him. The conduct of men towards
   Christ is the clearest proof of the apostasy of our race, and of the
   depth of the depravity into which they are sunk; and, so far as the
   hearers of the gospel are concerned, is the great ground of their
   condemnation. All other grounds seem merged into this, for our Lord
   says, that men are condemned because they do not believe in the only
   begotten Son of God. And the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of the Apostle,
   says, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be anathema
   maranatha;" a sentence which will be ratified in the day of judgment by
   every rational creature, fallen and unfallen, in the universe.

   The Sinfulness of Men Incorrigible.

   4. Another proof of the point under consideration is found in the
   incorrigible nature of original sin. It is, so far as we are concerned,
   an incurable malady. Men are not so besotted even by the fall as to
   lose their moral nature. They know that sin is an evil, and that it
   exposes them to the righteous judgment of God. From the beginning of
   the world, therefore, they have tried not only to expiate, but also to
   destroy it. They have resorted to all means possible to them for this
   purpose. They have tried the resources of philosophy and of moral
   culture. They have withdrawn from the contaminating society of their
   fellow-men. They have summoned all the energies of their nature, and
   all the powers of their will. They have subjected themselves to the
   most painful acts of self-denial, to ascetic observances in all their
   forms. The only result of these efforts has been that these anchorites
   have become like whitened sepulchres, which appear outwardly beautiful,
   while within they are filled with dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
   Men have been slow to learn what our Lord teaches, that it is
   impossible to make the fruit good until the tree is good. And evil,
   however, which is so indestructible must be very great.

   Argument from the Experience of God's People.

   5. We may appeal on this subject to the experience of God's people in
   every age and in every part of the world. In no one respect has that
   experience been more uniform, than in the conviction of their depravity
   in the sight of an infinitely Holy God. The patriarch Job, represented
   as the best man of his generation, placed his hand upon his mouth, and
   his mouth in the dust before God, and declared that he abhorred
   himself, and repented in dust and ashes. David's Penitential Psalms are
   filled not only with the confessions of sin, but also with the avowals
   of his deep depravity in the sight of God. Isaiah cried out, Woe is me!
   I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips.
   The ancient prophets, even when sanctified from the womb, pronounced
   their own righteousnesses as filthy rags. What is said of the body
   politic is everywhere represented as true of the individual man. The
   whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the
   foot, even unto the head, there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and
   bruises, and putrefying sores. In the New Testament the sacred writers
   evince the same deep sense of their own sinfulness, and strong
   conviction of the sinfulness of the race to which they belong. Paul
   speaks of himself as the chief of sinners. He complains that he was
   carnal, sold under sin. He groans under the burden of an evil nature,
   saying, O, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body
   of this death? From the days of the Apostles to the present time, there
   has been no diversity as to this point in the experience of Christians.
   There is no disposition ever evinced by them to palliate or excuse
   their sinfulness before God. They uniformly and everywhere, and just in
   proportion to their holiness, humble themselves under a sense of their
   guilt and pollution, and abhor themselves repenting in dust and ashes.
   This is not an irrational, nor is it an exaggerated experience. It is
   the natural effect of the apprehension of the truth; of even a partial
   discernment of the holiness of God, of the spirituality of the law, and
   of the want of conformity to that divine standard. There is always
   connected with this experience of sin, the conviction that our sense of
   its evil and its power over us, and consequently of our guilt and
   pollution, is altogether inadequate. It is always a part of the
   believer's burden, that he feels less than his reason and conscience
   enlightened by the Scriptures, teach him he ought to feel of his moral
   corruption and degradation.

   6. It need scarcely be added, that what the Scriptures so manifestly
   teach indirectly of the depth of the corruption of our fallen nature,
   they teach also by direct assertion. The human heart is pronounced
   deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. Even in the
   beginning (Gen. vi. 5, 6), it was said, "God saw that the wickedness of
   man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts
   of his heart was only evil continually." Job xv. 14-16, "What is man,
   that he should be clean? And he which is born of a woman, that he
   should be righteous? Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea,
   the heavens are not clean in his sight. How much more abominable and
   filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water." Eccl. ix. 3, "The
   heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart
   while they live, and after that they go to the dead." With such
   passages the Word of God is filled. It in the most explicit terms
   pronounces the degradation and moral corruption of man consequent on
   the fall, to be a total apostasy from God; a state of spiritual death,
   as implying the entire absence of any true holiness.

   Third Argument from the early Manifestation of Sin.

   A third great fact of Scripture and experience on this subject is the
   early manifestation of sin. As soon as a child is capable of moral
   action, it gives evidence of a perverted moral character. We not only
   see the manifestations of anger, malice, selfishness, envy, pride, and
   other evil dispositions, but the whole development of the soul is
   toward the world. The soul of a child turns by an inward law from God
   to the creature, from the things that are unseen and eternal to the
   things that are seen and temporal. It is in its earliest
   manifestations, worldly, of the earth, earthy. As this is the testimony
   of universal experience, so also it is the doctrine of the Bible. Job
   xi. 12, "Man" is "born like a wild ass's colt." Ps. lviii. 3, "The
   wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray as soon as they be
   born, speaking lies." Prov. xxii. 15, "Foolishness (moral evil) is
   bound in the heart of a child."

   These three undeniable facts, the universality of sin among men, its
   controlling power, and its early manifestation, are clear proof of the
   corruption of our common nature. It is a principle of judgment
   universally recognized and acted upon, that a course of action in any
   creature, rational or irrational, which is universal and controlling,
   and which is adopted uniformly from the beginning of its being,
   determines and reveals its nature. That all individuals of certain
   species of animals live on prey; that all the individuals of another
   species live on herbs; that some are amphibious, and others live only
   on the land; some are gregarious, others solitary; some mild and
   docile, others ferocious and untamable; not under certain circumstances
   and conditions, but always and everywhere, under all the different
   circumstances of their being, is regarded as proof of their natural
   constitution. It shows what they are by nature, as distinguished from
   what they are, or may be made by external circumstances and culture.
   The same principle is applied to our judgments of men. Whatever is
   variable and limited in its manifestations; whatever is found in some
   men and not in others, we attribute to peculiar and limited causes, but
   what is universal and controlling is uniformly referred to the nature
   of man. Some of these universally manifested modes of action among men
   are referrible to the essential attributes of their nature, as reason
   and conscience. The fact that all men perform rational actions is a
   clear proof that they are rational creatures; and the fact that they
   perform moral actions is proof that they have a moral nature. Other
   universal modes of action are referred not to the essential attributes
   of human nature, but to its present abiding state. That all men seek
   ease and self-indulgence and prefer themselves to others, is not to be
   attributed to our nature as men, but to our present state. As the fact
   that all men perform moral actions is proof that they have a moral
   nature, so the fact that such moral action is always evil, or that all
   men sin from the earliest development of their powers, is a proof that
   their moral nature is depraved. It is utterly inconsistent with all
   just ideas of God that He created man with a nature which with absolute
   uniformity leads him to sin and destruction; or that He placed him in
   circumstances which inevitably secure his ruin. The present state of
   human nature cannot therefore be its normal and original condition. We
   are a fallen race. Our nature has become corrupted by our apostasy from
   God, and therefore every imagination (i.e., every exercise) of the
   thoughts of man's heart is only evil continually. See also Gen. viii.
   21. This is the Scriptural and the only rational solution of the
   undeniable fact of the deep, universal, and early manifested sinfulness
   of men in all ages, of every class, and in every part of the world.

   Evasions of the Foregoing Arguments.

   The methods adopted by those who deny the doctrine of original sin, to
   account for the universality of sin, are in the highest degree
   unsatisfactory.

   1. It is not necessary here to refer to the theories which get over
   this great difficulty either by denying the existence of sin, or by
   extenuating its evil nature, so that the difficulty ceases to exist. If
   there be really no such evil as sin, there is no sin to account for.
   But the fact of the existence of sin, of its universality and of its
   power, is too palpable and too much a matter of consciousness to admit
   of being denied or ignored.

   2. Others contend that we have in the free agency of man a sufficient
   solution of the universality of sin. Men can sin; they choose to sin,
   and no further reason for the fact need be demanded. If Adam sinned
   without an antecedent corrupt nature, why, it is asked, must corruption
   of nature be assumed to account for the fact that other men sin? A
   uniform effect, however, demands a uniform cause. That a man can walk
   is no adequate reason why he always walks in one direction. A man may
   exercise his faculties to attain one object or another; the fact that
   he does devote them through a long life to the acquisition of wealth is
   not accounted for by saying that he is a free agent. The question is,
   Why his free agency is always exercised in one particular direction.
   The fact, therefore, that men are free agents is no solution for the
   universal sinfulness and total apostasy of our race from God.

   3. Others seek in the order of development of the constituent elements
   of our nature, an explanation of the fact in question. We are so
   constituted that the sensuous faculties are called into exercise before
   the higher powers of reason and conscience. The former therefore attain
   an undue ascendency, and lead the child and the man to obey the lower
   instincts of his nature, when he should be guided by his higher
   faculties. But, in the first place, this is altogether an inadequate
   conception of our hereditary depravity. It does not consist exclusively
   or principally in the ascendency of the flesh (in the limited sense of
   that word) over the Spirit. It is a far deeper and more radical evil.
   It is spiritual death, according to the express declarations of the
   Scriptures. And, in the second place, it cannot be the normal condition
   of man that his natural faculties should develop in such order as
   inevitably and universally to lead to his moral degradation and ruin.
   And, in the third place, this theory relieves no difficulties while it
   accounts for no facts. It is as hard to reconcile with the justice and
   goodness of God that men should be born with a nature so constituted as
   certainly to lead them to sin, as that they should be born in a state
   of sin. It denies any fair probation to the race. According to the
   Scriptures and the doctrine of the Church, mankind had not only a fair
   but a favourable probation in Adam, who stood for them in the maturity
   and full perfection of his nature; and with every facility, motive and
   consideration adapted to secure his fidelity. This is far easier of
   belief than the assumption that God places the child in the first dawn
   of reason on its probation for eternity, with a nature already
   perverted, and under circumstances which in every case infallibly lead
   to its destruction. The only solution therefore which at all meets the
   case is the Scriptural doctrine that all mankind fell in Adam's first
   transgression, and bearing the penalty of his sin, they come into the
   world in a state of spiritual death, the evidence of which is seen and
   felt in the universality, the controlling power, and the early
   manifestation of sin.

   The Scriptures expressly Teach the Doctrine.

   The Scriptures not only indirectly teach the doctrine of original sin,
   or of the hereditary, sinful corruption of our nature as derived from
   Adam, by teaching, as we have seen, the universal and total depravity
   of our race, but they directly assert the doctrine. They not only teach
   expressly that men sin universally and from the first dawn of their
   being, but they also assert that the heart of man is evil. It is
   declared to be "Deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: Who
   can know it?" (Jer. xvii. 9.) "The heart of the sons of men is fully
   set in them to do evil." (Eccl. viii. 11.) Every imagination of the
   thoughts of his (man's) heart is only evil." (Gen. vi. 5); or as it is
   in Gen. viii. 21, "The imagination of man's heart is evil from his
   youth." By heart in Scriptural language is meant the man himself; the
   soul; that which is the seat and source of life. It is that which
   thinks, feels, desires, and wills. It is that out of which good or evil
   thoughts, desires, and purposes proceed. It never signifies a mere act,
   or a transient state of the soul. It is that which is abiding, which
   determines character. It bears the same relation to acts that the soil
   does to its productions. As a good soil brings forth herbs suited for
   man and beast, and an evil soil brings forth briars and thorns, so we
   are told that the human heart (human nature in its present state), is
   proved to be evil by the prolific crop of sins which it everywhere and
   always produces. Still more distinctly is this doctrine taught in Matt.
   vii. 16-19, where our Lord says that men are known by their fruits. "Do
   men gather grapes or thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good
   tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
   fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt
   tree bring forth good fruit." And again, in Matt. xii. 33, "Either make
   the tree good and his fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and his
   fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit." The very pith and
   point of these instructions is, that moral acts are a revelation of
   moral character. They do not constitute it, but simply manifest what it
   is. The fruit of a tree reveals the nature of the tree. It does not
   make that nature, but simply proves what it is. So in the case of man,
   his moral exercises, his thoughts and feelings, as well as his external
   acts, are determined by an internal cause. There is something in the
   nature of the man distinct from his acts and anterior to them, which
   determines his conduct (i.e., all his conscious exercises), to be
   either good or evil. If men are universally sinful, it is, according to
   our Lord's doctrine, proof positive that their nature is evil; as much
   so as corrupt fruit proves the tree to be corrupt. When therefore the
   Scriptures assert that the heart of man is "desperately wicked," they
   assert precisely what the Church means when she asserts our nature to
   be depraved. Neither the word, heart, nor nature, in such connections
   means substance or essence, but natural disposition. The words express
   a quality as distinguished from an essential attribute or property.
   Even when we speak of the nature of a tree, we do not mean its essence,
   but its quality; something which can be modified or changed without a
   change of substance. Thus our Lord speaks of making a tree good, or
   making it evil. The explanation of the Scriptural meaning of the word
   heart given above is confirmed by analogous and synonymous forums of
   expression used in the Bible. What is sometimes designated as an evil
   heart is called "the old man," "a law of sin in our members," "the
   flesh," "the carnal mind," etc. And on the other hand, what is called
   "a new heart," is called "the new man," "a new creature" (or nature),
   "the law of the Spirit," "the spiritual mind," etc. All these terms and
   phrases designate what is inherent, immanent, and abiding, as opposed
   to what is transient and voluntary. The former class of terms is used
   to describe the nature of man before it is regenerated, and the other
   to describe the change consequent on regeneration. The Scriptures,
   therefore, in declaring the heart of man to be deceitful and
   desperately wicked, and its imaginations or exercises to be only evil
   continually, assert in direct terms the Church doctrine of original
   sin.

   The Psalmist also directly asserts this doctrine when he says (Ps. li.
   5), "Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive
   me." In the preceding verses he had confessed his actual sins; and he
   here humbles himself still more completely before God by acknowledging
   his innate, hereditary depravity; a depravity which he did not regard
   as a mere weakness, or inclination to evil, but which he pronounces
   iniquity and sin. To this inherent, hereditary corruption he refers in
   the subsequent parts of the Psalm as his chief burden from which he
   most earnestly desired to be delivered. "Behold, thou desirest truth in
   the inward parts; and in the hidden part shalt thou make me to know
   wisdom. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I
   shall be whiter than snow. . . . . Create in me a clean heart, O God,
   and renew a right spirit within me." It was his inward parts, his
   interior nature, which had been shapen in iniquity and conceived in
   sin, which he prayed might be purified and renewed. The whole spirit of
   this Psalm and the connection in which the words of the fifth verse
   occur, have constrained the great majority of commentators and readers
   of the Scripture to recognize in this passage a direct affirmation of
   the doctrine of original sin. Of course no doctrine rests on any one
   isolated passage. What is taught in one place is sure to be assumed or
   asserted in other places. What David says of himself as born in sin is
   confirmed by other representations of Scripture, which show that what
   was true of him is no less true of all mankind. Thus (Job xiv. 4), "Who
   can bring a clean thing out of an unclean." (xv. 14), "What is man that
   he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be
   righteous?" Thus also our Lord says (John iii. 6), "That which is born
   of the flesh is flesh." This clearly means that, That which is born of
   corrupt parents is itself corrupt; and is corrupt in virtue of its
   descent or derivation. This is plain, (1.) From the common usage of the
   word flesh in a religious sense in the Scriptures. Besides the primary
   and secondary meanings of the word it is familiarly used in the Bible
   to designate our fallen and corrupt nature. Hence to be "in the flesh"
   is to be in a natural, unrenewed state; the works of the flesh, are
   works springing from a corrupt nature; to walk after the flesh, is to
   live under the controlling influence of a sinful nature. Hence to be
   carnal, or carnally minded, is to be corrupt, or, as Paul explains it,
   sold under, a slave to sin. (2.) Because the flesh is here opposed to
   the Spirit. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which
   is born of the Spirit is spirit." As the latter member of this verse
   undoubtedly means that, That which is derived from the Holy Spirit is
   holy, or conformed to the nature of the Holy Spirit; the former member
   must mean that, That which is derived from an evil source is itself
   evil. A child born of fallen parents derives from them a fallen,
   corrupt nature. (3.) This interpretation is demanded by the context.
   Our Lord is assigning the reason for the necessity of regeneration or
   spiritual birth. That reason is, the derivation of a corrupt nature by
   our natural birth. It is because we are born in sin that the renewing
   of the Holy Ghost is universally and absolutely necessary to our
   salvation.

   Another passage equally decisive is Eph. ii. 3: "We also" (i.e., we
   Jews as well as the Gentiles) "were by nature the children of wrath,
   even as others." Children of wrath, according to a familiar Hebrew
   idiom, means the objects of wrath. We, says the Apostle, as well as
   other men, are the objects of the divine wrath. That is, under
   condemnation, justly exposed to his displeasure. This exposure to the
   wrath of God, as He teaches, is not due exclusively to our sinful
   conduct, it is the condition in which we were born. We are by nature
   the children of wrath. The word nature in such forms of speech always
   stands opposed to what is acquired, or superinduced, or to what is due
   to ab extra influence or inward development. Paul says that he and
   Peter were by nature Jews, i.e., they were Jews by birth, not by
   proselytism. He says the Gentiles do by nature the things of the law;
   i.e., in virtue of their internal constitution, not by external
   instruction. The gods of the heathen, he says, are by nature no gods.
   They are such only in the opinions of men. In classic literature as in
   ordinary language, to say that men are by nature proud, or cruel, or
   just, always means that the predicate is due to them in virtue of their
   natural constitution or condition, and not simply on account of their
   conduct or acquired character. The dative phusei in this passage does
   not mean on account of, because phusis means simply nature, whether
   good or bad. Paul does not say directly that it is "on account of our
   (corrupt) nature we are the children of wrath," which interpretation
   requires the idea expressed by the word corrupt to be introduced into
   the text. He simply asserts that we are the children of wrath by
   nature; that is, as we were born. We are born in a state of sin and
   condemnation. And this is the Church doctrine of original sin. Our
   natural condition is not merely a condition of physical weakness, or of
   proneness to sin, or of subjection to evil dispositions, which, if
   cherished, become sinful; but we are born in a state of sin. Rueckert,
   a rationalistic commentator, says in reference to this passage: [241]
   "It is perfectly evident, from Rom. v. 12-20, that Paul was far from
   being opposed to the view expressed in Ps. li. 7, that men are born
   sinners; and as we interpret for no system, so we will not attempt to
   deny that the thought, We were born children of wrath,' i.e.. such as
   we were from our birth we were exposed to the divine wrath, is the true
   sense of these words."

   The Bible Represents Men as Spiritually Dead.

   Another way in which the Scriptures clearly teach the doctrine of
   original sin is to be found in the passages in which they describe the
   natural state of man since the fall. Men, all men, men of every nation,
   of every age, and of every condition, are represented as spiritually
   dead. The natural man, man as he is by nature, is destitute of the life
   of God, i.e., of spiritual life. His understanding is darkness, so that
   he does not know or receive the things of God. He is not susceptible of
   impression from the realities of the spiritual world. He is as
   insensible to them as a dead man to the things of this world. He is
   alienated from God, and utterly unable to deliver himself from this
   state of corruption and misery. Those, and those only, are represented
   as delivered from this state in which men are born, who are renewed by
   the Holy Ghost; who are quickened, or made alive by the power of God,
   and who are therefore called spiritual as governed and actuated by a
   higher principle than any which belongs to our fallen nature. "The
   natural man," says the Apostle (that is, man as he is by nature),
   "receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
   foolishness unto him: neither can he know them; because they are
   spiritually discerned." (1 Cor. ii. 14.) "You hath he quickened who
   were dead in trespasses and sins;" and not only you Gentiles, but "even
   us," when dead in sins, hath God "quickened together with Christ."
   (Eph. ii. 1, 5.) The state of all men, Jews and Gentiles, prior to
   regeneration, is declared to be a state of spiritual death. In Eph. iv.
   17, 18, this natural state of man is described by saying of the heathen
   that they "walk in the vanity of their mind (i.e., in sin), having the
   understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through
   the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their
   heart." Man's natural state is one of darkness, of which the proximate
   effect is ignorance and obduracy, and consequent alienation from God.
   It is true this is said of the heathen, but the Apostle constantly
   teaches that what is true of the heathen is no less true of the Jews;
   for there is no difference, since all have sinned and come short of the
   glory of God. With these few passages the whole tenour of the word of
   God agrees. Human nature in its present state is always and everywhere
   described as thus darkened and corrupted.

   Argument from the Necessity of Redemption.

   Another argument in support of the doctrine of original sin is that the
   Bible everywhere teaches that all men need redemption through the blood
   of Christ. The Scriptures know nothing of the salvation of any of the
   human family otherwise than through the redemption which is in Christ
   Jesus. This is so plainly the doctrine of the Bible that it never has
   been questioned in the Christian Church. Infants need redemption as
   well as adults, for they also are included in the covenant of grace.
   But redemption, in the Christian sense of the term, is deliverance
   through the blood of Christ, from the power and consequences of sin.
   Christ came to save sinners. He saves none but sinners. If He saves
   infants, infants must be in a state of sin. There is no possibility of
   avoiding this conclusion, except by denying one or the other of the
   premises from which it is drawn. We must either deny that infants are
   saved through Christ, which is such a thoroughly anti-Christian
   sentiment, that it has scarcely ever been avowed within the pale of the
   Church; or we must deny that redemption, in the Christian sense of the
   term, includes deliverance from sin. This is the ground taken by those
   who deny the doctrine of original sin, and yet admit that infants are
   saved through Christ. They hold that in their case redemption is merely
   preservation from sin. For Christ's sake, or through his intervention,
   they are transferred to a state of being in which their nature develops
   in holiness. In answer to this evasion it is enough to remark, (1.)
   That it is contrary to the plain and universally received doctrine of
   the Bible as to the nature of the work of Christ. (2.) That this view
   supersedes the necessity of redemption at all. The Bible, however,
   clearly teaches that the death of Christ is absolutely necessary; that
   if there had been any other way in which men could be saved Christ is
   dead in vain. (Gal. ii. 21; iii. 21.) But, according to the doctrine in
   question, there is no necessity for his death. If men are an unfallen,
   uncorrupted race, and if they can be preserved from sin by a mere
   change of their circumstances, why should there be the costly array of
   remedial means, the incarnation, the sufferings and death of the
   Eternal Son of God, for their salvation. It is perfectly plain that the
   whole Scriptural plan of redemption is founded in the apostasy of the
   whole human race from God. It assumed that men, all men, infants as
   well as adults, are in a state of sin and misery, from which none but a
   divine Saviour can deliver them.

   Argument from the Necessity of Regeneration.

   This is still further plain from what the Scriptures teach concerning
   the necessity of regeneration. By regeneration is meant both in
   Scripture and in the language of the Church, the renewing of the Holy
   Ghost; the change of heart or of nature effected by the power of the
   Spirit, by which the soul passes from a state of spiritual death into a
   state of spiritual life. It is that change from sin to holiness, which
   our Lord pronounces absolutely essential to salvation. Sinners only
   need regeneration. Infants need regeneration. Therefore infants are in
   a state of sin. The only point in this argument which requires to be
   proved, is that infants need regeneration in the sense above explained.
   This, however, hardly admits of doubt. (1.) It is proved by the
   language of the Scriptures which assert that all men must be born of
   the Spirit, in order to enter the Kingdom of God. The expression used,
   is absolutely universal. It means every human being descended from Adam
   by ordinary generation. No exception of class, tribe, character, or age
   is made; and we are not authorized to make any such exception. But
   besides, as remarked above, the reason assigned for this necessity of
   the new birth, applies to infants as well as to adults. All who are
   born of the flesh, and because they are thus born, our Lord says, must
   be born again (2.) Infants always have been included with their parents
   in every revelation or enactment of the covenant of grace. The promise
   to our first parents of a Redeemer, concerned their children as well as
   themselves. The covenant with Abraham was not only with him, but also
   with his posterity, infant and adult. The covenant at Mount Sinai,
   which as Paul teaches, included the covenant of grace, was solemnly
   ratified with the people and with their "little ones." The Scriptures,
   therefore, always contemplate children from their birth as needing to
   be saved, and as interested in the plan of salvation which it is the
   great design of the Bible to reveal. (3.) This is still further evident
   from the fact that the sign and seal of the covenant of grace,
   circumcision under the Old dispensation, and baptism under the New, was
   applied to new-born infants. Circumcision was indeed a sign and seal of
   the national covenant between God and the Hebrews as a nation. That is,
   it was a seal of those promises made to Abraham, and afterwards through
   Moses, which related to the external theocracy or Commonwealth of
   Israel. But nevertheless, it is plain, that besides these national
   promises, there was also the promise of redemption made to Abraham,
   which promise, the Apostle expressly says, has come upon us. (Gal. iii.
   14) That is, we (all believers) are included in the covenant made with
   Abraham. It is no less plain that circumcision was the sign and seal of
   that covenant. This is clear, because the Apostle teaches that Abraham
   received circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith. That is,
   it was the seal of that covenant which promised and secured
   righteousness on the condition of faith. It is also plain because the
   Scriptures teach that circumcision had a spiritual import. It signified
   inward purification. It was administered in order to teach men that
   those who received the rite, needed such purification, and that this
   great blessing was promised to those faithful to the covenant, of which
   circumcision was the seal. Hence, the Scriptures speak of the
   circumcision of the heart; of an inward circumcision effected by the
   Spirit as distinguished from that which was outward in the flesh.
   Compare Deut. x. 16; xxx. 6; Ezek. xliv. 7; Acts vii. 51; Rom. ii. 28.
   From all this it is clear that circumcision could not be administered
   according to its divinely constituted design to any who did not need
   the circumcision or regeneration of heart, to fit them for the presence
   and service of God. And as it was by divine command administered to
   infants when eight days old, the conclusion is inevitable that in the
   sight of God such infants need regeneration, and therefore are born in
   sin.

   The same argument obviously applies to infant baptism. Baptism is an
   ordinance instituted by Christ, to signify and seal the purification of
   the soul, by the sprinkling of his blood, and its regeneration by the
   Holy Ghost. It can therefore be properly administered only to those who
   are in a state of guilt and pollution. It is, however, administered to
   infants, and therefore infants are assumed to need pardon and
   sanctification. This is the argument which Pelagius and his followers,
   more than all others, found it most difficult to answer. They could not
   deny the import of the rite. They could not deny that it was properly
   administered to infants, and yet they refused to admit the unavoidable
   conclusion, that infants are born in sin. They were therefore driven to
   the unnatural evasion, that baptism was administered to infants, not on
   the ground of their present state, but on the assumption of their
   probable future condition. They were not sinners, but would probably
   become such, and thus need the benefits of which baptism is the sign
   and pledge. Even the Council of Trent found it necessary to protest
   against such a manifest perversion of a solemn sacrament, which reduced
   it to a mockery. The form of baptism as prescribed by Christ, and
   universally adopted by the Church, supposes that those to whom the
   sacrament is administered are sinners and need the remission of sin and
   the renewal of the Holy Ghost. Thus the doctrine of original sin is
   inwrought into the very texture of Christianity, and lies at the
   foundation of the institutions of the gospel.

   Argument from the Universality of Death.

   Another decisive argument on this subject, is drawn from the
   universality of death. Death, according to the Scriptures, is a penal
   evil. It presupposes sin. No rational moral creature is subject to
   death except on account of sin. Infants die, therefore infants are the
   subjects of sin. The only way to evade this argument is to deny that
   death is a penal evil. This is the ground taken by those who reject the
   doctrine of original sin. They assert that it is a natural evil,
   flowing from the original constitution of our nature, and that it is
   therefore no more a proof that all men are sinners, than the death of
   brutes is a proof that they are sinners. In answer to this objection,
   it is obvious to remark that men are not brutes. That irrational
   animals, incapable of sin, are subject to death, is therefore no
   evidence that moral creatures may be justly subject to the same evil,
   although free from sin. But, in the second place, what is of far more
   weight, the objection is in direct opposition to the declarations of
   the Word of God. According to the Bible, death in the case of man is a
   punishment. It was threatened against Adam as the penalty of
   transgression. If he had not sinned, neither had he died. The Apostle
   expressly declares that death is the wages (or punishment) of sin; and
   death is on account of sin. (Rom. vi. 23 and v. 12.) He not only
   asserts this as a fact, but assumes it as a principle, and makes it the
   foundation of his whole argument in Rom. v. 12-20. His doctrine as
   there stated is, where there is no law there is no sin. And where there
   is no sin there is no punishment. All men are punished, therefore all
   men are sinners. That all men are punished, he proves from the fact
   that all men die. Death is punishment. Death, he says, reigned from
   Adam to Moses. It reigns even over those who had not sinned in their
   own persons, by voluntary transgression, as Adam did. It reigns over
   infants. It has passed absolutely on all men because all are sinners.
   It cannot be questioned that such is the argument of the Apostle;
   neither can it be questioned that this argument is founded on the
   assumption that death, in the case of man, is a penal evil, and its
   infliction an undeniable proof of guilt. We must, therefore, either
   reject the authority of the Scriptures, or we must admit that the death
   of infants is a proof of their sinfulness.

   Although the Apostle's argument as above stated is a direct proof of
   original sin (or inherent, hereditary corruption), it is no less a
   proof, as urged on another occasion, of the imputation of Adam's sin.
   Paul does argue, in Rom. v. 12-20, to prove that as in our
   justification the righteousness on the ground of which we are accepted
   is not subjectively ours, but the righteousness of another, even
   Christ; so the primary ground of our condemnation to death is the sin
   of Adam, something outside of ourselves, and not personally ours. But
   it is to be borne in mind that the death of which he speaks in
   accordance with the uniform usage of Scripture, in such connections, is
   the death of a man; a death appropriate to his nature as a moral being
   formed in the image of God. The death threatened to Adam was not the
   mere dissolution of his body, but spiritual death, the loss of the life
   of God. The physical death of infants is a patent proof that they are
   subject to the penalty which came on men (which entered the world and
   passed on all men) on account of one man, or by one man's disobedience.
   And as that penalty was death spiritual as well as the dissolution of
   the body, the death of infants is a Scriptural and decisive proof of
   their being born destitute of original righteousness and infected with
   a sinful corruption of nature. Their physical death is proof that they
   are involved in the penalty the principal element of which is the
   spiritual death of the soul. It was by the disobedience of one man that
   all are constituted sinners, not only by imputation (which is true and
   most important), but also by inherent depravity; as it is by the
   obedience of one that all are constituted righteous, not only by
   imputation (which also is true and vitally important), but also by the
   consequent renewing of their nature flowing from their reconciliation
   to God.

   Argument from the Common Consent of Christians.

   Finally, it is fair, on this subject, to appeal to the faith of the
   Church universal. Protestants, in rejecting the doctrine of tradition,
   and in asserting that the Word of God as contained in the Scriptures of
   the Old and New Testaments is the only infallible rule of faith and
   practice, do not reject the authority of the Church as a teacher. They
   do not isolate themselves from the great company of the faithful in all
   ages, and set up a new faith. They hold that Christ promised the Holy
   Spirit to lead his people into the knowledge of the truth; that the
   Spirit does dwell as a teacher in all the children of God, and that
   those who are born of God are thus led to the knowledge and belief of
   the truth. There is therefore to the true Church, or the true people of
   God, but one faith, as there is but one Lord and one God the Father of
   all. Any doctrine, therefore, which can be proved to be a part of the
   faith (not of the external and visible Church, but) of the true
   children of God in all ages of the world, must be true. It is to be
   received not because it is thus universally believed, but because its
   being universally believed by true Christians is a proof that it is
   taught by the Spirit both in his Word and in the hearts of his people.
   This is a sound principle recognized by all Protestants. This universal
   faith of the Church is not to be sought so much in the decisions of
   ecclesiastical councils, as in the formulas of devotion which have
   prevailed among the people. It is, as often remarked, in the players,
   in the hymnology, in the devotional writings which true believers make
   the channel of their communion with God, and the medium through which
   they express their most intimate religious convictions, that we must
   look for the universal faith. From the faith of God's people no man can
   separate himself without forfeiting the communion of saints, and
   placing himself outside of the pale of true believers. If these things
   be admitted we must admit the doctrine of original sin. That doctrine
   has indeed been variously explained, and in many cases explained away
   by theologians and by councils, but it is indelibly impressed on the
   faith of the true Church. It pervades the prayers, the worship, and the
   institutions of the Church. All true Christians are convinced of sin;
   they are convinced not only of individual transgressions, but also of
   the depravity of their heart and nature. They recognize this depravity
   as innate and controlling. They groan under it as a grievous burden.
   They know that they are by nature the children of wrath. Parents bring
   their children to Christ to be washed by his blood and renewed by his
   Spirit, as anxiously as mothers crowded around our Lord when on earth,
   with their suffering infants that they might be healed by his grace and
   power. Whatever difficulties, therefore, may attend the doctrine of
   original sin, we must accept it as clearly taught in the Scriptures,
   confirmed by the testimony of consciousness and history, and sustained
   by the faith of the Church universal.

   Objections.

   The objections to this doctrine, it must be admitted, are many and
   serious. But this is true of all the great doctrines of religion,
   whether natural or revealed. Nor are such difficulties confined to the
   sphere of religion. Our knowledge in every department is limited, and
   in a great measure confined to isolated facts. We know that a stone
   falls to the ground, that a seed germinates and produces a plant after
   its own kind; but it is absolutely impossible for us to understand how
   these familiar effects are accomplished. We know that God is, and that
   He governs all his creatures, but we do not know how his effectual
   controlling agency is consistent with the free agency of rational
   beings. We know that sin and misery exist in the world, and we know
   that God is infinite in power, holiness, and benevolence. How to
   reconcile the prevalence of sin with the character of God we know not.
   These are familiar and universally admitted facts as well in philosophy
   as in religion. A thing may be, and often certainly is true, against
   which objections may be urged which no man is able to answer. There are
   two important practical principles which follow from the facts just
   mentioned. First, that it is not a sufficient or a rational ground for
   rejecting any well authenticated truth that we are not able to free it
   from objections or difficulties. And, secondly, any objection against a
   religious doctrine is to be regarded as sufficiently answered if it can
   be shown to bear with equal force against an undeniable fact. If the
   objection is not a rational reason for denying the fact it is not a
   rational reason for rejecting the doctrine. This is the method which
   the sacred writers adopt in vindicating truth.

   It will be seen that almost all the objections against the doctrine of
   original sin are in conflict with one or the other of the principles
   just mentioned. Either they are addressed not to the evidences of the
   truth of the doctrine whether derived from Scripture or from
   experience, but to the difficulty of reconciling it with other truths;
   or these objections are insisted upon as fatal to the doctrine when
   they obviously are as valid against the facts of providence as they are
   against the teachings of Scripture.

   The Objection that Men are Responsible only for their Voluntary Acts.

   1. The most obvious objection to the doctrine of original sin is
   rounded on the assumption that nothing can have moral character except
   voluntary acts and the states of mind resulting from or produced by our
   voluntary agency, and which are subject to the power of the will. This
   objection rests on a principle which has already been considered. It
   reaches very far. If it be sound, then there can be no such thing as
   concreated holiness, or habitual grace, or innate, inherent, or
   indwelling sin. But we have already seen, when treating of the nature
   of sin, that according to the Scriptures, the testimony of
   consciousness, and the universal judgment of men) the moral character
   of dispositions depends on their nature and not on their origin. Adam
   was holy, although so created. Saints are holy, although regenerated
   and sanctified by the almighty power of God. And therefore the soul is
   truly sinful if the subject of sinful dispositions, although those
   dispositions should be innate and entirely beyond the control of the
   will. Here it will be seen that the objection is not against the
   Scriptural evidence of the doctrine that men are born in sin, nor
   against the testimony of facts to the truth of that doctrine; but it is
   founded on the difficulty of reconciling the doctrine of innate sin
   with certain assumed principles as to the nature and grounds of moral
   obligation. Whether we can refute those principles or not, does not
   affect the truth of the doctrine. We might as well deny all prophecy
   and all providence, because we cannot reconcile the absolute control of
   free agents with their liberty. If the assumed moral axiom that a man
   can be responsible only for his own acts, conflicts with the facts of
   experience and the teachings of Scriptures, the rational course is to
   deny the pretended axiom, and not to reject the facts with which it is
   in conflict. The Bible, the Church, the mass of mankind, and the
   conscience, hold a man responsible for his character, no matter how
   that character was formed or whence it was derived; and, therefore, the
   doctrine of original sin is not in conflict with intuitive moral
   truths.

   Objection Founded on the Justice of God.

   2. It is objected that it is inconsistent with the justice of God that
   men should come into the world in a state of sin. In answer to this
   objection it may be remarked, (1.) That whatever God does must be
   right. If He permits men to be born in sin, that fact must be
   consistent with his divine perfection. (2.) It is a fact of experience
   no less than a doctrine of Scripture that men are either, as the Church
   teaches, born in a state of sin and condemnation, or, as all men must
   admit, in a state which inevitably leads to their becoming sinful and
   miserable. The objection, therefore, bears against a providential fact
   as much as against a Scriptural doctrine. We must either deny God or
   admit that the existence and universality of sin among men is
   compatible with his nature and with his government of the world. (3.)
   The Bible, as often before remarked, accounts for and vindicates the
   corruption of our race on the ground that mankind had a full and fair
   probation in Adam, and that the spiritual death in which they are born
   is part of the judicial penalty of his transgression. If we reject this
   solution of the fact, we cannot deny the fact itself, and, being a
   fact, it must be consistent with the character of God.

   The Doctrine represents God as the Author of Sin.

   3. A third objection often and confidently urged is, that the Church
   doctrine on this subject makes God the author of sin. God is the author
   of our nature, If our nature be sinful, God must be the author of sin.
   The obvious fallacy of this syllogism is, that the word nature is used
   in one sense in the major proposition, and in a different sense in the
   minor. In the one it means substance or essence; in the other, natural
   disposition. It is true that God is the author of our essence. But our
   essence is not sinful. God is indeed our Creator. He made us, and not
   we ourselves. We are the work of his hands. He is the Father of the
   spirits of all men. But He is not the author of the evil dispositions
   with which that nature is infected at birth. The doctrine of original
   sin attributes no efficiency to God in the production of evil. It
   simply supposes that He judicially abandons our apostate race, and
   withholds from the descendants of Adam the manifestations of his favour
   and love, which are the life of the soul. That the inevitable
   consequence of this judicial abandonment is spiritual death, no more
   makes God the author of sin, than the immorality and desperate and
   unchanging wickedness of the reprobate, from whom God withholds his
   Spirit, are to be referred to the infinitely Holy One as their author.
   It is moreover a historical fact universally admitted, that character,
   within certain limits, is transmissible from parents to children. Every
   nation, separate tribe, and even every extended family of men, has its
   physical, mental, social, and moral peculiarities which are propagated
   from generation to generation. No process of discipline or culture can
   transmute a Tartar into an Englishman, or an Irishman into a Frenchman.
   The Bourbons, the Hapsburgs, and other historical families, have
   retained and transmitted their peculiarities for ages. We may be unable
   to explain thus, but we cannot deny it. No one is born an absolute man,
   with nothing but generic humanity belonging to him. Everyone is born a
   man in a definite state, with all those characteristics physical,
   mental, and moral, which make up his individuality. There is nothing
   therefore in the doctrine of hereditary depravity out of analogy with
   providential facts.

   It is said to destroy the Free Agency of Men.

   4. It is further objected to this doctrine that it destroys the free
   agency of man. If we are born with a corrupt nature by which we are
   inevitably determined to sinful acts, we cease to be free in performing
   those acts, and consequently are not responsible for them. This
   objection is founded on a particular theory of liberty, and must stand
   or fall with it. The same objection is urged against the doctrines of
   decrees, of efficacious grace, of the perseverance of the saints, and
   all other doctrines which assume that a free act can be absolutely
   certain as to its occurrence. It is enough here to remark that the
   doctrine of original sin supposes men to have the same kind and degree
   of liberty in sinning under the influence of a corrupt nature, that
   saints and angels have in acting rightly under the influence of a holy
   nature. To act according to its nature is the only liberty which
   belongs to any created being.

   § 14. The Seat of Original Sin.

   Having considered the nature of original sin, the next question
   concerns its seat. According to one theory it is in the body. The only
   evil effect of Adam's sin upon his posterity, which some theologians
   admit, is the disorder of his physical nature, whereby undue influence
   is secured to bodily appetites and passions. Scarcely distinguishable
   from this theory is the doctrine that the sensuous nature of man, as
   distinguished from the reason and conscience, is alone affected by our
   hereditary depravity. A third doctrine is, that the heart, considered
   as the seat of the affections as distinguished from the understanding,
   is the seat of natural depravity. This doctrine is connected with the
   idea that all sin and holiness are forms of feeling or states of the
   affections. And it is made the ground on which the nature of
   regeneration and conversion, the relation between repentance and faith,
   and other points of practical theology are explained. Everything is
   made to depend on the inclinations or state of the feelings. Instead of
   the affections following the understanding, the understanding it is
   said, follows the affections. A man understands and receives the truth
   only when he loves it. Regeneration is simply a change in time state of
   the affections, and the only inability under which sinners labour as to
   the things of God, is disinclination. In opposition to all these
   doctrines Augustinianism, as held by the Lutheran and Reformed
   Churches, teaches that the whole man, soul and body, the higher as well
   as the lower, the intellectual as well as the emotional faculties of
   the soul, is affected by the corruption of our nature derived from our
   first parents.

   As the Scriptures speak of the body being sanctified in two senses,
   first, as being consecrated to the service of God; and secondly, as
   being in a normal condition in all its relations to our spiritual
   nature, so as to be a fit instrument unto righteousness; and also as a
   partaker of the benefits of redemption; so also they represent the body
   as affected by the apostasy of our race. It is not only employed in the
   service of sin or as an instrument to unrighteousness; but it is in
   every respect deteriorated. It is inordinate in its cravings,
   rebellious, and hard to restrain. It is as the Apostle says, the
   opposite of the glorious, spiritual body with which the believer is
   hereafter to be invested.

   The Whole Soul the Seat of Original Sin.

   The theory that the affections (or, the heart in the limited sense of
   that word), to the exclusion of the rational faculties, are alone
   affected by original sin, is unscriptural, and the opposite doctrine
   which makes the whole soul the subject of inherent corruption, is the
   doctrine of the Bible, as appears, --

   1. Because the Scriptures do not make the broad distinction between the
   understanding and the heart, which is commonly made in our philosophy.
   They speak of "the thoughts of the heart," of "the intents of the
   heart," and of "the eyes of the heart," as well as of its emotions and
   affections. The whole immaterial principle is in the Bible designated
   as the soul, the spirit, the mind, the heart. And therefore when it
   speaks of the heart, it means the man, the self, that in which personal
   individuality resides. If the heart be corrupt the whole soul in all
   its powers is corrupt.

   2. The opposite doctrine assumes that there is nothing moral in our
   cognitions or judgments; that all knowledge is purely speculative.
   Whereas, according to the Scripture the chief sins of men consist in
   their wrong judgments, in thinking and believing evil to be good, and
   good to be evil. This in its highest form, as our Lord teaches us, is
   the unpardonable sin, or blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. It was
   because the Pharisees thought that Christ was evil, that his works were
   the works of Satan, that He declared that they could never be forgiven.
   It was because Paul could see no beauty in Christ that he should desire
   Him, and because he verily thought he was doing God service in
   persecuting believers, that he was, and declared himself to be, the
   chief of sinners. It is, as the Bible clearly reveals, because men are
   ignorant of God, and blind to the manifestation of his glory in the
   person of his Son, that they are lost. On the other hand the highest
   form of moral excellence consists in knowledge. To know God is eternal
   life. To know Christ is to be like Christ. The world, He says, hath not
   known me, but these (believers) have known me. True religion consists
   in the knowledge of the Lord, and its universal prevalence among men is
   predicted by saying, "All shall know Him from the least unto the
   greatest." Throughout the Scriptures wisdom is piety, the wise are the
   good; folly is sin, and the foolish are the wicked. Nothing can be more
   repugnant to the philosophy of the Bible than the dissociation of moral
   character from knowledge; and nothing can be more at variance with our
   own consciousness. We know that every affection in a rational creature
   includes an exercise of the cognitive faculties; and every exercise of
   our cognitive faculties, in relation to moral and religious subjects,
   includes the exercise of our moral nature.

   3. A third argument on this subject is drawn from the fact that the
   Bible represents the natural or unrenewed man as blind or ignorant as
   to the things of the Spirit. It declares that he cannot know them. And
   the fallen condition of human nature is represented as consisting
   primarily in this mental blindness. Men are corrupt, says the Apostle,
   through the ignorance that is in them.

   4. Conversion is said to consist in a translation from darkness to
   light. God is said to open the eyes. The eyes of the understanding (or
   heart) are said to be enlightened. All believers are declared to be the
   subjects of a spiritual illumination. Paul describes his own conversion
   by saying that, "God revealed his Son in him." He opened his eyes to
   enable him to see that Jesus was the Son of God, or God manifest in the
   flesh. He thereby became a new creature, and his whole life was
   thenceforth devoted to the service of Him, whom before he hated and
   persecuted.

   5. Knowledge is said to be the effect of regeneration. Men are renewed
   so as to know. They are brought to the knowledge of the truth; and they
   are sanctified by the truth. From all these considerations it is
   evident that the whole man is the subject of original sin; that our
   cognitive, as well as our emotional nature is involved in the depravity
   consequent on our apostasy from God that in knowing as well as in
   loving or in willing, we are under the influence and dominion of sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 15. Inability.

   The third great point included in the Scriptural doctrine of original
   sin, is the inability of fallen man in his natural state, of himself to
   do anything spiritually good. This is necessarily included in the idea
   of spiritual death. On this subject it is proposed: (1.) To state the
   doctrine as presented in the symbols of the Protestant churches. (2.)
   To explain the nature of the inability under which the sinner is said
   to labour. (3.) To exhibit the Scriptural proofs of the doctrine; and
   (4.) To answer the objections usually urged against it.

   The Doctrine as stated in Protestant Symbols.

   There have been three general views as to the ability of fallen man,
   which have prevailed in the Church. The first, the Pelagian doctrine,
   which asserts the plenary ability of sinners to do all that God
   requires of them. The second is the Semi-Pelagian doctrine (taking the
   word Semi-Pelagian in its wide and popular sense), which admits the
   powers of man to have been weakened by the fall of the race, but denies
   that he lost all ability to perform what is spiritually good. And
   thirdly, the Augustinian or Protestant doctrine which teaches that such
   is the nature of inherent, hereditary depravity that men since the fall
   are utterly unable to turn themselves unto God, or to do anything truly
   good in his sight. With these three views of the ability of fallen men
   are connected corresponding views of grace, or the influence and
   operations of the Holy Spirit in man's regeneration and conversion.
   Pelagians deny the necessity of any supernatural influence of the
   Spirit in the regeneration and sanctification of men. Semi-Pelagians
   admit the necessity of such divine influence to assist the enfeebled
   powers of man in the work of turning unto God, but claim that the
   sinner coöperates in that work and that upon his voluntary coöperation
   the issue depends. Augustinians and Protestants ascribe the whole work
   of regeneration to the Spirit of God, the soul being passive therein,
   the subject, and not the agent of the change; although active and
   coöperating in all the exercises of the divine life of which it has
   been made the recipient.

   The doctrine of the sinner's inability is thus stated in the symbols of
   the Lutheran Church. The "Augsburg Confession" [242] says: "Humana
   voluntas habet aliquam libertatem ad efficiendam civilem justitiam et
   deligendas res rationi subjectas. Sed non habet vim sine Spiritu Sancto
   efficiendæ justitiæ Dei, seu justitiæ spiritualis, quia animalis homo
   non percepit ea quæ sunt Spiritus Dei (1 Cor. ii. 14); sed hæc fit in
   cordibus, cum per verbum Spiritus Sanctus concipitur. Hæc totidem
   verbis dicit Augustinus; [243] est, fatemur, liberum arbitrium omnibus
   hominibus; habens quidem judicium rationis, non per quod sit idoneum,
   quæ ad Deum pertinent, sine Deo aut inchoare aut certe peragere: sed
   tantum in operibus vitæ presentis, tam bonis, quam etiam malis."

   "Formula Concordiæ:" [244] "Etsi humana ratio seu naturalis intellectus
   hominis, obscuram aliquam notitiæ illius scintillulam reliquam habet,
   quod sit Deus, et particulam aliquam legis tenet: tamen adeo ignorans,
   coeca, et perversa est ratio illa, ut ingeniosissimi homines in hoc
   mundo evangelium de Filio Dei et promissiones divinas de æterna salute
   legant vel audiant, tamen ea propriis viribus percipere, intelligere,
   credere et vera esse, statuere nequeant. Quin potius quanto diligentius
   in ea re elaborant, ut spirituales res istas suæ rationis acumine
   indagent et comprehendant, tanto minus intelligunt et credunt, et ea
   omnia pro stultitia et meris nugis et fabulis habent, priusquam a
   Spiritu Sancto illuminentur et doceantur." Again, [245] "Natura
   corrupta viribus suis coram Deo nihil aliud, nisi peccare possit."

   "Sacræ literæ hominis non renati cor duro lapidi, qui ad tactum non
   cedat, sed resistat, idem rudi trunco, interdum etiam feræ in domitæ
   comparant, non quod homo post lapsum non amplius sit rationalis
   creatura, aut quod absque auditu et meditatione verbi divini ad Deum
   convertatur, aut quod in rebus externis et civilibus nihil boni aut
   mali intelligere possit, aut libere aliquid agere vel omittere queat."
   [246]

   "Antequam homo per Spiritum Sanctum illuminatur, convertitur,
   regeneratur et trahitur, ex sese, et propriis naturalibus suis viribus
   in rebus spiritualibus, et ad conversionem aut regenerationem suam
   nihil inchoare, operari, aut coöperari potest, nec plus, quam lapis,
   truncus, aut limus." [247]

   The doctrine of the Reformed churches is to the same effect. [248]
   "Confessio Helvetica II.:" "Non sublatus est quidem homini intellectus,
   non erepta ei voluntas, et prorsus in lapidem vel truncum est
   commutatus: cæterum illa ita sunt immutata et inminuta in homine, ut
   non possint amplius, quod potuerunt ante lapsum. Intellectus enim
   obscuratus est: voluntas vero ex libera, facta est voluntas serva. Nam
   servit peccato, non nolens, sed volens. Etenim voluntas, non noluntas
   dicitur. . . . .

   "Quantum vero ad bonum et ad virtutes, intellectus hominis, non recte
   judicat de divinis ex semetipso. . . . Constat vero mentem vel
   intellectum ducem esse voluntatis, cum autem coecus sit dux, claret
   quousque et voluntas pertingat. Proinde nullum est ad bonum homini
   arbitrium liberum, nondum renato; vires nullæ ad perficiendum
   bonum. . . . . [249] Cæterum nemo negat in externis, et regenitos et
   non regenitos habere liberum arbitrium. . . . . Damnamus in hac causa
   Manichæos, qui negant homini bono, ex libero arbitrio fuisse initium
   mali. Damnamus etiam Pelagianos, qui dicunt hominem malum sufficienter
   habere liberum arbitrium, ad faciendum præceptum bonum."

   "Confessio Gallicana:" "Etsi enim nonnullam habet boni et mali
   discretionem: affirmamus tamen quicquid habet lucis mox fieri tenebras,
   cum de quærendo Deo agitur, adeo ut sua intelligentia et ratione nullo
   modo possit ad eum accedere: item quamvis voluntate sit præditus, qua
   ad hoc vel illud movetur, tamen quum ea sit penitus sub peccato
   captiva, nullam prorsus habet ad bonum appetendum libertatem, nisi quam
   ex gratia et Dei dono acceperit." [250]

   "Articuli XXXIX:" "Ea est hominis post lapsum Adæ conditio, ut sese
   naturalibus suis viribus et bonis operibus ad fidem et invocationem Dei
   convertere ac præparare non possit. Quare absque gratia Dei quæ per
   Christum est nos præveniente, ut velimus et cooperante dum volumus, ad
   pietatis opera facienda, quæ Deo grata sunt ac accepta, nihil valemus."
   [251]

   "Opera quæ fiunt ante gratiam Christi, et Spiritus ejus afflatum, cum
   ex fide Christi non prodeant minime Deo grata sunt. . . . . Immo, cum
   non sint facta ut Deus illa fieri voluit et præcepit, peccati rationem
   habere non dubitamus." [252]

   "Canones Dordrechtanæ," [253] "Omnes homines in peccato concipiuntur,
   et filii iræ nascuntur, inepti ad omne bonum salutare, propensi ad
   malum, in peccatis mortui, et peccati servi; et absque Spiritus Sancti
   regenerantis gratia, ad Deum redire, naturam depravatam corrigere, vel
   ad ejus correctionem se disponere nec volunt, nec possunt."

   "Residuum quidem est post lapsum in homine lumen aliquod naturæ, cujus
   beneficio ille notitias quasdam de Deo, de rebus naturalibus, de
   discrimine honestorum et turpium retinet, et aliquod virtutis ac
   disciplinæ externæ studium ostendit: sed tantum abest, ut hoc naturæ
   lumine ad salutarem Dei cognitionem pervenire, et ad eum se convertere
   possit, ut ne quidem eo in naturalibus ac civilibus recte utatur,
   quinimo qualecumque id demum sit, id totum variis modis contaminet
   atque in injustitia detineat, quod dum facit, coram Deo inexcusabilis
   redditur." [254]

   "Westminster Confession." [255] Original sin is declared in sections
   second and third to include the loss of original righteousness, and a
   corrupted nature; "whereby," in section fourth, it is declared, "we are
   utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly
   inclined to all evil."

   "Their (believers') ability to do good works is not at all of
   themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ." [256]

   Effectual calling "is of God's free and special grace alone, not from
   anything at all foreseen in man, who is altogether passive therein,
   until, being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby
   enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered and
   conveyed in it." [257]

   The Nature of the Sinner's Inability.

   It appears from the authoritative statements of this doctrine, as given
   in the standards of the Lutheran and Reformed churches, that the
   inability under which man, since the fall, is said to labour, does not
   arise: --

   Inability does not arise from the Loss of any Faculty of the Soul.

   1. From the loss of any faculty of his mind or of any original,
   essential attribute of his nature. He retains his reason, will, and
   conscience. He has the intellectual power of cognition, the power of
   self-determination, and the faculty of discerning between moral good
   and evil. His conscience, as the Apostle says, approves or disapproves
   of his moral acts.

   Nor from the Loss of Free-agency.

   2 The doctrine of man's inability, therefore, does not assume that man
   has ceased to be a free moral agent. He is free because he determines
   his own acts. Every volition is an act of free self-determination. He
   is a moral agent because he has the consciousness of moral obligation,
   and whenever he sins he acts freely against the convictions of
   conscience or the precepts of the moral law. That a man is in such a
   state that he uniformly prefers and chooses evil instead of good, as do
   the fallen angels, is no more inconsistent with his free moral agency
   than his being in such a state as that he prefers and chooses good with
   the same uniformity that the holy angels do.

   Inability not mere Disinclination.

   3. The inability of sinners, according to the above statement of the
   doctrine, is not mere disinclination or aversion to what is good. This
   disinclination exists, but it is not the ultimate fact. There must be
   some cause or reason for it. As God and Christ are infinitely lovely,
   the fact that sinners do not love them is not accounted for by saying
   that they are not inclined to delight in infinite excellence. That is
   only stating the same thing in different words. If a man does not
   perceive the beauty of a work of art, or of a literary production, it
   is no solution of the fact to say that he has no inclination for such
   forms of beauty. Why is it that what is beautiful in itself, and in the
   judgment of all competent judges, is without form or comeliness in his
   eyes? Why is it that the supreme excellence of God, and all that makes
   Christ the chief among ten thousand and the one altogether lovely in
   the sight of saints and angels, awaken no corresponding feelings in the
   unrenewed heart? The inability of the sinner, therefore, neither
   consists in his disinclination to good nor does it arise exclusively
   from that source.

   It Arises from the Want of Spiritual Discernment.

   4. According to the Scriptures and to the standards of doctrine above
   quoted, it consists in the want of power rightly to discern spiritual
   things, and the consequent want of all right affections toward them.
   And this want of power of spiritual discernment arises from the
   corruption of our whole nature, by which the reason or understanding is
   blinded, and the taste and feelings are perverted. And as this state of
   mind is innate, as it is a state or condition of our nature, it lies
   below the will, and is beyond its power, controlling both our
   affections and our volitions. It is indeed a familiar fact of
   experience that a man's judgments as to what is true or false, right or
   wrong, are in many cases determined by his interests or feelings. Some
   have, in their philosophy, generalized this fact into a law, and teach
   that as to all æsthetic and moral subjects the judgments and
   apprehensions of the understanding are determined by the state of the
   feelings. In applying this law to the matters of religion they insist
   that the affections only are the subject of moral corruption, and that
   if these be purified or renewed, the understanding then apprehends and
   judges rightly as a matter of course. It would be easy to show that
   this, as a philosophical theory, is altogether unsatisfactory. The
   affections suppose an object. They can be excited only in view of an
   object. If we love we must love something. Love is complacency and
   delight in the thing loved, and of necessity supposes the apprehension
   of it as good and desirable. It is clearly impossible that we should
   love God unless we apprehend his nature and perfections; and therefore
   to call love into exercise it is necessary that the mind should
   apprehend God as He really is. Otherwise the affection would be neither
   rational nor holy. This, however, is of subordinate moment. The
   philosophy of one man has no authority for other men. It is only the
   philosophy of the Bible, that which is assumed or presupposed in the
   doctrinal statements of the Word of God, to which we are called upon
   unhesitatingly to submit. Everywhere in the Scriptures it is asserted
   or assumed that the feelings follow the understanding, that the
   illumination of the mind in the due apprehension of spiritual objects
   is the necessary preliminary condition of all right feeling and
   conduct. We must know God in order to love Him. This is distinctly
   asserted by the Apostle in 1 Cor. ii. 14. He there says, (1.) That the
   natural or unrenewed man does not receive the things of the Spirit.
   (2.) The reason why he does not receive them is declared to be that
   they are foolishness unto him, or that he cannot know them. (3.) And
   the reason why he cannot know them is that they are spiritually
   discerned. It is ignorance, the want of discernment of the beauty,
   excellence, and suitableness of the things of the Spirit (i.e., of the
   truths which the Spirit has revealed), that is the reason or cause of
   unbelief. So also in Eph. iv. 18, he says, The heathen (unconverted
   men) are "alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is
   in them." Hence his frequent prayers for the illumination of his
   readers; and the supplication of the Psalmist that his eyes might be
   opened. Hence, also, true conversion is said to be effected by a
   revelation. Paul was instantaneously changed from a persecutor to a
   worshipper of Christ, when it pleased God to reveal his Son in him.
   Those who perish are lost because the god of this world has blinded
   their eyes so that they fail to see the glory of God in the face of
   Jesus Christ. It is in accordance with this principle that knowledge is
   essential to holiness, that true religion and life everlasting are said
   to consist in the knowledge of God (John xvii. 3); and that men are
   said to be saved and sanctified by the truth. It is therefore the clear
   doctrine of the Bible that the inability of men does not consist in
   mere disinclination or opposition of feeling to the things of God, but
   that this disinclination or alienation, as the Apostle calls it, arises
   from the blindness of their minds. We are not, however, to go to the
   opposite extreme, and adopt what has been called the "light system,"
   which teaches that men are regenerated by light or knowledge, and that
   all that is needed is that the eyes of the understanding should be
   opened. As the whole soul is the subject of original sin the whole soul
   is the subject of regeneration. A blind man cannot possibly rejoice in
   the beauties of nature or art until his sight is restored. But, if
   uncultivated, the mere restoration of sight will not give him the
   perception of beauty. His whole nature must be refined and elevated. So
   also the whole nature of apostate man must be renewed by the Holy
   Ghost; then his eyes being opened to the glory of God in Christ, he
   will rejoice in Him with joy unspeakable and full of glory. But the
   illumination of the mind is indispensable to holy feelings, and is
   their proximate cause. This being the doctrine of the Bible, it follows
   that the sinner's disability does not consist in mere disinclination to
   holiness.

   Inability Asserted only in Reference to the "Things of the Spirit."

   5. This inability is asserted only in reference to "the things of the
   Spirit." It is admitted in all the Confessions above quoted that man
   since the fall has not only the liberty of choice of
   self-determination, but also is able to perform moral acts, good as
   well as evil. He can be kind and just, and fulfil his social duties in
   a mariner to secure the approbation of his fellow-men. It is not meant
   that the state of mind in which these acts are performed, or the
   motives by which they are determined, are such as to meet the
   approbation of an infinitely holy God; but simply that these acts, as
   to the matter of them, are prescribed by the moral law. Theologians, as
   we have seen, designate the class of acts as to which fallen man
   retains his ability as "justitia civilis," or "things external." And
   the class as to which his inability is asserted is designated as "the
   things of God," "the things of the Spirit," "things connected with
   salvation." The difference between these two classes of acts, although
   it may not be easy to state it in words, as universally recognized.
   There is an obvious difference between morality and religion; and
   between those religious affections of reverence and gratitude which all
   men more or less experience, and true piety. The difference lies in the
   state of mind, the motives, and the apprehension of the objects of
   these affections. It is the difference between holiness and mere
   natural feeling. What the Bible and all the Confessions of the churches
   of the Reformation assert is, that man, since the fall, cannot change
   his own heart he cannot regenerate his soul; he cannot repent with
   godly sorrow, or exercise that faith which is unto salvation. He
   cannot, in short, put forth any holy exercise or perform any act in
   such a way as to merit the approbation of God. Sin cleaves to all he
   does, and from the dominion of sin he cannot free himself.

   In one Sense this Inability is Natural.

   6. This inability is natural in one familiar and important sense of the
   word. It is not natural in the same sense that reason, will, and
   conscience are natural. These constitute our nature, and without them
   or any one of them, we should cease to be men. In the second place, it
   is not natural as arising from the necessary limitations of our nature
   and belonging to our original and normal condition. It arises out of
   the nature of man as a creature that he cannot create, and cannot
   produce any effect out of himself by a mere volition. Adam in the state
   of perfection could not will a stone to move, or a plant to grow. It is
   obvious that an inability arising from either of the sources above
   mentioned, i.e., from the want of any of the essential faculties of our
   nature, or from the original and normal limitations of our being,
   involves freedom from obligation. In this sense nothing is more true
   than that ability limits obligation. No creature can justly be required
   to do what surpasses his powers as a creature.

   On the other hand, although the inability of sinners is not natural in
   either of the senses above stated, it is natural in the sense that it
   arises out of the present state of his nature. It is natural in the
   same sense as selfishness, pride, and worldly mindedness are natural.
   It is not acquired, or super-induced by any ab extra influence, but
   flows from the condition in which human nature exists since the fall of
   Adam.

   In another Sense it is Moral.

   7. This inability, although natural in the sense just stated, is
   nevertheless moral, inasmuch as it arises out of the moral state of the
   soul, as it relates to moral action, and as it is removed by a moral
   change, that is, by regeneration.

   Objections to the Popular Distinction between Natural and Moral
   Ability.

   In this country much stress has been laid upon the distinction between
   moral and natural ability. It has been regarded as one of the great
   American improvements in theology, and as marking an important advance
   in the science. It is asserted that man since the fall has natural
   ability to do all that is required of him, and on this ground his
   responsibility is made to rest; but it is admitted that he is morally
   unable to turn unto God, or perfectly keep his commandments. By this
   distinction, it is thought, we may save the great principle that
   ability limits obligation, that a man cannot be bound to do what he
   cannot do, and at the same time hold fast the Scriptural doctrine which
   teaches that the sinner cannot of himself repent or change his own
   heart. With regard to this distinction as it is commonly and popularly
   presented, it may be remarked: --

   1. That the terms natural and moral are not antithetical. A thing may
   be at once natural and moral. The inability of the sinner, as above
   remarked, although moral, is in a most important sense natural. And,
   therefore, it is erroneous to say, that it is simply moral and not
   natural.

   2. The terms are objectionable not only because they lack precision,
   but also because they are ambiguous. One man means by natural ability
   nothing more than the possession of the attributes of reason, will, and
   conscience. Another means plenary power, all that is requisite to
   produce a given effect. And this is the proper meaning of the words.
   Ability is the power to do. If a man has the natural ability to love
   God, he has full power to love Him. And if He has the power to love
   Him, he has all that is requisite to call that love into exercise. As
   this is the proper meaning of the terms, it is the meaning commonly
   attached to them. Those who insist on the natural ability of the
   sinner, generally assert that he has full power, without divine
   assistance, to do all that is required of him: to love God with all his
   soul and mind and strength, and his neighbour as himself. All that
   stands in the way of his thus doing is not an inability, but simply
   disinclination, or the want of will. An ability which is not adequate
   to the end contemplated, is no ability. It is therefore a serious
   objection to the use of this distinction, as commonly made, that it
   involves a great error. It asserts that the sinner is able to do what
   in fact he cannot do.

   3. It is a further objection to this mode of stating the doctrine that
   it tends to embarrass or to deceive. It must embarrass the people to be
   told that they can and cannot repent and believe. One or the other of
   the two propositions, in the ordinary and proper sense of the terms,
   must be false. And and esoteric or metaphysical sense in which the
   theologian may attempt to reconcile them, the people will neither
   appreciate nor respect. It is a much more serious objection that it
   tends to deceive men to tell them that they can change their own
   hearts, can repent, and can believe. This is not true, and every man's
   consciousness tells him that it is untrue. It is of no avail for the
   preacher to say that all he means by ability is that men have all the
   faculties of rational beings, and that those are the only faculties to
   be exercised in turning to God or in doing his will. We might as
   reasonably tell an uneducated man that he can understand and appreciate
   the Iliad, because he has all the faculties which the scholar
   possesses. Still less does it avail to say that the only difficulty is
   in the will. And therefore when we say that men can love God, we mean
   that they can love Him if they will. If the word will, be here taken in
   its ordinary sense for the power of self-determination, the proposition
   that a man can love God if he will, is not true; for it is notorious
   that the affections are not under the power of the will. If the word be
   taken in a wide sense as including the affections, the proposition is a
   truism. It amounts to saying, that we can love God if we do love Him.

   4. The distinction between natural and moral ability, as commonly made,
   is unscriptural. It has already been admitted that there is an obvious
   and very important distinction between an inability arising out of the
   limitations of our being as creatures, and an inability arising out of
   the apostate state of our nature since the Fall of Adam. But this is
   not what is commonly meant by those who assert the natural ability of
   men to do all that God requires of them. They mean and expressly assert
   that man, as his nature now is, is perfectly able to change his own
   heart, to repent and lead a holy life; that the only difficulty in the
   way of his so doing is the want of inclination, controllable by his own
   power. It is this representation which is unscriptural. The Scriptures
   never thus address fallen men and assure them of their ability to
   deliver themselves from the power of sin.

   5. The whole tendency and effect of this mode of statement are
   injurious and dangerous. If a sinner must be convinced of his guilt
   before he can trust in the righteousness of Christ for his
   justification, he must be convinced of his helplessness before he can
   look to God for deliverance. Those who are made to believe that they
   can save themselves, are, in the divine administration, commonly left
   to their own resources.

   In opposition therefore to the Pelagian doctrine of the sinner's
   plenary ability, to the Semi-Pelagian or Arminian doctrine of what is
   called "a gracious ability," that is, an ability granted to all who
   hear the gospel by the common and sufficient grace of the Holy Spirit,
   and to the doctrine that the only inability of the sinner is his
   disinclination to good, Augustinians have ever taught that this
   inability is absolute and entire. It is natural as well as moral. It is
   as complete, although different in kind, as the inability of the blind
   to see, of the deaf to hear, or of the dead to restore themselves to
   life.

   Proof of the Doctrine.

   1. The first and most obvious argument in support of the Augustinian or
   Orthodox argument on this subject is the negative one. That is, the
   fact that the Scriptures nowhere attribute to fallen men ability to
   change their own hearts or to turn themselves unto God. As their
   salvation depends on their regeneration, if that work was within the
   compass of their own powers, it is incredible that the Bible should
   never rest the obligation of effecting it upon the sinner's ability. If
   he had the power to regenerate himself, we should expect to find the
   Scriptures affirming his possession of this ability, and calling upon
   him to exercise it. It may indeed be said that the very command to
   repent and believe implies the possession of everything that is
   requisite to obedience to the command. It does imply that those to whom
   it is addressed are rational creatures, capable of moral obligation,
   and that they are free moral agents. It implies nothing more. The
   command is nothing more than the authoritative declaration of what is
   obligatory upon those to whom it is addressed. We are required to be
   perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect. The obligation is
   imperative and constant. Yet no sane man can assert his own ability to
   make himself thus perfect. Notwithstanding therefore the repeated
   commands given in the Bible to sinners to love God with all the heart,
   to repent and believe the gospel, and live without sin, it remains true
   that the Scriptures nowhere assert or recognize the ability of fallen
   man to fulfil these requisitions of duty.

   Express Declarations of the Scriptures.

   2. Besides this negative testimony of the Scriptures, we have the
   repeated and explicit declarations of the Word of God on this subject.
   Our Lord compares the relation between himself and his people to that
   which exists between the vine and its branches. The point of analogy is
   the absolute dependence common to both relations. "As the branch cannot
   bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye,
   except ye abide in me Without me ye can do nothing." (John xv. 4, 5.)
   We are here taught that Christ is the only source of spiritual life;
   that those out of Him are destitute of that life and of all ability to
   produce its appropriate fruits; and even with regard to those who are
   in Him, this ability is not of themselves, it is derived entirely from
   Him. In like manner the Apostle asserts his insufficiency (or
   inability) to do anything of himself. Our "sufficiency," he says, "is
   of God." (2 Cor. iii. 5.) Christ tells the Jews (John vi. 44), "No man
   can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him." This is
   not weakened or explained away by his saying in another place, "Ye will
   not come to me that ye might have life." The penitent and believing
   soul comes to Christ willingly. He wills to come. But this does not
   imply that he can of himself produce that willingness. The sinner wills
   not to come; but that does not prove that coming is in the power of his
   will. He cannot have the will to come to the saving of his soul unless
   he has a true sense of sin, and a proper apprehension of the person,
   the character and the work of Christ, and right affections towards Him.
   How is he to get these? Are all these complex states of mind, this
   knowledge, these apprehensions, and these affections subject to the
   imperative power of the will? In Rom. viii. 7, the Apostle says, "The
   carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of
   God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot
   please God." Those who are "in the flesh, are distinguished from those
   who are "in the Spirit." The former are the unrenewed, men who are in a
   state of nature, and of them it is affirmed that they cannot please
   God. Faith is declared to be the gift of God, and yet without faith, we
   are told it is impossible that we should please God. (Heb. xi. 6.) In 1
   Cor. ii. 14, it is said, "The natural man receiveth not the things of
   the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he
   know them, because they are spiritually discerned." The natural man is
   distinguished from the spiritual man. The latter is one in whom the
   Holy Spirit is the principle of life and activity, or, who is under the
   control of the Spirit, the former is one who is under the control of
   his own fallen nature, in whom there is no principle of life and action
   but what belongs to him as a fallen creature. Of such a man the Apostle
   asserts, first, that he does not receive the things of the Spirit, that
   is, the truths which the Spirit has revealed; secondly, that they are
   foolishness to him; thirdly, that he cannot know them; and fourthly,
   that the reason of this inability is the want of spiritual discernment,
   that is, of that apprehension of the nature and truth of divine things
   which is due to the inward teaching or illumination of the Holy Ghost.
   This passage therefore not only asserts the fact of the sinner's
   inability, but teaches the ground or source of it. It is no mere
   aversion or disinclination, but the want of true knowledge. No man can
   see the beauty of a work of art without æsthetic discernment; and no
   man, according to the Apostle, can see the truth and beauty of
   spiritual things without spiritual discernment. Such is the constant
   representation of Scripture. Men are everywhere spoken of and regarded
   not only as guilty and polluted, but also as helpless.

   Involved in the Doctrine of Original Sin.

   3. The doctrine of the sinner's inability is involved in the Scriptural
   doctrine of original sin. By the apostasy of man from God he not only
   lost the divine image and favour, but sunk into a state of spiritual
   death. The Bible and reason alike teach that God is the life of the
   soul; his favour, and communion with Hun, are essential not only to
   happiness but also to holiness. Those who are under his wrath and curse
   and are banished from his presence, are in outer darkness. They have no
   true knowledge, no desire after fellowship with a Being who to them is
   a consuming fire. To the Apostle it appears as the greatest absurdity
   and impossibility that a soul out of favour with God should be holy.
   This is the fundamental idea of his doctrine of sanctification. Those
   who are under the law are under the curse, and those who are under the
   curse are absolutely ruined. It is essential, therefore, to holiness
   that we should be delivered from the law and restored to the favour of
   God before any exercise of love or any act of true obedience can he
   performed or experienced on our part. We are free from sin only because
   we are not under the law, put under grace. The whole of the sixth and
   seventh chapters of the Epistle to the Romans is devoted to the
   development of this principle. To the Apostle the doctrine that the
   sinner has ability of himself to return to God, to restore to his soul
   the image of God, and live a holy life, must have appeared as thorough
   a rejection of his theory of salvation as the doctrine that we are
   justified by works. His whole system is founded on the two principles
   that, being guilty, we are condemned, and can be justified only on the
   ground of the righteousness of Christ; and, being spiritually dead, no
   objective presentation of the truth, no authoritative declarations of
   the law, no effort of our own can originate spiritual life, or call
   forth any spiritual exercise. Being justified freely and restored to
   the divine favour, we are then, and only then, able to bring forth
   fruit unto God. "Ye are become dead to the law by the body of Christ:
   that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from
   the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were
   in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in
   our members, to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered
   from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should
   serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter."
   (Rom. vii. 4-6.) This view of the matter necessarily implies that the
   natural state of fallen men is one of entire helplessness and
   inability. They are "utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to
   all good." The Bible, therefore, as we have already seen, uniformly
   represents men in their natural state since the fall as blind, deaf,
   and spiritually dead; from which state they can no more deliver
   themselves than one born blind can open his own eyes, or one corrupting
   in the grave can restore himself to life.

   The Necessity of the Spirit's influence.

   4. The next argument on this subject is derived from what the
   Scriptures teach of the necessity and nature of the Spirit's influence
   in regeneration and sanctification. If any man will take a Greek
   Concordance of the New Testament, and see how often the words Pneuma
   and To Pneuma to hagion are used by the sacred writers, he will learn
   how prominent a part the Holy Spirit takes in saving men, and how
   hopeless is the case of those who are left to themselves. What the
   Scriptures clearly teach as to this point is, (1.) That the Holy Spirit
   is the source of spiritual life and all its exercises; that without his
   supernatural influence we can no more perform holy acts than a dead
   branch, or a branch separated from the vine can produce fruit. (2.)
   That in the first instance (that is, in regeneration) the soul is the
   subject and not the agent of the change produced. The Spirit gives
   life, and then excites and guides all its operations; just as in the
   natural world God gives sight to the blind, and then light by which to
   see, and objects to be seen, and guides and sustains all the exercises
   of the power of vision which He has bestowed. (3.) That the nature of
   the influence by which regeneration, which must precede all holy
   exercises, is produced, precludes the possibility of preparation or
   coöperation on the part of the sinner. Some effects are produced by
   natural causes, others by the simple volition or immediate efficiency
   of God. To this latter class belong creation, miracles, and
   regeneration. (4.) Hence the effect produced is called a new creature,
   a resurrection, a new birth. These representations are designed to
   teach the utter impotence and entire dependence of the sinner.
   Salvation is not of him that wills nor of him who runs, but of God who
   showeth mercy, and who works in us to will and to do according to his
   own good pleasure. These are all points to be more fully discussed
   hereafter. It is enough in this argument to say that the doctrines of
   the Bible concerning the absolute necessity of grace, or the
   supernatural influence of the Spirit, and of the nature and effects of
   that influence, are entirely inconsistent with the doctrine that the
   sinner is able of himself to perform any holy act.

   The Argument from Experience.

   5. This is a practical question. What a man is able to do is best
   determined not by à priori reasoning, or by logical deductions from the
   nature of his faculties, but by putting his ability to the test. The
   thing to be done is to turn from sin to holiness; to love God perfectly
   and our neighbour as ourselves; to perform every duty without defect or
   omission, and keep ourselves from all sin of thought, word, or deed, of
   heart or life. Can any man do this? Does any man need argument to
   convince him that he cannot do it? He knows two things as clearly and
   as surely as he knows his own existence: first, that he is bound to be
   morally perfect, to keep all God's commands, to have all right feelings
   in constant exercise as the occasion calls for them, and to avoid all
   sin in feeling as well as in act; and, secondly, that he can no more do
   this than he can raise the dead. The metaphysician may endeavour to
   prove to the people that there is no external world, that matter is
   thought; and the metaphysician may believe it, but the people, whose
   faith is determined by the instincts and divinely constituted laws of
   their nature, will retain their own intuitive convictions. In like
   manner the metaphysical theologian may tell sinners that they can
   regenerate themselves, can repent and believe, and love God perfectly,
   and the theologian may, by a figure of speech, be said to believe it
   but the poor sinners know that it is not true. They have tried a
   thousand times, and would give a thousand worlds could they accomplish
   the work, and make themselves saints and heirs of glory by a volition,
   or by the exercise of their own powers, whether transient or
   protracted.

   It is universally admitted, because a universal fact of consciousness,
   that the feelings and affections are not under the control of the will.
   No man can love what is hateful to him, or hate what he delights in, by
   any exercise of his self-determining power. Hence the philosophers,
   with Kant, pronounce the command to love, an absurdity, as sceptics
   declare the command to believe, absurd. But the foolishness of men is
   the wisdom of God. It is right that we should be required to love God
   and believe his Word, whether the exercise of love and faith be under
   the control of our will or not. The only way by which this argument
   from the common consciousness of men can be evaded, is by denying that
   feeling has any moral character; or by assuming that the demands of the
   law are accommodated to the ability of the agent. If he cannot love
   holiness, he is not bound to love it. If he cannot believe all the
   gospel, he is required to believe only what he can believe, what he can
   see to be true in the light of his own reason. Both these assumptions,
   however, are contrary to the intuitive convictions of all men, and to
   the express declarations of the Word of God. All men know that moral
   character attaches to feelings as well as to purposes or volitions;
   that benevolence as a feeling is right and malice as a feeling is
   wrong. They know with equal certainty that the demands of right are
   immutable, that the law of God cannot lower itself to the measure of
   the power of fallen creatures. It demands of them nothing that exceeds
   the limitations of their nature as creatures; but it does require the
   full and constant, and therefore perfect, exercise of those powers in
   the service of God and in accordance with his will. And this is
   precisely what every fallen rational human being is fully persuaded he
   cannot do. The conviction of inability, therefore, is as universal and
   as indestructible as the belief of existence, and all the sophisms of
   metaphysical theologians are as impotent as the subtleties of the
   idealist or pantheist. Any man or set of men, any system of philosophy
   or of theology which attempts to stem the great stream of human
   consciousness is certain to be swept down into the abyss of oblivion or
   destruction.

   Conviction of Sin.

   There is another aspect of this argument which deserves to be
   considered. What is conviction of sin? What are the experiences of
   those whom the Spirit of God brings under that conviction? The answer
   to these questions may be drawn from the Bible, as for example time
   seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, from the records of the
   inward life of the people of God in all ages, and from every believer's
   own religious experience. From all these sources it may be proved that
   every soul truly convinced of sin is brought to feel and acknowledge,
   (1.) That he is guilty in the sight of God, and justly exposed to the
   sentence of his violated law. (2.) That he is utterly polluted and
   defiled by sin; that his thoughts, feelings, and acts are not what
   conscience or the divine law can approve; and that it is not separate,
   transient acts only by which he is thus polluted, but also that his
   heart is not right, that sin exists in him as a power or a law working
   in him all manner of evil. And, (3.) That he can make no atonement for
   his guilt, and that he cannot free himself from the power of sin; so
   that he is forced to cry out, O wretched man that I am, who will
   deliver me from the body of this death! This sense of utter
   helplessness, of absolute inability, is as much and as universally an
   element of genuine conviction as a sense of guilt or the consciousness
   of defilement. It is a great mercy that the theology of the heart is
   often better than the theology of the head.

   6. The testimony of every man's consciousness is confirmed by the
   common consciousness of the Church and by the whole history of our
   race. Appeal may be made with all confidence to the prayers, hymns, and
   other devotional writings of the people of God for proof that no
   conviction is more deeply impressed on the hearts of all true
   Christians than that of their utter helplessness and entire dependence
   upon the grace of God. They deplore their inability to love their
   Redeemer, to keep themselves from sin, to live a holy life in any
   degree adequate to their own convictions of their obligations. Under
   this inability they humble themselves, they never plead it as an excuse
   or palliation; they recognize it as the fruit and evidence of the
   corruption of their nature derived as a sad inheritance from their
   first parents. They refer with one voice, whatever there is of good in
   them, not to their own ability, but to the Holy Spirit. Everyone adopts
   as expressing the inmost conviction of his heart, the language of the
   Apostle, "Not I, but the grace of God which was with me." As this is
   the testimony of the Church so also it is the testimony of all history.
   The world furnishes no example of a self-regenerated man. No such man
   exists or ever has existed; and no man ever believed himself to be
   regenerated by his own power. If what men can do is to be determined by
   what men have done, it may safely be assumed that no man can change his
   own heart, or bring himself to repentance toward God and faith in the
   Lord Jesus Christ. An ability which has never in the thousands of
   millions of our race accomplished the desired end, even if it existed,
   would not be worth contending for. There is scarcely a single doctrine
   of the Scriptures either more clearly taught or more abundantly
   confirmed by the common consciousness of men, whether saints or
   sinners, than the doctrine that fallen man is destitute of all ability
   to convert himself or to perform any holy act until renewed by the
   almighty power of the Spirit of God.

   Objections.

   1. The most obvious and plausible objection to this doctrine is the old
   one so often considered already, namely, that it is inconsistent with
   moral obligation. A man, it is said, cannot be justly required to do
   any thing for which he has not the requisite ability. The fallacy of
   this objection lies in the application of this principle. It is
   self-evidently true in one sphere, but utterly untrue in another. It is
   true that the blind cannot justly be required to see, or the deaf to
   hear. A child cannot be required to understand the calculus, or an
   uneducated man to read the classics. These things belong to the sphere
   of nature. The inability which thus limits obligation arises out of the
   limitations which God has imposed on our nature. The principle in
   question does not apply in the sphere cf morals and religion, when the
   inability arises not out of the limitation, but out of the moral
   corruption of our nature. Even in the sphere of religion there is a
   bound set to obligation by the capacity of the agent. An infant cannot
   be expected or required to have the measure of holy affections which
   fills the souls of the just made perfect. It is only when inability
   arises from sin and is removed by the removal of sin, that it is
   consistent with continued obligation. And as it has been shown from
   Scripture that the inability of the sinner to repent and believe, to
   love God and to lead a holy life, does not arise from the limitation of
   his nature as a creature (as is the case with idiots or brutes); nor
   from the want of the requisite faculties or capacity, but simply from
   the corruption of our nature, it follows that it does not exonerate him
   from the obligation to be and to do all that God requires. This, as
   shown above, is the doctrine of the Bible and is confirmed by the
   universal consciousness of men, and especially by the experience of all
   the people of God. They with one voice deplore their helplessness and
   their perfect inability to live without sin, and yet acknowledge their
   obligation to be perfectly holy.

   We are responsible for external acts, because they depend on our
   volitions. We are responsible for our volitions because they depend on
   our principles and feelings; and we are responsible for our feelings
   and for those states of mind which constitute character, because
   (within the sphere of morals and religion) they are right or wrong in
   their own nature. The fact that the affections and permanent and even
   immanent states of the mind are beyond the power of the will does not
   (as has been repeatedly shown in these pages), remove them out of the
   sphere of moral obligation. As this is attested by Scripture and by the
   general judgment of men, the assumed axiom that ability limits
   obligation in the sphere of morals cannot be admitted.

   Moral obligation being founded upon the possession of the attributes of
   a moral agent, reason, conscience, and will, it remains unimpaired so
   long as these attributes remain. If reason be lost all responsibility
   for character or conduct ceases. If the consciousness of the difference
   between right and wrong, the capacity to perceive moral distinctions
   does not exist in a creature or does not belong to its nature, that
   creature is not the subject of moral obligation, and in like manner if
   he is not an agent, is not invested with the faculty of spontaneous
   activity as a personal being, he ceases, so far as his conscious states
   are concerned, to be responsible for what he is or does. Since the
   Scriptural and Augustinian doctrine admits that man since the fall
   retains his reason, conscience, and will, it leaves the grounds of
   responsibility for character and conduct unimpaired.

   It does not weaken the Motives to Exertion.

   2. Another popular objection to the Scriptural doctrine on this subject
   is, that it destroys all rational grounds on which rests the use of the
   means of grace. If we cannot accomplish a given end, why should we use
   the means for its accomplishment? So the farmer might say, If I cannot
   secure a harvest, why should I cultivate my fields? In every department
   of human activity the result depends on the coöperation of causes over
   which man has no control. He is expected to use the means adapted to
   the desired end and trust for the coöperation of other agencies without
   which his own efforts are of no avail. The Scriptural grounds on which
   we are bound to use the means of grace are, (1.) The command of God.
   This of itself is enough. If there were no apparent adaptation of the
   means to the end, and no connection which we could discover between
   them, the command of God would be a sufficient reason and motive for
   their diligent use. There was no natural adaptation in the waters of
   the Jordan to heal the leprosy, or in those of the pool of Siloam to
   restore sight to the blind. It had, however, been fatal folly on the
   part of Naaman to refuse on that account to obey the command to bathe
   himself seven times; and in the blind man to refuse to wash in the pool
   as Jesus directed. (2.) If the command of God is enough even when there
   is no apparent connection between the means and the end, much more is
   it enough when the means have a natural adaptation to the end. We can
   see such adaptation in the department of nature, and it is no less
   apparent in that of grace. There is an intimate connection between
   truth and holiness, as between sowing the grain and reaping the
   harvest. Man sows but God gives the increase in the one case as well as
   in the other. (3.) There is not only this natural adaptation of the
   means of grace to the end to be accomplished, but in all ordinary
   cases, the end is not attained otherwise than through the use of those
   means. Men are not saved without the truth. Those who do not seek fail
   to find. Those who refuse to ask do not receive. This is as much the
   ordinary course of the divine administration in the kingdom of grace,
   as in the kingdom of nature. (4.) There is not only this visible
   connection between the means of grace and the salvation of the soul, as
   a fact of experience, but the express promise of God that those who
   seek shall find, that those who ask shall receive, and that to those
   who knock it shall be opened. More than this cannot be rationally
   demanded. It is more than is given to the men of the world to stimulate
   them in their exertions to secure wealth or knowledge. The doctrine of
   inability, therefore, does not impair the force of any of the motives
   which should determine sinners to use all diligence in seeking their
   own salvation in the way which God has appointed.

   The Doctrine does not encourage Delay.

   3. Still another objection is everywhere urged against this doctrine.
   It is said that it encourages delay. If a man believes that he cannot
   change his heart, cannot repent and believe the gospel, he will say, "I
   must wait God's time. As He gives men a new heart, as faith and
   repentance are his gifts I must wait until He is pleased to bestow
   those gifts on me." No doubt Satan does tempt men thus to argue and
   thus to act, as he tempts them in other ways to egregious folly. The
   natural tendency of the doctrine in question, however, is directly the
   reverse. When a man is convinced that the attainment of a desirable end
   is beyond the compass of his own powers, he instinctively seeks help
   out of himself. If ill, if he knows he cannot cure himself, he sends
   for a physician. If persuaded that the disease is entirely under his
   own control, and especially if any metaphysician could persuade him
   that all illness is an idea, which can be banished by a volition, then
   it would be folly in him to seek aid from abroad. The blind, the deaf,
   the leprous, and the maimed who were on earth when Christ was present
   in the flesh, knew that they could not heal themselves, and therefore
   they went to Him for help. No more soul-destroying doctrine could well
   be devised than the doctrine that sinners can regenerate themselves,
   and repent and believe just when they please. Those who really embrace
   such a doctrine would never apply to the only source whence these
   blessings can in fact be obtained. They would be led to defer to the
   last moment of life a work which was entirely in their own hands and
   which could be accomplished in a moment. A miser on his death-bed may
   by a volition give away all his wealth. If a sinner could as easily
   change his own heart, he would be apt to cleave to the world as the
   miser to his wealth, till the last moment. All truth tends to
   godliness; all error to sin and death. As it is a truth both of
   Scripture and of experience that the unrenewed man can do nothing of
   himself to secure his salvation, it is essential that he should be
   brought to a practical conviction of that truth. When thus convinced,
   and not before, he seeks help from the only source whence it can be
   obtained.

CHAPTER IX.

  FREE AGENCY.

   § 3. Certainty Consistent with Liberty.

   In all discussions concerning sin and grace, the question concerning
   the nature and necessary conditions of free agency is of necessity
   involved. This is one of the points in which theology and psychology
   come into immediate contact. There is a theory of free agency with
   which the doctrines of original sin and of efficacious grace are
   utterly irreconcilable, and there is another theory with which those
   doctrines are perfectly consistent. In all ages of the Church,
   therefore, those who have adopted the former of these theories, reject
   those doctrines; and, on the other hand, those who are constrained to
   believe those doctrines, are no less constrained to adopt the other and
   congenial theory of free agency. Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians, and
   Remonstrants are not more notoriously at variance with Augustinians,
   Lutherans, and Calvinists, on the doctrines of sin and grace, than they
   are on the metaphysical and moral question of human liberty. In every
   system of theology, therefore, there is a chapter De libero arbitrio.
   This is a question which every theologian finds in his path, and which
   he must dispose of; and on the manner in which it is determined depends
   his theology, and of course his religion, so far as his theology is to
   him a truth and reality.

   It may seem preposterous to attempt, in the compass of a few pages, the
   discussion of a question on which so many volumes have been written.
   There is, however, this important difference between all subjects which
   relate to the soul, or the world within, and those which relate to the
   external world: with regard to the former, all the materials of
   knowledge being facts of consciousness, are already in our possession;
   whereas, in regard to the latter, the facts have first to be collected.
   In questions, therefore, which relate to the mind, a mere statement of
   the case is often all that is required, and all that can be given. If
   that statement be correct, the facts of consciousness spontaneously
   arrange themselves in order around it; if it be incorrect, they
   obstinately refuse to be thus marshalled. If this be so, why is it that
   men differ so much about these questions? To this it may be answered,
   --

   1. That they do not differ so much as they appear to. When the mind is
   left undisturbed, and allowed to act according to its own laws, men, in
   the great majority of cases, think alike on all the great questions
   about which philosophers are divided. It is only when they stir up the
   placid lake, and attempt to sound its depths, to analyze its waters, to
   determine the laws of its currents, and to ascertain its contents, that
   they see and think so differently. However men may differ in their
   speculative opinions as to the ultimate nature of matter, they all
   practically feel and act in the same way in everything which concerns
   its application and use. And however they may differ as to the question
   of liberty or necessity, they agree in regarding themselves and others
   as responsible agents.

   2. On no subject is the ambiguity of language a more serious
   impediment, in the way of conscious agreement, than in reference to
   this whole department, and especially in regard to the question of free
   agency. The same statement often appears true to one mind and false to
   another, because it is understood differently. This ambiguity arises
   partly from the inherent imperfection of human language. Words have,
   and must have more than one use; and although we may define our terms,
   and state in which its several senses we use a given word, yet the
   exigencies of language, or inattention, almost unavoidably lead to its
   being employed in some other of its legitimate meanings. Besides, the
   states of mind which these terms are employed to designate, are
   themselves so complex that no words can accurately represent them. We
   have terms to express the operations of the intellect, others to
   designate the feelings, and others again for acts of the will; but
   thousands of our acts include the exercise of the intellect, the
   sensibility, and the will, and it is absolutely impossible to find
   words for all these complex and varying states of mind. It is not
   wonderful, therefore, that men should misunderstand each other, fail in
   their most strenuous efforts to express what they mean so that others
   shall attach precisely the same sense to the words which they use.

   3. There is another reason for the diversity of opinion which has ever
   prevailed on all subjects connected with free agency. Although the
   facts which should determine the questions discussed are facts of
   consciousness common to all men, yet they are so numerous and of such
   different kinds, that it is hard to allow each its place and
   importance. From habit, or mental training, or from the moral state of
   mind, some men allow too much weight to one class of these facts, and
   too little to another. Some are governed by their understanding, others
   by their moral feelings. In some the moral sensibilities are much more
   lively and informing than in others. Some adopt certain principles as
   axioms to which they force all their judgments to conform. It is vain
   to hope, therefore, that we shall ever find all men of one mind, on
   even the plainest and most important questions relating to the
   constitution and laws of their own nature. There is but one sure guide,
   and but one path to either truth or unity, the Spirit and word of God;
   and happy are those who submit to be led by that guide, and to walk in
   that path.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Different Theories of the Will.

   All the different theories of the will may be included under the three
   classes of Necessity, Contingency, and Certainty.

   Necessity.

   To the first of these classes belong: --

   1. The doctrine of Fatalism, which teaches that all events are
   determined by a blind necessity. This necessity does not arise from the
   will of an intelligent Being governing all his creatures and all their
   acts according to their nature, and for purposes of wisdom and
   goodness; but from a law of sequence to which God (or rather the gods)
   as well as men is subject. It precludes the idea of foresight or plan,
   or of the voluntary selection of an end, and the adoption of means for
   its accomplishment. Things are as they are, and must be as they are,
   and are to be, without any rational cause. This theory ignores any
   distinction between physical laws and free agency. The acts of men and
   the operations of nature are determined by a necessity of the same
   kind. Events are like a mighty stream borne onward by a resistless
   force, -- a force outside of themselves, which cannot be controlled or
   modified. All we have to do is to acquiesce in being thus carried on.
   Whether we acquiesce or not makes no difference. A man falling from a
   precipice cannot by an act of will counteract the force of gravity;
   neither can he in any way control or modify the action of fate. His
   outward circumstances and inward acts are all equally determined by an
   inexorable law or influence residing out of himself. This at least is
   one form of fatalism. This view of the doctrine of necessity may rest
   on the assumption that the universe has the ground of its existence in
   itself, and is governed in all its operations by fixed laws, which
   determine the sequence of all events in the mineral, vegetable, and
   animal kingdom, by a like necessity. Or it may admit that the world
   owed its existence to an intelligent first cause, but assume that its
   author never designed to create free agents, but determined to set in
   operation certain causes which should work out given results.. However
   fatalists may differ as to the cause of the necessity which governs all
   events, they agree as to its nature. It may arise from the influence of
   the stars, as the ancient Chaldeans held; or from the operation of
   second causes, or from the original constitutions of things; or from
   the decree of God. It avowedly precludes all liberty of action, and
   reduces the acts of men to the same category with those of irrational
   animals. Properly speaking, however, fatalism refers this necessity to
   fate, an unintelligent cause.

   2. A second form of the doctrine of necessity, is the mechanical
   theory. This denies that man is the efficient cause of his own acts. It
   represents him as passive, or as endued with no higher form of activity
   than spontaneity. It avowedly precludes the idea of responsibility. It
   assumes that the inward state of man, and consequently his acts, are
   determined by his outward circumstances. This doctrine as connected
   with the materialism of Hobbes, Hartley, Priestley, Belsham, and
   especially as fully developed by the French Encyclopædists, supposes
   that from the constitution of our nature, some things give us pain,
   others pleasure: some excite desire, and others aversion; and that this
   susceptibility of being acted upon is all the activity which belongs to
   man, who is as purely a piece of living mechanism as the irrational
   animals. A certain external object produces a corresponding impression
   on the nerves, that is transmitted to the brain, and an answering
   impulse is sent back to the muscles; or the effect is spent on the
   brain itself in the form of thought or feeling thereby excited or
   evolved. The general features of this theory are the same so far as its
   advocates ignore any distinction between physical and moral necessity,
   and reject the doctrine of free agency and responsibility, however much
   they may differ on other points.

   3. A third form of necessity includes all those theories which
   supersede the efficiency of second causes, by referring all events to
   the immediate agency of the first cause. This of course is done by
   Pantheism in all its forms, whether it merely makes God the soul of the
   world, and refers all the operations of nature and all the actions of
   men to his immediate agency; or whether it regards the world itself as
   God; or whether it makes God the only substance of which nature and
   mind are the phenomena. According to all these views, God is the only
   agent; all activity is but different modes in which the activity of God
   manifests itself.

   The theory of occasional causes leads to the same result. According to
   this doctrine, all efficiency is in God. Second causes are only the
   occasions on which that efficiency is exerted. Although this system
   allows a real existence to matter and mind, and admits that they are
   endowed with certain qualities and attributes, yet these are nothing
   more than susceptibilities, or receptivities for the manifestation of
   the divine efficiency. They furnish the occasions for the exercise of
   the all-pervading power of God. Matter and mind are alike passive: all
   the changes in the one, and all the appearance of activity in the
   other, are due to God's immediate operation.

   Under the same head belongs the doctrine that the agency of God in the
   preservation of the world is a continuous creation. This mode of
   representation is indeed often adopted as a figure of speech by
   orthodox theologians; but if taken literally it implies the absolute
   inefficiency of all second causes. If God creates the outward world at
   every successive moment, He must be the immediate author of all its
   changes. There is no connection between what precedes and what follows,
   between antecedent and consequent, cause and effect, but succession in
   time; and when applied to the inward world, or the soul, the same
   consequence of necessity follows. The soul, at any given moment, exists
   only in a certain state; if in that state it is created, then the
   creative energy is the immediate cause of all its feelings, cognitions,
   and acts. The soul is not an agent; it is only something which God
   creates in a given form. All continuity of being, all identity, and all
   efficiency are lost; and the universe of matter and mind becomes
   nothing more than the continued pulsation of the life of God.

   Nearly allied with the doctrine of a continued creation is the
   "exercise scheme." According to this theory the soul is a series of
   exercises created by God. There is no such thing as the soul, no self,
   but only certain perceptions which succeed each other with amazing
   rapidity. Hume denies any real cause. All we know is that these
   perceptions exist, and exist in succession. Emmons says, God creates
   them. It is of course in vain to speak of the liberty of man in
   producing the creative acts of God. If He creates our volitions in view
   of motives, they are his acts and not ours. The difference between this
   system and Pantheism is little more than nominal.

   Contingency.

   Directly opposed to all these schemes of necessity, is the doctrine of
   contingency, which has been held under different names and variously
   modified. Sometimes it is called the liberty of indifference; by which
   is meant, that the will, at the moment of decision, is self-poised
   among conflicting motives, and decides one way or the other, not
   because of the greater influence of one motive over others, but because
   it is indifferent or undetermined, able to act in accordance with the
   weaker against the stronger motive, or even without any motive at all.
   Sometimes this doctrine is expressed by the phrase, self-determining
   power of the will. By this it is intended to deny that the will is
   determined by motives, and to affirm that the reason of its decisions
   is to be sought in itself. It is a cause and not an effect, and
   therefore requires nothing out of itself to account for its acts.
   Sometimes this doctrine is called the power of contrary choice; that
   is, that in every volition there is and must be power to the contrary.
   Even supposing all antecedents external and internal to have been
   precisely the same, the decision might have been the reverse of what it
   actually was. Contingence is therefore necessary to liberty. This is
   the essential idea of this theory in all its forms. A contingent event
   is one which may or may not happen. Contingence, therefore, is opposed
   not merely to necessity, but also to certainty. If a man may act in
   opposition to all motives, external and internal, and in despite of all
   influence which can be exerted on him, short of destroying his liberty,
   then it must forever remain uncertain how he will act. The advocates of
   this theory of liberty, therefore, maintain, that the will is
   independent of reason, of feeling, and of God. There is no middle
   ground, they say, between contingency (i.e., uncertainty), and
   fatalism; between the independence of the will and of the agent, and
   the denial of all free agency.

   Although the advocates of the liberty of contingency generally direct
   their arguments against the doctrine of necessity, yet it is apparent
   that they regard certainty no less than necessity to be inconsistent
   with liberty. This is plain, (1.) From the designations which they give
   their theory, as liberty of indifference, self-determining power of the
   will, power to the contrary. (2.) From their formal definition of
   liberty, as the power to decide for or against, or without motives; or
   it is power of "willing what we will." "If," says Reid, "in every
   voluntary action, the determination of his will be the necessary
   consequence of something involuntary in the state of his mind, or of
   something in the external circumstances of the agent, he is not free."
   [258] Cousin says, "The will is mine, and I dispose absolutely of it
   within the limits of the spiritual world." [259] The Scotists of the
   Middle Ages, Molina and the Jesuits as a class, and all the opponents
   of Augustinianism, define liberty as consisting in indifference, or in
   the independence of the will of the preceding state of the mind, and
   make it to exclude certainty no less than necessity. (3.) From the
   arguments by which they endeavour to sustain their theory, which are
   directed as often against certainty as against necessity. (4.) From
   their answers to opposing arguments, and especially to that derived
   from the foreknowledge of God. As the foreknowledge of an act supposes
   the certainty of its occurrence, if free acts are known, they must be
   certain. To this the advocates of the theory in question make such
   answers as show that certainty is what they are contending against.
   They say that we have no right to argue on this subject from the
   attributes of God; it is a simple matter of consciousness; or they say,
   that God's foreknowledge may be limited, just as his power is limited
   by impossibilities. If it be impossible to foreknow free acts, they are
   not the objects of knowledge, and, therefore, not to foreknow them is
   not a limitation of the divine knowledge. From these and other
   considerations, it is plain that the theory of contingency in all its
   forms, is opposed to the doctrine of certainty no less than to that of
   necessity, in the proper sense of that term. By this, however, it is
   not meant that the advocates of contingency are consistent as to this
   point. Arguing against necessity, they frequently do not discriminate
   between physical and moral necessity. They class Hobbes, Hartley,
   Priestley, Belsham, Collins, Edwards, the French Encyclopædists, and
   all who use the word necessity, under the same category; and yet they
   cannot avoid admitting, that in many cases free acts may be certain.
   They very often say that particular arguments prove certainty but not
   necessity; when certainty is precisely the thing contended for, and
   which they themselves deny. This is one of the unavoidable
   inconsistencies of error. No one, however, notwithstanding these
   admissions, will dispute that the theory of contingence, whether called
   indifference, self-determining power of the will, power of contrary
   choice, or by any other name, is in fact, and is intended to be,
   antagonistic to that of certainty.

   Certainty.

   The third general theory on this subject is separated by an equal
   distance from the doctrine of necessity on the one hand, and from that
   of contingency on the other. It teaches that a man is free not only
   when his outward acts are determined by his will, but when his
   volitions are truly and properly his own, determined by nothing out of
   himself but proceeding from his own views, feelings, and immanent
   dispositions, so that they are the real, intelligent, and conscious
   expression of his character, or of what is in his mind.

   This theory is often called the theory of moral or philosophical, as
   distinguished from physical, necessity. This is a most unfortunate and
   unsuitable designation. (1.) Because liberty and necessity are directly
   opposed. It is a contradiction to say that an act is free and yet
   necessary; that man is a free agent, and yet that all his acts are
   determined by a law of necessity. As all the advocates of the theory in
   question profess to believe in the freedom of the human will, or that
   man is a free agent, it is certainly to be regretted that they should
   use language which in its ordinary and proper sense teaches directly
   the reverse. (2.) Certainty and necessity are not the same, and
   therefore they should not be expressed by the same word. The necessity
   with which a stone falls to the ground, and the certainty with which a
   perfectly holy being confirmed in a state of grace will act holily, are
   as different as day and night. Applying the same term to express things
   essentially distinct tends to confound the things themselves. A man may
   be forced to do a thing against his will, but to say he can be forced
   to will against his will is a contradiction. A necessary volition is no
   volition, anymore than white is black. Because in popular language we
   often speak of a thing as necessary when it is absolutely certain, and
   although the Scriptures, written in the language of ordinary life,
   often do the same thing, is no reason why in philosophical discussions
   the word should be so used as unavoidably to mislead. (3.) Using the
   word necessity to express the idea of certainty brings the truth into
   reproach. It clothes it in the garb of error. It makes Edwards use the
   language of Hobbes. It puts Luther into the category with Spinoza; all
   Augustinians into the same class with the French materialists. They all
   use the same language, though their meaning is as diverse as possible.
   They all say that the acts of men are necessary. When they come to
   explain themselves, the one class says they are truly and properly
   necessary in such a sense that they are not free, and that they
   preclude the possibility of moral character or responsibility. The
   other class say that they are necessary, but in such a sense as to be
   nevertheless free and perfectly consistent with the moral
   responsibility of the agent. It is certainly a great evil that theories
   diametrically opposed to each other, that the doctrine of saints, and
   the doctrine of evils (to use Paul's language) should be expressed in
   the same words. We accordingly find the most respectable writers, as
   Reid and Stewart, arguing against Edwards as though he held the
   doctrine of Belsham.

   By the old Latin writers the theory of moral certainty is commonly
   designated Lubentia Rationalis, or Rational Spontaneity. This is a much
   more appropriate designation. It implies that in every volition there
   are the elements of rationality and spontaneous action. In brutes there
   is a spontaneity but no reason, and therefore they are not free agents
   in such a sense as to be the objects ot approbation or disapprobation.
   In maniacs also there is self-determination, but it is irrational, and
   therefore not free. But wherever reason and the power of
   self-determination or spontaneity are combined in an agent, he is free
   and responsible for his outward acts and for his volitions. This
   representation would satisfy Reid, who says, "We see evidently that, as
   reason without active power can do nothing, so active power without
   reason has no guide to direct it to any end. These two conjoined make
   moral liberty." [260]

   The old writers, in developing their doctrine of rational spontaneity
   were accustomed to say, the will is determined by the last judgment of
   the understanding. This is true or false as the language is
   interpreted. If by the last judgment of the understanding be meant the
   intellectual apprehension and conviction of the reasonableness and
   excellence of the object of choice, then none but the perfectly
   reasonable and good are always thus determined. Men in a multitude of
   cases choose that which their understanding condemns as wicked,
   trifling, or destructive. Or if the meaning be that every free act is
   the result of conscious deliberation, and consequent decision of the
   mind as to the desirableness of a given act, then again it cannot be
   said that the will follows the last dictate of the understanding. It is
   in reference probably to one or both of these interpretations of the
   language in question that Leibnitz says: "Non semper sequimur judicium
   ultimum intellectus practici, dum ad volendum nos determinamus; at ubi
   volumus, semper sequimur collectionem omnium inclinationum, tam a parte
   rationum, tam passionum, profectarum; id quod sæpenumero sine expresso
   intellectus judicio contingit." [261] But what is really meant by this
   expression is that the views or feelings which determine the will are
   themselves determined by the understanding. If I desire anything, it is
   because I apprehend it as suitable to satisfy some craving of my
   nature. If I will anything because it is right, its being right is
   something for the understanding to discern. In other words, all the
   desires, affections, or feelings which determine the will to act must
   have an object, and that object by which the feeling is excited and
   towards which it tends, must be discerned by the understanding. It is
   this that gives them their rational character, and renders the
   determinations of the will rational. Any volition which does not follow
   the last dictate of the understanding, in this sense of the words, is
   the act of an idiot. It may be spontaneous, just as the acts of brutes
   are, but it cannot be free in the sense of being the act of an
   accountable person.

   Another form under which this doctrine is often expressed is, that the
   will is as the greatest apparent good. This is a very common mode of
   stating the doctrine, derived from Leibnitz, the father of optimism,
   whose whole "Theodicée" is founded on the assumption that sin is the
   necessary means of the greatest good. By "good," writers of this class
   generally mean "adapted to produce happiness," which is regarded as the
   summum bonum. Their doctrine is that the will always decides in favour
   of what promises the greatest happiness. It is not the greatest real,
   but the greatest apparent good which is said to determine the volition.
   A single draught from the bowl may appear to the drunkard, in the
   intensity of his craving, a greater good, i.e., as better suited to
   relieve and satisfy him, than the welfare of himself or family for
   life. This whole theory is founded on the assumption that happiness is
   the highest end, and that the desire of happiness is the ultimate
   spring of all voluntary action. As both of these principles are
   abhorrent to the great mass of cultivated, and especially of Christian
   minds; as men act from other and higher motives than a desire to
   promote their own happiness, there are few who, in our day, will adopt
   the doctrine that the will is as the greatest apparent good, as thus
   expounded. If, however, the word good be taken in a more comprehensive
   sense, including everything that is desirable, whether as right,
   becoming, or useful, as well as suited to give happiness, then the
   doctrine is no doubt true. The will in point of fact always is
   determined in favour of that which under some aspect, or for some
   reason, is regarded as good. Otherwise men might choose evil as evil,
   which would violate a fundamental law of all rational and sensuous
   natures.

   It is still more common, at least in this country, to say that the will
   is always determined by the strongest motive. To this mode of statement
   there are two obvious objections. (1.) The ambiguity of the word
   motive. If that word be taken in one sense, the statement is true; if
   taken in another, it is false. (2.) The impossibility of establishing
   any test of the relative strength of motives. If you make vivacity of
   feeling the test, then it is not true that the strongest motive always
   prevails. If you make the effect the test, then you say that the
   strongest motive is that which determines the will, -- which amounts to
   saying that the will is determined by that which determines it.

   It is better to abide by the general statement. The will is not
   determined by any law of necessity; it is not independent, indifferent,
   or self-determined, but is always determined by the preceding state of
   mind; so that a man is free so long as his volitions are the conscious
   expression of his own mind; or so long as his activity is determined
   and controlled by his reason and feelings.

   § 2. Definition of Terms.

   Before proceeding to give an outline of the usual arguments in support
   of this doctrine, it is important to state the meaning of the words
   employed. No one in the least conversant with discussions of this
   nature can have failed to remark how much difficulty arises from the
   ambiguity of the terms employed, and how often men appear to differ in
   doctrine, when in fact they only differ in language.

   The Will.

   First, the word will itself is one of those ambiguous terms. Ii is
   sometimes used in a wide sense, so as to include all the desires,
   affections, and even emotions. It has this comprehensive sense when all
   the faculties of the soul are said to be included under the two
   categories of understanding and will. Everything, therefore, pertaining
   to the soul, that does not belong to the former, is said to belong to
   the latter. All liking and disliking, all preferring, all inclination
   and disinclination, are in this sense acts of the will. At other times,
   the word is used for the power of self-determination, or for that
   faculty by which we decide on our acts. In this sense only purposes and
   imperative volitions are acts of the will. It is obvious that if a
   writer affirms the liberty of the will in the latter sense, and his
   reader takes the word in the former, the one can never understand the
   other. Or if the same writer sometimes uses the word in its wide and
   sometimes in its narrow sense, he will inevitably mislead himself and
   others. To say that we have power over our volitions, and to say that
   we have power over our desires are entirely different things. One of
   these propositions may be affirmed and the other denied; but if will
   and desire are confounded the distinction between these propositions is
   obliterated. It has often been remarked that the confusion of these two
   meanings of the word will is the great defect of President Edwards's
   celebrated work. He starts with a definition of the term, which makes
   it include all preferring, choosing, being pleased or displeased with,
   liking and disliking, and advocates a theory which is true, and
   applicable only to the will in the restricted sense of the word.

   Motive.

   Secondly, The word motive is often taken in different senses. It is
   defined to be anything which has a tendency to move the mind. Any
   object adapted to awaken desire or affection; any truth or conception
   which is suited to influence a rational and sensitive being to a
   decision, is said to be a motive. This is what is called the objective
   sense of the word. In this sense it is very far from being true that
   the will is always determined by the strongest motive. The most
   important truths, the most weighty considerations, the most alluring
   objects, are often powerless, so far as the internal state of the mind
   is concerned. The word, however, is often used in a subjective sense,
   for those inward convictions, feelings, inclinations, and principles
   which are in the mind itself, and which impel or influence the man to
   decide one way rather than another. It is only in this sense of the
   term that the will is determined by the strongest motive. But even then
   it must be admitted, as before remarked, that we have no criterion or
   standard by which to determine the relative strength of motives, other
   than their actual effect. So that to say that the will is determined by
   the strongest motive, only means that it is not self-determined, but
   that in every rational volition the man is influenced to decide one way
   rather than another, by something within him, so that the volition is a
   revelation of what he himself is.

   Cause.

   Thirdly, The word cause is no less ambiguous. It sometimes means the
   mere occasion; sometimes the instrument by which something is
   accomplished; sometimes the efficiency to which the effect is due;
   sometimes the end for which a thing is done, as when we speak of final
   causes; sometimes the ground or reason why the effect or action of the
   efficient cause is so rather than otherwise. To say that motives are
   the occasional causes of volition, is consistent with any theory of
   agency, whether of necessity or indifference; to say that they are
   efficient causes, is to transfer the efficiency of the agent to the
   motives; but to say that they are the ground or reason why the
   volitions are what they are, is only to say that every rational being,
   in every voluntary act, must have a reason, good or bad, for acting as
   he does. Most of the arguments against the statement that motives are
   the cause of volitions, are founded on the assumption that they are
   affirmed to be producing causes, and that it is intended to deny that
   the agent is the efficient cause of his own acts; whereas, the meaning
   simply is that motives are the reasons which determine the agent to
   assert his efficiency in one way rather than another. They are,
   however, truly causes, in so far as they determine the effect to be
   thus, and not otherwise. Parental love may induce a mother to watch by
   a sick child, and in this sense is the cause of her devotion, but she
   is none the less the efficient cause of all her acts of tenderness.
   Reid says, "either the man is the cause of the action. and then it is a
   free action, and is justly imputed to him, or it must have another
   cause, and cannot justly be imputed to the man." [262] This supposes
   that the word cause has but one sense. In the case just supposed, the
   mother is the efficient, her love the rational cause or reason of her
   acts. Is it a denial of her free agency to say that her love determined
   her will in favour of attention instead of neglect?

   Liberty.

   Fourthly, No little ambiguity arises from confounding liberty of the
   will with liberty of the agent. These forms of expression are often
   used as equivalent. The same thing is perhaps commonly intended by
   saying, "The will is free," and "The agent is free." It is admitted
   that the same thought may be properly expressed by these phrases. As we
   speak of freedom of conscience, when we mean to say that the man is
   free as to his conscience; so we may speak of freedom of the will, when
   all we mean is, that the man is free in willing. The usage, however,
   which makes these expressions synonymous is liable to the following
   objections: (1.) Predicating liberty of the will is apt to lead to our
   conceiving of the will as separated from the agent; as a distinct
   self-acting power in the soul. Or, if this extreme be avoided, which is
   not always the case, the will is regarded as too much detached from the
   other faculties of the soul, and as out of sympathy with it in its
   varying stales. The will is only the soul willing. The soul is of
   course a unit. A self-determination is a determination of the will, and
   whatever leads to a self-decision leads to a decision of the will. (2.)
   A second objection to confounding these expressions is, that they are
   not really equivalent. The man may be free, when his will is in
   bondage. It is a correct and established usage of language, expressive
   of a real fact of consciousness, to speak of an enslaved will in a free
   agent. This is not a mere metaphor, but a philosophical truth. He that
   commits sin is the servant of sin. Long-continued mental or bodily
   habits may bring the will into bondage, while the man continues a free
   agent. A man who has been for years a miser, has his will in a state of
   slavery, yet the man is perfectly free. He is self-controlled,
   self-determined. His avarice is himself. It is his own darling,
   cherished feeling. (3.) There is no use to have two expressions for the
   same thing; the one appropriate, the other ambiguous. What we really
   mean is, that the agent is free. That is the only point to which any
   interest is attached. The man is the responsible subject. If he be free
   so as to be justly account able for his character and conduct, it
   matters not what are the laws which determine the operations of his
   reason, conscience, or will; or whether liberty can be predicated of
   either of those faculties separately considered. We maintain that the
   man is free; but we deny that the will is free in the sense of being
   independent of reason, conscience, and feeling. In other words, a man
   cannot be independent of himself, or any one of his faculties
   independent of all the rest.

   Liberty and Ability.

   Fifthly, Another fruitful source of confusion on this subject, is
   confounding liberty with ability. The usage which attaches the same
   meaning to these terms is very ancient. Augustine denied free will to
   man since the fall. Pelagius affirmed freedom of will to be essential
   to our nature. The former intended simply to deny to fallen man the
   power to turn himself unto God. The latter defined liberty to be the
   ability at any moment to determine himself either for good or evil. The
   controversy between Luther and Erasmus was really about ability,
   nominally it was about free-will. Luther's book is entitled "De Servo
   Arbitrio," that of Erasmus, "De Libero Arbitrio." This usage pervades
   all the symbols of the Reformation, and was followed by the theologians
   of the sixteenth century. They all ascribe free agency to man in the
   true sense of the words, but deny to him freedom of will. To a great
   extent this confusion is still kept up. Many of the prevalent
   definitions of liberty are definitions of liberty are definitions of
   ability; and much that is commonly advanced to prove the liberty of the
   will, is really intended, and is of force only as in support of the
   doctrine of ability. Jacobi denies liberty to be the power to decide in
   favour of the dictates of reason in opposition to the solicitations of
   sense. Bretschneider says it is the power to decide according to
   reason. Augustine, and after him most Augustinians distinguished, (1.)
   The liberty of man before the fall, which was an ability either to sin
   or not to sin. (2.) The state of man since the fall, when he has
   liberty to sin, but not to good. (3.) The state of man in heaven when
   he has liberty to good, but not to evil. This last is the highest form
   of liberty, a felix necessitas boni. This is the liberty which belongs
   to God. In the popular mind perhaps the common idea of liberty is, the
   power to decide for good or evil, sin or holiness. This idea pervades
   more or less all the disquisitions in favour of the liberty of
   indifference, or of power to the contrary. The essence of liberty in a
   moral accountable being, according to Reid, is the power to do what he
   is accountable for. So Cousin, Jouffroy, Tappan, and this whole class
   of writers, make liberty and ability synonymous. The last-mentioned
   author, when speaking of the distinction between natural and moral
   inability, says, "when we have denied liberty in denying a
   self-determining power, these definitions, in order to make out a quasi
   liberty and ability, are nothing but ingenious folly and plausible
   deception." [263] Here liberty and ability are avowedly used as
   convertible terms.

   Other writers who do not ignore the distinction between liberty and
   ability, yet distinguish them only as different forms of liberty. This
   is the case with many of the German authors. As for example with
   Müller, who distinguishes the Formale Freiheit, or ability, from the
   Reale Freiheit, or liberty as it actually exists. The former is only
   necessary as the condition of the latter. That is, he admits, that if a
   man's acts are certainly determined by his character, he is really
   free. But in order to render him justly responsible for his character,
   it must be self-acquired. [264] This is confounding things which are
   not only distinct, but which are admitted to be distinct. It is
   admitted by this class of writers, and, indeed, by the whole Christian
   world, that men since the fall have not power to make themselves holy;
   much less to effect this transformation by a volition. It is admitted
   that saints in glory are infallibly determined by their character to
   holiness, yet fallen men and saints are admitted to be free. Ability
   may be lost, yet liberty remain. The former is lost since the fall.
   Restored by grace, as they say, it is to be again lost in that liberty
   to good which is identical with necessity. If liberty and ability are
   thus distinct, why should they be confounded? We are conscious of
   liberty. We know ourselves to be free in all our volitions. They reveal
   themselves to our inmost consciousness as acts of self-determination.
   We cannot disown them, or escape responsibility on account of them,
   even if we try; and yet no man is conscious of ability to change his
   own heart. Free agency belongs to God, to angels, to saints in glory,
   to fallen men, and to Satan; and it is the same in all. Yet in the
   strictest sense of the words, God cannot do evil; neither can Satan
   recover, by a volition, his lost inheritance of holiness. It is a great
   evil thus to confound things essentially distinct. It produces endless
   confusion. Augustine says, man is not free since the fall, because he
   cannot but sin; saints are free because they cannot sin. Inability in
   the one case destroys freedom; inability in the other is the perfection
   of freedom! Necessity is the very opposite of liberty, and yet they are
   said to be identical. One man in asserting the freedom of the will,
   means to assert free agency, while he denies ability; another means by
   it full ability. It is certainly important that the same words should
   not be used to express antagonistic ideas.

   Confusion of thought and language, however, is not the principal evil
   which arises from making liberty and ability identical. It necessarily
   brings us into conflict with the truth, and with the moral judgments of
   men. There are three truths of which every man is convinced from the
   very constitution of his nature. (1.) That he is a free agent. (2.)
   That none but free agents can be accountable for their character or
   conduct. (3.) That he does not possess ability to change his moral
   state by an act of the will. Now, if in order to express the fact of
   his inability, we say, that he is not a free agent, we contradict his
   consciousness; or, if he believe what we say, we destroy his sense of
   responsibility. Or it we tell him that because he is a free agent, he
   has power to change his heart at will, we again bring ourselves into
   conflict with his convictions. He knows he is a free agent, and yet he
   knows that he has not the power to make himself holy. Free agency is
   the power to decide according to our character; ability is the power to
   change our character by a volition. The former, the Bible and
   consciousness affirm belongs to man in every condition of his being the
   latter, the Bible and consciousness teach with equal explicitness does
   not belong to fallen man. The two things, therefore, ought not to be
   confounded.

   Self-determination and Self-determination of the Will.

   Sixthly, Another source of confusion is not discriminating between
   self-determination and self-determination of the will. Those who use
   the latter expression, say they intend to deny that the will is
   determined by the antecedent state of the mind, and to affirm that it
   has a self-determining power, independent of anything preexisting or
   coëxisting. They say that those who teach that when the state of the
   mind is the same, the volition will inevitably be the same, teach
   necessity and fatalism, and reduce the will to a machine. "I know,"
   says Reid, "nothing more that can be desired to establish fatalism
   throughout the universe. When it is proved that, through all nature,
   the same consequences invariably result from the same circumstances,
   the doctrine of liberty must be given up." [265] The opposite doctrine
   is, that the will is "self-moved; it makes its nisus of itself, and of
   itself it forbears to make it, and within the sphere of its activity,
   and in relation to its objects, it has the power of selecting, by a
   mere arbitrary act, any particular object. It is a cause all whose
   acts, as well as any particular act, considered as phenomena demanding
   a cause, are accounted for in itself alone." [266] Thus, if it be asked
   why the will decides one way rather than another, the reason is to be
   sought in its self-determining power. It can by an arbitrary act,
   choose or not choose, choose one way or another, without a motive or
   with a motive, for or against any or all influences brought to bear
   upon it. But when these writers come to prove their case, it turns out
   that this is not at all what they mean. It is not the self-determining
   power of the will, but the self-determining power of the agent that
   they are contending for. Reid says that all that is involved in free
   agency is that man is an agent, the author of his own acts or that we
   are "efficient causes in our deliberate and voluntary actions." [267]
   "To say that man is a free agent, is no more than to say that, in some
   instances, he is truly an agent and a cause, and is not merely acted
   upon as a passive instrument." [268] Dr. Samuel Clarke, in his
   controversy with Leibnitz, says, "the power of self-motion or action,
   which, in all animate agents, is spontaneity, is, in moral or rational
   agents, what we properly call liberty." Again, he says, "the true
   definition of liberty is the power to act." Now, as all the advocates
   of the doctrine of moral certainty admit self-determination of the
   agent, and deny the self-determining power of the will, the greatest
   confusion must follow from confounding these two things; and, besides
   this, undue advantage is thereby secured for the doctrine of the
   self-determining power of the will, by arguments which prove only
   self-determination, which every man admits. On the other hand unfair
   prejudice is created against the truth by representing it as denying
   the power of self-determination, when it only denies the
   self-determining power of the will. Thus President Edwards is
   constantly represented as denying that volitions are
   self-determinations, or that the mind is the efficient cause of its own
   acts, or that man is an agent, because he wrote against the
   self-determining power of the will as taught by Clarke and Whitby.
   These two things ought not to be confounded, because they are really
   distinct. When we say that an agent is self-determined, we say two
   things. (1.) That he is the author or efficient cause of his own act.
   (2.) That the grounds or reasons of his determination are within
   himself. He is determined by what constitutes him at the moment a
   particular individual, his feelings, principles, character,
   dispositions; and not by any ab extra or coercive influence. But when
   we say that the will is self-determined, we separate it from the other
   constituents of the man, as an independent power, and on the one hand,
   deny that it is determined by anything in the man; and on the other,
   affirm that it determines itself by an inherent self-moving, arbitrary
   power. In this case the volition ceases to be a decision of the agent,
   for it may be contrary to that agent's whole character, principles,
   inclinations, feelings, convictions, or whatever else makes him what he
   is.

   the mind, but simply that the same decisions "invariably" occur in the
   same circumstances, that is declared to be fatalism.

   § 3. Certainty Consistent with Liberty.

   Although the doctrine of necessity subverts the foundation of all
   morality and religion, our present concern is with the doctrine of
   contingency. We wish simply to state the case as between certainty and
   uncertainty. The doctrine of necessity, in the proper sense of the
   word, is antichristian; but the Christian world is, and ever has been
   divided between the advocates and opponents of the doctrine of
   contingency. All Augustinians maintain that a free act may be
   inevitably certain as to its occurrence.. All Anti-Augustinians,
   whether Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians, or Arminians, and most moral
   philosophers and metaphysicians, take the opposite ground. They teach
   that as the will has a self-determining power it may decide against all
   motives internal or external, against all influences divine or human,
   so that its decisions cannot be rendered inevitable without destroying
   their liberty. The very essence of liberty, they say, is power to the
   contrary. In other words, a free act is one performed with the
   consciousness that under precisely the same circumstances, that is, in
   the same internal as well as external state of the mind, it might have
   been the opposite. According to the one doctrine, the will is
   determined; according to the other, it determines itself. In the one
   case, our acts are or may be inevitably certain and yet be free. In the
   other, in order to be free, they must be uncertain. We have already
   proved that this is a fair statement of the case; that the advocates of
   moral necessity mean thereby certainty; and that the advocates of
   contingency mean thereby uncertainty. We have admitted that the use of
   the word necessity, even when qualified by saying negatively, that it
   is not "absolute, physical, or mechanical," and that it is merely
   philosophical or moral, is unfortunate and inappropriate. And if any
   opponent of Augustine or Edwards say that all he denies is an absolute
   or physical necessity, and that he has no objection to the doctrine of
   certainty, then the difference between him and Edwards is merely
   verbal. But the real controversy lies deeper. It is not the word, but
   the thing that is opposed. There is a real difference as to the nature
   of free agency; and that difference concerns this very point: may the
   acts of free agents be rendered inevitably certain without destroying
   their liberty?

   Points of Agreement.

   It may be well before proceeding further, to state the points as to
   which the parties to this controversy are agreed.

   1. They are agreed that man is a free agent, in such a sense as to be
   responsible for his character and acts. The dispute is not about the
   fact, but the nature of free agency. If any one denied that men are
   responsible moral agents, then he belongs to the school of necessity,
   and is not a party to the discussion now under consideration.

   2. It is agreed as to the nature of free agency that it supposes both
   reason and active power. Mere spontaneity does not constitute free
   agency, because that is found in brutes, in idiots, and in maniacs.
   There is no dispute as to what is meant by reason as one of the
   elements of free agency; and so for as active power, which is its
   second element, is concerned, it is agreed that it means or includes
   efficiency. In other words, it is agreed that a free agent is the
   efficient cause of his own acts.

   3. It is admitted, on both sides, that in all important cases, men act
   under the influence of motives. Reid, indeed, endeavours to show that
   in many cases the will decides without any motive. When there is no
   ground of preference, he says this must be the case; as when a man
   decides which of fifty shillings he shall give away. He admits,
   however, that these arbitrary decisions relate only to trifles. Others
   of the same school acknowledge that no rational volition is ever
   arrived at except under the influence of motives.

   4. It is further agreed that the will is not determined with certainty
   by external motives. All Augustinians deny that the internal state of
   the mind which determines the will, is itself necessarily or certainly
   determined by anything external to the mind itself.

   5. It may be assumed, also, that the parties are agreed that the word
   will is to be taken in its proper, restricted sense. The question is
   not, whether men have power over their affections, their likes and
   dislikes. No one carries the power of the will so far as to maintain
   that we can, by a volition, change our feelings. The question concerns
   our volitions alone. It is the ground or reason of acts of
   self-determination that is in dispute. And, therefore, it is the will
   considered as the faculty of self-determination, and not as the seat of
   the affections, that comes into view. The question, why one man is led
   to love God, or Christ, or his fellow men, or truth and goodness; and
   another to love the world, or sin, is very different from the question,
   what determines him to do this or that particular act. The will is that
   faculty by which we determine to do something which we conceive to be
   in our power. The question, whether a man has power to change his own
   character at any moment, to give himself, in the language of Scripture,
   a new heart, concerns the extent of his power. That is, it is a
   question concerning the ability or inability of the sinner; and it is a
   most important question: but it should not be confounded with the
   question of free agency, which is the one now under consideration.

   The whole question therefore is, whether, when a man decides to do a
   certain thing, his will is determined by the previous state of his
   mind. Or, whether, with precisely the same views and feelings, his
   decision may be one way at one time, and another at an other. That is,
   whether the will, or rather the agent, in order to be free, must be
   undetermined.

   Argument that Certainty suits all Free Agents.

   It is certainly a strong argument in favour of that view of free
   agency, which makes it consistent with certainty, or which supposes
   that an agent may be determined with inevitable certainty as to his
   acts, and yet those acts remain free, that it suits all classes or
   conditions of free agents. To deny free agency to God, would be to deny
   Him personality, and to reduce Him to a mere power or principle. And
   yet, in all the universe, is there anything so certain as that God will
   do right? But if it be said that the conditions of existence in an
   infinite being are so different from what they are in creatures, that
   it is not fair to argue from the one to the other, we may refer to the
   case of our blessed Lord. He had a true body and a reasonable soul. He
   had a human will; a mind regulated by the same laws as those which
   determine the intellectual and voluntary acts of ordinary men. In his
   case, however, although there may have been the metaphysical
   possibility of evil (though even that is a painful hypothesis), still
   it was more certain that He would be without sin than that the sun or
   moon should endure. No conceivable physical law could be more certain
   in the production of its effects than his will in always deciding for
   the right. But if it be objected even to this case, that the union of
   the divine and human natures in the person of our Lord places Him in a
   different category from ourselves, and renders it unfair to assume that
   what was true in his case must be true in ours; without admitting the
   force of the objection, we may refer to the condition of the saints in
   heaven. They, beyond doubt, continue to be free agents; and yet their
   acts are, and to everlasting will be, determined with absolute and
   inevitable certainty to good. Certainty, therefore, must be consistent
   with free agency. What can any Christian say to this? Does he deny that
   the saints in glory are free, or does he deny the absolute certainty of
   their perseverance in holiness? Would his conception of the blessedness
   of heaven be thereby exalted? Or would it raise his ideas of the
   dignity of the redeemed to believe it to be uncertain whether they will
   be sinful or holy? We may, however, come down to our present state of
   existence. Without assuming anything as to the corruption of our
   nature, or taking for granted anything which Pelagius would deny, it is
   a certain fact that all men sin. There has never existed a mere man on
   the face of the earth who did not sin. When we look on a new-born
   infant we know that whatever may be uncertain in its future, it is
   absolutely, inevitably certain that, should it live, it will sin. In
   every aspect, therefore, in which we can contemplate free agency,
   whether in God, in the human nature of Christ, in the redeemed in
   heaven, or in man here on earth, we find that it is compatible with
   absolute certainty.

   Arguments from Scripture.

   A second argument on this subject is derived from those doctrines of
   Scripture which necessarily suppose that free acts may be certain as to
   their occurrence.

   1. The first and most obvious of these doctrines is the foreknowledge
   of God. Whatever metaphysical explanation may be given of this divine
   attribute; however we may ignore the distinction between knowledge and
   foreknowledge, or however we may contend that because God inhabits
   eternity, and is in no wise subject to the limitations of time, and
   that to Him nothing is successive, still the fact remains that we exist
   in time, and that to us there is a future as well as a present. It
   remains, therefore, a fact that human acts are known before they occur
   in time, and consequently are foreknown. But if foreknown as future,
   they must be certain; not because foreknowledge renders their
   occurrence certain, but because it supposes it to be so. It is a
   contradiction in terms to say that an uncertain event can be foreknown
   as certain. To deny foreknowledge to God, to say that free acts,
   because necessarily uncertain as to their occurrence, are not the
   objects of foreknowledge any more than sounds are the objects of sight,
   or mathematical truths of the affections, is to destroy the very idea
   of God. The future must be as dark to Him as to us; and He must every
   moment be receiving vast accessions of knowledge. He cannot be an
   eternal being, pervading all duration with a simultaneous existence,
   much less an omniscient Being, to whom there is nothing new. It is
   impossible, therefore, to believe in God as He is revealed in the
   Bible, unless we believe that all things are known unto Him from the
   beginning. But if all things are known, all things, whether fortuitous
   or free, are certain; consequently certainty must be consistent with
   freedom. We are not more assured of our existence than we are of our
   free agency. To say that this is a delusion is to deny the veracity of
   consciousness, which of necessity not only involves a denial of the
   veracity of God, but also subverts the foundation of all knowledge, and
   plunges us into absolute scepticism. We may just as well say that our
   existence is a delusion as that any other fact of consciousness is
   delusive. We have no more and no higher evidence for one such fact than
   for another. Men may speculate as they please, they must believe and
   act according to the laws impressed on our nature by ur Creator. We
   must believe, therefore, in our existence and in our free agency; and
   as by a necessity scarcely less imperative we must believe that all
   things are known to God from eternity, and that if foreknown their
   occurrence is certain, we cannot deny that certainty is consistent with
   free agency without involving ourselves in palpable contradictions.
   This argument is so conclusive that most theistical advocates of the
   doctrine of contingency, when they come to deal with it, give the
   matter up, and acknowledge that an act may be certain as to its
   occurrence and yet free. They content themselves for the time being
   with denying that it is necessary, although it may be certain. But they
   forget that by "moral necessity" nothing more than certainty is
   intended, and that certainty is precisely the thing which, on other
   occasions, they affirm to be contrary to liberty. If from all eternity
   it is fixed how every man will act; if the same consequences follow
   invariably from the same antecedents; if the acts of men are
   inevitable, this is declared to be fatalism. If, however, it be indeed
   true that the advocates of indifference, self-determining power of the
   will, power of contrary choice, or by whatever other name the theory of
   contingency may be called, really do not intend to oppose the doctrine
   of certainty, but are simply combating fatalism or physical necessity,
   then the controversy is ended. What more could Leibnitz or Edwards ask
   than Reid concedes in the following passage: "It must be granted, that,
   as whatever was, certainly was, and whatever is, certainly is, so
   whatever shall be, certainly shall be. These are identical
   propositions, and cannot be doubted by those who conceive them
   distinctly. But I know no rule of reasoning by which it can be inferred
   that because an event certainly shall be, therefore its production must
   be necessary. The manner of its production, whether free or necessary,
   cannot be concluded from the time of its production, whether it be
   past, present, or future. That it shall be, no more implies that it
   shall be necessarily than that it shall be freely produced; for neither
   present, past, nor future, have any more connection with necessity than
   they have with freedom. I grant, therefore, that from events being
   foreseen, it may be justly concluded, that, they are certainly future;
   but from their being certainly future it does not follow that they are
   necessary." [269] As all things are foreseen all things are inevitably
   certain as to their occurrence. This is granting all any Augustinian
   need demand.

   2. Another doctrine held by a large part of the Christian world in all
   ages which of necessity precludes the doctrine of contingency, is that
   of the foreordination of future events. Those who believe that God
   foreordains whatever comes to pass must believe that the occurrence of
   all events is determined with unalterable certainty. It is not our
   object to prove any of these doctrines, but simply to argue from them
   as true. It may, however, be remarked that there is no difficulty
   attending the doctrine of foreordination which does not attach to that
   of foreknowledge. The latter supposes the certainty of free acts, and
   the former secures their certainty. If their being certain be
   consistent with liberty, their being rendered certain cannot be
   incompatible with it. All that foreordination does is to render it
   certain that free acts shall occur. The whole difficulty is in their
   being certain, and that must be admitted by every consistent theist.
   The point now in hand is, that those who believe that the Bible teaches
   the doctrine of foreordination are shut up to the conclusion that an
   event may be free and yet certain, and therefore that the theory of
   contingency which supposes that an act to be free must be uncertain, is
   unscriptural and false.

   3. The doctrine of divine providence involves the same conclusion. That
   doctrine teaches that God governs all his creatures and all their
   actions. That is, that He so conducts the administration of his
   government as to accomplish all his purposes. Here again the difficulty
   is the same, and is no greater than before. Foreknowledge supposes
   certainty; foreordination determines it; and providence effects it. The
   last does no more than the first of necessity presupposes. If certainty
   be compatible with freedom, providence which only secures certainty
   cannot be inconsistent with it. Who for any metaphysical difficulty --
   who, because he is not able to comprehend how God can effectually
   govern free agents without destroying their nature, would give up the
   doctrine of providence? Who would wish to see the reins of universal
   empire fall from the hands of infinite wisdom and love, to be seized by
   chance or fate? Who would not rather be governed by a Father than by a
   tornado? If God cannot effectually control the acts of free agents
   there can be no prophecy, no prayer, no thanksgiving, no promises, no
   security of salvation, no certainty whether in the end God or Satan is
   to be triumphant, whether heaven or hell is to be the consummation.
   Give us certainty -- the secure conviction that a sparrow cannot fall,
   or a sinner move a finger, but as God permits and ordains. We must have
   either God or Satan to rule. And if God has a providence He must be
   able to render the free acts of his creatures certain; and therefore
   certainty must be consistent with liberty. Was it not certain that
   Christ should, according to the Scriptures, be by wicked hands
   crucified and slain, and yet were not his murderers free in all they
   did? Let it be remembered that in all these doctrines of providence,
   foreordination, and foreknowledge nothing is assumed beyond what Reid,
   one of the most able opponents of Leibnitz and Edwards, readily admits.
   He grants the prescience of future events; he grants that prescience
   supposes certainty, and that is all that either foreordination or
   providence secures. If an act may be free, although certainly
   foreknown, it may be free although foreordained and secured by the
   great scheme of providence.

   4. The whole Christian world believes that God can convert men. They
   believe that He can effectually lead them to repentance and faith; and
   that He can secure them in heaven from ever falling into sin. That is,
   they believe that He can render their free acts absolutely certain.
   When we say that this is the faith of the whole Christian world we do
   not mean that no individual Christian or Christian theologian has ever
   denied this doctrine of grace; but we do mean that the doctrine, to the
   extent above stated, is included in the Confessions of all the great
   historical churches of Christendom in all ages. It is just as much a
   part of the established faith of Christians as the divinity of our
   Redeemer. This being the fact, the doctrine that contingency is
   necessary to liberty cannot be reconciled with Christian doctrine. It
   has, indeed, been extensively held by Christians; but our object is to
   show that it is in conflict within doctrines which they themselves as
   Christians must admit. If God can fulfil his promise to give men a new
   heart; if He can translate them from the kingdom of darkness into the
   kingdom of his dear Son; if He can give them repentance unto life; if
   there be no impropriety in praying that He would preserve them from
   falling, and give them the secure possession of eternal life, then He
   can control their free acts. He can, by his grace, without violating
   their freedom, make it absolutely certain that they will repent and
   believe, and persevere in holiness. If these things are so, then it is
   evident that any theory which makes contingency or uncertainty
   essential to liberty must be irreconcilable with some of the plainest
   and most precious doctrines of the Scriptures.

   The Argument from Consciousness.

   A third argument on this subject is derived from consciousness. It is
   conceded that every man is conscious of liberty in his voluntary acts.
   It is conceded further that this consciousness proves the fact of free
   agency. The validity of this argument urged by the advocates of
   contingency against the doctrine of necessity in any such form as
   involves a denial of this fact of consciousness, we fully admit. The
   doctrine opposed by Reid and Stewart, as well as by many continental
   writers, was really a doctrine which denied both the liberty and
   responsibility of man. This is not the Augustinian or Edwardean
   doctrine, although unhappily both are expressed by the same terms. The
   one is the doctrine of physical or mechanical necessity; the other that
   of certainty. As between the advocates of the latter theory and the
   defenders of contingency, it is agreed that man is a free agent; it is
   further agreed that it is included in the consciousness of free agency,
   that we are efficient and responsible authors of our own acts, that we
   had the power to perform or not to perform any voluntary act of which
   we were the authors. But we maintain that we are none the less
   conscious that this intimate conviction that we had power not to
   perform an act, is conditional. That is, we are conscious that the act
   might have been otherwise had other views or feelings been present to
   our minds, or been allowed their due weight. No man is conscious of a
   power to will against his will; that is, the will, in the narrow sense
   of the word, cannot be against the will in the wide sense of the term.
   This is only saying, that a man cannot prefer against his preference or
   choose against his choice. A volition is a preference resulting in a
   decision. A man may have one preference at one time and another at
   another. He may have various conflicting feelings or principles in
   action at the same time; but he cannot have coëxisting opposite
   preferences. What consciousness teaches on this subject seems to be
   simply this: that in every voluntary act we had some reason for acting
   as we did; that in the absence of that reason, or in the presence of
   others, which others we may feel ought to have been present, we should
   or could have acted differently. Under the reasons for an act are
   included all that is meant by the word motives, in the subjective sense
   of the term; i.e., principles, inclinations, feelings, etc. We cannot
   conceive that a man can be conscious that, with his principles,
   feelings, and inclinations being one way, his will may be another way.
   A man filled with the fear of God, or with the love of Christ, cannot
   will to blaspheme his God or Saviour. That fear or love constitutes for
   the time being the man. He is a man existing in that state, and if his
   acts do not express that state they are not his.

   Argument from the Moral Character of Volition.

   This suggests a fourth argument on this subject. Unless the will be
   determined by the previous state of the mind, in opposition to being
   self-determined, there can be no morality in our acts. A man is
   responsible for his external acts, because they are decided by his
   will; he is responsible for his volitions, because they are determined
   by his principles and feelings; he is responsible for his principles
   and feelings, because of their inherent nature as good or bad, and
   because they are his own, and constitute his character. If you detach
   the outward act from the will it ceases to have any moral character. If
   I kill a man, unless the act was intentional, i.e., the result of a
   volition to kill or injure, there is no morality in the act. If I
   willed to kill, then the character of the act depends on the motives
   which determined the volition. If those motives were a regard to the
   authority of God, or of the demands of justice legally expressed, the
   volition was right. If the motive was malice or cupidity, the volition
   and consequent act were wrong. It is obvious that if the will be
   self-determined, independent of the previous state of the mind, it has
   no more character than the outward act detached from the volition, --
   it does not reveal or express anything in the mind. If a man when
   filled with pious feeling can will the most impious acts; or, when
   filled with enmity to God, have the volitions of a saint, then his
   volitions and acts have nothing to do with the man himself. They do not
   express his character and he cannot be responsible for them.

   Argument from the Rational Nature of Man.

   The doctrine that the will is determined and not self-determined, is
   moreover involved in the rational character of our acts. A rational act
   is not merely an act performed by a rational being, but one performed
   for a reason, whether good or bad. An act performed without a reason,
   without intention or object, for which no reason be assigned beyond the
   mere power of acting, is as irrational as the actions of a brute or of
   an idiot. If the will therefore ever acts independently of the
   understanding and of the feelings, its volitions are not the acts of a
   rational being any further than they would be if reason were entirely
   dethroned. The only true idea of liberty is that of a being acting in
   accordance with the laws of its nature. So long as an animal is allowed
   to act under the control of its own nature, determined in all it does
   by what is within itself, it has all the liberty of which it is
   capable. And so long as a man is determined in his volitions and acts
   by his own reason and feelings he has all the liberty of which he is
   capable. But if you detach the acts of an animal from its inward state
   its liberty is gone. It becomes possessed. And if the acts of a man are
   not determined by his reason and feelings he is a puppet or a maniac.

   The doctrine that the will acts independently of the previous state of
   the mind supposes that our volitions are isolated atoms, springing up
   from the abyss of the capricious self-determination of the will, from a
   source beyond the control or ken of reason. They are purely casual,
   arbitrary, or capricious. They have no connection with the past, and
   give no promise of the future. On this hypothesis there can be no such
   thing as character. It is, however, a fact of experience universally
   admitted, that there are such things as principles or dispositions
   which control the will. We feel assured that an honest man will act
   honestly, and that a benevolent man will act benevolently. We are
   moreover assured that these principles may be so strong and fixed as to
   render the volitions absolutely certain. "Rational beings," says Reid,
   "in proportion as they are wise and good, will act according to the
   best motives; and every rational being who does otherwise, abuses his
   liberty. The most perfect being, in everything where there is a right
   and a wrong, a better and a worse, always infallibly acts according to
   the best motives. This, indeed, is little else than an identical
   proposition; for it is a contradiction to say, that a perfect being
   does what is wrong or unreasonable. But to say that he does not act
   freely, because he always does what is best, is to say, that the proper
   use of liberty destroys liberty, and that liberty consists only in its
   abuse." [270] That is, the character determines the act; and to say
   that the infallible certainty of acts destroys their freedom is to make
   "liberty destroy liberty." Though Reid and Stewart wrote against
   Leibnitz and Edwards as well as against Hobbes and Belsham, the
   sentences above quoted contain the whole doctrine of the two former
   distinguished men, and of their innumerable predecessors, associates,
   and followers. It is the doctrine that infallible certainty is
   consistent with liberty. This conviction is so wrought into the minds
   of men that they uniformly, unconsciously as well as consciously, act
   upon it. They assume that a man's volitions are determined by motives.
   They take for granted that there is such a thing as character; and
   therefore they endeavour to mould the character of those under their
   influence, assured that if they make the tree good the fruit will be
   good. They do not act on the principle that the acts of men are
   capricious, that the will is self-determined, acting without or against
   motives as well as with them; so that it must always and forever remain
   uncertain how it will decide.

   Argument from the Doctrine of a Sufficient Cause.

   The axiom that every effect must have a cause, or the doctrine of a
   sufficient reason, applies to the internal as well as to the external
   world. It governs the whole sphere of our experience, inward and
   outward. Every volition is an effect, and therefore must have a cause.
   There must have been some sufficient reason why it was so, rather than
   otherwise. That reason was not the mere power of the agent to act; for
   that only accounts for his acting, not for his acting one way rather
   than another. The force of gravity accounts for a stone falling to the
   earth, but not for its falling here instead of there. The power to walk
   accounts for a man's walking, but not for his walking east rather than
   west. Yet we are told even by the most distinguished writers, that the
   efficiency of the agent is all that is required to satisfy the
   instinctive demand which we make for a sufficient reason, in the case
   of our volitions. Reid, as quoted above, asks, "Was there a cause of
   the action? Undoubtedly there was. Of every event there must be a cause
   that had power sufficient to produce it, and that exerted that power
   for the purpose. In the present case, either the man was the cause of
   the action, and then it was a free action, and is justly imputed to
   him; or it must have had another cause, and cannot justly be imputed to
   the man. In this sense, therefore, it is granted that there was a
   sufficient reason for the action; but the question about liberty, is
   not in the least affected by this concession." [271] Again, he asks,
   "Why may not an efficient cause be defined to be a being that had power
   and will to produce the effect? The production of an effect requires
   active power, and active power, being a quality, must be in a being
   endowed with that power. Power without will produces no effect; but,
   where these are conjoined, the effect must be produced." [272] Sir
   William Hamilton's annotation on the former of these passages is, "that
   of a hyper-physical as well as of a physical event, we must, by a
   necessary mental law, always suppose a sufficient reason why it is, and
   is as it is." The efficiency of the agent, therefore, is not a
   sufficient reason for the volition being as it is. It is inconceivable
   that an undetermined cause should act one way rather than another; and
   if it does act thus without a sufficient reason, its action can be
   neither rational nor moral.

   Another common method of answering this argument is to assume that
   because the advocates of certainty say that the will is determined by
   motives, and therefore, that the motives are the cause why the volition
   is as it is, they mean that the efficiency to which the volition is due
   is in the motives, and not in the agent. Thus Stewart says, "The
   question is not concerning the influence of motives, but concerning the
   nature of that influence. The advocates for necessity [certainty]
   represent it as the influence of a cause in producing its effect. The
   advocates for liberty acknowledge that the motive is the occasion for
   acting, or the reason for acting, but contend that it is so far from
   being the efficient cause of it, that it supposes the efficiency to
   reside elsewhere, namely, in the mind of the agent." [273] This
   representation has been sufficiently answered above. Motives are not
   the efficient cause of the volition; that efficiency resides in the
   agent; but what we, "by a necessary mental law," must demand, is a
   sufficient reason why the agent exerts his efficiency in one way rather
   than another. To refer us simply to his efficiency, is to leave the
   demand for a sufficient reason entirely unsatisfied; in other words, it
   is to assume that there may be an effect without a cause; which is
   impossible.

   The doctrine of free agency, therefore, which underlies the Bible,
   which is involved in the consciousness of every rational being, and
   which is assumed and acted on by all men, is at an equal remove, on the
   one hand, from the doctrine of physical or mechanical necessity, which
   precludes the possibility of liberty and responsibility; and, on the
   other, from the doctrine of contingency, which assumes that an act in
   order to be free must be uncertain; or that the will is self
   determined, acting independently of the reason, conscience,
   inclinations and feelings. It teaches that a man is a free and
   responsible agent, because he is author of his own acts, and because he
   is determined to act by nothing out of himself, but by his own views,
   convictions inclinations, feelings, and dispositions, so that his acts
   are the true products of the man, and really represent or reveal what
   he is. The profoundest of modern authors admit that this is the true
   theory of liberty; but some of them, as for example Müller, in his
   elaborate work on "Sin," maintain that in order to render man justly
   responsible for the acts which are thus determined by their internal
   state or character, that state must itself be self-produced. This
   doctrine has already been sufficiently discussed when treating of
   original sin. It may, however, be here remarked, in conclusion of the
   present discussion, that the principle assumed is contrary to the
   common judgment of men. That judgment is that the dispositions and
   feelings which constitute character derive their morality or immorality
   from their nature, and not from their origin. Malignity is evil and
   love is good, whether concreated, innate, acquired, or infused. It may
   be difficult to reconcile the doctrine of innate evil dispositions with
   the justice and goodness of God, but that is a difficulty which does
   not pertain to this subject. A malignant being is an evil being, if
   endowed with reason, whether he was so made or so born. And a
   benevolent rational being is good in the universal judgment of men,
   whether he was so created or so born. We admit that it is repugnant to
   our moral judgments that God should create an evil being; or that any
   being should be born in a state of sin, unless his being so born is the
   consequence of a just judgment. But this has nothing to do with the
   question whether moral dispositions do not owe their character to their
   nature. The common judgment of men is that they do. If a man is really
   humble, benevolent, and holy, he is so regarded, irrespective of all
   inquiry how he became so.

   A second remark on the principle above stated, is, that it is not only
   opposed to the common judgment of men, but that it is also contrary to
   the faith of the whole Christian Church. We trust that this language
   will not be attributed to a self-confident or dogmatic spirit. We
   recognize no higher standard of truth apart from the infallible word of
   God, than the teachings of the Holy Spirit as revealed in the faith of
   the people of God. It is beyond dispute the doctrine of the Church
   universal, that Adam was created holy; that his moral character was not
   self-acquired. It is no less the doctrine of the universal Church, that
   men, since the fall, are born unholy; and it is also included in the
   faith of all Christian Churches. that in regeneration men are made
   holy, not by their own act, but by the act of God. In other words, the
   doctrines of original righteousness, of original sin, and of
   regeneration by the Spirit of God, are, and ever have been the avowed
   doctrines of the Greek, Latin, and Protestant Churches: and if these
   doctrines are, as these Churches all believe, contained in the word of
   God, then it cannot be true that moral character, in order to be the
   object of approbation or disapprobation, must be self-acquired. A man,
   therefore, may be justly accountable for acts which are determined by
   his character, whether that character or inward state be inherited,
   acquired, or induced by the grace of God.

PART III. -- SOTERIOLOGY.

   Under this head are included God s purpose and plan in relation to the
   salvation of men; the person and work of the Redeemer; and the
   application of that work by the Holy Spirit to the actual salvation of
   the people of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I.

  THE PLAN OF SALVATION.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. God has such a Plan.

   The Scriptures speak of an Economy of Redemption; the plan or purpose
   of God in relation to the salvation of men. They call it in reference
   to its full revelation at the time of the advent, the oikonomia tou
   pleromatos ton kairon, "The economy of the fulness of times." It is
   declared to be the plan of God in relation to his gathering into one
   harmonious body, all the objects of redemption, whether in heaven or
   earth, in Christ. Eph. i. 10. It is also called the oikonomia tou
   musteriou, the mysterious purpose or plan which had been hidden for
   ages in God, which it was the great design of the gospel to reveal, and
   which was intended to make known to principalities and powers, by the
   Church, the manifold wisdom of God. Eph. iii. 9.

   A plan supposes: (1.) The selection of some definite end or object to
   be accomplished. (2.) The choice of appropriate means. (3.) At least in
   the case of God, the effectual application and control of those means
   to the accomplishment of the contemplated end.

   As God works on a definite plan in the external world, it is fair to
   infer that the same is true in reference to the moral and spiritual
   world. To the eye of an uneducated man the heavens are a chaos of
   stars. The astronomer sees order and system in this confusion; all
   those bright and distant luminaries have their appointed places and
   fixed orbits; all are so arranged that no one interferes with any
   other, but each is directed according to one comprehensive and
   magnificent conception. The innumerable forms of vegetable life, are
   not a confused mass, but to the eye of science arrange themselves into
   regular classes, orders, genera, and species, exhibiting a unity of
   design pervading the whole. The zoologist sees in the hundreds of
   thousands of animals which inhabit our globe, four, and only four
   original typical forms, of which all the others are the development in
   an ascending order, no one ever passing into the other, but all
   presenting one great comprehensive system carried out in all its
   details. At the head of these innumerable lower forms of animal life,
   stands man, endowed with powers which elevate him above the class of
   mere animals and bring him into fellowship with angels and with God
   himself. As in all these lower departments of his works, God acts
   according to a preconceived plan, it is not to be supposed that in the
   higher sphere of his operations, which concerns the destiny of men,
   everything is left to chance and allowed to take its undirected course
   to an undetermined end. We accordingly find that the Scriptures
   distinctly assert in reference to the dispensations of grace not only
   that God sees the end from the beginning, but that He works all things
   according to the counsel of his own will, or, according to his eternal
   purpose.

   The Importance of a Knowledge of this Plan.

   If there be such a plan concerning the redemption of man, it is
   obviously of the greatest importance that it should be known and
   correctly apprehended. If in looking at a complicated machine we are
   ignorant of the object it is designed to accomplish, or of the relation
   of its several parts, we must be unable to understand or usefully to
   apply it. In like manner if we are ignorant of the great end aimed at
   in the scheme of redemption, or of the relation of the several parts of
   that scheme; or if we misconceive that end and that relation, all our
   views must be confused or erroneous. We shall be unable either to
   exhibit it to others or to apply it to ourselves. If the end of
   redemption as well as of creation and of providence, is the production
   of the greatest amount of happiness, then Christianity is one thing; if
   the end be the glory of God, then Christianity is another thing. The
   whole character of our theology and religion depends on the answer to
   that question. In like manner, if the special and proximate design of
   redemption is to render certain the salvation of the people of God,
   then the whole Augustinian system follows by a logical necessity; if
   its design is simply to render the salvation of all men possible, the
   opposite system must be received as true. The order of the divine
   decrees, or in other words, the relation in which the several parts of
   the divine plan stand to each other, is therefore very far from being a
   matter of idle speculation. It must determine our theology, and our
   theology determines our religion.

   How the Plan of God can be known.

   If there be such a preconceived divine scheme relating to the salvation
   of men; and if the proper comprehension of that scheme be thus
   important, the next question is, How can it be ascertained? The first
   answer to this question is that in every system of facts which are
   really related to each other, the relation is revealed in the nature of
   the facts. The astronomer, the geologist, and the zoologist very soon
   discover that the facts of their several sciences stand in a certain
   relation to each other, and admit of no other. If the relation be not
   admitted the facts themselves must be denied or distorted. The only
   source of mistake is either an incomplete induction of the facts, or
   failing to allow them their due relative importance. One system of
   astronomy has given place to another, only because the earlier
   astronomers were not acquainted with facts which their successors
   discovered. The science has at last attained a state which commands the
   assent of all competent minds, and which cannot be hereafter seriously
   modified. The same, to a greater or less extent, is true in all
   departments of natural science. It must be no less true in theology.
   What the facts of nature are to the naturalist, the facts of the Bible
   and of our moral and religious consciousness, are to the theologian.
   If, for example, the Bible and experience teach the fact of the entire
   inability of fallen men to anything spiritually good, that fact
   stubbornly refuses to harmonize with any system which denies
   efficacious grace or sovereign election. It of itself determines the
   relation in which the eternal purpose of God stands to the salvation of
   the individual sinner. So of all other great Scriptural facts. They
   arrange themselves in a certain order by an inward law, just as
   certainly and as clearly as the particles of matter in the process of
   crystallization, or in the organic unity of the body of an animal. It
   is true here as in natural science, that it is only by an imperfect
   induction of facts, or by denying or perverting them, that their
   relative position in the scheme of salvation can be a matter of doubt
   or of diversity of opinion. But secondly, we have in theology a guide
   which the man of science does not possess. We have in the Scriptures
   not only the revelation of the grand design of God in all his works of
   creation, providence, and redemption, which is declared to be his own
   glory, but we have, in many cases, the relation which one part of this
   scheme bears to other parts expressly stated. Thus, for example, it is
   said, that Christ died in order that He might save his people from
   their sins. We are elected to holiness. Therefore election precedes
   sanctification. We are chosen to be made holy, and not because we are
   holy. These revelations concerning the relation of the subordinate
   parts of the scheme of redemption, of necessity determine the nature of
   the whole plan. This will become plain from what follows.

   As men differ in their understanding of the facts of Scripture, and as
   some are more careful than others to gather all the facts which are to
   be considered, or more faithful in submitting to their authority, so
   they differ in their views of the plan which God has devised for the
   salvation of men. The more important of the views which have been
   adopted on this subject are, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Supralapsarianism.

   First, the supralapsarian scheme. According to this view, God in order
   to manifest his grace and justice selected from creatable men (i.e.,
   from men to be created) a certain number to be vessels of mercy, and
   certain others to be vessels of wrath. In the order of thought,
   election and reprobation precede the purpose to create and to permit
   the fall. Creation is in order to redemption. God creates some to be
   saved, and others to be lost.

   This scheme is called supralapsarian because it supposes that men as
   unfallen, or before the fall, are the objects of election to eternal
   life, and foreordination to eternal death. This view was introduced
   among a certain class of Augustinians even before the Reformation, but
   has not been generally received. Augustine himself, and after him the
   great body of those who adopt his system of doctrine, were, and are,
   infralapsarians. That is, they hold that it is from the mass of fallen
   men that some were elected to eternal life, and some for the just
   punishment of their sins, foreordained to eternal death. The position
   of Calvin himself as to this point has been disputed. As it was not in
   his day a special matter of discussion, certain passages may be quoted
   from his writings which favour the supralapsarian and other passages
   which favour the infralapsarian view. In the "Consensus Genevensis,"
   written by him, there is an explicit assertion of the infralapsarian
   doctrine After saying that there was little benefit in speculating on
   the foreordination of the fall of man, he adds, "Quod ex damnata Adæ
   sobole Deus quos visum est eligit, quos vult reprobat, sicuti ad fidem
   exercendam longe aptior est, ita majore fructu tractatur." [274]

   In the "Formula Consensus Helvetica," drawn up as the testimony of the
   Swiss churches in 1675, whose principal authors were Heidegger and
   Turrettin, there is a formal repudiation of the supralapsarian view. In
   the Synod of Dort, which embraced delegates from all the Reformed
   churches on the Continent and in Great Britain, a large majority of the
   members were infralapsarians, Gomarus and Voetius being the prominent
   advocates of the opposite view. The canons of that synod, while
   avoiding any extreme statements, were so framed as to give a symbolical
   authority to the infralapsarian doctrine. They say: [275] "Cum omnes
   homines in Adamo peccaverint et rei sint facti maledictionis et mortis
   æteternæ, Deus nemini fecisset injuriam, si universum genus humanum in
   peccato et maledictione relinquere, ac propter peccatum damnare
   voluisset." The same remark applies to the Westminster Assembly. Twiss,
   the Prolocutor of that venerable body, was a zealous supralapsarian;
   the great majority of its members, however, were on the other side. The
   symbols of that Assembly, while they clearly imply the infralapsarian
   view, were yet so framed as to avoid offence to those who adopted the
   supralapsarian theory. In the "Westminster Confession," [276] it is
   said that God appointed the elect unto eternal life, and "the rest of
   mankind, God was pleased, according to the unsearchable counsel of his
   own will, whereby He extendeth or withholdeth mercy as He pleaseth, for
   the glory of his sovereign power over his creatures, to pass by, and to
   ordain them to dishonour and wrath for their sin, to the praise of his
   glorious justice." It is here taught that those whom God passes by are
   "the rest of mankind;" not the rest of ideal or possible men, but the
   rest of those human beings who constitute mankind, or the human race.
   In the second place, the passage quoted teaches that the non-elect are
   passed by and ordained to wrath "for their sin." This implies that they
   were contemplated as sinful before this foreordination to judgment. The
   infralapsarian view is still more obviously assumed in the answers to
   the 19th and 20th questions in the "Shorter Catechism." It is there
   taught that all mankind by the fall lost communion with God, and are
   under his wrath and curse, and that God out of his mere good pleasure
   elected some (some of those under his wrath and curse), unto
   everlasting life. Such has been the doctrine of the great body of
   Augustinians from the time of Augustine to the present day.

   Objections to Supralapsarianism.

   The most obvious objections to the supralapsarian theory are, (1.) That
   it seems to involve a contradiction. Of a Non Ens, as Turrettin says,
   nothing can be determined. The purpose to save or condemn, of necessity
   must, in the order of thought, follow the purpose to create. The latter
   is presupposed in the former, (2.) It is a clearly revealed Scriptural
   principle that where there is no sin there is no condemnation.
   Therefore there can be no foreordination to death which does not
   contemplate its objects as already sinful. (3.) It seems plain from the
   whole argument of the Apostle in Rom. ix. 9-21, that the "mass" out of
   which some are chosen and others left, is the mass of fallen men. The
   design of the sacred writer is to vindicate the sovereignty of God in
   the dispensation of his grace. He has mercy upon one and not on
   another, according to his own good pleasure, because all are equally
   unworthy and guilty. The vindication is drawn, not only from the
   relation of God to his creatures as their Creator, but also from his
   relation to them as a sovereign whose laws they have violated. This
   representation pervades the whole Scriptures. Believers are said to be
   chosen "out of the world;" that is, out of the mass of fallen men. And
   everywhere, as in Rom. i. 24, 26, 28, reprobation is declared to be
   judicial, founded upon the sinfulness of its objects. Otherwise it
   could not be a manifestation of the justice of God. (4.) Creation is
   never in the Bible represented as a means of executing the purpose of
   election and reprobation. This, as just remarked, cannot be so. The
   objects of election are definite individuals, as in this controversy is
   admitted. But the only thing which distinguishes between merely
   possible or "creatable" men and definite individuals, certain to be
   created and saved or lost, is the divine purpose that they shall be
   created. So that the purpose to create of necessity, in the order of
   nature, precedes the purpose to redeem. Accordingly, in Rom. viii 29,
   30, prognosis is declared to precede proorismos. "Whom he did foreknow
   he also did predestinate." But foreknowledge implies the certain
   existence of its objects; and certainty of existence supposes on the
   part of God the purpose to create. Nothing is or is to be but in virtue
   of the decree of Him who foreordains whatever comes to pass. All
   futurition, therefore, depends on foreordination; and foreknowledge
   supposes futurition. We have, therefore, the express authority of the
   Apostle for saying that foreknowledge, founded on the purpose to
   create, precedes predestination. And, therefore, creation is not a
   means to execute the purpose of predestination, for the end must
   precede the means; and, according to Paul, the purpose to create
   precedes the purpose to redeem, and therefore cannot be a means to that
   end. Our Lord, we are told, was delivered to death "by the determinate
   counsel and foreknowledge of God." But his death, of necessity,
   supposed his incarnation, and therefore in the order of thought, or in
   the plan of God, the purpose to prepare Him a body preceded the purpose
   to deliver Him to the death of the cross. The only passage of the Bible
   which appears to teach explicitly that creation is a means for the
   execution of the purpose of predestination is Eph. iii. 9, 10. There,
   according to some it is said that God created all things in order that
   (hina) his manifold wisdom might be known through the Church. If this
   be the relation between the several clauses of these verses the Apostle
   does teach that the universe was created in order that through redeemed
   men (the Church) the glory of God should be revealed to all rational
   creatures. In this sense and in this case creation is declared to be a
   means to redemption; and therefore the purpose to redeem must precede
   the purpose to create. Such, however, is not the logical connection of
   the clauses in this passage. Paul does not say that God created all
   things in order that. He is not speaking of the design of creation, but
   of the design of the gospel and of his own call to the apostleship. To
   me, he says, is this grace given that I should preach among the
   Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to enlighten all men in
   the knowledge of the mystery (of redemption, i.e., the gospel) in order
   that by the Church should be made known the manifold wisdom of God.
   Such is the natural connection of the passage, and such is the
   interpretation adopted by modern commentators entirely irrespective of
   the bearing of the passage on the supralapsarian controversy. (5.) It
   is a further objection to the supralapsarian scheme that it is not
   consistent with the Scriptural exhibition of the character of God. He
   is declared to be a God of mercy and justice. But it is not compatible
   with these divine attributes that men should be foreordained to misery
   and eternal death as innocent, that is, before they had apostatized
   from God. If passed by and foreordained to death for their sins, it
   must be that in predestination they are contemplated as guilty and
   fallen creatures.

   § 3. Infralapsarianism.

   According to the infralapsarian doctrine, God, with the design to
   reveal his own glory, that is, the perfections of his own nature,
   determined to create the world, secondly, to permit the fall of man;
   thirdly, to elect from the mass of fallen men a multitude whom no man
   could number as "vessels of mercy;" fourthly, to send his Son for their
   redemption; and, fifthly, to leave the residue of mankind, as He left
   the fallen angels, to suffer the just punishment of their sins.

   The arguments in favour of this view of the divine plan have already
   been presented in the form of objections to the supralapsarian theory.
   It may, however, be further remarked, --

   1. That this view is self-consistent and harmonious. As all the decrees
   of God are one comprehensive purpose, no view of the relation of the
   details embraced in that purpose which does not admit of their being
   reduced to unity can be admitted. In every great mechanism, whatever
   the number or complexity of its parts, there must be unity of design.
   Every part bears a given relation to every other part, and the
   perception of that relation is necessary to a proper understanding of
   the whole. Again, as the decrees of God are eternal and immutable, no
   view of his plan of operation which supposes Him to purpose first one
   thing and then another can ho consistent with their nature. And as God
   is absolutely sovereign and independent, all his purposes must be
   determined from within or according to the counsel of his own will.
   They cannot be sup.. posed to he contingent or suspended on the action
   of his creatures, or upon anything out of Himself. The infralapsarian
   scheme, as held by most Augustinians, fulfils all these conditions. All
   the particulars form one comprehensive whole. All follow in an order
   which supposes no change of purpose; and all depend on the infinitely
   wise, holy, and righteous will of God. The final end is the glory of
   God. For that end He creates the world, allows the fall; from among
   fallen men He elects some to everlasting life, and leaves the rest to
   the just recompense of their sins. Whom He elects He calls, justifies,
   and glorifies. This is the golden chain the links of which cannot be
   separated or transposed. This is the form in which the scheme of
   redemption lay in the Apostle's mind as he teaches us in Rom. viii. 29,
   30.

   Different Meanings assigned the Word Predestination.

   2. There is an ambiguity in the word predestination. It may be used,
   first, in the general sense of foreordination. In this sense it has
   equal reference to all events; for God foreordains whatever comes to
   pass. Secondly, it may refer to the general purpose of redemption
   without reference to particular individuals. God predetermined to
   reveal his attributes in redeeming sinners, as He predetermined to
   create the heavens and the earth to manifest his power, wisdom, and
   benevolence. Thirdly, it is used in theology generally to express the
   purpose of God in relation to the salvation of individual men. It
   includes the selection of one portion of the race to be saved, and the
   leaving the rest to perish in sin. It is in this sense used by
   supralapsarians, who teach that God selected a certain number of
   individual men to be created in order to salvation, and a certain
   number to be created to be vessels of wrath. It is in this way they
   subordinate creation to predestination as a means to an end. It is to
   this that infralapsarians object as inconceivable, repugnant to the
   nature of God, and unscriptural. Taking the word predestination,
   however, in the second of the senses above mentioned, it may be
   admitted that it precedes in the order of thought the purpose to
   create. This view is perfectly consistent with the doctrine which makes
   man as created and fallen the object of predestination in the third and
   commonly received meaning of the word. The Apostle teaches in Col. i.
   16, that all things visible and invisible were created by and for Him
   who is the image of the invisible God, who is before all things, by
   whom all things consist, and who is the head of the body, the Church.
   The end of creation, therefore, is not merely the glory of God, but the
   special manifestation of that glory in the person and work of Christ.
   As He is the Alpha, so also is He the Omega; the beginning and the end.
   Having this great end in view, the revelation of Himself in the person
   and work of his Son, He purposed to create, to permit the fall, to
   elect some to be the subjects of his grace and to leave others in their
   sin. This view, as it seems, agrees with the representations of the
   Scriptures, and avoids the difficulties connected with the strict
   supralapsarian doctrine. It is to be borne in mind that the object of
   these speculations is not to pry into the operation of the divine mind,
   but simply to ascertain and exhibit the relation in which the several
   truths revealed in Scripture concerning the plan of redemption bear to
   each other.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. Hypothetical Redemption.

   According to the common doctrine of Augustinians, as expressed an the
   Westminster Catechism, "God, having . . . . elected some to everlasting
   life, did enter into a covenant of grace, to deliver them out of the
   estate of sin and misery, and to bring them into an estate of salvation
   by a Redeemer." In opposition to this view some of the Reformed
   theologians of the seventeenth century introduced the scheme which is
   known in the history of theology as the doctrine of hypothetical
   redemption. The principal advocate of this doctrine was Amyraut (died
   1664), Professor in the French Protestant Seminary at Saumur. He
   taught, (1.) That the motive impelling God to redeem men was
   benevolence, or love to men in general. (2.) From this motive He sent
   His Son to make the salvation of all men possible. (3.) God, in virtue
   of a decretum universale hypotheticum, offers salvation to all men if
   they believe in Christ. (4.) All men have a natural ability to repent
   and believe. (5.) But as this natural ability was counteracted by a
   moral inability, God determined to give his efficacious grace to a
   certain number of the human race, and thus to secure their salvation.

   This scheme is sometimes designated as "universalismus hypotheticus."
   It was designed to take a middle ground between Augustinianism and
   Arminianism. It is liable to the objections which press on both
   systems. It does not remove the peculiar difficulties of
   Augustinianism, as it asserts the sovereignty of God in election.
   Besides, it leaves the case of the heathen out of view. They, having no
   knowledge of Christ, could not avail themselves of this decretum
   hypotheticum, and therefore must be considered as passed over by a
   decretum absolutum. It was against this doctrine of Amyraut and other
   departures from the standards of the Reformed Church that, in 1675, the
   "Formula Consensus Helvetica" was adopted by the churches of
   Switzerland. This theory of the French theologians soon passed away as
   far as the Reformed churches in Europe were concerned. Its advocates
   either returned to the old doctrine, or passed on to the more advanced
   system of the Arminians. In this country it has been revived and
   extensively adopted.

   At first view it might seem a small matter whether we say that election
   precedes redemption or that redemption precedes election. In fact,
   however, it is a question of great importance. The relation of the
   truths of the Bible is determined by their nature. If you change their
   relation you must change their nature. If you regard the sun as a
   planet instead of as the centre of our system you must believe it to be
   something very different in its constitution from what it actually is.
   So in a scheme of thought, if you make the final cause a means, or a
   means the final cause, nothing but confusion can be the result. As the
   relation of election to redemption depends on the nature of redemption
   the full consideration of this question must be reserved until the work
   of Christ has been considered. For the present it is sufficient to say
   that the scheme proposed by the French theologians is liable to the
   following objections.

   Arguments against this Scheme.

   1. It supposes mutability in the divine purposes; or that the purpose
   of God may fail of accomplishment. According to this scheme, God, out
   of benevolence or philanthropy, purposed the salvation of all men, and
   sent his Son for their redemption. But seeing that such purpose could
   not be carried out, He determined by his efficacious grace to secure
   the salvation of a certain portion of the human race. This difficulty
   the scheme involves, however it may be stated. It cannot however be
   supposed that God intends what is never accomplished; that He purposes
   what He does not intend to effect; that He adopts means for an end
   which is never to be attained. This cannot be affirmed of any rational
   being who has the wisdom and power to secure the execution of his
   purposes. Much less can it be said of Him whose power and wisdom are
   infinite. If all men are not saved, God never purposed their salvation,
   and never devised and put into operation means designed to accomplish
   that end. We must assume that the result is the interpretation of the
   purposes of God. If He foreordains whatsoever comes to pass, then
   events correspond to his purposes; and it is against reason and
   Scripture to suppose that there is any contradiction or want of
   correspondence between what He intended and what actually occurs. The
   theory, therefore, which assumes that God purposed the salvation of all
   men, and sent his Son to die as a means to accomplish that end, and
   then seeing, or foreseeing that such end could not or would not be
   attained, elected a part of the race to be the subjects of efficacious
   grace, cannot be admitted as Scriptural.

   2. The Bible clearly teaches that the work of Christ is certainly
   efficacious. It renders certain the attainment of the end it was
   designed to accomplish. It was intended to save his people, and not
   merely to make the salvation of all men possible. It was a real
   satisfaction to justice, and therefore necessarily frees from
   condemnation. It was a ransom paid and accepted, and therefore
   certainly redeems. If, therefore, equally designed for all men, it must
   secure the salvation of all. If designed specially for the elect, it
   renders their salvation certain, and therefore election precedes
   redemption. God, as the Westminster Catechism teaches, having elected
   some to eternal life, sent his Son to redeem them.

   3. The Scriptures further teach that the gift of Christ secures the
   gift of all other saving blessings. "He that spared not his own Son,
   but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely
   give us all things?" (Rom. vii 32.) Hence they are certainly saved for
   whom God delivered up his Son. The elect only are saved, and therefore
   He was delivered up specially for them, and consequently election must
   precede redemption. The relation, therefore, of redemption to election
   is as clearly determined by the nature of redemption as the relation of
   the sun to the planets is determined by the nature of the sun.

   4. The Bible in numerous passages directly asserts that Christ came to
   redeem his people; to save them from their sins; and to bring them to
   God. He gave Himself for his Church; He laid down his life for his
   sheep. As the end precedes the means, if God sent his Son to save his
   people, if Christ gave Himself for his Church, then his people were
   selected and present to the divine mind, in the order of thought, prior
   to the gift of Christ.

   5. If, as Paul teaches (Rom. viii. 29, 30), foreknowledge precedes
   predestination, and if the mission of Christ is the means of
   accomplishing the end of predestination, then of necessity
   predestination to eternal life precedes the gift of Christ. Having, as
   we are taught in Eph. i. 4, 5, predestinated us to the adoption of
   sons, God chose us before the foundation of the world, and sent his Son
   to be the propitiation for our sins. This is the order of the divine
   purposes, or the mutual relation of the truths of redemption as
   presented in the Scriptures.

   6. The motive (so to speak) of God in sending his Son is not, as this
   theory assumes, general benevolence or that love of which all men are
   equally the objects, but that peculiar, mysterious, infinite love in
   which God, in giving his Son, gives Himself and all conceivable and
   possible good. All these points, however, as before remarked, ask for
   further consideration when we come to treat of the nature and design of
   Christ's work.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 5. The Lutheran Doctrine as to the Plan of Salvation.

   It is not easy to give the Lutheran doctrine on this subject, because
   it is stated in one way in the early symbolical books of that Church,
   and in a somewhat different way in the "Form of Concord," and in the
   writings of the standard Lutheran theologians. Luther himself taught
   the strict Augustinian doctrine, as did also Melancthon in the first
   edition of his "Loci Communes." In the later editions of that work
   Melancthon taught that men coöperate with the grace of God in
   conversion, and that the reason why one man is regenerated and another
   not is to be found in that coöperation. This gave rise to the
   protracted and vehement synergistic controversy, which for a long time
   seriously disturbed the peace of the Lutheran Church. This controversy
   was for a time authoritatively settled by the "Form of Concord," which
   was adopted and enjoined as a standard of orthodoxy by the Lutherans.
   In this document both the doctrine of coöperation and that of absolute
   predestination were rejected. It taught the entire inability of the
   natural man for anything spiritually good; and therefore denied that he
   could either prepare himself for regeneration or coöperate with the
   grace of God in that work. It refers the regeneration of the sinner
   exclusively to the supernatural agency of the Holy Spirit. It is the
   work of God, and in no sense or degree the work of man. But it teaches
   that the grace of God may be effectually resisted, and that the reason
   why all who hear the gospel are not saved is that some do thus resist
   the influence which is brought to bear upon them, and others do not.
   While, therefore, regeneration is exclusively the work of the Spirit,
   the failure of salvation is to be referred to the voluntary resistance
   of offered grace. As this system was illogical and contrary to the
   clear declarations of Scripture, it did not long maintain its ground.
   Non-resistance to the grace of God, passively yielding to its power, is
   something good. It is something by which one class is favourably
   distinguished from another; and therefore the reason why they, rather
   than others, are saved, is to be referred to themselves and not to God,
   who gives the same grace to all. The later Lutheran theologians,
   therefore, have abandoned the ground of the "Form of Concord," and
   teach that the objects of election are those whom God foresaw would
   believe and persevere in faith unto the end.

   According to this scheme, God, (1.) From general benevolence or love to
   the fallen race of man, wills their salvation by a sincere purpose and
   intention. "Benevolentia Dei universalis," says Hollaz, "non est inane
   votum, non sterilis velleitas, non otiosa complacentia, qua quis rem,
   quæ sibi placet, et quam in se amat, non cupit efficere aut consequi
   adeoque mediis ad hunc finem ducentibus non vult uti; sed est voluntas
   efficax, qua Deus salutem hominum, ardentissime amatam, etiam efficere
   atque per media sufficientia et efficacia consequi serio intendit."
   [277] (2.) Te give effect to this general purpose of benevolence and
   mercy towards men indiscriminately, God determined to send his Son to
   make a full satisfaction for their sins. (3.) To this follows (in the
   order of thought) the purpose to give to all men the means of salvation
   and the power to avail themselves of the offered mercy. This is
   described as a "destinatio mediorum, quibus tum æterna salus
   satisfactione Christi parta, turn vires credendi omnibus hominibus
   offeruntur, ut satisfactionem Christi ad salutem acceptare et sibi
   applicare queant." [278] (4.) Besides this, voluntas generalis (as
   relating to all men) and antecedens, as going before any contemplated
   action of men, there is a voluntas specialis, as relating to certain
   individual men, and consequens, as following the foresight of their
   action. This voluntas specialis is defined as that "quæ peccatores
   oblata salutis media amplectentes æterna salute donare constituit."
   [279] So Hutter [280] says, "Quia (Deus) prævidit ac præscivit maximam
   mundi partem mediis salutis locum minime relicturam ac proinde in
   Christum non credituram, ideo Deus de illis tantum salvandis fecit
   decretum, quos actu in Christum credituros prævidit." Hollaz expresses
   the same view: [281] "Electio hominum, peccato corruptorum, ad vitam
   æternam a Deo misericordissimo facta est intuitu fidei in Christum ad
   finem usque vitæ perseverantis." Again: "Simpliciter quippe et
   categorice decrevit Deus hunc, ilium, istum hominem salvare, quia
   perseverantem ipsius in Christum fidem certo prævidit." [282]

   The Lutheran doctrine, therefore, answers the question, Why one man is
   saved and another not? by saying, Because the one believes and the
   other does not. The question, Why God elects some and not others, and
   predestinates them to eternal life? is answered by saying, Because He
   foresees that some will believe unto the end, and others will not. If
   asked, Why one believes and another not? the answer is, Not that one
   coöperates with the grace of God and the other does not; but that some
   resist and reject the grace offered to all, and others do not. The
   difficulty arising from the Lutheran doctrine of the entire corruption
   of our fallen nature, and the entire inability of the sinner to do
   anything spiritually good, is met by saying, that the sinner has power
   to use the means of grace, he can hear the word and receive the
   sacraments, and as these means of grace are imbued with a divine
   supernatural power1 they produce a saving effect upon all who do not
   voluntarily and persistently resist their influence. Baptism, in the
   case of infants, is attended by the regeneration of the soul; and
   therefore all who are baptized in infancy have a principle of grace
   implanted in them, which, if cherished, or, if not voluntarily
   quenched, secures their salvation. Predestination in the Lutheran
   system is confined to the elect. God predestinates those who He
   foresees will persevere in faith unto salvation. There is no
   predestination of unbelievers unto death.

   § 6. The Remonstrant Doctrine.

   In the early part of the seventeenth century Arminius introduced a new
   system of doctrine in the Reformed churches of Holland, which was
   formally condemned by the Synod of Dort which sat from November 1618 to
   May 1619. Against the decisions of that Synod the advocates of the new
   doctrine presented a Remonstrance, and hence they were at first called
   Remonstrants, but in after years their more common designation has been
   Arminians. Arminianism is a much lower form of doctrine than
   Lutheranism. In all the points included under Anthropology and
   Soteriology it is a much more serious departure from the system of
   Augustinianism which in all ages has been the life of the church. The
   Arminians taught, --

   1. That all men derive from Adam a corrupt nature by which they are
   inclined to sin. But they deny that this corruption is of the nature of
   sin. Men are responsible only for their own voluntary acts and the
   consequences of such acts. "Peccatum originale nec habent
   (Remonstrantes) pro peccato proprie dicto . . . . nec pro malo, quod
   per modum proprie dictæ poenæ ab Adamo in posteros dimanet, sed pro
   malo infirmitate." [283] Limborch [284] says, "Atqui illa physica est
   impuritas (namely, the deterioration of our nature derived from Adam),
   non moralis: et tantum abest ut sit vere ac proprie dictum peccatum."

   2. They deny that man by his fall has lost his ability to good. Such
   ability, or liberty as they call it, is essential to our nature, and
   cannot be lost without the loss of humanity. "Innatam arbitrii humani
   libertatem (i.e., ability) olim semel in creatione datam, nunquam
   . . . . tollit (Deus)." [285]

   3. This ability, however, is not of itself sufficient to secure the
   return of the soul to God. Men need the preventing, exciting, and
   assisting grace of God in order to their conversion and holy living.
   "Gratiam Dei statuimus esse principium, progressum et complementum
   omnis boni: adeo ut ne ipse quidem regenitus absque præcedente ista,
   sive præveniente, excitante, prosequente et coöperante gratia, bonum
   ullum salutare cogitare, velle, aut peragere possit." [286]

   4. This divine grace is afforded to all men in sufficient measure to
   enable them to repent, believe, and keep all the commandments of God.
   "Gratia efficax vocatur ex eventu. Ut statuatur gratia habere ex se
   sufficientem vim, ad producendum consensum in voluntate, sed quia vis
   illa partialis est, non posse exire in actum sive effectum sortiri sine
   coöperatione liberæ voluntatis humanæ, ac proinde ut effectum habeat,
   . . . . pendere a libera voluntate." [287] This grace, says Limborch,
   "incitat, exstimulat, adjuvat et cerroborat, quantum satis est, ut homo
   reipsa Deo obediat et ad fineni in obedientia perseveret." And again:
   [288] "Sufficiens vocatio, quando per coöperationem liberi arbitrii
   sortitur suum effectum, vocatur efficax."

   5. Those who of their own free will, and in the exercise of that
   ability which belongs to them since the fall, coöperate with this
   divine grace, are converted and saved. "Etsi vero maxima est gratiæ
   disparitas, pro liberrima scilicet voluntatis divinæ dispensatione
   tamen Spiritus Sanctus omnibus et singulis, quibus verbum fidei
   ordinarie prædicatur, tantum gratiæ confert, aut saltem conferre
   paratus est, quantum ad fidem ingenerandum, et ad promovendum suis
   gradibus salutarem ipsorum conversionem sufficit." [289] The Apology
   for the Remonstrance, and especially the Remonstrant Theologians, as
   Episcopius and Limborch, go farther than this. Instead of limiting this
   sufficient grace to those who hear the gospel, they extend it to all
   mankind.

   6. Those who thus believe are predestinated to eternal life, not
   however as individuals, but as a class. The decree of election does not
   concern persons, it is simply the purpose of God to save believers.
   "Decretum vocant Remonstrantes decretum prædestinationis ad salutem,
   quia eo decernitur, qua ratione et conditione Deus peccatores saluti
   destinet. Enunciatur autem hoc decretum Dei hac formula: Deus decrevit
   salvare credentes, non quasi credentes quidam re ipsa jam sint, qui
   objiciantur Deo salvare volenti, sive prædestinanti; nihil minus; sed,
   ut quid in iis, circa quos Deus prædestinans versatur, requiratur, ista
   enunciatione clare significetur. Tantundem enim valet atqui si diceres,
   Deus decrevit homines salvare sub conditione fidei. . . . . Etiamsi
   hujusmodi prædestinatio non sit prædestinatio certarum personarum, est
   tamen omnium hominum prædestinatio, si modo credant et in virtute
   prædestinatio certarum personarum, quæ et quando credunt." [290]

   § 7. Wesleyan Arminianism.

   The Arminian system received such modifications in the hands of Wesley
   and his associates and followers, that they give it the designation of
   Evangelical Arminianism, and claim for it originality and completeness.
   It differs from the system of the Remonstrants, --

   1. In admitting that man since the fall is in a state of absolute or
   entire pollution and depravity. Original sin is not a mere physical
   deterioration of our nature, but entire moral depravity.

   2. In denying that men in this state of nature have any power to
   coöperate with the grace of God. The advocates of this system regard
   this doctrine of natural ability, or the ability of the natural man to
   coöperate with the grace of God as Semi-pelagian, and the doctrine that
   men have the power by nature perfectly to keep the commandments of God,
   as pure Pelagianism. [291]

   3. In asserting that the guilt brought upon all men by the sin of Adam
   is removed by the justification which has come upon all men by the
   righteousness of Christ.

   4. That the ability of man even to coöperate with the Spirit of God, is
   due not to anything belonging to his natural state as fallen, but to
   the universal influence of the redemption of Christ. Every infant,
   therefore, comes into the world free from condemnation on the ground of
   the righteousness of Christ and with a seed of divine grace, or a
   principle of a new life implanted in his heart. "That by the offence of
   one," says Wesley, [292] "judgment came upon all men (all born into the
   world) unto condemnation, is an undoubted truth, and affects every
   infant, as well as every adult person. But it is equally true, that by
   the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men (all born
   into the world -- infants and adults) unto justification." And
   Fletcher, [293] says, "As Adam brought a general condemnation and a
   universal seed of death upon all infants, so Christ brings upon them a
   general justification and a universal seed of life." "Every human
   being," says Warren, "has a measure of grace (unless he has cast it
   away), and those who faithfully use this gracious gift, will be
   accepted of God in the day of judgment, whether Jew or Greek, Christian
   or Heathen. In virtue of the mediation of Jesus Christ, between God and
   our fallen race, all men since the promise Gen. iii. 15, are under an
   economy of grace, and the only difference between them as subjects of
   the moral government of God, is that while all have grace and light
   enough to attain salvation, some, over and above this, have more and
   others less." [294] Wesley says, "No man living is without some
   preventing grace, and every degree of grace is a degree of life. And in
   another place, "I assert that there is a measure of free will
   supernaturally restored to every man, together with that supernatural
   light which enlightens every man that cometh into the world." [295]

   According to this view of the plan of God, he decreed or purposed, (1.)
   To permit the fall of man. (2.) To send his Son to make a full
   satisfaction for the sins of the whole world. (3.) On the ground of
   that satisfaction to remit the guilt of Adam's first transgression and
   of original sin, and to impart such a measure of grace and light to all
   and every man as to enable all to attain eternal life. (4.) Those who
   duly improve that grace, and persevere to the end, are ordained to be
   saved; God purposes from eternity, to save those who He foresees will
   thus persevere in faith and holy living.

   It is plain that the main point of difference between the later
   Lutheran, the Arminian, and the Wesleyan schemes, and that of
   Augustinians is, that according to the latter, God, and according to
   the former, man, determines who are to be saved. Augustine taught that
   out of the fallen family of men, all of whom might have been justly
   left to perish in their apostasy, God, out of his mere good mercy,
   elected some to everlasting life, sent his Son for their redemption,
   and gives to them the Holy Spirit to secure their repentance, faith,
   and holy living unto the end. "Cur autem non omnibus detur [donum
   fidei], fidelem movere non debet, qui credit ex uno omnes isse in
   condemnationem, sine dubio justissimam: ita ut nulla Dei esset justa
   reprehensio, etiamsi nullus inde liberaretur. Unde constat, magnam esse
   gratiam, quod plurimi liberantur." [296] It is God, therefore, and not
   man, who determines who are to be saved. Although this may be said to
   be the turning point between these great systems, which have divided
   the Church in all ages, yet that point of necessity involves all the
   other matters of difference; namely, the nature of original sin; the
   motive of God in providing redemption; the nature and design of the
   work of Christ and the nature of divine grace, or the work of the Holy
   Spirit. Thus, in a great measure, the whole system of theology, and of
   necessity the character of our religion, depend upon the views taken of
   this particular question. It is, therefore, a question of the highest
   practical importance, and not a matter of idle speculation.

   § 8. The Augustinian Scheme.

   Preliminary Remarks.

   It is to be remembered that the question is not which view of the plan
   of God is the freest from difficulties, the most agreeable to our
   natural feelings, and therefore the most plausible to the human mind.
   It may be admitted that it would appear to us more consistent with the
   character of God that provision should be made for the salvation of all
   men, and that sufficient knowledge and grace should be granted to every
   human being to secure his salvation. So it would be more consistent
   with the natural understanding and feelings, if like provision had been
   made for the fallen angels; or if God had prevented the entrance of sin
   and misery into the universe; or if, when they had entered, He had
   provided for their ultimate elimination from the system, so that all
   rational creatures should be perfectly holy and happy for eternity.
   There would be no end to such plans if each one were at liberty to
   construct a scheme of divine operation according to his own views of
   what would be wisest and best. We are shut up to facts: the facts of
   providence, of the Bible, and of religious experience. These facts must
   determine our theory. We cannot say that the goodness of God forbids
   the permission of sin and misery, if sin and misery actually exist. We
   cannot say that justice requires that all rational creatures should be
   treated alike, have the same advantages, and the same opportunity to
   secure knowledge, holiness, and happiness, if, under the government of
   a God of infinite justice, the greatest disparity actually exists.
   Among all Christians certain principles are admitted, according to
   which the facts of history and of the Scriptures must be interpreted.

   1. It is admitted that God reigns; that his providence extends to all
   events great and small, so that nothing does or can occur contrary to
   his will, or which He does not either effect by his own power, or
   permit to be done by other agents. This is a truth of natural religion
   as well as of revelation. It is (practically) universally recognized.
   The prayers and thanksgivings which men by a law of their nature
   address to God, assume that He controls all events. War, pestilence and
   famine, are deprecated as manifestations of his displeasure. To Him all
   men turn for deliverance from these evils. Peace, health, and plenty,
   are universally recognized as his gifts. This truth lies at the
   foundation of all religion, and cannot be questioned by any Theist,
   much less by any Christian.

   2. No less clear and universally admitted is the principle that God can
   control the free acts of rational creatures without destroying either
   their liberty or their responsibility. Men universally pray for
   deliverance from the wrath of their enemies, that their enmity may be
   turned aside, or that the state of their minds may be changed. All
   Christians pray that God would change the hearts of men, give them
   repentance and faith, and so control their acts that his glory and the
   good of others may be promoted. This again is one of those simple,
   profound, and far-reaching truths, which men take for granted, and on
   which they act and cannot avoid acting, whatever may be the doubts of
   philosophers, or the speculative difficulties with which such truths
   are attended.

   3. All Christians admit that God has a plan or purpose in the
   government of the world. There is an end to be accomplished. It is
   inconceivable that an infinitely wise Being should create, sustain, and
   control the universe, without contemplating any end to be attained by
   this wonderful manifestation of his power and resources. The Bible,
   therefore, teaches us that God works all things after the counsel of
   his own will. And this truth is incorporated in all the systems of
   faith adopted among Christians, and is assumed in all religious worship
   and experience.

   4. It is a necessary corollary from the foregoing principles that the
   facts of history are the interpretation of the eternal purposes of God.
   Whatever actually occurs entered into his purpose. We can, therefore,
   learn the design or intention of God from the evolution or development
   of his plan in the history of the world, and of every individual man.
   Whatever occurs, He for wise reasons permits to occur. He can prevent
   whatever He sees fit to prevent. If, therefore, sin occurs, it was
   God's design that it should occur. If misery follows in the train of
   sin, such was God's purpose. If some men only are saved, while others
   perish, such must have entered into the all comprehending purpose of
   God. It is not possible for any finite mind to comprehend the designs
   of God, or to see the reasons of his dispensations. But we cannot, on
   that account, deny that He governs all things, or that He rules
   according to the counsel of his own will.

   The Augustinian system of doctrine is nothing more than the application
   of these general and almost universally recognized principles to the
   special case of the salvation of man.

   Statement of the Doctrine.

   The Augustinian scheme includes the following points: (1.) That the
   glory of God, or the manifestation of his perfections, is the highest
   and ultimate end of all things. (2.) For that end God purposed the
   creation of the universe, and the whole plan of providence and
   redemption. (3.) That He placed man in a state of probation, making
   Adam, their first parent, their head and representative. (4.) That the
   fall of Adam brought all his posterity into a state of condemnation,
   sin, and misery, from which they are utterly unable to deliver
   themselves. (5.) From the mass of fallen men God elected a number
   innumerable to eternal life, and left the rest of mankind to the just
   recompense of their sins. (6.) That the ground of this election is not
   the foresight of anything in the one class to distinguish them
   favourably from the members of the other class, but the good pleasure
   of God. (7.) That for the salvation of those thus chosen to eternal
   life, God gave his own Son, to become man, and to obey and suffer for
   his people, thus making a full satisfaction for sin and bringing in
   everlasting righteousness, rendering the ultimate salvation of the
   elect absolutely certain. (8.) That while the Holy Spirit, in his
   common operations, is present with every man, so long as he lives,
   restraining evil and exciting good, his certainly efficacious and
   saving power is exercised only in behalf of the elect. (9.) That all
   those whom God has thus chosen to life, and for whom Christ specially
   save Himself in the covenant of redemption, shall certainly (unless
   they die in infancy), be brought to the knowledge of the truth, to the
   exercise of faith, and to perseverance in holy living unto the end.

   Such is the great scheme of doctrine known in history as the Pauline,
   Augustinian, or Calvinistic, taught, as we believe, in the Scriptures,
   developed by Augustine, formally sanctioned by the Latin Church,
   adhered to by the witnesses of the truth during the Middle Ages,
   repudiated by the Church of Rome in the Council of Trent, revived in
   that Church by the Jansenists, adopted by all the Reformers,
   incorporated in the creeds of the Protestant Churches of Switzerland,
   of the Palatinate, of France, Holland, England, and Scotland, and
   unfolded in the Standards framed by the Westminster Assembly, the
   common representative of Presbyterians in Europe and America.

   It is a historical fact that this scheme of doctrine has been the
   moving power in the Church; that largely to it are to be referred the
   intellectual vigour and spiritual life of the heroes and confessors who
   have been raised up in the course of ages; that it has been the
   fruitful source of good works, of civil and religious liberty, and of
   human progress. Its truth may be evinced from many different sources.

   Proof of the Doctrine.

   In the first place, it is a simple, harmonious, self-consistent scheme.
   It supposes no conflicting purposes in the divine mind; no willing
   first one thing, and then another; no purposing ends which are never
   accomplished; and no assertion of principles in conflict with others
   which cannot be denied. All the parts of this vast plan admit of being
   reduced to one comprehensive purpose as it was hid for ages in the
   divine mind. The purpose to create, to permit the fall, to elect some
   to everlasting life, while others are left, to send his Son to redeem
   his people, and to give the Spirit to apply that redemption, are
   purposes which harmonize one with all the others, and form one
   consistent plan. The parts of this scheme are not only harmonious, but
   they are also connected in such a way that the one involves the others,
   so that if one be proved it involves the truth of all the rest. If
   Christ was given for the redemption of his people, then their
   redemption is rendered certain, and then the operations of the Spirit
   must, in their case, be certainly efficacious; and if such be the
   design of the work of Christ, and the nature of the Spirit's influence,
   then those who are the objects of the one, and the subjects of the
   other, must persevere in holiness unto the end. Or if we begin with any
   other of the principles aforesaid, the same result follows. If it be
   proved or conceded that the fall brought mankind into an estate of
   helpless sin and misery, then it follows that salvation must be of
   grace; that it is of God and not of us, that we are in Christ; that
   vocation is effectual; that election is of the good pleasure of God;
   that the sacrifice of Christ renders certain the salvation of his
   people; and that they cannot fatally fall away from God. So of all the
   rest. Admit that the death of Christ renders certain the salvation of
   his people, and all the rest follows. Admit that election is not of
   works, and the whole plan must be admitted as true. Admit that nothing
   happens contrary to God's purposes, then again the whole Augustinian
   scheme must be admitted. There can scarcely be a clearer proof that we
   understand a complicated machine than that we can put together its
   several parts, so that each exactly fits its place; no one admitting of
   being transferred or substituted for another; and the whole being
   complete and unimpeded in its action. Such is the order of God's
   working, that if you give a naturalist a single bone, he can construct
   the whole skeleton of which it is a part; and such is the order of his
   plan of redemption, that if one of the great truths which it includes
   be admitted, all the rest must be accepted. This is the first great
   argument in support of the Pauline or Augustinian scheme of doctrine.

   Argument from the Facts of Providence.

   In the second place, this scheme alone is consistent with the facts of
   God's providence. Obvious as the truth is, it needs to be constantly
   repeated, that it is useless to contend against facts. If a thing is,
   it is vain to ignore it, or to deny its significance. We must conform
   our theories to facts, and not make the facts conform to our theories.
   That view of divine truth, therefore, is correct which accords with the
   facts of God's providence; and that view of doctrine must be false
   which conflicts with those facts. Another principle no less plain, and
   no less apt to be forgotten, is the one assumed above as admitted by
   all Christians, namely, that God has a plan and that the events of his
   providence correspond with that plan. In other words, that whatever
   happens, God intended should happen; that to Him nothing can be
   unexpected, and nothing contrary to his purposes. If this be so, then
   we can learn with certainty what God's plan is, what He intended to do
   or to permit, from what actually comes to pass. If one portion of the
   inhabitants of a given country die in infancy, and another portion live
   to mature age; such was, for wise reasons, the purpose of God. If some
   are prosperous, and others miserable, such also is in accordance with
   his holy will. If one season is abundant, another the reverse, it is so
   in virtue of his appointment. This is a dictate even of natural
   religion. As much as this even the heathen believe.

   It can hardly be doubted that if these simple principles be granted,
   the truth of the Augustinian scheme must be admitted. It is a fact that
   God created man; it is a fact that the fall of Adam involved our whole
   race in sin and misery; it is a fact that of this fallen family, some
   are saved and others perish; it is a fact that the salvation of those
   who actually attain eternal life, is secured by the mediation of
   Christ, and the work of the Holy Spirit. These are providential facts
   admitted by all Christians. All that Augustinianism teaches is, that
   these facts were not unexpected by the divine mind, but that God
   foreknew they would occur, and intended that they should come to pass.
   This is all. What actually does happen, God intended should happen.
   Although his purposes or intentions cannot fail, He uses no influence
   to secure their accomplishment, which is incompatible with the perfect
   liberty and entire responsibility of rational creatures. As God is
   infinite in power and wisdom, He can control all events, and therefore
   the course of events must be in accordance with his will, because He
   can mould or direct that course at pleasure. It is, therefore, evident,
   first, that events must be the interpretation of his purposes, i.e., of
   what He intends shall happen; and secondly, that no objection can bear
   against the purpose or decrees of God, which does not bear equally
   against his providence. If it be right that God should permit an event
   to happen, it must be right that He should purpose to permit it, i.e.,
   that He should decree its occurrence. We may suppose the Deistic or
   Rationalistic view of God's relation to the world to be true: that God
   created men, and left them without any providential guidance, or any
   supernatural influence, to the unrestrained exercise of their own
   faculties, and to the operation of the laws of nature and of society.
   If this were so, a certain course of events in regular succession, and
   in every variety of combination, would as a matter of fact, actually
   occur. In this case there could be no pretence that God was responsible
   for the issue. He had created man, endowed him with all the faculties,
   and surrounded him by all the circumstances necessary for his highest
   welfare. If he chose to abuse his faculties, and neglect his
   opportunities, it would be his own fault. He could bring no just
   complaint against his maker. We may further suppose that God,
   overlooking and foreseeing how men left to themselves would act, and
   what would be the issue of a universe conducted on this plan, should
   determine, for wise reasons, that it should become actual that just
   such a world and just such a series of events should really occur.
   Would this be wrong? Or, would it make any difference, if God's purpose
   as to the futurition of such a world, instead of following the
   foresight of it, should precede it? In either case God would purpose
   precisely the same world, and the same course of events. Augustinianism
   supposes that God for his own glory, and therefore for the highest and
   most beneficent of all ends, did purpose such a world and such a series
   of events as would have occurred on the Deistical hypothesis, with two
   important exceptions. First, He interposes to restrain and guide the
   wickedness of men so as to prevent its producing unmitigated evil, and
   to cause it to minister to the production of good. And secondly, He
   intervenes by his providence, and by the work of Christ and of the Holy
   Spirit, to save innumerable souls from the deluge of destruction. The
   Augustinian system, therefore, is nothing but the assumption that God
   intended in eternity what He actually does in time. That system,
   therefore, is in accordance with all the facts of divine providence,
   and thus is founded on an immovable basis.

   Sovereignty of God in the Dispensations of his Providence.

   There is, however, another view which must be taken of this subject.
   Augustinianism is founded on the assumption of the sovereignty of God.
   It supposes that it belongs to Him, in virtue of his own perfection, in
   virtue of his relation to the universe as its creator and preserver,
   and of his relation to the world of sinners as their ruler and judge,
   to deal with them according to his own good pleasure; that He can
   rightfully pardon some and condemn others; can rightfully give his
   saving grace to one and not to another; and, therefore, that it is of
   Him, and not of man, that one and not another is made a partaker of
   eternal life. On the other hand, all anti-Augustinian systems assume
   that God is bound to provide salvation for all; to give sufficient
   grace to all; and to leave the question of salvation and perdition to
   be determined by each man for himself. We are not condemned criminals
   of whom the sovereign may rightfully pardon some and not others; but
   rational creatures, having all an equal and valid claim on our Maker to
   receive all that is necessary for our salvation. The question is not
   which of these theories is the more agreeable, but which is true. And
   to decide that question one method is to ascertain which accords best
   with providential facts. Does God in his providential dealings with men
   act on the principles of sovereignty, distributing his favours
   according to the good pleasure of his will; or on the principle of
   impartial justice, dealing with all men alike? This question admits of
   but one answer. We may make as little as we please of mere external
   circumstances, and magnify as much as we can the compensations of
   providence which tend to equalize the condition of men. We may press to
   the extreme the principle that much shall be required of those who
   receive much, and less of those who receive less. Notwithstanding these
   qualifications and limitations, the fact is patent that the greatest
   inequalities do exist among men; that God deals far more favourably
   with some than with others; that He distributes his providential
   blessings, which include not only temporal good but also religious
   advantages and opportunities, as an absolute sovereign according to his
   own good pleasure, and not as an impartial judge. The time for judgment
   is not yet.

   This sovereignty of God in the dispensation of his providence is
   evinced in his dealings both with nations and with individuals. It
   cannot be believed that the lot of the Laplanders is as favourable as
   that of the inhabitants of the temperate zone; that the Hottentots are
   in as desirable a position as Europeans; that the people of Tartary are
   as well off as those of the United States. The inequality is too
   glaring to be denied; nor can it be doubted that the rule which God
   adopts in determining the lot of nations is his own good pleasure, and
   not the relative claims of the people affected by his providence. The
   same fact is no less obvious as concerns individuals. Some are happy,
   others are miserable. Some have uninterrupted health; others are the
   victims of disease and suffering. Some have all their faculties, others
   are born blind or deaf. Some are rich, others sunk in the misery and
   degradation of abject poverty. Some are born in the midst of civilized
   society and in the bosom of virtuous families, others are from the
   beginning of their being surrounded by vice and wretchedness. These are
   facts which cannot be denied. Nor can it be denied that the lot of each
   individual is determined by the sovereign pleasure of God.

   The same principle is carried out with regard to the communication of
   religious knowledge and advantages. God chose the Jews from among all
   time families of the earth to be the recipients of his oracles and of
   the divinely instituted ordinances of religion. The rest of the world
   was left for centuries in utter darkness. We may say that it will be
   more tolerable in the judgment for the heathen than for the unfaithful
   Jews; and that God did not leave even the Gentiles without a witness.
   All this may be admitted, and yet what the Apostle says stands true:
   The advantages of the Jews were great every way. It would be
   infatuation and ingratitude for the inhabitants of Christendom not to
   recognize their position as unspeakably more desirable than that of
   Pagans. No American Christian can persuade himself that it would have
   been as well had he been born in Africa; nor can he give any answer to
   the question, Why was I born here and not there? other than, "Even so,
   Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight."

   It is therefore vain to adopt a theory which does not accord with these
   facts. It is vain for us to deny that God is a sovereign in the
   distribution of his favours if in his providence it is undeniable that
   He acts as a sovereign. Augustinianism accords with these facts of
   providence, and therefore must be true. It only assumes that God acts
   in the dispensation of his grace precisely as He acts in the
   distribution of his other favours; and all anti-Augustinian systems
   which are founded on the principle that this sovereignty of God is
   inconsistent with his justice and his parental relation to the children
   of men are in obvious conflict with the facts of his providence.

   Argument from the Facts of Scripture.

   The third source of proof on this subject is found in the facts of the
   Bible, or in the truths therein plainly revealed. Augustinianism is the
   only system consistent with those facts or truths.

   1. This appears first from the clear revelation which the Scriptures
   make of God as infinitely exalted above all his creatures, and as the
   final end as well as the source of all things. It is because He is
   infinitely great and good that his glory is the end of all things; and
   his good pleasure the highest reason for whatever comes to pass. What
   is man that he should contend with God; or presume that his interests
   rather than God's glory should be made the final end? The Scriptures
   not only assert the absolute sovereignty of God, but they teach that it
   is founded, first, on his infinite superiority to all creatures;
   secondly, upon his relation to the world and all it contains, as
   creator and preserver, and therefore absolute proprietor; and, thirdly,
   so far as we men are concerned, upon our entire forfeiture of all claim
   on his mercy by our apostasy. The argument is that Augustinianism is
   the only system which accords with the character of God and with his
   relation to his creatures as revealed in the Bible.

   2. It is a fact that men are a fallen race; that by their alienation
   from God they are involved in a state of guilt and pollution, from
   which they cannot deliver themselves. They have by their guilt
   forfeited all claim on God's justice; they might in justice be left to
   perish; and by their depravity they have rendered themselves unable to
   turn unto God, or to do anything spiritually good. These are facts
   already proved. The sense of guilt is universal and indestructible. All
   sinners know the righteous judgment of God, that they are worthy of
   death. The inability of sinners is not only clearly and repeatedly
   asserted in the Scriptures, but is proved by all experience, by the
   common consciousness of men, and, of course, by the consciousness of
   every individual man, and especially of every man who has ever been or
   who is truly convinced of sin. But if men are thus unable to change
   their own hearts, to prepare themselves for that change, or to
   coöperate in its productions then all those systems which assume the
   ability of the sinner and rest the distinction between one man and
   another as to their being saved or lost, upon the use made of that
   ability, must be false. They are contrary to facts. They are
   inconsistent with what every man, in the depth of his own heart, knows
   to be true. The point intended to be illustrated when the Scriptures
   compare sinners to men dead, and even to dry bones, is their entire
   helplessness. In this respect they are all alike. Should Christ pass
   through a graveyard, and bid one here and another there to come forth,
   the reason why one was restored to life, and another left in his grave
   could be sought only in his good pleasure. From the nature of the case
   it could not be found in the dead themselves. Therefore if the
   Scriptures, observation, and consciousness teach that men are unable to
   restore themselves to spiritual life, their being quickened must be
   referred to the good pleasure of God.

   From the Work of the Spirit.

   3. This is confirmed by another obvious fact or truth of Scripture. The
   regeneration of the human heart; the conversion of a sinner to God is
   the work, not of the subject of that change, but of the Spirit of God.
   This is plain, first, because the Bible always attributes it to the
   Holy Ghost. We are said to be born, not of the will of man, but of God;
   to be born of the Spirit; to be the subjects of the renewing of the
   Holy Ghost; to be quickened, or raised from the dead by the Spirit of
   the Lord; the dry bones live only when the Spirit blows upon them. Such
   is the representation which pervades the Scriptures from beginning to
   end. Secondly, the Church, therefore, in her collective capacity, and
   every living member of that Church recognizes this truth in their
   prayers for the renewing power of the Holy Ghost. In the most ancient
   and universally recognized creeds of the Church the Spirit is
   designated as to zoopoion, the life-giving; the author of all spiritual
   life. The sovereignty involved in this regenerating influence of the
   Holy Spirit is necessarily implied in the nature of the power exerted.
   It is declared to be the mighty power of God; the exceeding greatness
   of his power; the power which wrought in Christ when it raised Him from
   the dead. It is represented as analogous to the power by which the
   blind were made to see, the deaf to hear, and lepers were cleansed. It
   is very true the Spirit illuminates, teaches, convinces, persuades,
   and, in a word, governs the soul according to its nature as a rational
   creature But all this relates to what is done in the case of the
   children of God after their regeneration. Imparting spiritual life is
   one thing; sustaining, controlling, and cherishing that life is
   another. If the Bible teaches that regeneration, or spiritual
   resurrection, is the work of the almighty power of God, analogous to
   that which was exercised by Christ when He said, "I will, be thou
   clean;" then it of necessity follows that regeneration is an act of
   sovereignty. It depends on God the giver of life and not on those
   spiritually dead, who are to live, and who are to remain in their sins.
   The intimate conviction of the people of God in all ages has been and
   is that regeneration, or the infusion of spiritual life, is an act of
   God's power exercised according to his good pleasure, and therefore it
   is the gift for which the Church specially prays. But this fact
   involves the truth of Augustinianism, which simply teaches that the
   reason why one man is regenerated and another not, and consequently one
   saved and another not, is the good pleasure of God. He has mercy upon
   whom He will have mercy. It is true that He commands all men to seek
   his grace, and promises that those who seek shall find. But why does
   one seek and another not? Why is one impressed with the importance of
   salvation while others remain indifferent? If it be true that not only
   regeneration, but all right thoughts and just [u poses come from God,
   it is of Him, and not of us, that we seek and find his favour.

   Election is to Holiness.

   4. Another plainly revealed fact is, that we are chosen to holiness;
   that we are created unto good works; in other words, that all good in
   us is the fruit, and, therefore, cannot by possibility be the ground of
   election. In Eph. i. 3-6, the Apostle says: "Blessed be the God and
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual
   blessings in heavenly places in Christ: according as He hath chosen us
   in Him, before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
   without blame before Him in love: having predestinated us unto the
   adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good
   pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein
   He hath made us accepted in the Beloved." In this passage the
   Augustinian doctrine of election is stated as clearly and as
   comprehensively as it has ever been presented in human language. The
   Apostle teaches, (1.) That the end or design of the whole scheme of
   redemption is the praise of the glory of the grace of God, i.e., to
   exhibit to the admiration of intelligent creatures the glorious
   attribute of divine grace, or the love of an infinitely holy and just
   God towards guilty and polluted sinners. (2.) To this end, of his mere
   good pleasure, He predestinated those who were the objects of this love
   to the high dignity of being the children of God. (3.) That, to prepare
   them for this exalted state, He chose them, before the foundation of
   the world, to be holy and without blame in love. (4.) That in
   consequence of his choice, or in execution of this purpose, He confers
   upon them all spiritual blessings, regeneration, faith, repentance, and
   the indwelling of the Spirit. It is utterly incompatible within this
   fact that the foresight of faith and repentance should be the ground of
   election. Men, according to the Apostle, repent and believe, because
   they are elected; God has chosen them to be holy, and therefore their
   holiness or their goodness in any form or measure cannot be the reason
   why He chose them. In like manner the Apostle Peter says, believers are
   elect "unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ." (1
   Pet. i. 2.) Such is the clear doctrine of the Bible, men are chosen to
   be holy. The fact that God has predestinated them to salvation is the
   reason why they are brought to repentance and a holy life. "God," says
   Paul to the Thessalonians (2 Thess. ii. 13), "hath from the beginning
   chosen you to salvation through (not on account of) sanctification of
   the Spirit and belief of the truth." "We give thanks to God always for
   you all, making mention of you in our prayers; remembering without
   ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in
   our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; knowing,
   brethren beloved, your election of God." (1 Thess. i. 2-4.) He
   recognizes their election as the source of their faith and love.

   From the Gratuitous Nature of Salvation.

   5. Another decisive fact is that salvation is of grace. The two ideas
   of grace and works; of gift and debt; of undeserved favour and what is
   merited; of what is to be referred to the good pleasure of the giver,
   and what to the character or state of the receiver, are antithetical.
   The one excludes the other. "If by grace, then is it no more of works:
   otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no
   more grace: otherwise work is no more work." Rom. xi. 6. Nothing
   concerning the plan of salvation is more plainly revealed, or more
   strenuously insisted upon than its gratuitousness, from beginning to
   end. "Ye are saved by grace, is engraved upon almost every page of the
   Bible, and in the hearts of all believers. (1.) It was a matter of
   grace that a plan of salvation was devised for fallen man and not for
   fallen angels. (2.) It was a matter of grace that that plan was
   revealed to some portions A our race and not to others. (3.) The
   acceptance, or justification of every individual heir of salvation is a
   matter of grace. (4.) The work of sanctification is a work of grace,
   i.e., a work carried on by the unmerited, supernatural power of the
   Holy Spirit. (5.) It is a matter of grace that of those who hear the
   gospel some accept the offered mercy, while others reject it. All these
   points are so clearly taught in the Bible that they are practically
   acknowledged by all Christians. Although denied to satisfy the
   understanding, they are conceded by the heart, as is evident from the
   prayers and praises of the Church in all ages and in all its divisions.
   That the vocation or regeneration of the believer is of grace, i.e.,
   that the fact of his vocation is to be referred to God, and not to
   anything in himself is specially insisted upon by the Apostle Paul in
   almost all his epistles. For example, in 1 Cor. i. 17-31. It had been
   objected to him that he did not preach "with the wisdom of words." He
   vindicated himself by showing, first, that the wisdom of men had not
   availed to secure the saving knowledge of God; and secondly, that when
   the gospel of salvation was revealed, it was not the wise who accepted
   it. In proof of this latter point, he appealed to their own experience.
   He referred to the fact that of their number God had not chosen the
   wise, the great, or the noble; but the foolish, the weak, and the
   despised. God had done this. It was He who decided who should be
   brought to accept the Gospel, and who should be left to themselves. He
   had a purpose in this, and that purpose was that those who glory should
   glory in the Lord, i.e., that no man should be able to refer his
   salvation (the fact that he was saved while another was not saved) to
   himself. For, adds the Apostle, it is of Him that we are in Christ
   Jesus. Our union with Christ, the fact that we are believers, is to be
   referred to Him, and not to ourselves.

   The Apostle's Argument in Romans ix.

   This also is the purpose of the Apostle in the whole of the ninth
   chapter of his Epistle to the Romans. He had asserted agreeably to the
   predictions of time ancient prophets, that the Jews as a nation were to
   be cast off, and the blessings of the true religion were to be extended
   to the Gentiles. To establish this point, he first shows that God was
   not bound by his promise to Abraham to save all the natural descendants
   of that patriarch. On the contrary, that it was a prerogative which
   God, as sovereign, claimed and exercised to have mercy on whom He
   would, and to reject whom He would. He chose Isaac and not Ishmael,
   Jacob and not Esau, and, in that case, to show that the choice was
   perfectly sovereign, it was announced before the birth of the children,
   before they had done good or evil. Pharaoh He had hardened. He left him
   to himself to be a monument of justice. This right, which God both
   claims and exercises, to choose whom He will to be the recipients of
   his mercy, involves, the Apostle teaches us, no injustice. It is a
   right of sovereignty which belongs to God as Creator and as moral
   Governor. No one had a right to complain if, for the manifestation of
   his mercy, he saved some of the guilty family of men; and to show his
   justice, allowed others to bear the just recompense of their sins. On
   these principles God, as Paul tells us, dealt with the Jews. The nation
   as a nation was cast off, but a remnant was saved. And this remnant was
   an "election of grace," i.e., men chosen gratuitously. Paul himself was
   an illustration of this election, and a proof of its entirely
   gratuitous nature. He was a persecutor and a blasphemer, and while in
   the very exercise of his malignant opposition, was suddenly and
   miraculously converted. Here, if in no other case, the election was of
   grace. There was nothing in Paul to distinguish him favourably from
   other unbelieving Pharisees. It could not be the foresight of his faith
   and repentance which was the ground of his election, because he was
   brought to faith and repentance by the sovereign and irresistible
   intervention of God. What, however, was true of Paul is true of every
   other believer. Every man who is brought to Christ is so brought that
   it is revealed to his own consciousness, and openly confessed by the
   mouth, that his conversion is of God and not of himself; that he is a
   monument of the election of grace; that he, at least, was not chosen
   because of his deserts.

   Argument from Experience.

   The whole history of the Church, and the daily observation of
   Christians, prove the sovereignty of God in the dispensation of saving
   blessings, for which Augustinians contend. It is true, indeed, first,
   that God is a covenant keeping God, and that his promise is to his
   people and to their seed after them to the third and fourth
   generations. It is, therefore, true that his grace is dispensed,
   although not exclusively, yet conspicuously, in the line of their
   descendants. Secondly, it is also true that God has promised his
   blessing to attend faithful instruction. He commands parents to bring
   up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and
   promises that if thus trained in the way in which they should go, when
   they are old they will not depart from it. But it is not true that
   regeneration is the product of culture. Men cannot be educated into
   Christians, as they may be trained in knowledge or morals. Conversion
   is not the result of the development of a germ of spiritual life
   communicated in baptism or derived by descent from pious parents.
   Everything is in the hands of God. As Christ when on earth healed one
   and another by a word, so now by his Spirit, He quickens whom He will.
   This fact is proved by all history. Some periods of the Church have
   been remarkable for these displays of his powers, while others have
   passed with only here and there a manifestation of his saving grace. In
   the Apostolic age thousands were converted; many were daily added to
   the Church of such as were to be saved. Then in the Augustinian age
   there was a wide diffusion of the saving influences of the Spirit.
   Still more conspicuously was this the case at the Reformation. After a
   long decline in Great Britain came the wonderful revival of true
   religion under Wesley and Whitefield. Contemporaneously the great
   awakening occurred throughout this country. And thus from time to time,
   and in all parts of the Church, we see these evidences of the special
   and sovereign interventions of God. The sovereignty of these
   dispensations is just as manifest as that displayed in the seven years
   of plenty and the seven years of dearth in the time of Moses. Every
   pastor, almost every parent, can bear witness to the same truth. They
   pray and labour long apparently without success; and then, often when
   they look not for it, comes the outpouring of the Spirit. Changes are
   effected in the state and character of men, which no man can produce in
   another; and which no man can effect in himself; changes which must be
   referred to the immediate agency of the Spirit of God. These are facts.
   They cannot be reasonably denied. They cannot be explained away. They
   demonstrate that God acts as a sovereign in the distribution of his
   grace. With this fact no other scheme than the Augustinian can be
   reconciled. If salvation is of grace, as the Scriptures so clearly
   teach, then it is not of works whether actual or foreseen.

   Express Declarations of Scripture.

   6. The Scriptures clearly assert that God has mercy on whom He will
   have mercy, and compassion on him on whom He will have compassion. They
   teach negatively, that election to salvation is not of works; that it
   does not depend on the character or efforts of its objects; and
   affirmatively, that it does depend on God. It is referred to his good
   pleasure. It is declared to be of Him; to be of grace. Passages in
   which these negative and affirmative statements are made, have already
   been quoted. In Rom. ix. it is said that election is "not of works, but
   of Him that calleth." "So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of
   him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy." As in the time of
   Elias and the general apostasy, God said, "I have left me seven
   thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed the knee unto
   Baal. (1 Kings, xix. 18.) "So then," says the Apostle, "there is a
   remnant according to the election of grace. And if by grace, then is it
   no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace." (Rom. xi. 5, 6.)
   So in Rom. viii. 30, it is said, "Whom He did predestinate, them He
   also called," i.e., He regenerated and sanctified. Regeneration follows
   predestination to life, and is the gift of God. Paul said of himself,
   "It pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me
   by his grace, to reveal his Son in me." (Gal. i. 15, 16.) To the
   Ephesians he says that those obtain the inheritance, who were
   "predestinated according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things
   after the counsel of his own will." (Eph. i. 12.) In 2 Tim. i. 9, he
   says, we are saved "according to his own purpose and grace, which was
   given us in Christ Jesus before the world began." The Apostle James, i.
   18, says, "Of his own will begat He us with the word of truth, that we
   should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures." The Apostle Peter
   speaks of those who "stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto
   also they were appointed." (1 Pet. ii. 8.) And Jude speaks of certain
   men who had "crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this
   condemnation." (Jude 4.) This foreordination to condemnation is indeed
   a judicial act, as is taught in Rom. ix. 22. God condemns no man, and
   foreordains no man to condemnation, except on account of his sin. But
   the preterition of such men, leaving them, rather than others equally
   guilty, to suffer the penalty of their sins, is distinctly declared to
   be a sovereign act.

   The Words of Jesus.

   Of all the teachers sent by God to reveal his will, no one more
   frequently asserts the divine sovereignty than our blessed Lord
   himself. He speaks of those whom the Father had "given Him." (John
   xvii. 2.) To these He gives eternal life. (John xvii. 2, 24.) For these
   He prays; for them He sanctified Himself (John xvii. 19.) Of them He
   says, it is the Father's will that He should lose none, but raise them
   up at the last day. (John vi. 39.) They are, therefore, perfectly safe.
   "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I
   give unto them eternal life; they shall never perish, neither shall any
   man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is
   greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's
   hand." (John x. 27-29.) As the sheep of Christ are chosen out of the
   world, and given to Him, God is the chooser. They do not choose Him,
   but He chooses them. No one can be added to their number, and that
   number shall certainly be completed. "All that the Father giveth me
   shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast
   out." (John vi. 37.) "No man can come to me, except the Father which
   hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day." (John
   vi. 44.) "Every man therefore that hath heard, and learned of the
   Father, cometh unto me." (Verse 45.) "No man can come unto me, except
   it were given unto him of my Father." (Verse 65.) With God it rests who
   shall be brought to the saving knowledge of the truth. "It is given
   unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
   is not given." (Matt. xiii. 11.) "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
   heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and
   prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." (Matt. xi. 25.) In Acts
   xiii. 48, it is said, "As many as were ordained to eternal life
   believed." The Scriptures, therefore, say that repentance, faith, and
   the renewing of the Holy Ghost are gifts of God. Christ was exalted at
   the right hand of God to give repentance and remission of sins. But if
   faith and repentance are the gifts of God they must be the fruits of
   election They cannot possibly be its ground.

   If the office of the theologian, as is so generally admitted, be to
   take the facts of Scripture as the man of science does those of nature,
   and found upon them his doctrines, instead of deducing his doctrines
   from the principles or primary truths of his philosophy, it seems
   impossible to resist the conclusion that the doctrine of Augustine is
   the doctrine of the Bible. According to that doctrine God is an
   absolute sovereign. He does what seems good in his sight. He sends the
   truth to one nation and not to another. He gives that truth saving
   power in one mind and not in another. It is of him, and not of us, that
   any man is in Christ Jesus, and is an heir of eternal life.

   This, as has been shown, is asserted in express terms, with great
   frequency and clearness in the Scriptures. It is sustained by all the
   facts of providence and of revelation. It attributes to God nothing but
   what is proved, by his actual government of the world, to be his
   rightful prerogative. It only teaches that God purposes what, with our
   own eyes, we see He actually does, and ever has done, in the
   dispensations of his providence. The consistent opponent of this
   doctrine must, therefore, reject the truths even of natural religion.
   As Augustinianism agrees with the facts of providence it of course
   agrees with the facts of Scripture. The Bible declares that the
   salvation of sinful men is a matter of grace; and that the great design
   of the whole scheme of redemption is to display the glory of that
   divine attribute, -- to exhibit to the admiration, and for the
   edification of the intelligent universe, God's unmerited love and
   boundless beneficence to guilty and polluted creatures. Accordingly,
   men are represented as being sunk into a state of sin and misery; from
   this state they cannot deliver themselves; for their redemption God
   sent his own eternal Son to assume their nature, obey, and suffer in
   their place; and his Holy Spirit to apply the redemption purchased by
   the Son. To introduce the element of merit into any part of this scheme
   vitiates its nature and frustrates its design. Unless our salvation
   from beginning to end be of grace it is not an exhibition of grace. The
   Bible, however, teaches that it was a matter of grace that salvation
   was provided; that it was revealed to one nation and not to another;
   and that it was applied to one person and not to another. It teaches
   that all goodness in man is due to the influence of the Holy Spirit,
   and that all spiritual blessings are the fruits of election; that we
   are chosen to holiness, and created unto good works, because
   predestinated to be the children of God. With these facts of Scripture
   the experience of Christians agrees. It is the intimate conviction of
   every believer, founded upon the testimony of his own consciousness, as
   well as upon the Scriptures, that his salvation is of God; that it is
   of Him, and not of himself, that he has been brought to the exercise of
   faith and repentance. So long as he looks within the believer is
   satisfied of the truth of these doctrines. It is only when he looks
   outward, and attempts to reconcile these truths with the dictates of
   his own understanding that he becomes confused and sceptical. But as
   our faith is not founded on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God,
   as the foolishness of God is wiser than men, the part of wisdom, as
   well as the path of duty and safety, is to receive as true what God has
   revealed, whether we can comprehend his ways unto perfection or not.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 9. Objections to the Augustinian Scheme.

   That there are formidable objections to the Augustinian doctrine of
   divine sovereignty cannot be denied. They address themselves even more
   powerfully to the feelings and to the imagination than they do to the
   understanding. They are therefore often arrayed in such distorted and
   exaggerated forms as to produce the strongest revulsion and abhorrence.
   This, however, is due partly to the distortion of the truth and partly
   to the opposition of our imperfectly or utterly unsanctified nature, to
   the things of the Spirit, of which the Apostle speaks in 1 Cor. ii. 14.

   Of these objections, however, it may be remarked in general, in the
   first place, that they do not bear exclusively on this doctrine. It is
   one of the unfair devices of controversy to represent difficulties
   which press with equal force against some admitted doctrine as valid
   only against the doctrine which the objector rejects. Thus the
   objections against Augustinianism, on which special reliance is placed,
   bear with their full force against the decrees of God in general; or if
   these be denied, against the divine foreknowledge; against the
   permission of sin and misery, and especially against the doctrine of
   the unending sinfulness and misery of many of God's intelligent
   creatures. These are doctrines which all Christians admit, and which
   are arrayed by infidels and atheists in colours as shocking to the
   imagination and feelings as any which Anti-Augustinians have employed
   in depicting the sovereignty of God. It is just as difficult to
   reconcile to our natural ideas of God that He, with absolute control
   over all creatures, should allow so many of them to perish eternally as
   that He should save some and not others. The difficulty is in both
   cases the same. God does not prevent the perdition of those whom,
   beyond doubt, He has power to save. If those who admit God's providence
   say that He has wise reasons for permitting so many of our race to
   perish, the advocates of his sovereignty say that He has adequate
   reasons for saving some and not others. It is unreasonable and unjust,
   therefore, to press difficulties which bear against admitted truths as
   fatal to doctrines which are matters of controversy. When an objection
   is shown to prove too much it is rationally refuted.

   The same objections bear against the Providence of God.

   A second general remark respecting these objections is, that they hear
   against the providence of God. This has already been shown. It is
   useless and irrational to argue against facts. It can avail nothing to
   say that it is unjust in God to deal more favourably with one nation
   than with another, with one individual than with another, if in point
   of fact He acts as a sovereign in the distribution of his favours. That
   He does so act is undeniable so far as providential blessings and
   religious advantages are concerned. And this is all that Augustinianism
   asserts in regard to the dispensations of his grace. If, therefore, the
   principle on which these objections are founded is proved to be false
   by the actual facts of providence the objections cannot be valid
   against the Augustinian scheme.

   Founded on our Ignorance.

   A third obvious remark is that these objections are subjective; i.e.,
   they derive all their force from the limitation of our powers and from
   the narrowness of our views. They assume that we are competent to sit
   in judgment on God's government of the universe; that we can ascertain
   the end which He has in view, and estimate aright the wisdom and
   justice of the means adopted for its accomplishment. This is clearly a
   preposterous assumption, not only because of our utter incapacity to
   comprehend the ways of God, but also because we must of necessity judge
   before the consummation of his plan, and must also judge from
   appearances. It is but right in judging of the plans even of a fellow
   mortal, that we should wait until they are fully developed, and also
   right that we should not judge without being certain that we can see
   his real intentions, and the connection between his means and end.

   Besides all this, it is to be observed that these difficulties arise
   from our contemplating, so to speak, only one aspect of the case. We
   look only on the sovereignty of God and the absolute nature of his
   control over his creatures. We leave out of view, or are incapable of
   understanding the perfect consistency of that sovereignty and control,
   with the free agency and responsibility of his rational creatures. It
   is perfectly true, in one aspect, that God determines according to his
   own good pleasure the destiny of every human being; and it is equally
   true, in another aspect, that every man determines his own destiny.
   These truths can both be established on the firmest grounds. Their
   consistency, therefore, must be admitted as a fact, even though we may
   not be able to discover it. Of the multitudes who start in the pursuit
   of fame, wealth, or power, some succeed while others fail. Success and
   failure, in every case, are determined by the Lord. This is distinctly
   asserted in the Bible. "God," saith the Psalmist, "putteth down one and
   setteth up another." (Ps. lxxv. 7.) "The Lord maketh poor, and maketh
   rich: He bringeth low, and lifteth up." (1 Sam. ii. 7) "The Lord gave,
   and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord." (Job i.
   21.) "It is He that giveth thee power to get wealth." (Deut. viii. 18.)
   "He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know
   understanding." (Dan ii. 21.) "The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of
   men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will." (Dan. iv. 17.) This is a
   truth of natural religion. All men, whether Christians or not, pray for
   the success of their enterprises. They recognize the providential
   control of God over all the affairs of men. Nevertheless they are fully
   aware of the consistency of this control with their own free agency and
   responsibility. Every man who makes the acquisition of wealth his
   object in life, is conscious that he does it of his own free choice. He
   lays his own plans; adopts his own means; and acts as freely, and as
   entirely according to the dictates of his own will, as though there
   were no such thing as providence. This is not a delusion. He is
   perfectly free. His character expresses itself in the choice which he
   makes of the end which he desires to secure. He cannot help recognizing
   his responsibility for that choice, and for all the means which he
   adopts to carry it into effect. All this is true in the sphere of
   religion. God places life and death before every man who hears the
   gospel. He warns him of the consequences of a wrong choice. He presents
   and urges all the considerations which should lead to a right
   determination. He assures the sinner that if he forsakes his sin, and
   returns unto the Lord, he shall be pardoned and accepted. He promises
   that if lie asks, he shall receive; if he seeks he shall find. He
   assures him that He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit, than
   parents are to give bread unto their children. If, notwithstanding all
   this, he deliberately prefers the world, refuses to seek the salvation
   of his soul in the appointed way, and finally perishes, he is as
   completely responsible for his character and conduct, and for the
   perdition of his soul, as the man of the world is responsible for the
   pursuit of wealth. In both cases, and equally in both cases, the
   sovereign disposition of God is consistent with the freedom and
   responsibility of the agents. It is, therefore, by looking at only one
   half of the whole truth, that the difficulties in question are
   magnified into such importance. Men act as freely in religion as they
   do in any department of life; and when they perish it is the work of
   their own hands.

   These Objections were urged against the Teachings of the Apostle.

   Another remark respecting these objections should not be overlooked.
   They were urged by the Jews against the doctrine of the Apostle. This
   at least proves that his doctrine is our doctrine. Had he not taught
   what all Augustinians hold to be true, there would have been no room
   for such objections. Had he denied that God dispenses salvation
   according to his own good pleasure, having mercy on whom He will have
   mercy, why should the Jews urge that God was unjust and that the
   responsibility of man was destroyed? What appearance of injustice could
   there have been had Paul taught that God elects those whom He foresees
   will repent and believe, and because of that foresight? It is only
   because he clearly asserts the sovereignty of God that the objections
   have any place. The answers which Paul gives to these difficulties
   should satisfy us for two reasons; first, because they are the answers
   dictated by the Spirit of God; and secondly, because they are in
   themselves satisfactory to every rightly constituted mind.

   The first of these objections is that it is inconsistent with the
   justice of God to save one and not another, according to his own good
   pleasure. To this Paul answers, (1.) That God claims this prerogative.
   (2.) That He actually exercises it. It is useless to deny facts, or to
   say that what God really does is inconsistent with his nature. (3.)
   That it is a rightful prerogative, founded not only on the infinite
   superiority of God and in his proprietorship in all his creatures; but
   also in his relation as moral governor to the race of sinful men. If
   even a human sovereign is entitled to exercise his discretion in
   pardoning one criminal and not another, surely this prerogative cannot
   reasonably be denied to God. There can be no injustice in allowing the
   sentence of a just law to be executed upon an offender. And this is all
   that God does in regard to sinners.

   The further difficulty connected with this subject arising from the
   foreordination of sin, belongs to the subject of decrees, and has
   already been considered. The same remark applies to the objection that
   the doctrine in question destroys all motive to exertion and to the use
   of means of grace; and reduces the doctrine of the Scriptures to a
   purely fatalistic system.

   The practical tendency of any doctrine is to be decided from its
   nature, and from its effects. The natural effect of the conviction that
   we have forfeited all claims on God's justice, that we are at his
   mercy, and that He may rightfully leave us to perish in our sins, is to
   lead us to seek that mercy with earnestness and importunity. And the
   experience of the Church in all ages proves that such is the actual
   effect of the doctrine in question. It has not led to neglect, to
   stolid unconcern, or to rebellious opposition to God, but to
   submission, to the acknowledgment of the truth, and to sure trust in
   Christ as the appointed Saviour of those who deserve to perish.

CHAPTER II.

  THE COVENANT OF GRACE.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Plan of Salvation is a Covenant.

   The plan of salvation is presented under the form of a covenant. This
   is evident, --

   First, from the constant use of the words bryt and diatheke in
   reference to it. With regard to the former of these words, although it
   is sometimes used for a law, disposition, or arrangement in general,
   where the elements of a covenant strictly speaking are absent, yet
   there can be no doubt that according to its prevailing usage in the Old
   Testament, it means a mutual contract between two or more parties. It
   is very often used of compacts between individuals, and especially
   between kings and rulers. Abraham and Abimelech made a covenant. (Gen.
   xxi. 27.) Joshua made a covenant with the people. (Josh. xxiv. 25.)
   Jonathan and David made a covenant. (1 Sam. xviii. 3) Jonathan made a
   covenant with the house of David. (1 Sam. xx. 16.) Ahab made a covenant
   with Benhadad. (1 Kings xx. 34.) So we find it constantly. There is
   therefore no room to doubt that the word bryt when used of transactions
   between man and man means a mutual compact. We have no right to give it
   any other sense when used of transactions between God and man. Repeated
   mention is made of the covenant of God with Abraham, as in Gen. xv. 18;
   xvii. 13, and afterwards with Isaac and Jacob. Then with the Israelites
   at Mount Sinai. The Old Testament is founded on this idea of a covenant
   relation between God and the theocratic people.

   The meaning of the word diatheke in the Greek Scriptures is just as
   certain and uniform. It is derived from the verb diatithemi, to
   arrange, and, therefore, in ordinary Greek is used for any arrangement,
   or disposition. In the Scriptures it is almost uniformly used in the
   sense of a covenant. In the Septuagint it is the translation of bryt in
   all the cases above referred to. It is the term always used in the New
   Testament to designate the covenant with Abraham, with the Israelites,
   and with believers. The old covenant and the new are presented in
   contrast. Both were covenants. If the word has this meaning when
   applied to the transaction with Abraham and with the Hebrews, it must
   have the same meaning when applied to the plan of salvation revealed in
   the gospel.

   Secondly, that the plan of salvation is presented in the Bible under
   the form of a covenant is proved not only from the signification and
   usage of the words above mentioned, but also and more decisively from
   the fact that the elements of a covenant are included in this plan.
   There are parties, mutual promises or stipulations, and conditions. So
   that it is in fact a covenant, whatever it may be called. As this is
   the Scriptural mode of representation, it is of great importance that
   it should be retained in theology. Our only security for retaining the
   truths of the Bible, is to adhere to the Scriptures as closely as
   possible in our mode of presenting the doctrines therein revealed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Different Views of the Nature of this Covenant.

   It is assumed by many that the parties to the covenant of grace are God
   and fallen man. Man by his apostasy having forfeited the favour of God,
   lost the divine image, and involved himself in sin and misery, must
   have perished in this state, had not God provided a plan of salvation.
   Moved by compassion for his fallen creatures, God determined to send
   his Son into the world, to assume their nature, and to do and suffer
   whatever was requisite for their salvation. On the ground of this
   redeeming work of Christ, God promises salvation to all who will comply
   with the terms on which it is offered. This general statement embraces
   forms of opinion which differ very much one from the others.

   1. It includes even the Pelagian view of the plan of salvation, which
   assumes that there is no difference between the covenant of works under
   which Adam was placed, and the covenant of grace, under which men are
   now, except as to the extent of the obedience required. God promised
   life to Adam on the condition of perfect obedience, because he was in a
   condition to render such obedience. He promises salvation to men now on
   the condition of ouch obedience as they are able to render, whether
   Jews, Pagans, or Christians. According to this view the parties to the
   covenant are God and man; the promise is life; the condition is
   obedience, such as man in the use of his natural powers is able to
   render.

   2. The Remonstrant system does not differ essentially from the
   Pelagian, so far as the parties, the promise and the condition of the
   covenant are concerned. The Remonstrants also make God and man the
   parties, life the promise, and obedience the condition. But they regard
   fallen men as in a state of sin by nature, as needing supernatural
   grace which is furnished to all, and the obedience required is the
   obedience of faith, or fides obsequiosa, faith as including and
   securing evangelical obedience. Salvation under the gospel is as truly
   by works as under the law; but the obedience required is not the
   perfect righteousness demanded of Adam, but such as fallen man, by the
   aid of the Spirit, is now able to perform.

   3. Wesleyan Arminianism greatly exalts the work of Christ, the
   importance of the Spirit's influence, and the grace of the gospel above
   the standard adopted by the Remonstrants. The two systems, however, are
   essentially the same. The work of Christ has equal reference to all
   men. It secures for all the promise of salvation on the condition of
   evangelical obedience; and it obtains for all, Jews and Gentiles,
   enough measures of divine grace to render such obedience practicable.
   The salvation of each individual man depends on the use which he makes
   of this sufficient grace.

   4. The Lutherans also hold that God had the serious purpose to save all
   men; that Christ died equally for all; that salvation is offered to all
   who hear the gospel, on the condition, not of works or of evangelical
   obedience, but of faith alone; faith, however, is the gift of God; men
   have not the power to believe, but they have the power of effectual
   resistance; and those, and those only, under the gospel, who wilfully
   resist, perish, and for that reason. According to all these views,
   which were more fully stated in the receding chapter, the covenant of
   grace is a compact between God and fallen man, in which God promises
   salvation on condition of a compliance with the demands of the gospel.
   What those demands are, as we have seen, is differently explained.

   The essential distinctions between the above-mentioned views of the
   plan of salvation, or covenant of grace, and the Augustinian system,
   are, (1.) That, according to the former, its provisions have equal
   reference to all mankind, whereas according to the latter they have
   special reference to that portion of our race who are actually saved;
   and (2.) That Augustinianism says that it is God and not man who
   determines who are to be saved. As has been already frequently
   remarked, the question which of these systems is true is not to be
   decided by ascertaining which is the more agreeable to our feelings or
   the more plausible to our understanding, but which is consistent with
   the doctrines of the Bible and the facts of experience. This point has
   already been discussed. Our present object is simply to state what
   Angustinians mean by the covenant of grace.

   The word grace is used in Scripture and in ordinary religious writings
   in three senses. (1.) For unmerited love; i.e., love exercised towards
   the undeserving. (2.) For any unmerited favour, especially for
   spiritual blessings. Hence, all the fruits of the Spirit in believers
   are called graces, or unmerited gifts of God. (3.) The word grace often
   means the supernatural influence of the Holy Ghost. This is
   preëminently grace, being the great gift secured by the work of Christ,
   and without which his redemption would not avail to our salvation. In
   all these senses of the word the plan of salvation is properly called a
   covenant of grace. It is of grace because it originated in the
   mysterious love of God for sinners who deserved only his wrath and
   curse. Secondly, because it promises salvation, not on the condition of
   works or anything meritorious on our part, but as an unmerited gift.
   And, thirdly, because its benefits are secured and applied not in the
   course of nature, or in the exercise of the natural powers of the
   sinner, but by the supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit, granted
   to him as an unmerited gift.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Parties to the Covenant.

   At first view there appears to be some confusion in the statements of
   the Scriptures as to the parties to this covenant. Sometimes Christ is
   presented as one of the parties; at others He is represented not as a
   party, but as the mediator and surety of the covenant; while the
   parties are represented to be God and his people. As the old covenant
   was made between God and the Hebrews, and Moses acted as mediator, so
   the new covenant is commonly represented in the Bible as formed between
   God and his people, Christ acting as mediator. He is, therefore, called
   the mediator of a better covenant founded on better promises.

   Some theologians propose to reconcile these modes of representation by
   saying that as the covenant of works was formed with Adam as the
   representative of his race, and therefore in him with all mankind
   descending from him by ordinary generation; so the covenant of grace
   was formed with Christ as the head and representative of his people,
   and in Him with all those given to Him by the Father. This simplifies
   the matter, and agrees with the parallel which the Apostle traces
   between Adam and Christ in Rom. v. 12-21, and 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22, 47-49.
   Still it does not remove the incongruity of Christ's being represented
   as at once a party and a mediator of the same covenant. There are in
   fact two covenants relating to the salvation of fallen man, the one
   between God and Christ, the other between God and his people. These
   covenants differ not only in their parties, but also in their promises
   and conditions. Both are so clearly presented in the Bible that they
   should not be confounded. The latter, the covenant of grace, is founded
   on the former, the covenant of redemption. Of the one Christ is the
   mediator and surety; of the other He is one of the contracting parties.

   This is a matter which concerns only perspicuity of statement. There is
   no doctrinal difference between those who prefer the one statement and
   those who prefer the other; between those who comprise all the facts of
   Scripture relating to the subject under one covenant between God and
   Christ as the representative of his people, and those who distribute
   them under two. The Westminster standards seem to adopt sometimes the
   one and sometimes the other mode of representation. In the Confession
   of Faith [297] it is said, "Man, by his fall, having made himself
   incapable of life by that covenant [i.e., by the covenant of works],
   the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of
   grace; wherein He freely offereth unto sinners life and salvation by
   Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in Him, that they may be saved,
   and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto life, his
   Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe." Here the
   implication is that God and his people are the parties; for in a
   covenant the promises are made to one of the parties, and here it is
   said that life and salvation are promised to sinners, and that faith is
   demanded of them. The same view is presented in the Shorter Catechism,
   according to the natural interpretation of the answer to the twentieth
   question. It is there said, "God having out of his mere good pleasure,
   from all eternity, elected some to everlasting life, did enter into a
   covenant of grace, to deliver them out of the estate of sin and misery,
   and to bring them into an estate of salvation by a Redeemer." In the
   Larger Catechism, however, the other view is expressly adopted. In the
   answer to the question, [298] "With whom was the covenant of grace
   made?" it is said, "The covenant of grace was made with Christ as the
   second Adam, and in Him with all the elect as his seed."

   Two Covenants to be Distinguished.

   This confusion is avoided by distinguishing between the covenant of
   redemption between the Father and the Son, and the covenant of grace
   between God and his people. The latter supposes the former, and is
   founded upon it. The two, however, ought not to be confounded, as both
   are clearly revealed in Scripture, and moreover they differ as to the
   parties, as to the promises, and as to the conditions. On this subject
   Turrettin says, [299] "Atque hic superfluum videtur quærere, An foedus
   hoc contractum fuerit cum Christo, tanquam altera parte contrahente, et
   in ipso cum toto ejus semine, ut primum foedus cum Adamo pactum fuerat,
   et in Adamo cum tota ejus posteritate: quod non paucis placet, quia
   promissiones ipsi dicuntur factæ, Gal. iii. 16, et quia, ut Caput et
   Princeps populi sui, in omnibus primas tenet, ut nihil nisi in ipso et
   ab ipso obtineri possit: An vero foedus contractum sit in Christo cum
   toto semine, ut non tam habeat rationem partis contrahentis, quam
   partis mediæ, quæ inter dissidentes stat ad eos reconciliandos, ut
   aliis satius videtur. Superfiuum, inquam, est de eo disceptare, quia
   res eodem redit; et certum est duplex hic pactum necessario attendendum
   esse, vel unius ejusdem pacti duas partes et gradus. Prius pactum est,
   quod inter Patrem et Filium intercedit, ad opus redemptionis
   exequendum. Posterius est, quod Deus cum electis in Christo contrahit,
   de illis per et propter Christum salvandis sub conditione fidei et
   resipiscentiæ. Prius fit cum Sponsore et capite ad salutem membrorum:
   Posterius fit cum membris in capite et sponsore."

   The same view is taken by Witsius: [300] "Ut Foederis gratiæ natura
   penitius perspecta sit, duo imprimis distincte consideranda sunt. (1.)

   § 4. Covenant of Redemption.

   By this is meant the covenant between the Father and the Son in
   reference to the salvation of man. This is a subject which, from its
   nature, is entirely beyond our comprehension. We must receive the
   teachings of the Scriptures in relation to it without presuming to
   penetrate the mystery which naturally belongs to it. There is only one
   God, one divine Being, to whom all the attributes of divinity belong.
   But in the Godhead there are three persons, the same in substance, and
   equal in power and glory. It lies in the nature of personality, that
   one person is objective to another. If therefore, the Father and the
   Son are distinct persons the one be the object of the acts of the
   other. The one may love, address, and commune with the other. The
   Father may send the Son, may give Him a work to do, and promise Him a
   recompense. All this is indeed incomprehensible to us, but being
   clearly taught in Scripture, it must enter into the Christian's faith.

   In order to prove that there is a covenant between the Father and the
   Son, formed in eternity, and revealed in time, it is not necessary that
   we should adduce passages of the Scriptures in which this truth is
   expressly asserted. There are indeed passages which are equivalent to
   such direct assertions. This is implied in the frequently recurring
   statements of the Scripture that the plan of God respecting the
   salvation of men was of the nature of a covenant, and was formed in
   eternity. Paul says that it was hidden for ages in the divine mind;
   that it was before the foundation of the world. Christ speaks of
   promises made to Him before his advent; and that He came into the world
   in execution of a commission which He had received from the Father. The
   parallel so distinctly drawn between Adam and Christ is also a proof of
   the point in question. As Adam was the head and representative of his
   posterity, so Christ is the head and representative of his people. And
   as God entered into covenant with Adam so He entered into covenant with
   Christ. This, in Rom. v. 12-21, is set forth as the fundamental idea of
   all God's dealings with men, both in their fall and in their
   redemption.

   The proof of the doctrine has, however, a much wider foundation. When
   one person assigns a stipulated work to another person with the promise
   of a reward upon the condition of the performance of that work, there
   is a covenant. Nothing can be plainer than that all this is true in
   relation to the Father and the Son. The Father gave the Son a work to
   do; He sent Him into the world to perform it, and promised Him a great
   reward when the work was accomplished. Such is the constant
   representation of the Scriptures. We have, therefore, the contracting
   parties, the promise, and the condition. These are the essential
   elements of a covenant. Such being the representation of Scripture,
   such must be the truth to which we are bound to adhere. It is not a
   mere figure, but a real transaction, and should be regarded and treated
   as such if we would understand aright the plan of salvation. In the
   fortieth Psalm. expounded by the Apostle as referring to the Messiah,
   it is said, "Lo, I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me,
   I delight to do thy will." i.e. to execute thy purpose, to carry on thy
   plan. "By the which will," says the Apostle (Heb. x. 10), "we are
   sanctified (i.e., cleansed from the guilt of sin), through the offering
   of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." Christ came, therefore, in
   execution of a purpose of God, to fulfil a work which had been assigned
   Him. He, therefore, in John xvii. 4, says, "I have finished the work
   which thou gavest me to do." This was said at the close of his earthly
   course. At its beginning, when yet a child, He said to his parents,
   "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" (Luke ii. 49.)
   Our Lord speaks of Himself, and is spoken of as sent into the world. He
   says that as the Father had sent Him into the world, even so had He
   sent his disciples into the world. (John xvii. 18.) "When the fulness
   of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman." (Gal.
   iv. 4.) "God sent his only begotten Son into the world." (1 John iv.
   9.) God "sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." (Verse 10.)

   It is plain, therefore, that Christ came to execute a work, that He was
   sent of the Father to fulfil a plan, or preconceived design. It is no
   less plain that special promises were made by the Father to the Son,
   suspended upon the accomplishment of the work assigned Him. This may
   appear as an anthropological mode of representing a transaction between
   the persons of the adorable Trinity. But it must be received as
   substantial truth. The Father did give the Son a work to do, and He did
   promise to him a reward upon its accomplishment. The transaction was,
   therefore, of the nature of a covenant. An obligation was assumed by
   the Son to accomplish the work assigned Him; and an obligation was
   assumed by the Father to grant Him the stipulated reward. The
   infinitude of God does not prevent these things being possible.

   As the exhibition of the work of Christ in the redemption of man
   constitutes a large part of the task of the theologian, all that is
   proper in this place is a simple reference to the Scriptural statements
   on the subject.

   The Work assigned to the Redeemer.

   (1) He was to assume our nature, humbling Himself to be born of a
   woman, and to be found in fashion as a man. This was to be a real
   incarnation, not a mere theophany such as occurred repeatedly under the
   old dispensation. He was to become flesh: to take part of flesh and
   body; to be bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh, made in all things
   like unto his brethren, yet without sin, that He might be touched with
   a sense of our infirmities, and able to sympathize with those who are
   tempted, being Himself also tempted. (2.) He was to be made under the
   law, voluntarily undertaking to fulfil all righteousness by obeying the
   law of God perfectly in all the forms in which it had been made
   obligatory on man. (3.) He was to bear our sins, to be a curse for us,
   offering Himself as a sacrifice, or propitiation to God in expiation of
   the sins of men. This involved his whole life of humiliation, sorrow,
   and suffering, and his ignominious death upon the cross under the
   hiding of his Father's countenance. What He was to do after this
   pertains to his exaltation and reward.

   The Promises made to the Redeemer.

   Such, in general terms, was the work which the Son of God undertook to
   perform. The promises of the Father to the Son conditioned on the
   accomplishment of that work, were, (1.) That He would prepare Him a
   body, fit up a tabernacle for Him, formed as was the body of Adam by
   the immediate agency of God, uncontaminated and without spot or
   blemish. (2.) That He would give the Spirit to Him without measure,
   that his whole human nature should be replenished with grace and
   strength, and so adorned with the beauty of holiness that He should be
   altogether lovely. (3.) That He would be ever at his right hand to
   support and comfort Him in the darkest hours of his conflict with the
   powers of darkness, and that He would ultimately bruise Satan under his
   feet. (4.) That He would deliver Him from the power of death, and exalt
   Him to his own right hand in heaven; and that all power in heaven and
   earth should be committed to Him. (5.) That He, as the Theanthropos and
   head of the Church, should have the Holy Spirit to send to whom He
   willed, to renew their hearts, to satisfy and comfort them, and to
   qualify them for his service and kingdom. (6.) That all given to Him by
   the Father should come to Him, and be kept by Him, so that none of them
   should be lost. (7.) That a multitude whom no man can number should
   thus be made partakers of his redemption, and that ultimately the
   kingdom of the Messiah should embrace all the nations of the earth.
   (8.) That through Christ, in Him, and in his ransomed Church, there
   should be made the highest manifestation of the divine perfections to
   all orders of holy intelligences throughout eternity. The Son of God
   was thus to see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 5. The Covenant of Grace.

   In virtue of what the Son of God covenanted to perform, and what in the
   fulness of time He actually accomplished, agreeably to the stipulations
   of the compact with thu Father, two things follow. First, salvation is
   offered to all men on the condition of faith in Christ. Our Lord
   commanded his disciples to go into all the world and preach the gospel
   to every creature. The gospel, however, is the offer of salvation upon
   the conditions of the covenant of grace. In this sense, the covenant of
   grace is formed with all mankind. And, therefore, Turrettin [301] says,
   "Foedus hoc gratiæ est pactum gratuitum inter Deum offensum et hominem
   offendentem in Christo initum, in quo Deus homini gratis propter
   Christum remissionem peccatorum et salutem pollicetur, homo vero eadem
   gratia fretus pollicetur fidem et obedientiam." And the Westminster
   Confession [302] says, "Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable
   of life by that covenant [namely, by the covenant of works], the Lord
   was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace:
   wherein He freely offereth unto sinners [and all sinners] life and
   salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in Him, that they
   may be saved, and promising to give unto all those that are ordained
   unto life, his Holy Spirit, to make them able and willing to believe."
   If this, therefore, were all that is meant by those who make the
   parties to the covenant of grace, God and mankind in general and all
   mankind equally, there would be no objection to the doctrine. For it is
   undoubtedly true that God offers to all and every man eternal life on
   condition of faith in Jesus Christ. But as it is no less true that the
   whole scheme of redemption has special reference to those given by the
   Father to the Son, and of whom our Lord says, "All that the Father
   giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise
   cast out" (John vi. 37), it follows, secondly, from the nature of the
   covenant between the Father and the Son, that the covenant of grace has
   also special reference to the elect. To them God has promised to give
   his Spirit in order that they may believe; and to them alone all the
   promises made to believers belong. Those who ignore the distinction
   between the covenants of redemption and of grace, merging the latter in
   the former, of course represent the parties to the covenant to be God
   and Christ as the head and representative of his own people. And
   therefore mankind, as such, are in no sense parties. All that is
   important is, that we should adopt such a mode of representation as
   will comprehend the various facts recognized in the Scriptures. It is
   one of those facts that salvation is offered to all men on the
   condition of faith in Christ. And therefore to that extent, or, in a
   sense which accounts for that fact, the covenant of grace is made with
   all men. The great sin of those who hear the gospel is that they refuse
   to accept of that covenant and therefore place themselves without its
   pale.

   Christ as Mediator of the Covenant.

   As Christ is a party to the covenant of redemption, so He is constantly
   represented as the mediator of the covenant of grace; not only in the
   sense of an internuncius, as Moses was a mediator between God and the
   people of Israel, but in the sense, (1.) That it was through his
   intervention, and solely on the ground of what He had done, or promised
   to do, that God entered into this new covenant with fallen men. And,
   (2.) in the sense of a surety. He guarantees the fulfilment of all the
   promises and conditions of the covenant. His blood was the blood of the
   covenant. That is, his death had all the effects of a federal
   sacrifice, it not only bound the parties to the contract, but it also
   secured the fulfilment of all its provisions. Hence He is called not
   only Mesites, but also Enguos (Heb. vii. 22), a sponsor, or surety. By
   fulfilling the conditions on which the promises of the covenant of
   redemption were suspended, the veracity and justice of God are pledged
   to secure the salvation of his people; and this secures the fidelity of
   his people. So that Christ answers both for God and man. His work
   renders certain the gifts of God's grace, and the perseverance of his
   people in faith and obedience. He is therefore, in every sense, our
   salvation.

   The Condition of the Covenant.

   The condition of the covenant of grace, so far as adults are concerned,
   is faith in Christ. That is, in order to partake of the benefits of
   this covenant we must receive the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God
   in whom and for whose sake its blessings are vouchsafed to the children
   of men. Until we thus believe we are aliens and strangers from the
   covenant of promise, without God and without Christ. We must acquiesce
   in this covenant, renouncing all other methods of salvation, and
   consenting to be saved on the terms which it proposes, before we are
   made partakers of its benefits. The word "condition," however, is used
   in two senses. Sometimes it means the meritorious consideration on the
   ground of which certain benefits are bestowed. In this sense perfect
   obedience was the condition of the covenant originally made with Adam.
   Had he retained his integrity he would have merited the promised
   blessing. For to him that worketh the reward is not of grace but of
   debt. In the same sense the work of Christ is the condition of the
   covenant of redemption. It was the meritorious ground, laying a
   foundation in justice for the fulfilment of the promises made to Him by
   the Father. But in other cases, by condition we merely mean a sine qua
   non. A blessing may be promised on condition that it is asked for; or
   that there is a willingness to receive it. There is no merit in the
   asking or in the willingness, which is the ground of the gift. It
   remains a gratuitous favour; but it is, nevertheless, suspended upon
   the act of asking. It is in this last sense only that faith is the
   condition of the covenant of grace. There is no merit in believing. It
   is only the act of receiving a proffered favour. In either case the
   necessity is equally absolute. Without the work of Christ there would
   be no salvation; and without faith there is no salvation. He that
   believeth on the Son hath everlasting life. He that believeth not,
   shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.

   The Promises of the Covenant.

   The promises of this covenant are all included in the comprehensive
   formula, so often occurring in the Scriptures, "I will be your God, and
   ye shall be my people." This involves the complete restoration of our
   normal relation to God. All ground of alienation, every bar to
   fellowship is removed. He communicates Himself in his fulness to his
   people; and they become his by entire conformity to his will and
   devotion to his service, and are the special objects of his favour.

   God is said to be our God, not only because He is the God whom we
   acknowledge and profess to worship and obey, as He was the God of the
   Hebrews in distinction from the Gentiles who did not acknowledge his
   existence or profess to be his worshippers, but He is our God, -- our
   infinite portion; the source to us of all that God is to those who are
   the objects of his love. His perfections are revealed to us as the
   highest knowledge; they are all pledged for our protection,
   blessedness, and glory. His being our God implies also that He assures
   us of his love, and admits us to communion with Himself. As his favour
   is life, and his loving kindness better than life; as the vision of
   God, the enjoyment of his love and fellowship with Him secure the
   highest possible exaltation and beatification of his creatures, it is
   plain that the promise to be our God, in the Scriptural sense of the
   term, includes all conceivable and all possible good.

   When it is said that we are to be his people it means, (1.) That we are
   his peculiar possession. His delights are with the children of men.
   From the various orders of rational creatures. He has chosen man to be
   the special object of his favour, and the special medium through which
   and by which to manifest his glory. And from the mass of fallen men He
   has, of his own good pleasure, chosen an innumerable multitude to be
   his portion, as He condescends to call them; on whom He lavishes the
   plenitude of his grace, and in whom He reveals his glory to the
   admiration of all holy intelligences. (2.) That being thus selected for
   the special love of God and for the highest manifestation of his glory,
   they are in all things fitted for this high destiny. They are
   justified, sanctified, and glorified. They are rendered perfectly
   conformed to his image, devoted to his service, and obedient to his
   will.

   § 6. The Identity of the Covenant of Grace under all Dispensations.

   By this is meant that the plan of salvation has, under all
   dispensations, the Patriarchal, the Mosaic, and the Christian, been the
   same. On this subject much diversity of opinion, and still more of mode
   of statement has prevailed. Socinians say that under the old economy,
   there was no promise of eternal life; and that the condition of
   salvation was not faith in Christ. The Remonstrants admitted that the
   patriarchs were saved, and that they were saved through Christ, i.e.,
   in virtue of the work which the Redeemer was to accomplish; but they
   also questioned whether any direct promise of eternal life was given in
   the Old Testament, or whether faith in the Redeemer was the condition
   of acceptance with God. On this subject the "Apology for the Confession
   of the Remonstrants" says [303] concerning faith in Jesus Christ, "Et
   certum esse locum nullum esse unde appareat fidem istam sub V. T.
   præceptam fuisse, aut viguisse." And Episcopius [304] says, "Ex his
   facile colligere est, quid statuendum sit de quæstione illa famosa, An
   vitæ æternæ promissio etiam in Veteri foedere locum habuerit, vel
   potius in foedere ipso comprehensa fuerit. Si enim speciales
   promissiones in foedere ipso veteri expressæ videantur, fatendum est,
   nullam vitæ æternæ promissionem disertam in illis reperiri. Si quis
   contra sentiat, ejus est locum dare ubi illa exstat: quod puto
   impossibile esse. Sed vero, si promissiones Dei generales videantur,
   fatendum ex altera parte est, eas tales esse, ut promissio vitæ æternæ
   non subesse tantum videatur, sed ex Dei intentione eam eis subfuisse
   etiam credidebeat."

   The Baptists, especially those of the time of the Reformation, do not
   hold the common doctrine on this subject. The Anabaptists not only
   spoke in very disparaging terms of the old economy and of the state of
   the Jews under that dispensation, but it was necessary to their
   peculiar system, that they should deny that the covenant made with
   Abraham included the covenant of grace. Baptists hold that infants
   cannot be church members, and that the sign of such membership cannot
   properly be administered to any who have not knowledge and faith. But
   it cannot be denied that infants were included in the covenant made
   with Abraham, and that they received circumcision, its appointed seal
   and sign. It is therefore essential to their theory that the Abrahamic
   covenant should be regarded as a merely national covenant entirely
   distinct from the covenant of grace.

   The Romanists assuming that saving grace is communicated through the
   sacraments, and seeing that the mass of the ancient Israelites, on many
   occasions at least, were rejected of God, notwithstanding their
   participation of the sacraments then ordained, were driven to assume a
   radical difference between the sacraments of the Old Testament and
   those of the New. The former only signified grace, the latter actually
   conveyed it. From this it follows that those living before the
   institution of the Christian sacraments were not actually saved. Their
   sins were not remitted, but pretermitted, passed over. At death they
   were not admitted into heaven, but passed into a place and state called
   the limbus patrum, where they remained in a negative condition until
   the coming of Christ, who after his death descended to hell, sheol, for
   their deliverance.

   In opposition to these different views the common doctrine of the
   Church has ever been, that the plan of salvation has been the same from
   the beginning. There is the same promise of deliverance from the evils
   of the apostasy, the same Redeemer, the same condition required for
   participation. in the blessings of redemption, and the same complete
   salvation for all who embrace the offers of divine mercy.

   In determining the degree of knowledge possessed by the ancient people
   of God, we are not to be governed by our own capacity of discovering
   from the Old Testament Scriptures the doctrines of grace. What amount
   of supplementary instruction the people received from the prophets, or
   what degree of divine illumination was granted to them we cannot tell.
   It is, however, clear from the writings of the New Testament, that the
   knowledge of the plan of salvation current among the Jews at the time
   of the advent, was much greater than we should deem possible from the
   mere perusal of the Old Testament. They not only generally and
   confidently expected the Messiah, who was to be a teacher as well as a
   deliverer, but the devout Jews waited for the salvation of Israel. They
   spoke as familiarly of the Holy Spirit and of the baptism which He was
   to effect, as Christians now do. It is, principally, from the
   assertions of the New Testament writers and from their expositions of
   the ancient Scriptures, that we learn the amount of truth revealed to
   those who lived before the coming of Christ.

   From the Scriptures, therefore, as a whole, from the New Testament, and
   from the Old as interpreted by infallible authority in the New, we
   learn that the plan of salvation has always been one and the same;
   having the same promise, the same Saviour, the same condition, and the
   same salvation.

   The Promise of Eternal Life made before the Advent.

   That the promise was the same to those who lived before the advent that
   it is to us, is plain. Immediately after the fall God gave to Adam the
   promise of redemption. That promise was contained in the prediction
   that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head. In this
   passage it is clear that the serpent is Satan. He was the tempter, and
   on him the curse pronounced was designed to fall. Bruising his head
   implies fatal injury or overthrow. The prince of darkness who had
   triumphed over our first parents, was to be cast down, and despoiled of
   his victory. This overthrow was to be accomplished by the seed of the
   woman. This phrase might mean the posterity of the woman, and in this
   sense would convey an important truth; man was to triumph over Satan.
   But it evidently had a more specific reference. It refers to one
   individual, who in a sense peculiar to himself, was to be the seed of
   the woman. This is clear from the analogy of prophecy. When it was
   promised to Abraham that in his seed all the nations of the earth
   should be blessed; it would be very natural to understand by seed his
   posterity, the Hebrew people. But we know certainly, from the direct
   assertion of the Apostle (Gal. iii. 10), that one individual, namely,
   Christ, was intended. So when Isaiah predicts that the "servant of the
   Lord" was to suffer, to triumph, and to be the source of blessings to
   all people, many understood, and many still understand him to speak of
   the Jewish nation, as God so often speaks of his servant Israel. Yet
   the servant intended was the Messiah, and the people were no further
   included in the prediction than when it is said that "salvation is of
   the Jews." In all these and similar cases we have two guides as to the
   real meaning of the Spirit. The one is found in subsequent and
   explanatory declarations of the Scriptures, the other is in the
   fulfilment of the predictions. We know from the event who the seed of
   the woman; who the seed of Abraham; who the Shiloh; who the Son of
   David; who the servant of the Lord were; for in Christ and by Him was
   fulfilled all that was predicted of them. The seed of the woman was to
   bruise the serpent's head. But it was Christ, and Christ alone, who
   came into the world to destroy the works of the Devil. This he declared
   to be the purpose of his mission. Satan was the strong man armed whom
   Christ came to dispossess and to deliver from him those who were led
   captive by him at his will. We have, then, the promise of redemption
   made to our first parents immediately after the fall, to be by them
   communicated to their descendants to be kept in perpetual remembrance.
   This promise was repeated and amplified from time to time, until the
   Redeemer actually came. In these additional and fuller predictions, the
   nature of this redemption was set forth with ever increasing clearness.
   This general promise included many specific promises. Thus we find God
   promising to his faithful people the forgiveness of their sins,
   restoration to his favour, the renewing of their hearts, and the gift
   of his Spirit. No higher blessings than these are offered under the
   Christian dispensation. And for these blessings the ancient people of
   God earnestly longed and prayed. The Old Testament, and especially the
   Psalms and other devotional parts of the early Scriptures, are filled
   with the record of such prayers and longings. Nothing can be plainer
   than that pardon and the favour of God were promised holy men before
   the coming of Christ, and these are the blessings which are now
   promised to us.

   The Apostle in Heb. xi. teaches that the hopes of the patriarchs were
   not confined to the present life, but were fixed on a future state of
   existence. Such a state, therefore, must have been revealed to them,
   and eternal life must have been promised to them. Thus he says (chapter
   xi. 10), that Abraham "looked for the city which hath foundations,
   whose builder and maker is God." That this was heaven is plain from
   verse 16, where it is said, "They desire a better country, that is, an
   heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He
   hath prepared for them a city." He tells us that these ancient worthies
   gladly sacrificed all earthly good, and even life itself, "not
   accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection."
   That this was the common faith of the Jews long before the coming of
   Christ appears from 2 Macc. vii. 9, where the dying martyr says to his
   tormentor, "Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life, but
   the King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for his laws,
   unto everlasting life." Our Lord teaches us that Abraham, Isaac, and
   Jacob are still alive; and that where Abraham is, is heaven. His bosom
   was the resting-place of the faithful.

   Christ, the Redeemer, under both Dispensations.

   This is a very imperfect exhibition of the evidence which the
   Scriptures afford that the promise of redemption, and of all that
   redemption includes, pardon, sanctification, the favour of God, and
   eternal life, was made to the people of God from the beginning. It is
   no less clear that the Redeemer is the same under all dispensations. He
   who was predicted as the seed of the woman, as the seed of Abraham, the
   Son of David, the Branch, the Servant of the Lord, the Prince of Peace,
   is our Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, God manifest in the flesh.
   He, therefore, from the beginning has been held up as the hope of the
   world, the Salvator hominum. He was set forth in all his offices, as
   Prophet, Priest, and King. His work was described as a sacrifice, as
   well as a redemption. All this is so obvious, and so generally
   admitted, as to render the citation of proof texts unnecessary. It is
   enough to refer to the general declarations of the New Testament on
   this subject. Our Lord commanded the Jews to search their Scriptures,
   because they testified of Him. He said that Moses and the prophets
   wrote of Him. Beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded to
   the disciples in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. The
   Apostles when they began to preach the gospel, not only everywhere
   proved from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ, but they referred
   to them continually in support of everything which they taught
   concerning his person and his work. It is from the Old Testament they
   prove his divinity; his incarnation; the sacrificial nature of his
   death; that He was truly a Priest to make reconciliation for the
   people, as well as a Prophet and a King; and that He was to die, to
   rise again on the third day, to ascend into heaven, and to be invested
   with absolute authority over all the earth, and aver all orders of
   created beings. There is not a doctrine concerning Christ, taught in
   the New Testament, which the Apostles do not affirm to have been
   revealed under former dispensations. They therefore distinctly assert
   that it was through Him and the efficacy of his death that men were
   saved before, as well as after his advent. The Apostle Paul says (Rom.
   iii. 25), that Christ was set forth as a propitiation for the remission
   of sins, not only en to nun kairo but also of the sins committed before
   the present time, during the forbearance of God. And in Heb. ix. 15, it
   is still more explicitly asserted that He died for the forgiveness of
   sin under the first covenant. He was, therefore, as said in Rev. xiii.
   8, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. This is at least
   the common and most natural interpretation of that passage.

   Such a revelation of the Messiah was undoubtedly made in the Old
   Testament as to turn the eyes of the whole Jewish nation in hope and
   faith. What the two disciples on the way to Emmaus said, "We trusted it
   had been He who should have redeemed Israel," reveals what was the
   general expectation and desire of the people. Paul repeatedly speaks of
   the Messiah as the hope of Israel. The promise of redemption through
   Christ, he declared to be the great object of the people's hope. When
   arraigned before the tribunals of the Jews, and before Agrippa, he
   uniformly declared that in preaching Christ and the resurrection, he
   had not departed from the religion of the fathers, but adhered to it,
   while his enemies had deserted it. "Now I stand, and am judged," he
   says, "for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers." (Acts
   xxvi. 6.) Again he said to the Jews in Rome, Acts xxviii. 20, "For the
   hope of Israel I am bound with this chain." See, also, xxiii. 6; xxiv.
   15. In Eph. i. 12, he designates the Jews as hoi proelpikotes en to
   Christo, those who hoped in the Messiah before his advent. In Acts
   xiii. 7, he says the rulers of the Jews rejected Christ because they
   knew not "the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath day,"
   which they "fulfilled in condemning Him." In Him was "the promise which
   was made unto the fathers," he tells us (verses 32, 33), of which he
   says, "God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that He
   hath raised up (or brought into view) Jesus," the long-expected
   Saviour. It is needless to dwell upon this point, because the doctrine
   of a personal Messiah who was to redeem the people of God, not only
   pervades the Old Testament, but is everywhere in the New Testament
   declared to be the great promise which is fulfilled in the advent and
   work of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Faith the Condition of Salvation from the Beginning.

   As the same promise was made to those who lived before the advent which
   is now made to us in the gospel, as the same Redeemer was revealed to
   them who is presented as the object of faith to us, it of necessity
   follows that the condition, or terms of salvation, was the same then as
   now. It was not mere faith or trust in God, or simply piety, which was
   required, but faith in the promised Redeemer, or faith in the promise
   of redemption through the Messiah.

   This is plain not only from the considerations just mentioned, but also
   further, (1.) From the fact that the Apostle teaches that faith, not
   works, was before as well as after Christ the condition of salvation.
   This, in his Epistle to the Romans, he not only asserts, but proves. He
   argues that from the nature of the case the justification of sinners by
   works is a contradiction. If sinners, they are under condemnation for
   their works, and therefore cannot be justified by them. Moreover he
   proves that the Old Testament everywhere speaks of gratuitous
   forgiveness and acceptance of men with God; but if gratuitous, it
   cannot be meritorious. He further argues from the case of Abraham, who,
   according to the express declaration of the Scriptures, was justified
   by faith; and he quotes from the old prophets the great principle, true
   then as now, that the "just shall live by faith." (2.) In the second
   place, he proves that the faith intended was faith in a promise and not
   merely general piety or confidence toward God. Abraham, he says,
   "staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong
   in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that what He
   had promised He was able also to perform." (Rom. iv. 20, 21.) (3.) The
   Apostle proves that the specific promise which was the object of the
   faith of the patriarch was the promise of redemption through Christ.
   That promise they were required to believe; and that the true people of
   God did believe. The mass of the people mistook the nature of the
   redemption promised; but even in their case it was the promise of
   redemption which was the object of their faith. Those taught by the
   Spirit knew that it was a redemption from the guilt and power of sin
   and from the consequent alienation from God. In Gal. iii. 14, the
   Apostle therefore says that the blessing promised to Abraham has come
   upon the Gentiles. That blessing, therefore was that which through the
   gospel is now offered to all men.

   Not only, therefore, from these explicit declarations that faith in the
   promised Redeemer was required from the beginning, but from the
   admitted fact that the Old Testament is full of the doctrine of
   redemption by the Messiah, it follows that those who received the
   religion of the Old Testament received that doctrine, and exercised
   faith in the promise of God concerning his Son. The Epistle to the
   Hebrews is designed in great part to show that the whole of the Old
   dispensation was an adumbration of the New, and that it loses all its
   value and import if its reference to Christ be ignored. To deny,
   therefore, that the faith of the Old Testament saints was a faith in
   the Messiah and his redemption, is to deny that they had any knowledge
   of the import of the revelations and promises of which they were the
   recipients.

   Paul, in Rom. iii. 21, says that the method of salvation revealed in
   the gospel had been already revealed in the law and the prophets; and
   his definite object, in Gal. iii. 13-28, is to prove that the covenant
   under which we live and according to the terms of which we are to be
   saved, is the identical covenant made with Abraham, in which the
   promise of redemption was made on the condition of faith in Him in whom
   all the nations of the earth were to be blessed This is a covenant
   anterior to the Mosaic law, and which that law could not set aside or
   invalidate.

   The covenant of grace, or plan of salvation, being the same in all its
   elements from the beginning, it follows, first, in opposition to the
   Anabaptists, that the people of God before Christ constituted a Church,
   and that the Church has been one and the same under all dispensations.
   It has always had the same promise, the same Redeemer, and the same
   condition of membership, namely, faith in the Son of God as the Saviour
   of the world.

   It follows from the same premises, in opposition to the Romanists, that
   the salvation of the people of God who died before the coming of
   Christ, was complete. They were truly pardoned, sanctified, and, at
   death, admitted to that state into which those dying in the Christian
   faith are now received. This is confirmed by what our Lord and the
   Apostles teach. The salvation promised us is that on which the Old
   Testament saints have already entered. The Gentile believers are to sit
   down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The bosom of Abraham was the place
   of rest for all the faithful. All that Paul claims for believers under
   the gospel is, that they are the sons of Abraham, and partakers of his
   inheritance. If this is so, then the whole ritual theory which assumes
   that grace and salvation are communicated only through Christian
   sacraments must be false.

   § 7. Different Dispensations.

   First, from Adam to Abraham.

   Although the covenant of grace has always been the same, the
   dispensations of that covenant have changed. The first dispensation
   extended from Adam to Abraham. Of this period we have so few records,
   that we cannot determine how far the truth was revealed, or what
   measures were adopted for its preservation. All we know is, that the
   original promises concerning the seed of the woman, as the Redeemer of
   our race, had been given; and that the worship of God by sacrifices had
   been instituted. That sacrifices were a divine institution, and
   designed to teach the method of salvation, may be inferred, (1.) From
   the fact that it is the method which the common consciousness of men
   has everywhere led them to adopt. It is that which their relation to
   God as sinners demanded. It is the dictate of conscience that guilt
   requires expiation; and that expiation is made by the shedding of
   blood. Sacrifices, therefore, not being an arbitrary institution, but
   one having its foundation in our real relation to God as sinners, we
   may infer that it was by his command, direct or indirect, that such
   sacrifices were offered. (2.) This may also be inferred from God's
   approving them, adopting them, and incorporating them in the religious
   observances subsequently enjoined. (3.) The fact that man was to be
   saved by the sacrifice of Christ, and that this was the great event to
   which the institutions of the earlier dispensations refer, renders it
   clear that this reference was designed, and that it was founded upon
   the institution of God.

   The Second Dispensation.

   The second dispensation extended from Abraham to Moses. This was
   distinguished from the former, (1.) By the selection of the descendants
   of Abraham to be the peculiar people of God. They were chosen in order
   to preserve the knowledge of the true religion in the midst of the
   general apostasy of mankind. To this end special revelations were made
   to them, and God entered into a covenant with them, promising that He
   would be their God, and that they should be his people. (2.) Besides
   thus gathering his Church out of the world, and making its members a
   peculiar people, distinguished by circumcision from the Gentiles around
   them, the promise of redemption was made more definite. The Redeemer
   was to be of the seed of Abraham. He was to be one person. The
   salvation He was to effect should pertain to all nations. (3.)
   Subsequently it was made known that the Deliverer was to be of the
   tribe of Judah.

   The Third Dispensation.

   The third dispensation of this covenant was from Moses to Christ. All
   that belonged to the previous periods was taken up and included in
   this. A multitude of new ordinances of polity, worship, and religion
   were enjoined. A priesthood and a complicated system of sacrifices were
   introduced. The promises were rendered more definite, setting forth
   more clearly by the instructions of the prophets the person and work of
   the coming Redeemer as the prophet, priest, and king of his people. The
   nature of the redemption He was to effect and the nature of the kingdom
   He was to establish were thus more and more clearly revealed. We have
   the direct authority of the New Testament for believing that the
   covenant of grace, or plan of salvation, thus underlay the whole of the
   institutions of the Mosaic period, and that their principal design was
   to teach through types and symbols what is now taught in explicit terms
   in the gospel. Moses, we are told (Heb. iii. 5), was faithful as a
   servant to testify concerning the things which were to be spoken after.

   Besides this evangelical character which unquestionably belongs to the
   Mosaic covenant, it is presented in two other aspects in the Word of
   God. First, it was a national covenant with the Hebrew people. In this
   view the parties were God and the people of Israel; the promise was
   national security and prosperity; the condition was the obedience of
   the people as a nation to the Mosaic law; and the mediator was Moses.
   In this aspect it was a legal covenant. It said. "Do this and live."
   Secondly, it contained, as does also the New Testament, a renewed
   proclamation of the original covenant of works. It is as true now as in
   the days of Adam, it always has been and always must be true, that
   rational creatures who perfectly obey the law of God are blessed in the
   enjoyment of his favour; and that those who sin are subject to his
   wrath and curse. Our Lord assured the young man who came to Him for
   instruction that if he kept the commandments he should live. And Paul
   says (Rom. ii. 6) that God will render to every man according to his
   deeds; tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil;
   but glory, honour, and peace to every man who worketh good. This arises
   from the relation of intelligent creatures to God. It is in fact
   nothing but a declaration of the eternal and immutable principles of
   justice. If a man rejects or neglects the gospel, these are the
   principles, as Paul teaches in the opening chapters of his Epistle to
   the Romans, according to which he will be judged. If he will not be
   under grace, if he will not accede to the method of salvation by grace,
   he is of necessity under the law.

   These different aspects under which the Mosaic economy is presented
   account for the apparently inconsistent way in which it in spoken of in
   the New Testament. (1.) When viewed in relation to the people of God
   before the advent, it is represented as divine and obligatory. (2.)
   When viewed in relation to the state of the Church after the advent, it
   is declared to be obsolete. It is represented as the lifeless husk from
   which the living kernel and germ have been extracted, a body from which
   the soul has departed. (3.) When viewed according to its true import
   and design as a preparatory dispensation of the covenant of grace, it
   is spoken of as teaching the same gospel, the same method of salvation
   as that which the Apostles themselves preached. (4.) When viewed, in
   the light in which it was regarded by those who rejected the gospel, as
   a mere legal system, it was declared to be a ministration of death and
   condemnation. (2 Cor. iii. 6-18.) (5.) And when contrasted with the new
   or Christian economy, as a different mode of revealing the same
   covenant, it is spoken of as a state of tutelage and bondage, far
   different from the freedom and filial spirit of the dispensation under
   which we now live.

   The Gospel Dispensation.

   The gospel dispensation is called new in reference to the Mosaic
   economy, which was old, and about to vanish away. It is distinguished
   from the old economy, --

   1. In being catholic, confined to no one people, but designed and
   adapted to all nations and to all classes of men.

   2. It is more spiritual, not only in that the types and ceremonies of
   the Old Testament are done away, but also in that the revelation itself
   is more inward and spiritual. What was then made known objectively, is
   now, to a greater extent, written on the heart. (Heb. viii. 8-11.) It
   is incomparably more clear and explicit in its teachings.

   4. It is more purely evangelical. Even the New Testament, as we have
   seen, contains a legal element, it reveals the law still as a covenant
   of works binding on those who reject the gospel; but in the New
   Testament the gospel greatly predominates over the law. Whereas, under
   the Old Testament, the law predominated over the gospel.

   5. The Christian economy is specially the dispensation of the Spirit.
   The great blessing promised of old, as consequent on the coming of
   Christ, was the effusion of the Spirit on all flesh, i.e., on all
   nations and on all classes of men. This was so distinguishing a
   characteristic of the Messianic period that the evangelist says, "The
   Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet
   glorified." (John vii. 39.) Our Lord promised that after his death and
   ascension He would send the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, to abide
   with his people, to guide them into the knowledge of the truth, and to
   convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment to come.
   He charged the Apostles to remain at Jerusalem until they had received
   this power from on high. And in explanation of the events of the day of
   Pentecost, the Apostle Peter said, "This Jesus hath God raised up,
   whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore being by the right hand of God
   exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy
   Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear." (Acts ii.
   32, 33.)

   6. The old dispensation was temporary and preparatory; the new is
   permanent and final. In sending forth his disciples to preach the
   gospel, and in promising them the gift of the Spirit, He assured them
   that He would be with them in that work unto the end of the world. This
   dispensation is, therefore, the last before the restoration of all
   things; the last, that is, designed for the conversion of men and the
   ingathering of the elect. Afterwards comes the end; the resurrection
   and the final judgment. In the Old Testament there are frequent
   intimations of another and a better economy, to which the Mosaic
   institutions were merely preparatory. But we have no intimation in
   Scripture that the dispensation of the Spirit is to give way for a new
   and better dispensation for the conversion of the nations. When the
   gospel is fully preached, then comes the end.

CHAPTER III.

  PERSON OF CHRIST.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Preliminary Remarks.

   1. The most mysterious and the most familiar fact of consciousness and
   experience is the union of soul and body in the constitution of our
   nature. According to the common faith of mankind and of the Church, man
   consists of two distinct substances, soul and body. By substance is
   meant that which is. It is the entity in which properties, attributes,
   and qualities inhere, and of which they are the manifestations. It is
   therefore something more than mere force. It is something more than a
   collective name for a certain number of properties which appear in
   combination. It is that which continues, and remains unchanged under
   all the varying phenomena of which it may be the subject. The substance
   which we designate the soul, is immaterial, that is, it has none of the
   properties of matter. It is spiritual, i.e., it has all the properties
   of a spirit. It is a self-conscious, intelligent, voluntary agent. The
   substance which we call the body, on the other hand, is material. That
   is, it has all the properties of matter and none of the properties of
   mind or spirit. This is the first fact universally admitted concerning
   the constitution of our nature.

   2. The second fact concerns the nature of the union between the soul
   and body. It is, (a.) A personal union. Soul and body constitute one
   individual man, or human person. There is but one consciousness. It is
   the man or person who is conscious of sensations and of thoughts, of
   affections of the body and of the acts of the mind. (b.) It is a union
   without mixture or confusion. The soul remains spirit, and the body
   remains matter. Copper and zinc combined form brass. The constituent
   elements lose their distinctive characteristics, and produce a third
   substance. There is no such mixture in the union of the soul and body.
   The two remain distinct. Neither is there a transfer of any of the
   properties of the one to the other. No property of the mind is
   transferred to the body; and no property of the body is transferred to
   the mind. (c.) Nevertheless the union is not a mere inhabitation, a
   union of contact or in space. The soul does not dwell in the body as a
   man dwells in a house or in his garments. The body is part of himself,
   and is necessary to his completeness as a man. He is in every part of
   it, and is conscious of the slightest change in the state of even the
   least important of its members.

   3. Thirdly, the consequences of this union of the soul and body are,
   (a.) A koinonia idiomaton, or communion of attributes. That is, the
   person is the possessor of all the attributes both of the soul and of
   the body. We may predicate of the man whatever may be predicated of his
   body; and we may predicate of him whatever may be predicated of his
   soul. We say of the man that he is tall or short; that he is sick or
   well; that he is handsome or deformed. In like manner, we may say that
   he is judicious, wise, good, benevolent, or learned. Whatever is true
   of either element of his constitution is true of the man. What is true
   of the one, however, is not true of the other. When the body is wounded
   or burnt it is not the soul that is the subject of these accidents; and
   when the soul is penitent or believing, or enlightened and informed,
   the body is not the subject spoken of. Each has its properties and
   changes, but the person or man is the subject of them all. (b.) Hence,
   inconsistent, or apparently contradictory affirmations may be made of
   the same person. We may say that he is weak and that he is strong; that
   he is mortal and immortal; that he is a spirit, and that he is dust and
   ashes. (c.) We may designate the man from one element of his nature
   when what we predicate of him is true only of the other element. We may
   call him a spirit and yet say that he hungers and thirsts. We may call
   him a worm of the dust when we speak of him as the subject of
   regeneration. That is, the person may be designated from either nature
   when the predicate belongs to the other. (d.) As in virtue of the
   personal union of the soul and body all the properties of either are
   properties of the man, so all the acts of either are the acts of the
   man. Some of our acts are purely mental, as thinking, repenting, and
   believing; some are purely bodily, as the processes of digestion,
   assimilation, and the circulation of the blood; some are mixed, as all
   voluntary acts, as walking, speaking, and writing. In these there is a
   direct concurrence or cooperation of the mind and body. These several
   classes of acts are acts of the man. It is the man who thinks; it is
   the man who speaks and writes; and the man who digests and assimilates
   his food. (e.) A fifth consequence of this hypostatic union is the
   exaltation of the body. The reason why the body of a man and its life
   are so immeasurably exalted above those of a brute is that it is in
   personal union with a rational and immortal soul. It is this also which
   gives the body its dignity and beauty. The gorgeous plumage of the
   bird, or the graceful symmetry of the antelope, are as nothing compared
   to the erect figure and intellectual beauty of man. The mind irradiates
   the body, and imparts to it a dignity and value which no configuration
   of mere matter could possess. At the same time the soul is not degraded
   by its union with the body. It was so arrayed before the fall, and is
   to be clothed with a body in its glorified state in heaven.

   The union of soul and body in the constitution of man is the analogue
   of the union of the divine and human natures in the person of Christ.
   No analogy is expected to answer in all points. There is in this case
   enough of resemblance to sustain faith and rebuke unbelief. There is
   nothing in the one more mysterious or inscrutable than in the other.
   And as the difficulties to the understanding in the union of two
   distinct substances, matter and mind, in the person of man have induced
   many to deny the plainest facts of consciousness, so the difficulties
   of the same kind attending the doctrine of the union of two natures,
   the one human and the other divine in the person of Christ, have led
   many to reject the plainest facts of Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. The Scriptural Facts concerning the Person of Christ.

   The facts which the Bible teaches concerning the person of Christ are,
   first, that He was truly man, i.e., He had a perfect or complete human
   nature. Hence everything that can be predicated of man (that is, of man
   as man, and not of man as fallen) can be predicated of Christ.
   Secondly, He was truly God, or had a perfect divine nature. Hence
   everything that can be predicated of God can be predicated of Christ.
   Thirdly, He was one person. The same person, self, or Ego, who said, "I
   thirst," said, "Before Abraham was, I am." This is the whole doctrine
   of the incarnation as it lies in the Scriptures and in the faith of the
   Church.

   Proof of the Doctrine.

   The proof of this doctrine includes three distinct classes of passages
   of Scripture, or may be presented in three different forms. First, the
   proof of the several elements of the doctrine separately. Secondly, the
   current language of the Scriptures which speak of Christ, from
   beginning to end, sometimes as man and sometimes as God; and combine
   the two modes of statement, or pass from the one to the other as
   naturally and as easily as they do where speaking of man as mortal and
   immortal, or as corporeal and as spiritual. Thirdly, there are certain
   passages of Scripture in which the doctrine of the incarnation is
   formally presented and dogmatically asserted.

   First Argument, all the Elements of the Doctrine separately taught.

   First, the Scriptures teach that Christ was truly man, or had a
   complete human nature. That is, He had a true body and a rational soul.

   Christ had a True Body.

   By a true body is meant a material body, composed of flesh and blood,
   in everything essential like the bodies of ordinary men. It was not a
   phantasm, or mere semblance of a body. Nor was it fashioned out of any
   heavenly or ethereal substance. This is plain because He was born of a
   woman. He was conceived in the womb of the Virgin Mary, nourished of
   her substance so as to be consubstantial with her. His body increased
   in stature, passing through the ordinary process of development from
   infancy to manhood. It was subject to all the affections of a human
   body. It was subject to pain, pleasure, hunger, thirst, fatigue,
   suffering, and death. It could be seen, felt, and handled. The
   Scriptures declare it to have been flesh and blood. "Forasmuch then as
   the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise
   took part of the same." (Hebrews ii. 14.) Our Lord said to his
   terrified disciples, "A spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
   have." (Luke xxiv. 39.) He was predicted in the Old Testament as the
   seed of the woman; the seed of Abraham; the Son of David. He was
   declared to be a man; a man of sorrows; the man Christ Jesus; and He
   called Himself the Son of Man. This designation occurs some eighty
   times in the Gospel. Nothing, therefore, is revealed concerning Christ
   more distinctly than that He had a true body.

   Christ had a Rational Soul.

   It is no less plain that He had a rational soul. He thought, reasoned,
   and felt; was joyful and sorrowful; He increased in wisdom; He was
   ignorant of the time when the day of judgment should come. He must,
   therefore, have had a finite human intelligence. These two elements, a
   true body and a rational soul, constitute a perfect or complete human
   nature, which is thus proved to have entered into the composition of
   Christ's person.

   Christ is truly God.

   Secondly, the Scriptures, with equal clearness, declare that Christ was
   truly God. This has been already proved at length. All divine names and
   titles are applied to Him. He is called God, the mighty God, the great
   God, God over all; Jehovah; Lord; the Lord of lords and the King of
   kings. All divine attributes are ascribed to Him. He is declared to be
   omnipresent, omniscient, almighty, and immutable, the same yesterday,
   today, and forever. He is set forth as the creator and upholder and
   ruler of the universe. All things were created by Him and for Him; and
   by Him all things consist. He is the object of worship to all
   intelligent creatures, even the highest; all the angels (i.e., all
   creatures between man and God) are commanded to prostrate themselves
   before Him. He is the object of all the religious sentiments; of
   reverence, love, faith, and devotion. To Him men and angels are
   responsible for their character and conduct. He required that men
   should honour Him as they honoured the Father; that they should
   exercise the same faith in Him that they do in God. He declares that He
   and the Father are one; that those who had seen Him had seen the Father
   also. He calls all men unto him; promises to forgive their sins; to
   send them the Holy Spirit; to give them rest and peace; to raise them
   up at the last day; and to give them eternal life. God is not more, and
   cannot promise more, or do more than Christ is said to be, to promise,
   and to do. He has, therefore, been the Christian's God from the
   beginning, in all ages and in all places.

   Christ One Person.

   Thirdly, He was, nevertheless, although perfect man and perfect God,
   but one person. There is, in the first place, the absence of all
   evidence of a twofold personality in Christ. The Scriptures reveal the
   Father, Son, and Spirit as distinct persons in the Godhead, because
   they use the personal pronouns in reference to each other. The Father
   says Thou to the Son, and the Son says Thou to the Father. The Father
   says to the Son, "I will give thee; and the Son says, "Lo, I come to do
   thy will." Moreover the one is objective to the other. The Father loves
   and sends the Son; the Son loves and obeys the Father. The same is true
   of the Spirit. There is nothing analogous to this in the case of
   Christ. The one nature is never distinguished from the other as a
   distinct person. The Son of God never addresses the Son of Man as a
   different person from Himself. The Scriptures reveal but one Christ. In
   the second place, besides this negative proof, the Bible affords all
   the evidence of the individual personality of our Lord that the case
   admits of. He always says I, me, mine. He is always addressed as Thou,
   thee, thine. He is always spoken of as He, his, him. It was the same
   person to whom it was said, "Thou art not yet fifty years old;" and
   "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth,
   and the heavens are the works of thine hands." The individual
   personality of Christ is set forth as clearly and as variously as that
   of any other personage of whose history the Scriptures give us the
   record. In teaching that Christ had a perfect human and a perfect
   divine nature, and is one person, the Bible teaches the whole doctrine
   of the incarnation as it has entered into the faith of the Church from
   the beginning.

   Second Argument, from the Current Representations of Scripture.

   The current language of Scripture concerning Christ proves that He was
   at once divine and human. In the Old Testament, He is set forth as the
   seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah anti the family of David; as to
   be born of a virgin in the town of Bethlehem; as a man of sorrows; as
   meek and lowly; as bearing the chastisement of our sins, and pouring
   out his soul unto death. He is everywhere represented as a man. At the
   same time He is everywhere represented as God; He is called the Son of
   God, Immanuel, the Mighty God, Jehovah our righteousness; and He is
   spoken of as from everlasting; as enthroned in heaven and receiving the
   adoration of angels.

   In the New Testament, the same mode of representation is continued. Our
   Lord, in speaking of Himself, and the Apostles when speaking of Him,
   uniformly speak of Him as a man. The New Testament gives his genealogy
   to prove that He was of the house and lineage of David. It records his
   birth, life, and death. It calls Him the Son of Man, the man Christ
   Jesus. But with like uniformity our Lord assumes, and the Apostles
   attribute to Him a divine nature. He declares Himself to be the Son of
   God, existing from eternity, having all power in heaven and in earth,
   entitled to all the reverence, love, and obedience due to God. The
   Apostles worship Him; they call Him the great God and Saviour; they
   acknowledge their dependence upon Him and responsibility to Him; and
   they look to Him for pardon, sanctification, and eternal life. These
   conflicting representations, this constant setting forth the same
   person as man and also as God, admits of no solution but in the
   doctrine of the incarnation. This is the key to the whole Bible. If
   this doctrine be denied all is confusion and contradiction. If it be
   admitted all is light, harmony, and power. Christ is both God and man,
   in two distinct natures, and one person forever. This is the great
   mystery of Godliness. God manifest in the flesh is the distinguishing
   doctrine of the religion of the Bible, without which it is a cold and
   lifeless corpse.

   Third Argument, from Particular Passages of Scriptures.

   Although, as appears from what has already been said, the doctrine of
   the incarnation does not rest on isolated proof-texts, but upon the
   broad basis of the whole revelation of God concerning the person and
   work of his Son, yet there are some passages in which this doctrine is
   so clearly stated in all its elements, that they cannot be properly
   overlooked in treating of this subject.

   To this class of passages belongs, --

   1. The first chapter of John, verses 1-14. It is here taught concerning
   the Logos, (1.) That He existed in eternity. (2.) That He was in
   intimate relation to God. (3.) That He was God. (4.) That He was the
   Creator of all things. (5.) In Him was life. Having life in himself, He
   is the source of life to all that live. That is, He is the source of
   natural, of intellectual, and of spiritual life. (6.) And, therefore,
   He is the true light; that is, the fountain of all knowledge and all
   holiness. (7.) He came into the world, and the world although made by
   Him, did not recognize Him. (8.) He came to his own people, and even
   they did not receive Him. (9.) He became flesh, i.e., He assumed our
   nature, so that He dwelt among us as a man. (10.) And, says the
   Apostle, we saw his glory, a glory which revealed Him to be the only
   begotten of the Father. It is here taught that a truly divine person,
   the eternal Word, the Creator of the world, became man, dwelt among
   men, and revealed Himself to those who had eyes to see, as the eternal
   Son of God. Here is the whole doctrine of the incarnation, taught in
   the most explicit terms.

   2. A second passage to the same effect is found in 1 John i. 1-3. It is
   there taught that what was in the beginning, what was with God, what
   was eternal, what was essentially life, appeared on earth, so as to be
   seen, heard, looked upon, and handled. Here, again, a divine,
   invisible, eternal person, is said to have assumed our nature, a real
   body and a rational soul. He could be seen and touched as well as
   heard. This is the main idea of this epistle. The incarnation is
   declared to be the characteristic and essential doctrine of the gospel.
   "Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,
   is of God: and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is
   come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of
   antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now
   already is it in the world."

   3. In Romans i. 2-5, the Apostle says that the gospel concerns the Son
   of God, who is our Lord Jesus Christ, who, as to his human nature, kata
   sarka, is the Son of David, but as to his divine nature, kata pneuma,
   is the Son of God. Here also the two natures and one person of the
   Redeemer are clearly asserted. The parallel passage to this is Romans
   ix. 5, where Christ is said kata sarka to be descended from the
   fathers, but at the same time to be God over all and blessed forever.
   The same person is declared to be the supreme God and a child of
   Abraham, a member of the Hebrew nation by natural descent.

   4. In 1 Timothy iii. 16, we are taught that God was "manifest in the
   flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached among the
   Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory." In this
   passage the reading is indeed doubtful. The common text which has Theos
   has the support of almost all the cursive, and of some of the uncial
   manuscripts, of several of the versions, and of many of the Greek
   fathers. But whether we read Theos or hos, the meaning is substantially
   the same. Two things are plain: first, that all the predicates in this
   verse belong to one subject; and secondly, that that subject is Christ.
   He, his person, is the great mystery of Godliness. He was manifested in
   the flesh (i.e., in our nature); He, as thus manifested, the
   Theanthropos, was justified, i.e., proved to be just, i.e., to be what
   He claimed to be (namely, the Son of God), by the Spirit, either by the
   divine nature or majesty dwelling in Him, or by the Holy Ghost, whose
   office it is to take the things of Christ and reveal them unto us. He,
   this incarnate God, was seen, i.e., recognized and served by angels;
   preached among the Gentiles as the Son of God and Saviour of men;
   believed upon as such; and finally received up into glory. All that the
   Church teaches concerning the person of Christ, is here taught by the
   Apostle.

   5. No passage, however, is more full and explicit on this subject than
   Philippians ii. 6-11. Of one and the same subject or person, it is here
   taught, (1.) That He was God, or existed in the form of God. The form
   of a thing is the mode in which it reveals itself; and that is
   determined by its nature. It is not necessary to assume that morphe has
   here, as it appears to have in some other cases, the sense of phusis;
   the latter is implied in the former. No one can appear, or exist in
   view of others in the form of God, i.e., manifesting all divine
   perfections, who is not God. (2.) Hence it is asserted that the person
   spoken of was equal to God. (3.) He became a man like other men, and
   assumed the form of a servant, i.e., appeared among men as a servant.
   (4.) He submitted to die upon the cross. (5.) He has been exalted above
   all created beings, and invested with universal and absolute authority.
   Christ, therefore, of whom this passage treats, has a divine nature,
   and a human nature, and is one person.

   6. In Hebrews ii. 14, the same doctrine concerning the person of Christ
   is clearly taught. In the first chapter of that Epistle the Son is
   declared to be the brightness of the Father's glory and the express
   image of his substance (i.e., of what the Father is). By Him the worlds
   were made. He upholds all things by the word of his power. He is higher
   than the angels, i.e., than all intelligent creatures. They are bound
   to worship Him. They are addressed as mere instruments; but the Son as
   God. He made the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. He is
   eternal and immutable. He is associated with God in glory and dominion.
   He, the person of whom all this is said in the first chapter, in the
   second chapter is declared to be a man. In Him was fulfilled as the
   sacred writer in the eighth Psalm had taught concerning the universal
   dominion assigned to man. Men are declared to be his brethren, because
   He and they are of one nature. As they are partakers of flesh and
   blood, He also took part in the same, in order that He might die, and
   by death redeem his people from all the evils of sin.

   Nothing can be plainer than that the Scriptures do teach that Christ is
   truly God, that He is truly man, and that He is one person. They assert
   of Him whatever may be said of God, and everything that can be said of
   a sinless man. They enter into no explanations. They assume it as a
   certain fact that Christ is God and man in one person, just as they
   assume that a man is a soul and body in one person.

   Here the subject might be left. All the ends of the spiritual life of
   the believer, are answered by this simple statement of the doctrine
   concerning Christ's person as it is presented in the Scriptures. False
   explanations, however, create the necessity for a correct one.
   Errorists in all ages have so explained the facts recorded concerning
   Christ, as either to deny the truth concerning his divine nature, or
   the integrity of his human nature, or the unity of his person. Hence
   the Church has been constrained to teach what the Bible doctrine
   involves: first, as to the nature of the union of the two natures in
   Christ; and secondly, as to the consequences of that union.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. The Hypostatical Union.

   Two Natures in Christ.

   There is a union. The elements united are the divine and human nature.
   By nature, in this connection is meant substance. In Greek the
   corresponding words are phosis and ousia; in Latin, natura and
   substantia. The idea of substance is a necessary one. We are
   constrained to believe that where we see the manifestation of force,
   there is something, an objective entity which acts, and of which such
   force is the manifestation. It is self-evident that a non-ens cannot
   act. It may be well here to call to mind a few admitted principles
   which have already been repeatedly adverted to. (1.) It is intuitively
   certain that attributes, properties, and power or force, necessarily
   imply a substance of which they are manifestations. Of nothing, nothing
   can be predicated. That of which we can predicate the attributes either
   of matter or mind, must of necessity be a reality. (2.) It is no less
   certain that where the attributes are incompatible, the substances must
   be different and distinct. That which is extended cannot be unextended.
   That which is divisible cannot be indivisible. That which is incapable
   of thought cannot think. That which is finite cannot be infinite. (3.)
   Equally certain is it that attributes cannot exist distinct and
   separate from substance. There cannot be accidentia sine subjecto;
   otherwise there might be extension without anything extended, and
   thought without anything that thinks. (4.) Again, it is intuitively
   certain that the attributes of one substance cannot be transferred to
   another. Matter cannot be endowed with the attributes of mind; for then
   it would cease to be matter. Mind cannot be invested with the
   properties of matter, for then it would cease to be mind, neither can
   humanity be possessed of the attributes of divinity, for then it would
   cease to be humanity. This is only saying that the finite cannot be
   infinite. Speaking in general terms, in the whole history of human
   thought, these principles have been recognized as axiomatic; and their
   denial puts an end to discussion.

   If the above mentioned principles be admitted, then it follows that in
   setting forth his Son as clothed in all the attributes of humanity,
   with a body that was born of a woman, which increased an stature, which
   was seen, felt, and handled; and with a soul that was troubled, joyful,
   and sorrowful, that increased in wisdom and was ignorant of certain
   things, God intends and requires that we should believe that He was a
   true man, -- not a phantom, not an abstraction, -- not the complex of
   properties without the substance of humanity, but a true or real man,
   like other men, yet without sin. In like manner when He is declared to
   be God over all, to be omniscient, almighty, and eternal, it is no less
   evident that He has a truly divine nature; that the substance of God in
   Him is the subject in which these divine attributes inhere. This being
   so, we are taught that the elements combined in the constitution of his
   person, namely, humanity and divinity, are two distinct natures, or
   substances. Such has been the faith of the Church universal. In those
   ancient creeds which are adopted by the Greek, Latin and Protestant
   Churches, it is declared that Christ as to his humanity is
   consubstantial with us, and as to his divinity, consubstantial with the
   Father. In the Council of Chalcedon, the Church declared our Lord to
   be, [305] Theon alethos kai anthropon alethos ton auton ek psuches
   logikes kai somatos, omoousion to patri kata ten theoteta kai
   homoousion ton auton hemin kata ten anthropoteta.

   Thomas Aquinas says, [306] "Humana natura in Christo quamvis sit
   substantia particularis: qui tamen venit in unionem cujusdam completi,
   scilicet totius Christi, prout est Deus et homo, non potest dici
   hypostasis vel suppositum: Sed illum completum ad quod concurrit,
   dicitur esse hypostasis vel suppositum." In all the creeds of the
   Reformation the same doctrine is presented. In the "Augsburg
   Confession" [307] it is said, "Filius Dei assumpsit humanam naturam in
   utero beatæ Mariæ virginis, ut sint duæ naturæ, divina et humana, in
   unitate personæ inseparabiliter conjunctæ, unus Christus, vere Deus et
   vere homo." "Natura (phusis, ousia) in Christo est substantia vel
   divinitatis vel humanitatis. Persona (hupostasis, prosopon) Christi est
   individuum ex utraque natura et divina et humana, conjuncta, non mixta,
   concretum." [308] In the "Second Helvetic Confession" [309] it is said,
   "Agnoscimus in uno atque eodem Domino nostro Jesu Christo, duas naturas
   (for natura, substantia is used in other parts of the chapter), divinam
   et humanam. . . . . In una persona unitæ vel conjunctæ [sunt]: ita ut
   unum Christum Dominum, non duos veneremur: unum inquam verum Deum, et
   hominem, juxta divinam naturam Patri, juxta humanam vero nobis
   hominibus consubstantialem, et per omnia similem, peccato excepto."
   Therefore the theologians teach, [310] "Natura divina est essentia
   divina, qua Christus Patri et Spiritui Sancto coessentialis est. Natura
   humana est essentia seu substantia humana, qua Christus nobis hominibus
   coessentialis est." Or as stated in the ancient creeds, Christ is not
   allos kai allos (one person and another person), but allo kai allo (one
   substance and another substance).

   The Two Natures are united but not mingled or confounded.

   We have seen that the first important point concerning the person of
   Christ is, that the elements united or combined in his person are two
   distinct substances, humanity and divinity; that He has in his
   constitution the same essence or substance which constitutes us men,
   and the same substance which makes God infinite, eternal, and immutable
   in all his perfections. The second point is, that this union is not by
   mixture so that a new, third substance is produced, which is neither
   humanity nor divinity but possessing the properties of both. This is an
   impossibility, because the properties in question are incompatible. We
   cannot mingle mind and matter so as to make a substance which is
   neither mind nor matter, but spiritual matter, for that would be a
   contradiction. It would amount to unextended extension, tangible
   intangibility, or visible invisibility. Neither is it possible that the
   divine and human natures should be so mingled as to result in a third,
   which is neither purely human nor purely divine, but theanthropic.
   Christ's person is theanthropic, but not his nature; for that would
   make the finite infinite, and the infinite finite. Christ would be
   neither God nor man; but the Scriptures constantly declare Him to be
   both God and man. In all Christian creeds therefore, it is declared
   that the two natures in Christ retain each its own properties and
   attributes. They all teach that the natures are not confounded, "Sed
   salvis potius et permanentibus naturarum proprietatibus in una persona
   unitæ vel conjunctæ."

   As therefore the human body retains all its properties as matter, and
   the soul all its attributes as spirit in their union in our persons; so
   humanity and divinity retain each its peculiar properties in their
   union in the person of Christ. And as intelligence, sensibility, and
   will are the properties of the human soul, without which it ceases to
   be a soul, it follows that the human soul of Christ retained its
   intelligence, sensibility, and will. But intelligence and will are no
   less the essential properties of the divine nature, and therefore were
   retained after its union with the human nature in Christ. In teaching,
   therefore, that Christ was truly man and truly God, the Scriptures
   teach that He had a finite intelligence and will, and also an infinite
   intelligence. In Him, therefore, as the Church has ever maintained,
   there were and are two wills, two energeiai or operations. His human
   intellect increased, his divine intelligence was, and is infinite. His
   human will had only human power, his divine will was, and is almighty.
   Mysterious and inscrutable as all this is, it is not more so than the
   union of the discordant elements of mind and matter in our own
   constitution.

   There is no Transfer of the Attributes of one Nature to the Other.

   The third point in relation to the person of Christ, is that no
   attribute of the one nature is transferred to the other, This is
   virtually included in what has already been said. There are those,
   however, who admit that the two natures in Christ are not mixed or
   confounded, who yet maintain that the attributes of the one are
   transferred to the other. But the properties or attributes of a
   substance constitute its essence, so that if they be removed or if
   others of a different nature be added to them, the substance itself is
   changed. If you take rationality from mind it ceases to be mind. If you
   add rationality to matter it ceases to be matter. If you make that
   extended which in itself is incapable of extension the identity of the
   thing is lost. If therefore infinity be conferred in the finite, it
   ceases to be finite. If divine attributes be conferred on man, he
   ceases to be man; and if human attributes be transferred to God, he
   ceases to be God. The Scriptures teach that the human nature of Christ
   remained in its integrity after the incarnation; and that the divine
   nature remained divine. The Bible never requires us to receive as true
   anything which the constitution of our nature given to us by God
   himself, forces us to believe to be false or impossible.

   The Union is a Personal Union.

   Thc union of the two natures in Christ is a personal or hypostatic
   union. By this is meant, in the first place, that it is not a mere
   indwelling of the divine nature analogous to the indwelling of the
   Spirit of God in his people. Much less is it a mere moral or
   sympathetic union; or a temporary and mutable relation between the two.
   In the second place, it is intended to affirm that the union is such
   that Christ is but one person. As the union of the soul and body
   constitutes a man one person, so the union of the Son of God with our
   nature constitutes Him one person. And as in man the personality is in
   the soul and not in the body, so the personality of Christ is in the
   divine nature. Both of these points are abundantly evident from
   Scripture. The former, or the unity of Christ's person, has already
   been proved; and the latter is proved by the fact that the Logos, or
   Son, was from all eternity a distinct person in the Godhead. It was a
   divine person, not merely a divine nature, that assumed humanity, or
   became incarnate. Hence it follows that the human nature of Christ,
   separately considered, is impersonal. To this, indeed, it is objected
   that intelligence and will constitute personality, and as these belong
   to Christ's human nature personality cannot be denied to it. A person,
   however, is a suppositum intelligens, but the human nature of Christ is
   not a suppositum or subsistence. To personality both rational substance
   and distinct subsistence are essential. The latter the human nature of
   Christ never possessed. The Son of God did not unite Himself with a
   human person, but with a human nature. The proof of this is that Christ
   is but one person. The possibility of such a union cannot rationally be
   denied. Realists believe that generic humanity, although intelligent
   and voluntary, is impersonal, existing personally only in individual
   men. Although realism may not be a correct philosophy, the fact of its
   wide and long continued prevalence may be taken as a proof that it does
   not involve any palpable contradiction. Human nature, therefore,
   although endowed with intelligence and will, may be, and in fact is, in
   the person of Christ impersonal. That it is so is the plain doctrine of
   Scripture, for the Son of God, a divine person, assumed a perfect human
   nature, and, nevertheless, remains one person.

   The facts, therefore, revealed in Scripture concerning Christ constrain
   us to believe, (1.) That in his person two natures, the divine and the
   human, are inseparably united; and the word nature in this connection
   means substance. (2.) That these two natures or substances are not
   mixed or confounded so as to form a third, which is neither the one nor
   the other. Each nature retains all its own properties unchanged; so
   that in Christ there is a finite intelligence and infinite
   intelligence, a finite will or energy, and an infinite will. (3.) That
   no property of the divine nature is transferred to the human, and much
   less is any property of the human transferred to the divine. Humanity
   in Christ is not deified, nor is the divinity reduced to the
   limitations of humanity. (4.) The union of the natures is not mere
   contact or occupancy of the same portion of space. It is not an
   indwelling, or a simple control of the divine nature over the
   operations of the human, but a personal union; such a union that its
   result is that Christ is one person with two distinct natures forever;
   at once God and man.

   § 4. Consequences of the Hypostatical Union.

   Communion of Attributes.

   The first and most obvious of these consequences is, the koinonia
   idiomaton, or communion of attributes. By this is not meant that the
   one nature participates in the attributes of the other, but simply that
   the person is the koinonos, or partaker of the attributes of both
   natures; so that whatever may be affirmed of either nature may be
   affirmed of the person. As of a man can be affirmed whatever is true of
   his body and whatever is true of his soul, so of Christ may be affirmed
   whatever is true of his human nature and whatever is true of his
   divinity; as we can say of a man that he is mortal and immortal; that
   he is a creature of the dust and the child of God: so we may say of
   Christ that He is finite and infinite; that He is ignorant and
   omniscient; that He is less than God and equal with God; that He
   existed from eternity and that He was born in time; that He created all
   things and that He was a man of sorrows. It is on this principle, that
   what is true of either nature is true of the person, that a multitude
   of passages of Scripture are to be explained. These passages are of
   different kinds.

   1. Those in which the predicate belongs to the whole person. This is
   the most numerous class. Thus when Christ is called our Redeemer, our
   Lord, our King, Prophet, or Priest, our Shepherd, etc., all these
   things are true of Him not as the Logos, or Son, nor as the man Christ
   Jesus, but as the Theanthropos, the God-man. And in like manner, when
   He is said to have been humbled, to have given Himself for us, to be
   the head of the Church, to be our life, and to be our wisdom,
   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, this is true of Christ
   as a person. The same may be said with regard to those passages in
   which He is said to be exalted above all principalities and powers; to
   sit at the right hand of God; and to come to judge the world.

   2. There are many passages in which the person is the subject, but the
   predicate is true only of the divine nature, or of the Logos. As when
   our Lord said, "Before Abraham was I am;" "The glory which I had with
   thee before the foundation of the world; or when it is said, "Thou,
   Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the world, and the
   heavens are the work of thine hands."

   3. Passages in which the person is the subject, but the predicate is
   true only of the human nature. As when Christ said, "I thirst;" "My
   soul is sorrowful even unto death." And when we read that "Jesus wept."
   So all those passages which speak of our Lord as walking, eating, and
   sleeping; and as being seen, touched, and handled. There are two
   classes of passages under this general head which are of special
   interest. First, those in which the person is designated from the
   divine nature when the predicate is true only of the human nature. "The
   Church of God which He purchased with his blood." "The Lord of glory
   was crucified." The Son knows not the time when the final judgment is
   to come. (Mark xiii. 32.) The forms of expression, therefore, long
   prevalent in the Church, "the blood of God," "God the mighty maker
   died," etc., are in accordance with Scriptural usage. And if it be
   right to say "God died," it is right to say "He was born." The person
   born of the Virgin Mary was a divine person. He was the Son of God. It
   is, therefore, correct to say that Mary was the mother of God. For, as
   we have seen, the person of Christ is in Scripture often designated
   from the divine nature, when the predicate is true only of the human
   nature. On this particular form of expression, which, from its abuse,
   is generally offensive to Protestant ears, Turrettin remarks: "Maria
   potest dici vere theotokos seu Mater Dei, Deipara, si vox Dei sumatur
   concrete pro toto personali Christi, quod constat ex persona Logou et
   natura humana, quo sensu vocatur Mater Domini Luc. i. 43, sed non
   precise et abstracte ratione Deitatis." [311] The second class of
   passages under this head are of the opposite kind, namely, those in
   which the person is denominated from the human nature when the
   predicate is true only of the divine nature. Thus Christ is called the
   Son of man who is in heaven. Here the denomination "Son of man" is from
   the human, while the predicate (ubiquity) is true only of the divine
   nature. So our Lord says, "What and if ye shall see the Son of man
   ascend up where He was before?" (John vi. 62.) In Romans ix. 5, He who
   was of the fathers (the seed of Abraham and son of David) is declared
   to be God over all and blessed forever.

   4. There is a fourth class of passages which come under the first
   general head mentioned above, but have the peculiarity that the
   denomination is derived from the divine nature, when the predicate is
   not true of the divine nature itself, but only of the Theanthropos.
   Thus it is said, "The Son also himself shall be subject to him who put
   all things under him." Here the designation Son is from the divine
   nature, but the subjection predicated is not of the Son as such, or of
   the Logos, nor is it simply of the human nature, but officially of the
   God-man. So our Lord says, "The Father is greater than I." The Father
   is not greater than the Son, for they are the same in substance and
   equal in power and glory. It is as God-man that He is economically
   subject to the Father. Perhaps the passage in John v. 26 may belong to
   this class. "As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to
   the Son to have life in himself." This may be understood of the eternal
   communication of life from the first to the second person of the
   Trinity (i.e., of eternal generation); or it may refer to the
   constitution of Christ's person. And then the term Son would designate,
   not the Logos, but the Theanthropos, and the communication of life
   would not be from the Father to the Son, but from God to the
   Theanthropos. It pleased the Father that Christ should have a divine
   nature possessed of inherent life in order that He might be the source
   of life to his people.

   It is instructive to notice here how easily and naturally the sacred
   writers predicate of our Lord the attributes of humanity and those of
   divinity, however his person may be denominated. They call Him Lord, or
   Son, and attribute to Him, often in the same sentence, what is true of
   Him only as God, what is true only of his humanity, and what is true of
   Him only as the God-man. Thus in the beginning of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews it is said, God hath spoken unto us by his Son. Here Son means
   the incarnate Logos. In the next clause, "By whom he made the world,"
   what is said is true only of the eternal Son. So also what immediately
   follows, Who is "the brightness of his glory and the express image of
   his person, and upholding all things (the universe) by the word of his
   power." But in the next clause, "When he had by himself (i.e., by his
   sacrificial death) purged away our sins," the reference is to his human
   nature, as the body only died. And then it is added, He "sat down on
   the right hand of the Majesty on high," which is true of the God-man.

   The Acts of Christ.

   The second consequence of the hypostatical union relates to the acts of
   Christ. As a man is one person, and because he is one person all his
   acts are the acts of that person, so all the acts of Christ are the
   acts of his whole person. But, as was before remarked, the acts of a
   man are of three classes: such as are purely mental, as thought; such
   as belong exclusively to the body, as digestion and assimilation; and
   such as are mixed, i.e., both mental and corporeal, as all voluntary
   acts, as speaking, writing, etc. Yet all are equally the acts of the
   man. It is the man who thinks who digests his food, and who speaks. So
   of the acts of Christ. Some are purely divine, as creation and
   preservation; some are purely human, as eating, drinking, and sleeping;
   some are theanthropic, i.e., those in which both natures concur, as in
   the work of redemption. Yet all these acts are the acts of Christ, of
   one and the same person. It was Christ who created the world. It was
   Christ who ate and drank. And it is Christ who redeems us from the
   power of darkness.

   Here also, as in the case of the attributes of Christ, his person may
   be denominated from one nature when the act ascribed to Him belongs to
   the other nature. He is called God, the Son of God, the Lord of glory,
   when his delivering Himself unto death is spoken of. And He is called
   man, or the Son of man, when the acts ascribed to Him involve the
   exercise of divine power or authority. It is the Son of man who
   forgives sins; who is Lord of the Sabbath; who raises the dead; and who
   is to send forth his angels to gather his elect.

   Such being the Scriptural doctrine concerning the person of Christ, it
   follows that although the divine nature is immutable and impassible,
   and therefore neither the obedience nor the suffering of Christ was the
   obedience or suffering of the divine nature, yet they were none the
   less the obedience and suffering of a divine person. The soul of man
   cannot be wounded or burnt, but when the body is injured it is the man
   who suffers. In like manner the obedience of Christ was the
   righteousness of God, and the blood of Christ was the blood of God. It
   is to this fact that the infinite merit and efficiency of his work are
   due. This is distinctly asserted in the Scriptures. It is impossible,
   says the Apostle, that the blood of bulls and of goats could take away
   sin. It was because Christ was possessed of an eternal Spirit that He
   by the one offering of Himself hath perfected forever them who are
   sanctified. This is the main idea insisted upon in the Epistle to the
   Hebrews. This is the reason given why the sacrifice of Christ need
   never be repeated, and why it is infinitely more efficacious than those
   of the old dispensation. This truth has been graven on the hearts of
   believers in all ages. Every such believer says from his heart, "Jesus,
   my God, thy blood alone has power sufficient to atone."

   The Man Christ Jesus the object of Worship.

   Another obvious inference from this doctrine is that the man Christ
   Jesus is the object of religious worship. To worship, in the religious
   sense of the word, is to ascribe divine perfections to its object. The
   possession of those perfections, is, therefore, the only proper ground
   for such worship. The humanity of Christ, consequently, is not the
   ground of worship, but it enters into the constitution of that person
   who, being God over all and blessed forever, is the object of adoration
   to saints and angels. We accordingly find that it was He whom they saw,
   felt, and handled, that the Apostles worshipped as their Lord and God;
   whom they loved supremely, and to whom they consecrated themselves as a
   living sacrifice.

   Christ can sympathize with his People.

   A third inference which the Apostles drew from this doctrine is. that
   Christ is a merciful and faithful high-priest. He is just the Saviour
   we need. God as God, the eternal Logos, could neither be nor do what
   our necessities demand. Much less could any mere man, however wise,
   holy, or benevolent, meet the wants of our souls. It is only a Saviour
   who is both God and man in two distinct natures and one person forever,
   who is all we need and all we can desire. As God He is ever present,
   almighty and infinite in all his resources to save and bless; and as
   man, or being also a man, He can be touched with a sense of our
   infirmities, was tempted as we are, was subject to the law which we
   violated, and endured the penalty which we had incurred. In Him dwells
   all the fulness of the Godhead, in a bodily form, in fashion as a man,
   so as to be accessible to us, and so that from his fulness we can all
   partake. We are therefore complete in Him, wanting nothing.

   The Incarnate Logos the Source of Life.

   The Scriptures teach that the Logos is everlasting life, having life in
   Himself, and the source of life, physical, intellectual, and spiritual.
   They further teach that his incarnation was the necessary condition of
   the communication of spiritual life to the children of men. He,
   therefore, is the only Saviour, the only source of life to us. We
   become partakers of this life, by union with Him. This union is partly
   federal established in the councils of eternity partly vital by the
   indwelling of the Holy Spirit; and partly voluntary and conscious by
   faith. It is to those who believe, to those who receive Him as God
   manifest in the flesh, that He becomes eternal life. For it is not they
   who live, but Christ who liveth in them. (Gal. ii. 20.) The life of the
   believer is not a corporate life, conditioned on union with any outward
   organization, called the Church, for whosoever calls on the name of the
   Lord, that is, whosoever religiously worships Him and looks to Him as
   his God and Saviour, shall be saved, whether in a dungeon or alone in a
   desert.

   The Exaltation of the Human Nature of Christ.

   Another consequence of the hypostatical union is the exaltation of the
   humanity of Christ. As the human body in virtue of its vital union with
   an immortal soul, is immeasurably exalted above any mere material
   organization in the universe (so far as known or revealed), so the
   humanity of Christ in virtue of its union with his divine nature is
   immeasurably exalted in dignity and worth, and even power over all
   intelligent creatures. The human body, however, is not now, and will
   not be, even when made like to Christ's glorious body, so exalted as to
   cease to be material. In like manner the humanity of Christ is not so
   exalted by its union with his divine nature as to cease to be human.
   This would break the bond of sympathy between Him and us. It has been
   the pious fault of some Christians that they merge his humanity in his
   Godhead. This is as real, if not so fatal an error, as merging his
   Godhead in his humanity. We must hold fast to both. "The Man Christ
   Jesus," and "The God over all blessed forever," is the one undivided
   inseparable object of the adoration, love, and confidence of the people
   of God; who can each say, --


   "Jesus, my God, I know his name,

   His name is all my trust;

   Nor will He put my soul to shame,

   Nor let my hope be lost."

   § 5. Erroneous and Heretical Doctrines on the Person of Christ.

   Plainly as all the truths above mentioned concerning the person of
   Christ, seem now to us to be revealed in the Holy Scriptures, it was
   not until after the conflict of six centuries that they came to be
   fully stated so as to secure the general assent of the Church. We must
   indeed always bear in mind the difference between the speculations of
   theologians and the faith of the great body of the people if God. It is
   a false assumption that the doctrines taught by the ecclesiastical
   writers of a particular age, constituted the faith of believers of that
   age. The doctrines of theologians are largely determined by their
   antecedents and by the current philosophy of the day in which they
   live. This is unavoidable. The faith of the common people is determined
   by the Word of God, by the worship of the sanctuary, and by the
   teachings of the Spirit. They remain in a great measure ignorant of, or
   indifferent to, the speculations of theologians. It cannot be doubted
   that the great body of the people from the beginning believed that
   Christ was truly a man, was truly God, and is one person. They could
   not read and believe the Scriptures without having these truths
   engraved on their hearts. All the records of their confessions, hymns,
   and prayers, prove them to have been the worshippers of Him who died
   for their sins. And in this light they were regarded and described by
   all contemporary heathen writers. But while the people thus rested in
   these essential facts, the theologians were forced from without and
   from within, to ask, How can these things be? How can the same person
   be both God and man? How does the Godhead in the person of Christ stand
   related to his humanity? It was in the answers given to these questions
   that difficulty and controversy occurred. To avoid the great and
   obvious difficulties connected with the doctrine of the incarnation of
   God, some denied his true divinity; others denied the reality or
   completeness of his human nature; others so explained the nature and
   effects of the union as to interfere either with the integrity of the
   divine or of the human nature of Christ or with the unity of his
   person.

   The Ebionites.

   The errors which disturbed the peace of the early Church on this, as on
   other subjects, arose either from Judaism or from heathen philosophy.
   The Jews who professed themselves Christians, were not able, in many
   instances, as we learn from the New Testament itself, to emancipate
   themselves from their former opinions and prejudices. They had by the
   misinterpretation of their Scriptures been led to expect a Messiah who
   was to be the head of their nation as David and Solomon had been. They,
   therefore, as a body, rejected Christ, who came as a man of sorrows,
   not having anywhere to lay his head. And of those who were constrained
   by his doctrines and miracles to acknowledge Him as the promised
   Messiah, many believed Him to be a mere man, the son of Joseph and
   Mary, distinguished from other men only by his holiness and his
   extraordinary endowments. This was the case with the sect known as
   Ebionites. Why so called is a matter of doubt. Although as a body, and
   characteristically, they entertained this low, humanitarian view of the
   person of Christ, yet it appears from the fragmentary records of the
   ancient writers, that they differed much among themselves, and were
   divided into different classes. Some had mingled with their Jewish
   opinions more or less of the elements of the Gnostic philosophy. This
   was the more natural, as many of the teachers of Gnosticism were Jews.
   The fathers, therefore, speak both of Jewish, and of Gnostic Ebionites.
   So far as their views of Christ's person were modified by Gnosticism,
   they ceased to be distinctly the views of the Ebionites as a body.

   Another class of nominal Jewish Christians is known as Nazarenes. They
   differed but little from the Jewish Ebionites. Both insisted on the
   continued obligation of the Mosaic law, and both regarded Christ as a
   mere man. But the Nazarenes acknowledged his miraculous conception, and
   thus elevated Him above all other men, and regarded Him as the Son of
   God in a peculiar sense. The acknowledgment of the divinity of Christ,
   and the ability and willingness to unite in worship of which He was the
   object, was from the beginning the one indispensable condition of
   Christian fellowship. These Jewish sects, therefore, who denied his
   divinity, existed outside of the Church, and were not recognized as
   Christians.

   The Gnostics.

   As the Ebionites denied the divinity, so the Gnostics in different ways
   denied his humanity. They were led to this denial by their views of the
   origin of evil. God is the source only of good. As evil exists it must
   have its origin not only outside of Him, but independently of Him. He
   is, however, the source of all spiritual existences. By emanation from
   his substance spiritual beings are produced; from them other emanations
   proceed, and from those still others in ever increasing deterioration
   according to their distance from the primal fountain. Evil arises from
   matter. The world was created, not by God, but by an inferior spirit,
   the Demiourgos, whom some sects of the Gnostics regarded as the God of
   the Jews. Man consists of a spirit derived from God combined with a
   material body and an animal soul. By this union of the spiritual with
   the material, the spirit is defiled and enslaved. Its redemption
   consists in its emancipation from the body, so as to enable it to
   reenter the sphere of pure spirits, or to be lost in God. To effect
   this redemption, Christ, one of the highest emanations from God (or
   Æons), came into the world. It was necessary that He should appear "in
   fashion as a man," but it was impossible He should become a man,
   without subjecting Himself to the pollution and bondage from which He
   came to deliver men. To meet this difficulty various theories were
   adopted. Some held that Christ had no real body or human soul. His
   earthly manifestation is human form was a phantasm, a mere appearance
   without substance or reality. Hence they were called Docetæ, from the
   Greek verb dokeo, which means to appear, to seem to be. According to
   this class of the Gnostics, Christ's whole earthly life was an
   illusion. He was not born, nor did he suffer or die. Others admitted
   that he had a real body, but denied that it was material. They taught
   that it was formed of some ethereal or celestial substance, and brought
   by Christ into the world. Although born of the virgin Mary, it was not
   of her substance, but only through her as the mould in which this
   ethereal substance was cast. Hence in the ancient creeds it is said
   that Christ was born, not per, but ex Maria virgine, which is explained
   to mean ex substantia matris suæ. It was also in opposition to this
   Gnostic heresy that the ancient creeds emphasized the declaration that
   Christ, as to his human nature, is consubstantial with us. Others, as
   the Cerinthians, held that Jesus and Christ were distinct. Jesus was an
   ordinary man, the son of Joseph and Mary. Christ was a spirit or power
   which descended on Jesus at his baptism, and became his guide and
   guardian, and enabled Him to work miracles. At the time of his passion,
   the Christ departed, returning into heaven, leaving the man Jesus to
   suffer alone. As nothing is more distinctly revealed in Scripture, and
   nothing is more essential to Christ's being the Saviour of men, than
   that he should be truly a man, all these Gnostic theories were rejected
   as heretical.

   The Apollinarian Doctrine.

   As the Gnostic doctrine which denied entirely the human nature of
   Christ was rejected, the next attempt was directed against the
   integrity of that nature. Many of the early fathers, especially of the
   Alexandrian school, had presented views of this element of Christ's
   person, which removed Him more or less from the class of ordinary men.
   They nevertheless maintained that He was truly a man. The
   Apollinarians, so called from Apollinaris, a distinguished bishop of
   Laodicea, adopting the Platonic distinction between the soma, psuche,
   and pneuma, as three distinct subjects or principles in the
   constitution of man, admitted that Christ had a true body (soma) and
   animal soul (psuche), but not a rational spirit, or mind (pneuma or
   nous). In Him the eternal Son, or Logos, supplied the place of the
   human intelligence. The Apollinarians were led to the adoption of this
   theory partly from the difficulty of conceiving how two complete
   natures can be united in one life and consciousness. If Christ be God,
   or the divine Logos, He must have an infinite intelligence and an
   almighty will. If a perfect man, He must have a finite intelligence and
   a human will. How then can He be one person? This is indeed
   incomprehensible; but it involves no contradiction. Apollinaris
   admitted that the psuche, and pneuma in ordinary men, although two
   distinct principles, are united in one life and consciousness. The
   psuche, has its own life and intelligence, and so has the pneuma, and
   yet the two are one. But a second and strong inducement to adopting the
   Apollinarian theory, was the doctrine then held, by many, at least, of
   the Platonizing fathers, that reason in man is part of the divine Logos
   or universal reason. So that the difference between man and God, so far
   as man's intelligence is concerned, is merely quantitive. If this be
   so, it is indeed difficult to conceive how there should be in Christ
   both a part of the Logos and the entire Logos. The part would be
   necessarily superseded by the whole, or comprehended in it. But
   notwithstanding the force of this ad hominem argument as directed
   against some of his opponents, the conviction of the Church was so
   strong that Christ was a perfect man, possessing within Himself all the
   elements of our nature, that the Apollinarian doctrine was condemned in
   the general council held in Constantinople, A.D. 381, and soon
   disappeared.

   Nestorianism.

   The integrity of the two natures in Christ having been thus asserted
   and declared to be the faith of the Church, the next question which
   arose concerned the relations of the two natures, the one to the other,
   in the one person of Christ. Nestorianism is the designation adopted in
   church history, for the doctrine which either affirms, or implies a
   twofold personality in our Lord. The divine Logos was represented as
   dwelling in the man Christ Jesus, so that the union between the two
   natures was somewhat analogous to the indwelling of the Spirit. The
   true divinity of Christ was thus endangered. He was distinguished from
   other men in whom God dwelt, only by the plenitude of the divine
   presence, and the absolute control of the divine over the human. This
   was not the avowed or real doctrine of Nestorius, but it was the
   doctrine charged upon him, and was the conclusion to which his
   principles were supposed to lead. Nestorius was a man of great
   excellence and eminence; first a presbyter in Antioch, and afterwards
   Patriarch of Constantinople. The controversy on this subject arose from
   his defending one of his presbyters who denied that the Virgin Mary
   could properly be called the Mother of God. As this designation of the
   blessed Virgin had already received the sanction of the Church, and was
   familiar and dear to the people, Nestorius's objection to its use
   excited general and violent opposition. He was on this account alone
   accused of heresy. As, however, there is a sense in which Mary was the
   Mother of God, and a sense in which such a designation is blasphemous,
   everything depends on the real meaning attached to the terms. What
   Nestorius meant, according to his own statement, was simply that God,
   the divine nature, could neither be born nor die. In his third letter
   to Coelestin, Bishop of Rome, he said, "Ego autem ad hanc quidem vocem,
   quæ est theotokos, nisi secundum Apollinaris et Arii furorem ad
   confusionem naturarum proferatur, volentibus dicere non resisto; nec
   tamen ambigo quia hæc vox theotokos illi voci cedat, quæ est
   christotokos, tanquam prolatæ ab Angelis et evangelistis." What he
   asserted was, "Non peperit creatura creatorem, sed peperit hominem
   deitatis instrumentum. . . . . Spiritus sanctus . . . Deo Verbo templum
   fabricatus est, quod habitaret, ex virgine." Nevertheless, he obviously
   carried the distinction of natures too far, for neither he nor his
   followers could bring themselves to use the Scriptural language, "The
   Church of God which he purchased with his blood." The Syriac version
   used by the Nestorians, reads Christos instead of Theos in Acts xx. 28.
   The principal opponent of Nestorius was Cyril of Alexandria, who
   secured his condemnation by violent means in the Synod of Ephesus in
   A.D. 431. This irregular decision was resisted by the Greek and Syrian
   bishops, so that the controversy, for a time at least, was a conflict
   between these two sections of the Church. Ultimately Nestorius was
   deposed and banished, and died A.D. 440. His followers removed eastward
   to Persia, and organized themselves into a separate communion, which
   continues until this day.

   Eutychianism.

   As Nestorius so divided the two natures in Christ as almost to
   necessitate the assumption of two persons, his opponents were led to
   the opposite extreme. Instead of two, they insisted that there was but
   one nature in Christ. Cyril himself had taught what clearly implied
   this idea. According to Cyril there is but one nature in Christ because
   by the incarnation, or hypostatical union the human was changed into
   the divine. [312] With the extreme Alexandrian theologians, the
   humanity of Christ was ignored. It was the Logos who was born, the
   Logos who suffered and died. All about Christ was divine, even his
   body. [313] The opposition between the Syrian and Egyptian bishops
   (Antioch and Alexandria) became so pronounced, that any distinction of
   natures in Christ was by the latter denounced as Nestorianism. It was
   Eutyches, however, a presbyter of Constantinople, one of the most
   strenuous advocates of the views of Cyril and an opponent of Nestorius,
   who became the representative of this doctrine which has since gone by
   his name. He was accused of heresy on this account, and condemned in a
   Council called by the Patriarch of Constantinople. Eutyches admitted
   that before the incarnation there were. two natures, but afterwards
   only one. Homologo ek duo phuseon gegennesthai ton kurion hemon pro tes
   henoseos, meta de ten henosin, mian phusin homologo. But what was that
   nature which resulted from the union of the two? The human might be
   exalted into the divine, or lost in it, as a drop of vinegar (to use
   one of the illustrations then employed) in the ocean. Then Christ
   ceased to be a man. And as the union of the two natures commenced from
   the beginning, the whole of Christ's human earthly life became an
   illusion, or empty show. Where then are his redeeming work, and his
   bond of union or sympathy with us? Or the effect of the union might be
   to merge the divine into the human, so that the one nature was after
   all only the nature of man. Then the true divinity of Christ was
   denied, and we have only a human saviour. Or the effect of the union of
   the two natures was the production of a third, which was neither human
   nor divine, but theanthropic, as in chemical combinations an acid and
   an alkali when united, produce a substance which is no longer either
   acid or alkaline. Then Christ instead of being God and man, is neither
   God nor man. This being contrary to the Scriptures, and placing Christ
   out of the range of human sympathies, was opposed to the intimate
   convictions of the Church.

   The condemnation of Eutyches at Constantinople greatly incensed
   Dioscurus, bishop of Alexandria, and his associates. Through his
   influence a general synod was convened at Ephesus in 449 A.D., from
   which the opposers of Eutyches were forcibly excluded, and his doctrine
   of one nature in Christ formally sanctioned. The Council proceeded to
   excommunicate those who taught a contrary doctrine, and Eutyches was
   restored to office. The doctrines of the Council (known in history as
   "the robber council") were sanctioned by the emperor Theodosius. But as
   he died in the following year, his successor being hostile to
   Dioscurus, summoned another general synod, which met at Chalcedon, A.D.
   451. Here Dioscurus was deposed, and the letter of Leo of Rome to
   Flavian of Constantinople was adopted as a true exposition of the faith
   of the Church. Agreeably to the distinctions contained in that letter
   the Council framed its confession, in which it is said, [314] "We teach
   that Jesus Christ is perfect as respects Godhead, and perfect as
   respects manhood; that He is truly God, and truly a man consisting of a
   rational soul and a body; that He is consubstantial with the Father as
   to his divinity, and consubstantial with us as to his humanity, and
   like us in all respects, sin excepted. He was begotten of the Father
   before creation (pro aionon) as to his deity; but in these last days
   He, for us, and for our salvation, was born of Mary the Virgin, the
   mother of God as to his humanity. He is one and the same Christ, Lord,
   only begotten, existing in two natures without mixture, without change,
   without division, without separation; the diversity of the two natures
   not being at all destroyed by their union in the one person, but rather
   the peculiar property of each nature being preserved, and concurring to
   one person, and one subsistence." This was one of the six general
   Councils in whose doctrinal decisions all Protestants, at the time of
   the Reformation, professed their agreement. The Latin Church received
   this confession of the Council of Chalcedon cheerfully, but it met with
   great opposition in some parts, and especially in Palestine and Egypt,
   and therefore did not bring the controversy on this subject to an end.
   This conflict resulted in great disorders and bloodshed in Palestine
   and Egypt, and in Constantinople even in revolution; one Emperor was
   deposed, and another enthroned. After nearly two centuries of
   controversy, the Emperor Heraclius endeavoured to effect a
   reconciliation by getting both parties to admit that there are two
   natures in Christ, but only one will and operation, mia theandrike
   energeia. This effort was so far successful that a portion of the
   Monophysites assented to this modification of the creed of the Council
   of Chalcedon; but the more determined of that party and the great body
   of the orthodox refused. The controversy turned after this specially on
   the question whether there is one only, or two wills in Christ. If only
   one, then, as the orthodox asserted, there could be but one nature, for
   will is one of the essential elements or faculties of a rational
   nature. To deny Christ a human will, was to deny that He had a human
   nature, or was truly a man. Besides, it precluded the possibility of
   his having been tempted, and therefore contradicted the Scriptures, and
   separated Him so far from his people that He could not sympathize with
   them in their temptations. The effort of Heraclius therefore proved
   abortive, and the controversy continued with unabated acrimony, until
   finally the sixth general council held at Constantinople, A.D. 681,
   authoritatively decided in favour of the doctrine that in the one
   person of Christ, as there are two distinct natures, human and divine,
   there are of necessity two intelligences and two wills, the one
   fallible and finite, the other immutable and infinite. Christ was
   tempted, and there was, therefore, the metaphysical possibility that He
   should have yielded. According to this Council the person of Christ was
   not only formed, [315] ek duo phuseon, but consists since the
   hypostatic union ek duo phusesi, and it says in the name of the Church
   that there are duo phusikas theleseis etoi thelemata en auto, kai duo
   phusikas energeias adiairetos, atrettos, ameristos, asunchutos kata ten
   ton hagion pateron didaskalian hosautos keruttomen. The Monothelites
   being thus condemned were persecuted and driven eastward, where they
   have perpetuated themselves in the sect of the Maronites.

   With this council the conflict on this doctrine so far ceased that
   there has since been no further modification of the Church doctrine.
   The decision against Nestorius, in which the unity of Christ's person
   was asserted; that against Eutyches, affirming the distinction of
   natures; and that against the Monothelites, declaring that the
   possession of a human nature involves of necessity the possession of a
   human will, have been received as the true faith by the Church
   universal, the Greek, Latin, and Protestant.

   During the Middle Ages, although the person of Christ was the subject
   of diverse speculations on the part of individual writers, there was no
   open or organized opposition to the decisions of the above named
   councils.

   § 6. Doctrine of the Reformed Churches.

   At the time of the Reformation the Reformed adhered strictly to the
   doctrine of the early Church. This is apparent from the different
   Confessions adopted by the several Reformed bodies, especially from the
   Second Helvetic Confession, which, as will be seen, reviews and rejects
   all the ancient heresies on this subjects and repeats and adopts the
   language of the ancient creeds. In this Confession it is said: [316]
   "Credimus præterea et docemus filium Dei Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum
   ab æterno prædestinatum vel præordinatum esse, a Patre, salvatorem
   mundi: credimusque hunc esse genitum, non tantum, cum ex virgine Maria
   carnem assumsit, nec tantum ante jacta fundamenta mundi, sed ante omnem
   æternitatem, et quidem, a Patre, ineffabiliter. . . . . Proinde Filius
   est Patri juxta divinitatem coæqualis et consubstantialis, Deus verus
   non nuncupatione, aut adoptione, aut ulla dignatione, sed substantia
   atque natura. . . . . Abominamur ergo Arii et omnium Arianorum impiam
   contra filium Dei doctrinam. . . . . Eundem quoque æterni Dei æternum
   filium credimus et docemus hominis factum esse filium, ex semine Abrahæ
   atque Davidis, non ex viri coitu, quod Hebion dixit, sed conceptum
   purissime ex Spiritn Sancto, et natum ex Maria semper virgine: . . . .
   Caro ergo Christi, nec phantastica fuit, nec coelitus allata, sicuti
   Valentinus et Martion somniabant. Præterea anima fuit Domino nostro non
   absque sensu et ratione, ut Apollinaris sentiebat, neque caro absque
   anima, ut Eunomius docebat, sed anima cum ratione sua, et caro cum
   sensibus suis, per quos sensus, veros dolores tempore passionis suæ
   sustinuit. . . . . Agnoscimus ergo in uno atque eodem Domino nostro
   Jesu Christo, duas naturas [vel substantias, as it is in several
   editions], divinam et humanam: et has ita dicimus conjunctas et unitas
   esse, ut absorptæ, aut confusæ, aut immixtæ non sint: sed salvis potius
   et permanentibus naturarum proprietatibus, in una persona, unitæ et
   conjunctæ: ita ut unum Christum Dominum, non duos veneremur: unum
   inquam verum Deum et hominem, juxta divinam naturam Patri, juxta
   humanam vero nobis hominibus consubstantialem, et per omnia similem,
   peccato excepto. Etenim, ut Nestorianum dogma ex uno Christo duos
   faciens, et unionem personæ dissolvens, abominamur: ita Eutychetis et
   Monothelitarum vel Monophysicorum vesaniam, expungentem naturæ humanæ
   proprietatem execramur penitus. Ergo minime docemus naturam in Christo
   divinam passam esse, aut Christum secundum humanam naturam adhuc esse
   in hoc mundo, adeoque esse ubique. Neque enim vel sentimus, vel docemus
   veritatem corporis Christi a clarificatione desiisse, aut deificatam,
   adeoque sic deificatam esse, ut suas proprietates, quoad corpus et
   animam, deposuerit, ac prorsus in naturam divinam abierat, unaque
   duntaxat substantia esse coeperit. . . . . Præterea credimus Dominum
   nostrum Jesum Christum, vere passum et mortuum esse pro nobis. . . . .
   Interim non negamus et Dominum gloriæ, juxta verba Pauli, crucifixum
   esse pro nobis. Nam communicationem idiomatum, ex scripturis petitam,
   et ab universa vetustate in explicandis componendisque scripturarum
   locis in speciem pugnantibus usurpatam, religiose et reverenter
   recipimus et usurpamus."

   It thus appears that the Reformed distinctly rejected all the errors
   concerning the person of Christ, condemned in the early Church; the
   Arian, the Ebionitic, the Gnostic, the Apollinarian, the Nestorian, the
   Eutychian, and the Monothelite, as well as the peculiar Lutheran
   doctrine introduced at the time of the Reformation. The Reformed taught
   what the first six general councils taught, and what the Church
   universal received, -- neither more nor less. With this agrees the
   beautifully clear and precise statement of the Westminster Confession:
   "The Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, being very and
   eternal God, of one substance, and equal with the Father, did, when the
   fulness of time was come, take upon Him man's nature, and all the
   essential properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin:
   being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost in the womb of the
   Virgin Mary, of her substance. So that two whole, perfect, and distinct
   natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together
   in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion. Which
   person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only mediator
   between God and man." [317]

   § 7. Lutheran Doctrine.

   The Lutherans in their symbols adopt all the doctrinal decisions of the
   early Church respecting the person of Christ. They therefore hold, (1.)
   That Christ is very God and very man. (2.) That He has two distinct
   natures, a human and divine; that as to the latter He is consubstantial
   with the Father, and as to the former He is consubstantial with men.
   (3.) That He is one person. There is one Christ and not two. (4.) That
   the two natures are intimately united, but without confusion or change.
   Each nature retains its own peculiar properties. Nevertheless they hold
   that the attributes of the one nature were communicated to the other.
   They admit a "communio idiomatum" in the sense that whatever is true of
   either nature is true of the person. But beyond this they insist upon a
   "communicatio naturarum." And by nature, in this connection, they mean
   essence. In their symbols and writings the formula "natura, seu
   substantia, seu essentia" is of frequent occurrence. The divine essence
   is communicated to the human. The one interpenetrates the other. They
   "are mixed" (commiscentur). They do not become one essence, but remain
   two; yet where the one is the other is; what the one does the ether
   does. The human is as truly divine as the eternal essence of the
   Godhead, except that it is not divine ex se, but by communication. (5.)
   As however it would be derogatory to the divine nature to suppose it to
   be subject to the limitations and infirmities of humanity, this
   communication of attributes is said to be confined to the human nature.
   It receives divine perfections; but the divine receives nothing from
   the human. (6.) The human nature of Christ, therefore, is almighty,
   omniscient, and everywhere present both as to soul and body. (7.) As
   this transfer of divine attributes from the divine to the human nature
   is the consequence of the incarnation, or rather constitutes it, it
   began when the incarnation began, and consequently in the womb of the
   Virgin Mary. (8.) The humiliation of Christ consisted mainly in the
   hiding or not using the divine perfections of his human nature while
   here on earth; and his exaltation in the manifestation of the divine
   glory of his humanity. On this subject the "Form of Concord" [318]
   says, "Eamque Majestatem, ratione unionis personalis, semper Christus
   habuit: sed in statu suæ humiliationis sese exinanivit; qua de causa
   revera ætate, sapientia et gratia apud Deum atque homines profecit.
   Quare majestatem illam non semper, sed quoties ipsi visum fuit,
   exseruit, donec formam servi, non autem naturam humanam, post
   resurrectionem plene et prorsus deponeret, ut in plenariam
   usurpationem, manifestationem et declarationem divinæ majestatis
   collocaretur, et hoc modo in gloriam suam ingrederetur." (9.)
   Nevertheless Christ while here on earth, and even when in the womb of
   the Virgin, was as to his soul and body everywhere present.

   The above statement is believed to be a correct exhibition of the
   doctrine of the Lutheran Church as presented in the eighth chapter of
   the "Form of Concord." There is, however, no little difficulty in
   determining what the Lutheran doctrine really is. The Christology of
   Luther, although very clear and pronounced on certain points, was
   indefinite and doubtful in others. His successors differed seriously
   among themselves. It was one of the principal objects of the "Form of
   Concord" to settle the matters in dispute. This was done by compromise.
   Both parties made concessions, and yet both insisted upon the assertion
   of their peculiar views in one part or other of that document. It is,
   therefore, difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile some portions of
   the "Form of Concord" with others. It did not in fact put an end to the
   divisions which it was designed to heal.

   Different Views among the Lutherans.

   The principal points of difference among the Lutheran divines
   concerning the person of Christ were the following: The nature and
   effects of the union of natures in Christ; the ground of that union;
   and the time of its occurrence. The Reformed Church in adhering to the
   doctrine as it had been settled in the Council of Chalcedon, maintained
   that there is such an essential difference between the divine and human
   natures that the one could not become the other, and that the one was
   not capable of receiving the attributes of the other. If God became the
   subject of the limitations of humanity He would cease to be God; and if
   man received the attributes of God he would cease to be man. This was
   regarded as a self-evident truth. The "communion of attributes" which
   the Reformed, in accordance with the common faith of the Church,
   admitted, concerned only the person and not the natures of Christ.
   Christ possessed all the attributes of humanity and of divinity, but
   the two natures remained distinct; just as a man is the subject of all
   that can be predicated of his body and of his soul, although the
   attributes of the one are not predicable of the other. The Lutherans
   maintained that, according to this view, the two natures were as
   separate as duo asseres agglutinatos. This they pronounced to be no
   real incarnation. The Reformed acknowledged that Jesus Christ the son
   of the Virgin Mary is a divine person, but denied that his human nature
   was divine. The Lutherans maintained that man became God, and that the
   human did become divine. Otherwise, Christ as clothed in our nature,
   could not be an object of divine worship. As though we could not
   reverence a man unless we believed that the attributes of his mind were
   transferred to his body.

   Although the Lutheran theologians agree as to the fact that the man
   Christ Jesus became God, they differ as to the mode in which this was
   accomplished. Their language as to the fact is as strong as it can be
   made. Thus Brentius, the friend of Luther and the Reformer of
   Würtemberg, in his work "De Personali Unione," says, If the Logos "did
   not intend to remain either personally or with his nature outside of
   Christ, but purposed to become man, He must needs exalt the humanity
   into his own majesty. Therein, in fact, consists the incarnation, that
   the man Christ not merely never existed or worked without the Logos,
   but also that the Logos never existed or worked without the man, whom
   He had assumed; and is this was only possible though the elevation of
   the humanity to equal dignity with the Logos, the incarnation consists
   precisely in this elevation, -- the one is identical with the other."
   [319] "According to the philosophy of Zwingli, there is no proportion
   between the finite and the infinite; but in the philosophy of God,
   finite humanity also may become infinite." [320] The human nature of
   Christ, therefore, possesses all divine attributes. It fills heaven and
   earth. It is omniscient and almighty. In the "Form of Concord" [321] it
   is said, "Itaque non tantum ut Deus, verum etiam ut homo, omnia novit,
   omnia potest, omnibus creaturis præsens est, et omnia, quæ in coelis,
   in terris et sub terra sunt, sub pedibus suis et in manu sua habet."
   And again, [322] "Non in Christo sunt duæ separatæ personæ, sed unica
   tantum est persona. Ubicunque ea est, ibi est unica tantum et indivisa
   persona. Et ubicunque recte dixeris: hic est Deus, ibi fateri oportet,
   et dicere, ergo etiam Christus homo adest." This being the case, it
   being admitted that man becomes God, that the human becomes divine, the
   finite infinite, the question arises, How can this be? How is divinity
   thus communicated to humanity? It is in the answer to these questions
   that the diversities and inconsistencies in the views not only of
   theologians but also of the symbolical books, appear. It was a
   principle with the Wittenberg school of the Lutheran theologians that
   human nature is not capable of divinity. This is true also of Chemnitz,
   the greatest of the divines of the age after the Reformation. In his
   work "De Duabus Naturis in Christo, de Hypostatica Earum Unione, de
   Communicatione Idiomatum," etc., says Dorner, "he controverts in the
   most vigorous manner, a physica, naturalis communicatio,' or transfusio
   idiomatum;' and no less earnestly does he deny the capacitas' of a
   natura finita' for the infinitum,' if it signify more than that the
   divine can dwell and work in man." [323] As to the ubiquity of Christ's
   body, the dissent was still more decided. [324] Yet this idea of the
   capacity of human nature for divinity became the formative idea in the
   Lutheran doctrine of the person of Christ.

   No less diversity appears in the answer to the question, What is meant
   by the communication of natures? Sometimes it is said to be a
   communication of the essence of God to the human nature of Christ;
   sometimes a communication of divine attributes; and sometimes it is
   said to mean nothing more than that the human is made the organ of the
   divine. [325] The first has symbolical authority in its favour, and is
   the most consistent with the theory. It is the proper meaning of the
   words, for as natura in the "Form of Concord" is constantly in this
   connection explained by the words substantia and essentia, a
   communication of nature is a communication of essence. The one is not
   changed into the other, but they are intermingled and mixed without
   being confounded. [326]

   The favorite illustration of this union of two natures was derived from
   heated iron. In that case (according to the theory of heat then in
   vogue) two substances are united. The one interpenetrates the other.
   The iron receives the attributes of the caloric. It glows and burns.
   Where the iron is, there the caloric is. Yet the one is not changed
   into the other. The iron remains iron, and the heat remains heat. This
   is very ingenious; but, as is often the case, the analogy fails in the
   very point to be illustrated. The fact to be explained is how man
   becomes God and God man; how the human becomes divine, and the finite
   becomes infinite. In the illustration the heat does not become iron nor
   the iron heat. The only relation between the two is juxtaposition in
   space. But in the doctrine the human does become divine; man does
   become God.

   A second and minor point of difference was that some referred the
   communion of the attributes of the two natures to the hypostatical
   union, while others held that that union was the result of the
   communication of the divine nature to the human.

   The main difficulty, however, and the principal source of diversity
   related to the time and manner of the union of the two natures. We have
   already seen that one party held that this union took place at the
   moment of the "miraculous conception." The conception was the
   ascension. As the union of the divine with the human nature rendered
   the human divine, it became instanter omnipresent, almighty, and
   infinitely exalted. The effect of the incarnation was that the logos no
   longer existed extra carnem, neither was the caro extra logon. Whatever
   the one is the other is; whatever the one knows the other knows;
   whatever the one does the other does; and whatever majesty, glory, or
   blessedness the one has the other also has. "So certainly as the act of
   incarnation communicates the divine essence to humanity, even so
   certainly must this actual omnipresence, and not merely its potence,
   which does not exist, be communicated to the flesh of Christ." [327]
   The "Form of Concord" teaches the same doctrine; [328] it says, "Ex
   eodem etiam fundamento credimus, docemus et confitemur, Filium hominis
   ad dexteram omnipotentis majestatis et virtutis Dei, realiter, hoc est,
   vere et reipsa, secundum humanam suam naturam, esse exaltatum, cum homo
   ille in Deum assumptus fuerit, quamprimum in utero matris a Spiritu
   Sancto est confectus, ejusque humanitas jam tum cum Filio Dei altissimi
   personaliter fuerit unita." This, however, supposes the whole earthly
   life of Christ to be an illusion. There could be no growth or
   development of his human nature. He was omniscient and omnipotent when
   an unborn infant. The Bible says He increased in knowledge; this theory
   says that He knew all things from the beginning; that He was the ruler
   of the universe cooperating in all the activity of the Logos when in
   the womb of the Virgin; that He was supremely blessed as to his human
   nature when in the garden and upon the cross; and that as to soul and
   body He was living while lying in the grave. If this be so He never
   suffered or died, and there has been no redemption through his blood.

   To avoid these fatal consequences of their theory, the Lutherans were
   driven to different and conflicting subtle explanations. According to
   some there was no actual communication of the divine essence and
   attributes to the human nature until after his resurrection. The Logos
   was in Him only potentially. There was on the part of the divine nature
   a retractio, or hesuchazein, or quiescence, so that it was as though it
   were not there. According to others, there was a voluntary krupsis or
   veiling of itself or of its divine glory on the part of the humanity of
   Christ. According to others, this humiliation was rather the act of the
   Godman, who only occasionally revealed the fact that the human nature
   was divine. No explanation could meet the difficulties of the case,
   because they are inseparable from the assumption that the human nature
   of Christ was replete with divine attributes from the moment of its
   miraculous conception. It is a contradiction to say that the same
   individual mind was omniscient and yet was ignorant and increased in
   knowledge; that the same rational soul was supremely happy and
   exceeding sorrowful, at the same time; that the same body was
   potentially alive and yet actually dead. From the nature of the case
   there can be no difference between the ktesis and chresis of such
   divine attributes as omniscience and omnipresence. It would require a
   volume to give the details of the controversies between the different
   schools of the Lutheran divines on these and kindred points. This
   general outline is all that can here be expected. [329]

   Remarks on the Lutheran Doctrine.

   1. The first remark which suggests itself on this Lutheran doctrine is
   its contrast with the simplicity of the gospel. The New Testament
   predicates of our Lord Jesus Christ all that can be predicated of a
   sinless man, and all that can be predicated of a divine person. It is
   only stating this fact in another form to say that the Bible teaches
   that the eternal Son of God became man taking to Himself a true body
   and a reasonable soul, and so was, and continues to be, God and man, in
   two entire distinct natures and one person forever. Whatever is beyond
   this, is mere speculation. Not content with admitting the fact that two
   natures are united in the one person of Christ, the Lutheran
   theologians insist on explaining that fact. They are willing to
   acknowledge that two natures or substances, soul and body, are united
   in the one person in man, without pretending to explain the essential
   nature of the union. Why then can they not receive the fact that two
   natures are united in Christ without philosophizing about it? The first
   objection, therefore, is that the Lutheran doctrine is an attempt to
   explain the inscrutable.

   2. A second objection is that the character of the explanation was
   determined by the peculiar views of Luther as to the Lord's Supper. He
   believed that the body and blood of Christ are really and locally
   present in the Eucharist. And when asked, How can the body of Christ
   which is in heaven be in many different places at the same time? He
   answered that the body of Christ is everywhere. And when asked, How can
   that be? His only answer was, That in virtue of the incarnation the
   attributes of the divine nature were communicated to the human, so that
   wherever the Logos is there the soul and body of Christ must be.

   There are two things specially prominent in Luther as a theologian. The
   one is his entire subjection to the authority of Scripture, as he
   understood it. He seemed, moreover, never to doubt the correctness of
   his interpretations, nor was he willing to tolerate doubt in others. As
   to matters not clearly determined in the Bible, according to his view,
   he was exceedingly tolerant and liberal. But with regard to points
   which he believed to be taught in the Word of God, he allowed neither
   hesitation nor dissent. The other marked trait in his character was his
   power of faith. He could believe not only what was repugnant to his
   feelings, but what was directly opposed to his system, and even what
   was in its own nature impossible. His cardinal doctrine was
   "justification by faith alone," as he translated Romans iii. 28. He
   constantly taught not only that no man could be saved without faith in
   Christ, but that faith alone was necessary. Yet as he understood our
   Lord in John iii. 5, to teach that baptism is essential to salvation,
   he asserted its absolute necessity, although sorely against his will.
   To reconcile this with his doctrine of the necessity and sufficiency of
   faith, he held that new-born infants, when baptized, exercised faith
   although he meant by faith the intelligent, voluntary, and cordial
   reception of Christ as He is offered in the gospel. In like manner he
   hated the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation, and was bitterly
   opposed to all the subtleties of scholasticism. Yet as he understood
   our Lord's words, "This is my body," literally, he adopted all the
   subtleties, inconsistencies, and, we may say, impossibilities, involved
   in the doctrine of the ubiquity of Christ's body. Body includes the
   idea of form as well as of substance. A man's body is not the water,
   ammonia, and lime of which it is composed. It is certainly a strong
   objection to any doctrine that it owes its existence mainly to the
   desire to support a false interpretation of Scripture.

   Lutherans, indeed, deny that their doctrine concerning the person of
   Christ is thus subordinate to their views of the Lord's Supper. Even
   Dorner, in one place, seems to take the same ground. Elsewhere,
   however, he fully admits the fact. Thus when speaking of Luther, he
   says that he "did not develop his deep and full Christological
   intuitions in a connected doctrinal form. His controversy with the
   Swiss, on the contrary, had led him, as we have shown, to the adoption
   of single divergent principles, which aided in reducing Christology to
   the rank of a follower in the train of another doctrine, instead of
   conceding to it an independent life and sphere of its own." [330] And
   on the next page he says, "Even the champions of peace between the
   evangelical parties put their Christology in a position of dependence
   on the doctrine of the Eucharist, which almost involved the entire loss
   of the grand features of Luther's doctrine."

   3. It is to be objected to the Lutheran doctrine, not only that it
   undertakes to explain what is an inscrutable mystery, and that the
   explanation derives its character from Luther's views of the Eucharist,
   but also that the explanation itself is utterly unsatisfactory. In the
   first place, it is one sided. It insists on a communication of natures
   and a communion of attributes. Lutherans maintain that God became man
   as truly, and in the same sense that man became God. Yet they deny that
   the divine nature received anything from the human, or that God was in
   any way subject to the limitations of humanity. Nevertheless, such
   limitation appears to be involved in the Lutheran doctrine of Christ's
   humiliation. The idea is that after the incarnation the Logos is not
   extra carnem, that all his activity is with and through the activity of
   his humanity; and yet it is affirmed that the humanity did not
   exercise, while on earth, except occasionally, its divine perfections.
   This seems of necessity to involve the admission that the Logos did not
   exercise those perfections during the period of the humiliation. That
   is, while Christ was on earth, the knowledge and power of the Logos
   were measured and circumscribed by the knowledge and power of the human
   soul of Christ. This is the modern doctrine of kenosis which Luther
   rejected. He refused, says Dorner, "to purchase an actual growth of the
   divine-human vital unity at the price of a depotentiation or
   self-emptying of the Logos." [331]

   In the second place, the doctrine in question is destitute of any
   Scriptural support. Almost all the arguments derived from the
   Scriptures, urged by Lutherans, are founded on passages in which the
   person of Christ is denominated from his human nature when divine
   attributes or prerogatives are ascribed to Him; whence it is inferred
   that those attributes and prerogatives belong to his humanity. Thus
   because it is said, "The Son of Man is in heaven," it is inferred that
   the human nature, i.e., the soul and body of Christ, were in heaven
   while He was on earth. But they do not carry out the principle, and
   argue that because Christ is denominated from his divine nature when
   the limitations of humanity are ascribed to Him, that therefore his
   divine nature is limited. But if his being called God when He is said
   to have purchased the Church with his blood, does not prove that the
   divine nature suffered death, neither does his being called the Son of
   Man when He is said to be in heaven, prove the ubiquity of his
   humanity. Still less force is due to the argument from passages in
   which the Theanthropos is the subject to which divine perfections and
   prerogatives are ascribed. That our Lord said, "All power is given unto
   me in heaven and in earth," no more proves that his human nature is
   almighty, than his saying, "Before Abraham was I am," proves that his
   humanity is eternal. If saying that man is a rational creature does not
   imply that his body thinks, saying that Jesus Christ is God, does not
   imply that his human nature is divine. If the personal union between
   the soul and body in man, does not imply that the attributes of the
   soul are communicated to the body, then the personal union of the two
   natures in Christ does not imply that the divine attributes are
   communicated to his humanity.

   In the third place, the Lutheran doctrine destroys the integrity of the
   human nature of Christ. A body which fills immensity is not a human
   body. A soul which is omniscient, omnipresent, and almighty, is not a
   human soul. The Christ of the Bible and of the human heart is lost if
   this doctrine be true.

   In the fourth place, the Lutheran doctrine is contrary to the entire
   drift of the teaching of the Word of God, and of the whole Church. If
   anything is plainly revealed in the Scriptures concerning our Lord, and
   if there is anything to which the heart of the believer instinctively
   clings, it is that although He is God over all and blessed forever, He
   is nevertheless a man like ourselves; bone of our bone, and flesh of
   our flesh; one who can be touched with a sense of our infirmities; and
   who knows from his own experience and present consciousness, what a
   weak and infirm thing human nature is. He became and continues a man
   that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things
   pertaining to God. But a man whose body and soul fill immensity, who
   "as man" is omniscient and omnipotent, as just said, ceases to be a
   man. His humanity is merged into divinity, and He becomes not God and
   man, but simply God, and we have lost our Saviour, the Jesus of the
   Bible, who was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, who was one
   with us in his humanity, and therefore can sympathize with us and save
   us.

   Finally, it is a fatal objection to the doctrine under consideration
   that it involves the physical impossibility that attributes are
   separable from the substances of which they are the manifestation. This
   is the same kind of impossibility as action without something acting;
   or, motion without something moving. It is an objection urged by
   Lutherans as well as others against the Romish doctrine of
   transubstantiation that it supposes the accidents, or attributes of the
   bread and wine in the Eucharist, to continue when their substance no
   longer exists. In like manner, according to the Lutheran doctrine, the
   attributes of the divine nature or essence are transferred to another
   essence. If there be no such transfer or communication, then the human
   nature of Christ is no more omniscient or almighty, than the worker of
   a miracle is omnipotent. If the divine nature only exercises its
   omnipotence in connection with the activity of the humanity, then the
   humanity is the mere organ or instrument of the divine nature. This
   idea, however, the Lutherans repudiate. They admit that for God to
   exercise his power, when Peter said the lame man, "Rise up and walk,"
   was something entirely different from rendering Peter omnipotent.
   Besides, omnipresence and omniscience are not attributes of which a
   creature can be made the organ. Knowledge is something subjective. If a
   mind knows everything, then that mind, and not another in connection
   with it, is omniscient, If Christ's body is everywhere present, then it
   is the substance of that body, and not the essence of God that is
   omnipresent. The Lutheran doctrine is, however, that the essential
   attributes or properties of the two natures remain unchanged after the
   hypostatical union. The properties of the divine essence do not become
   the properties of the human. Then the humanity of Christ has the
   attributes of his divinity without its essence, and yet those
   attributes or, properties do not inhere in his human substance. [332]

   It seems a plain contradiction in terms, to say that the human becomes
   divine, that the finite becomes infinite; and no less a contradiction
   to say that the humanity of Christ has infinite attributes and yet
   itself is not infinite.

   The Lutheran doctrine of the Person of Christ has never been
   disconnected from the Lutheran doctrine of he Lord's Supper. Both are
   peculiar to that Church and form no part of Catholic Christianity.

   § 8. Later Forms of the Doctrine.

   During the period between the Reformation and the present time, the
   doctrine concerning the Person of Christ was constantly under
   discussion. The views advanced however were, for the most part,
   referrible to the one or other of the forms of the doctrine already
   considered. The only theories calling for special notice are
   Socinianism and that of the Preëxistent Humanity of Christ.

   Socinianism.

   Socinus was an Italian, born of a noble family at Siena, in 1539. The
   earlier part of his life was not devoted to learning. Being a favourite
   of the Grand Duke, he passed twelve years at his court, and then
   removed to Basel that he might prosecute his theological studies, in
   which he had become deeply interested. After a few years he removed to
   Poland and settled at Cracow. There and in its vicinity he passed the
   greater part of his active life. He died in 1604.

   The early Socinians erected a college at Racovia, in Lesser Poland,
   which attained so high a reputation that it attracted students from
   among Protestants and Romanists. It was however suppressed by the
   government in 1658, and the followers of Socinus, after having suffered
   a protracted persecution, were expelled from the kingdom.

   Socinus and his followers admitted the divine authority of the
   Scriptures. The sacred writers, they said, wrote, divino Spiritu
   impulsi eoque dictante. They admitted that the Bible contained
   doctrines above, but not contrary to reason. Of this contrariety reason
   was to judge. On this ground they rejected many doctrines held by the
   Church universal, especially the doctrines of the Trinity and of the
   Atonement. Socinus said that as there is but one divine essence there
   can be but one divine person. He denied that there is any such thing as
   natural religion or natural theology. Supernatural revelation he
   regarded as the only source of our knowledge of God and of divine
   things. The only religion was the Christian, which he defined to be
   "Via divinitus proposita et patefacta perveniendi ad immortalitatem,
   seu æternam vitam." [333] This is the answer to the first question of
   the "Brevissima Institutio," of which Socinus was the author.

   All men having sinned they became subject to the penalty of eternal
   death, which Socinus understood to be annihilation. To deliver men from
   this penalty God sent Christ into the world, and it is only through Him
   that immortality can be secured. Concerning Christ, he taught that He
   was in Himself and by nature a mere man, having had no existence prior
   to his being born of the Virgin Mary. He was, however, distinguished
   from all other men, --

   1. By his miraculous conception. [334]

   2. Although peccable and liable to be tempted, He was entirely free
   from sin.

   3. He received a special baptism of the Holy Ghost, that is, of the
   divine efficiency.

   4. Some time before entering upon his public ministry He was taken up
   into heaven that He might see God and be instructed immediately by Him.
   There are two passages which speak of Christ's having been in heaven
   (John iii. 13, and John vi. 62). "In priore loco," says Socinus, "ex
   Græco ita verba Christi legi possunt, ut dicat, filium hominis non
   quidem esse in coelo, sed fuisse. Vox enim Græca ?on quæ per præsens
   tempus reddita fuit, potest, ut doctissimi aliqui interpretes
   annotarunt (Erasmus et Beza), reddi per præteritum imperfectum; ut
   legatur non qui est, sed, qui erat in coelo." [335] As no preëxistence
   of Christ was admitted, these passages were regarded as direct
   assertions of his being taken up into heaven during his earthly life.

   5. The great distinction of Christ is that since his resurrection and
   ascension all power in heaven and in earth has been committed to Him.
   He is exalted above all creatures, and constituted God's viceroy over
   the whole universe. The question is asked, "Quid tamen istud ejus
   divinum imperium nominatim complectitur?" To which the answer is,
   "Propter id quod jam dictum est, nempe quod hoc potestatem complectitur
   plenissimam et absolutissimam in verum Dei populum, hinc necessario
   sequitur, eodem divino imperio contineri potestatem et dominationem in
   omnes angelos et spiritus tam malos, quam bonos." [336] And again:
   "Nonne ex eadem tua ratiocinatione sequitur, Jesum Christum in omnes
   homines plenum dominatum habere? Sine dubio; nec solum in omnes homines
   sed præter ipsum unum Deum 1 Cor. xv. 27, prorsus in alia omnia,
   quemadmodum divina testimonia nos diserte docent." [337]

   6. On account of this exaltation and authority Christ is properly
   called God, and is to be worshipped. Socinus would recognize no man as
   a Christian who was not a worshipper of Christ. The answer to Question
   246 in the Racovian Catechism, declares those "qui Christum non
   invocant nec adorandum censent," to be no Christians, because in fact
   they have no Christ. [338]

   7. Socinus acknowledges that men owe their salvation to Christ. He
   saves them not only in his character of prophet by teaching them the
   truth; not only in his character of priest by interceding for them; but
   especially in virtue of his kingly office. He exercises the divine and
   absolute power and authority granted to Him for their protection and
   assistance. He operates not only over them and for them, but also
   within them, so that it is through Him that immortality or eternal life
   is secured.

   From all this it appears that Socinus and his early followers held much
   more exalted views of Christ than those who in Great Britain and
   America are called Socinians, by whom our Lord is regarded as an
   ordinary man. The term Unitarian, especially in this country, is used
   in a sense which includes all who deny the doctrine of the Trinity and
   retain the name of Christians. It therefore includes Arians,
   Semi-Arians, genuine Socinians, and Humanitarians.

   Preëxistence of Christ's Humanity.

   Swedenborg.

   This theory has been held in different forms. The doctrine of
   Swedenborg is so mystical that it is very difficult to be clearly
   understood, and it has been modified in a greater or less degree by his
   recognized disciples. Swedenborg was the son of a Swedish bishop. He
   was born in January, 1688, and died in March, 1772. He enjoyed every
   advantage of early education. He manifested extraordinary precocity,
   and made such attainments in every branch of learning as to gain the
   highest rank among the literati of that day. He wrote numerous works in
   all the departments of science before he turned his attention to
   matters of religion. Believing that the existing Church in all its
   forms had failed to arrive at the true sense of Scripture, he regarded
   himself as called by God, in an extraordinary or miraculous manner, to
   reveal the hidden meaning of the Word of God and found a new Church.

   1. Concerning God, he taught that He was not only essence but form, and
   that that form was human. He called God "the eternal God-man." There
   are two kinds of bodies, material and spiritual. Every man, besides his
   external material body has another which is internal and spiritual. The
   latter has all the organs of the former, so that it can see, hear, and
   feel. At death the outer body is laid aside, and the soul thereafter
   acts through the ethereal or spiritual vestment. This is the only
   resurrection which Swedenborg admitted. There is no rising again of the
   bodies laid in the grave. As however the spiritual corresponds to the
   material, those who know each other in this world will enjoy mutual
   recognition in the world to come. This feature of his anthropology is
   connected with his doctrine concerning God. For as the soul from its
   nature forms for itself a body for action ad extra, so the essence of
   God forms for itself a spiritual body for external manifestation.

   As there is but one divine essence, Swedenborg maintained that there
   can be but one divine person. The Church doctrine of the Trinity he
   regarded as Tritheistic. He admitted a Trinity of principles, but not
   of persons. As soul and body in man are one person, and from them
   proceeds the activity which operates without, so in God the divine and
   human are the Father and the Son, as one person, and the Holy Spirit is
   their efficiency or sanctifying influence.

   2. Concerning man, Swedenborg taught that he was created in the image
   of God, and was a creature of a very exalted nature. The Scriptural
   account of the fall he understood allegorically of the apostasy of the
   Church. Men, however, he admits, are sinful, and are even born with a
   bias to evil, but they have not lost their ability to do good. They
   consequently need redemption. They are susceptible of being delivered
   from evil not only because they retain their moral liberty, but also
   because in virtue of the inward spiritual body they are capable of
   intercourse with spiritual beings. As man by means of his material body
   is conversant with the world of sense, so in virtue of his spiritual
   body he is capable of intercourse with the inhabitants of the spiritual
   world. Swedenborg reports many instances in which he conversed with God
   and angels, good and bad. By angels, however, he meant men who had
   departed this life. He did not admit the existence of any created
   intelligence other than man.

   3. Christ he held to be Jehovah, the only living and true God, the
   creator, preserver, and ruler of the world. As this divine person was
   God and man from eternity, his incarnation, or manifestation in the
   flesh, consisted in his assuming a material body with its psychical
   life in the womb of the Virgin Mary. This was the body which grew,
   suffered, and died. In the case of ordinary men the material body is
   left forever in the grave, but in the case of Christ the outward body
   was gradually refined and glorified until it was lost in that which is
   spiritual and eternal. This idea of a twofold body in Christ is not by
   any means peculiar to Swedenborg. Barclay, the representative
   theologian of the Quakers, says: "As there was the outward visible body
   and temple of Jesus Christ, which took its origin from the Virgin Mary:
   there is also the spiritual body of Christ, by and through which He
   that was the Word in the beginning with God, and was and is God, did
   reveal Himself to the sons of men in all ages, and whereby men in all
   ages come to be made partakers of eternal life, and to have communion
   and fellowship with God and Christ." [339] And again, P. Poiret, of
   Amsterdam, teaches that "La Majesté divine voulut couvrir son corps
   glorieux de notre chair mortelle, qu'il voulut prendre dans le sein
   d'une Vierge." "Le corps de Jésus Christ, se revêtant de la chair et du
   sang de la bien heureuse Vierge, fera aussi peu un composé de deux
   corps différents, qu'un habit blanc et lumineux plongé dans un vase de
   couleur chargée et obscure, ou il se charge de la matière, qui produit
   cette opacité, ne devient pour cela un habit double ou deux habits, au
   lieu d'un." [340]

   4. Christ's redemptive work does not consist in his bearing our sins
   upon the tree, or in making satisfaction to the justice of God for our
   offences. All idea of such satisfaction Swedenborg rejects. The work of
   salvation is entirely subjective. Justification is pardon granted on
   repentance. The people of God are made inwardly righteous, and being
   thus holy are admitted to the presence of God and holy spirits in
   heaven. His peculiar views of the state of the departed, or of Heaven
   and Hell, do not call for consideration in this place. [341]

   Isaac Watts.

   No one familiar with Dr. Watts' "Psalms and Hymns," can doubt his being
   a devout worshipper of our Lord Jesus Christ, or call in question his
   belief in the doctrine of the Trinity. Yet on account of his peculiar
   views on the person of Christ, there is a vague impression that he had
   in some way departed from the faith of the Church. It is, indeed, often
   said that he was Arian. In his works, [342] however, there is a
   dissertation on "The Christian Doctrine of the Trinity: or, Father,
   Son, and Spirit, three persons and one God, asserted and proved, with
   their divine Rights and Honors vindicated, by plain evidence of
   Scripture, without the aid or incumbrance of human Schemes. Written
   chiefly for the use of private Christians." In that dissertation the
   common Church doctrine is presented in the usual form, and sustained by
   the common arguments, with singular perspicuity and force.

   His peculiar views on the person of Christ are brought out in three
   discourses on "The Glory of Christ as God-man," [343] published in
   1746. In the first of these he refers to the "visible appearances of
   Christ, as God before his incarnation," and brings into view all the
   texts in which He is called Jehovah, God, and Lord, and those in which
   divine attributes and prerogatives are ascribed to Him.

   In the second, he treats of the "extensive powers of the human nature
   of Christ in its present glorified state." In a previous essay he took
   the position that the "human soul of Christ is the first, the greatest,
   the wisest, the holiest, and the best of all created spirits." [344] He
   argues this point from all those passages of Scripture which speak of
   the exaltation of Christ and of the gift to Him of absolutely universal
   dominion. As the divine nature of Christ does not admit of exaltation
   or of receiving anything as a gift, he inferred that these passages
   must be understood of his human nature, and therefore that Christ as a
   man must be regarded as exalted over all created beings. To the
   objection, "How is it possible that a human spirit should be endued
   with powers of so vast an extent?" he answers, first, that the power in
   question is not infinite; and secondly, that if the doctrine of the
   infinite divisibility of matter be true, we cannot fix the minimum of
   smallness, and how then can we determine the maximum of greatness.
   "Why," he asks, "may not the human soul of Christ be as well appointed
   to govern the world, as the soul of man is appointed to govern his
   body, when it is evident the soul of man does not know one thousandth
   part of the fine branchings of the muscles and nerves, and the more
   refined vapour or animal spirits which are parts of this body?" [345]
   Thirdly, we can hardly set a limit even to our own capacity; and yet
   the "soul of Christ may be reasonably supposed in its own nature to
   transcend the powers of all other souls as far as an angel exceeds an
   idiot, and yet be but a human soul still, for gradus non mutant
   speciem." [346] Fourthly, if the powers of the soul of Christ were not
   in his state of humiliation sufficient for the purposes of government
   and judgment, that does not prove that they are not now sufficient in
   his glorified estate. "Who knows what amazing enlargement may attend
   all the natural powers of man when advanced to a state of glory?" [347]
   Fifthly and mainly, this supreme exaltation of the power of the human
   soul of Christ is due to its union with the divine nature. It was
   because of this union that when the soul of Christ, while here on
   earth, willed to perform a miracle, the effect immediately followed. So
   "the man Christ may give forth all the commands of God whereby the
   world is governed." [348] "Upon this representation of things," he
   adds, "the various language of Scripture appears to be true, and is
   made very intelligible. Christ says He can do nothing of himself, He
   knew not the day of judgment' when He was here on earth, etc., and yet
   He is said to know the hearts of men, and to know all things'; for as
   fast as the divine mind united to Him was pleased to communicate all
   these ideas, so fast was his human nature capable of receiving them."
   [349]

   The third discourse is devoted to proving the preëxistence of the human
   soul of Christ. He argues from the fact that there are many expressions
   in the Bible, which seem to imply that He had a dependent nature before
   He came into this world. He is called the angel or messenger of God,
   and is represented as sent to execute his will. He urges also the fact
   that He is said to be the image of God. But the divine essence or
   nature cannot be the image of itself. That term can only apply to a
   created nature united to the divine, so that the "complex person" thus
   constituted, should reveal what God is. An argument is also drawn from
   all those passages in which Christ is said to have humbled Himself, to
   have become poor, to have made Himself of no reputation. All this
   cannot, he says, be properly understood of the divine nature, but is
   perfectly intelligible and full of meaning if referred to the human
   soul of our Lord. It was an act of unspeakable condescension for the
   highest intelligent creature to "empty Himself" and become as ignorant
   and feeble as an infant, and to submit not only to grow in wisdom, but
   to subject Himself to the infirmities and sufferings of our mortal
   state. If asked how so exalted an intellect can be reduced to the
   condition or state of an infant, he answers, that something analogous
   to this not unfrequently occurs, even in human experience. Men of
   mature age and of extensive learning have lost all their knowledge, and
   have been reduced to the necessity of learning it all over again,
   though in some cases it has returned suddenly. It was the same nature
   that emptied itself that was afterwards filled with glory as a
   recompense. Another argument for the preëxistence of the soul of
   Christ, he says, may be drawn from the fact that his incarnation "is
   always expressed in some corporeal language, such as denotes his taking
   on Him animal nature, or body, or flesh, without the least mention of
   taking a soul.'" [350]

   Again, [351] "The covenant betwixt God the Father and his Son Jesus
   Christ for the redemption of mankind, is represented in Scripture as
   being made and agreed upon from or before the foundation of the world.
   Is it not then most proper that both real parties should be actually
   present, and that this should not be transacted merely within the
   divine essence by such sort of distinct personalities as have no
   distinct mind and will? The essence of God is generally agreed by our
   Protestant divines to be the same single numerical essence in all three
   personalities, and therefore it can be but one conscious mind or
   spirit. Now can one single understanding and will make such a covenant
   as Scripture represents? I grant the divine nature which is in Christ
   from eternity contrived and agreed all the parts of this covenant. But
   does it not add a lustre and glory, and more conspicuous equity, to
   this covenant, to suppose the man Christ Jesus who is most properly the
   mediator according to 1 Tim. ii. 5, to be also present before the world
   was made, to be chosen and appointed as the redeemer or reconciler of
   mankind, to be then ordained the head of his future people, to receive
   promises, grace, and blessings in their name, and to accept the solemn
   and weighty trust from the hand of his Father, that is, to take care of
   millions of souls?"

   He also argues from what the Bible teaches of the Sonship of Christ.
   "When He is called a Son, a begotten Son, this seems to imply
   derivation and dependency; and perhaps the Sonship of Christ, and his
   being the only begotten of the Father, may be better explained by
   attributing it to his human soul, existing by some peculiar and
   immediate manner of creation, formation, or derivation from the Father,
   before other creatures were formed; especially if we include in the
   same idea of Sonship his union to the divine nature, and if we add also
   his exaltation to the office of the Messiah, as King and Lord of all."
   [352]

   Dr. Watts explains clearly what he means by the preëxistence of the
   humanity of Christ, when he says: [353] "All the idea which I have of a
   human soul is this, namely, a created mind or spirit which hath
   understanding and will, and rational powers, and which is fit to be
   united to a human body, in such a manner as to exert the powers of a
   man, to feel the appetites and sensibilities and passions of a man, as
   to receive impressions or sensations, whether pleasant or painful, by
   the means of that body, and is also able to actuate and influence all
   the animal powers of that body in a way agreeable to human nature."

   The above is very far from being a full exposition of the
   considerations urged by Dr. Watts in support of his theory. It is
   simply a selection of the more plausible of his arguments presented in
   order that his doctrine may be properly understood.

   It appears that he believed in the eternal Godhead of the Logos as the
   second person of the Trinity; and that God, before any other creatures
   were called into existence, created a human soul in personal union with
   the Logos of such exalted powers as to render him the greatest of all
   created spirits; that the incarnation consisted in this complex person
   assuming a material human body with its animal life; that the
   humiliation of Christ consisted in his human soul thus exalted in its
   own nature, emptying itself of its knowledge, power, and glory, and
   submitting not only to the gradual development of his humanity, but
   also to all that made our Lord while here on earth a man of sorrows.
   His exaltation consisted in the enlargement of the powers of his soul
   during his state of humiliation, and in his resurrection and ascension
   to the right hand of God.

   The more obvious objections to this theory are, --

   1. That it is contrary to the common faith of the Church, and,
   therefore, to the obvious sense of Scripture. The Bible in teaching
   that the Son of God became man, thereby teaches that He assumed a true
   body and a rational soul. For neither a soul without a body, nor a body
   without a soul, is a man in the Scriptural sense of the term. It was
   the Logos which became man; and not a God-man that assumed a material
   body.

   2. The passages of Scripture cited in its support are interpreted, for
   the most part, in violation of the recognized principle that whatever
   is true of either nature in Christ, may be predicated of his person. As
   Christ could say, "I thirst," without implying that his divine nature
   was subject to the wants of a material body; so He could say, "All
   power is given unto me in heaven and in earth," without teaching that
   such power vests in his humanity.

   3. The doctrine that Christ's human soul was the first and most exalted
   of created spirits, raises Him beyond the reach of human sympathies. He
   is, as man, farther from us than the angel Gabriel. We need, and the
   Bible reveals to us a, so to speak, more circumscribed Saviour, one
   who, although true God, is nevertheless a man like unto his brethren,
   whom we can embrace in the arms of our faith and love. [354]

   § 9. Modern Forms of the Doctrine.

   Dorner, in the first edition of his work on the "Person of Christ,"
   says that the Lutheran theology carried the attempt to preserve the
   unity of Christ's person, on the Church assumption that He possessed
   two distinct natures, to the utmost extreme. If that attempt be a
   failure, nothing more remains. He holds it to be a failure not only
   because it involves the impossible assumption of a transfer of
   attributes without a change of substance, but also because it is
   one-sided. It refuses to admit of the communication of human attributes
   to the divine nature, whilst it insists on the transfer of divine
   perfections to the human nature. And moreover, he urges, that admitting
   all the Lutheran theory claims, the union of the two natures remains
   just as unreal as it is on the Church doctrine. Any distinction of
   natures, in the ordinary sense of the words, must, he says, be given
   up. It is on this assumption that the modern views of the person of
   Christ are founded. These views may be divided into two classes, the
   Pantheistical and the Theistical. These two classes, however, have a
   good deal in common. Both are founded on the principle of the oneness
   of God and man. This is admitted on all sides. "The characteristic
   feature of all recent Christologies," says Dorner, "is the endeavour to
   point out the essential unity of the divine and human." [355] The
   heading of the section in which this admission occurs, is, "The
   Foundations of the New Christology laid by Schelling, Hegel,
   Schleiermacher." This is equivalent to saying that the New Christology
   is founded on the principles of the pantheistic philosophy. Baur [356]
   says the same thing. He entitles the last division of his work on the
   Trinity, "Die gegenseitige Durchdringung der Philosophie und der
   Theologie," i.e., The mutual interpenetration of Philosophy and
   Theology. The latter is merged into the former. Dr. Ullmann says, the
   doctrine of the oneness of God and man, which he represents as the
   fundamental idea of Schleiermacher's theology and of Christianity
   itself, is not entirely new. It was inculcated by the German Mystics of
   the Middle Ages. [357] Hegel says that what the Bible teaches of Christ
   is not true of an individual, but only of mankind as a whole; and
   Hegel's Christological ideas, Dr. John Nevin of Mercersburg, says, "are
   very significant and full of instruction." [358] The objection that
   these principles are pantheistical, he pronounces "a mere sound without
   any force whatever," and adds that we need a Christian pantheism to
   oppose the antichristian pantheism of the day. Schleiermacher says that
   a pantheism which holds to the formula "One and All" ("the
   all-one-doctrine") is perfectly consistent with religion, and differs
   little in its effects from Monotheism! Similar avowals might be adduced
   without number. Theologians of this class deny that God and man are
   essentially different. They repeat, almost with every breath, that God
   and man are one, and they make this the fundamental idea of
   Christianity, and especially of Christology

   Pantheistical Christology.

   As Christian theology purports to be an exhibition of the theology of
   the Bible, every theory which involves the denial of a personal God,
   properly lies beyond its sphere. In modern systems, however, there is
   such a blending of pantheistic principles with theistic doctrines, that
   the two cannot be kept entirely separate. Pantheistical and theistical
   theologians, of the modern school, unite in asserting "the oneness of
   God and man." They understand that doctrine, however, in different
   senses. With the former it is understood to mean identity, so that man
   is only the highest existence-form of God; with the others, it often
   means nothing more than that "natura humana capax est naturæ divinæ."
   The human is capable of receiving the attributes of the divine. Man may
   become God.

   It follows, in the first place, from the doctrine, that God is the only
   real Being of which the world is the ever changing phenomenon, that
   "die Menschwerdung Gottes ist eine Menschwerdung von Ewigkeit." The
   incarnation of God is from eternity. And, in the second place, that
   this process is continuous, complete in no one instance, but only in
   the whole. Every man is a form of the life of God, but the infinite is
   never fully realized or revealed in any one manifestation. Some of
   these philosophers were willing to say that God was more fully
   manifested in Christ than in any other individual of our race, but the
   difference between Him and other men is only one of degree. Others say
   that the peculiar distinction of Christ was that He had a clearer view
   and a deeper conviction of the identity of God and man than any other
   man. It all amounts to the summation of the doctrine as given by
   Strauss. [359] "If," says he, "the idea of the oneness of the divine
   and human natures, of God and man, be a reality, does it follow that
   this reality is effected or manifested once for all in a single
   individual, as never before and never after him? . . . . An idea is
   never exhibited in all its fulness in a single exemplar; and in all
   others only imperfectly. An idea is always realized in a variety and
   multiplicity of exemplars, which complement each other; its richness
   being diffused by the constant change of individuals, one succeeding or
   supplanting another. . . . . Mankind, the human race, is the God-man.
   The key to a true Christology is that the predicates which the Church
   applies to Christ, as an individual, belong to an idea, or to a generic
   whole." So Blasche [360] says, "We understand by God's becoming man,
   not the revelation of Himself in one or more of the most perfect of
   men, but the manifestation of Himself in the race of men (in der ganzen
   Menschheit)."

   Theistical Christology.

   We have the authority of Dorner for saying that the modern speculations
   on Christology are founded on the two principles that there is but one
   nature in Christ, and that human nature is capax naturæ divinæ, is
   capable of being made divine. To this must be added a third, although
   Dorner himself does not hold it, that the divine is capable of becoming
   human.

   The advocates of these principles agree, First, in admitting that there
   was a true growth of the man Christ Jesus. When an infant He was as
   feeble, as ignorant, and as unconscious of moral character as other
   infants. When a child He had no more intellectual or physical strength
   than other children. There is, however, a difference in their mode of
   statement as to what Christ was during the maturity of his earthly
   life. According to some, He had no superhuman knowledge or power. All
   He knew was communicated to Him, some say by the Father, others say by
   the Logos. The miracles which He wrought were not by his own power, but
   by the power of God. At the grave of Lazarus He prayed for power to
   restore his friend to life, or rather that God would raise him from the
   dead; and He gave thanks that his prayer was heard.

   Secondly, they agree that the development of the humanity of our Lord
   was without sin. He was from the beginning holy, harmless, undefiled,
   and separate from sinners. Nevertheless He had to contend with all the
   infirmities of our nature, and to resist all the temptations arising
   from the flesh, the world, and the devil, with which his people have to
   contend. He was liable to sin. As He was subject to hunger, thirst,
   weariness, and pain, as He had feelings capable of being wounded by
   ingratitude and insult, He was liable to the impatience and resentment
   which suffering or injury is adapted to produce. As He was susceptible
   of pleasure from the love and admiration of others, He was exposed to
   the temptation of seeking the honour which comes from men. In all
   things, however, He was without sin.

   Thirdly, they agree that it was only gradually that Christ came to the
   knowledge that He was a divine person, and into the possession and use
   of divine attributes. Communications of knowledge and power were made
   to Him from time to time from on high, so that both the knowledge of
   what He was and the consciousness of the possession of divine
   perfections came to Him by degrees. Christ's exaltation, therefore,
   began and was carried on while He was here on earth, but it was not
   until his resurrection and ascension that He became truly and forever
   divine.

   Fourthly, since his ascension and session at the right hand of God, He
   is still a man, and only a man. Nevertheless He is an infinite man. A
   man with all the characteristics of a human soul possessed of all the
   perfections of the Godhead. Since his ascension, as Gess expresses it,
   a man has been taken into the adorable Trinity. "As the glorified Son
   remains man, a man is thus received into the trinitarian life of the
   Deity from and by the glorification of the Son." [361] Thomasius says
   the same thing. "Die immanente Lebensbewegung der drei Personen ist
   nunmehr gewissermassen eine göttlich-menschhiche geworden; . . . . So
   tief ist in der Person Christi die Menschheit in den Kreis der Trinität
   hereingenommen -- und zwar nicht auf vorübergehende Weise, sondern für
   immer. Denn der Sohn bleibt ewig Mensch." [362] That is: The immanent
   life movement of the three persons has now become in a measure
   divine-human; . . . . so deep has humanity in the person of Christ been
   taken into the sphere of the Trinity, -- and that not in a temporary
   manner, but forever. For the Son remains man eternally. On the
   following page he says that humanity, or manhood (Menschsein), has
   become the permanent existence-form of God the Son. And again [363] he
   says that humanity (das menschliche Geschlecht) is "exalted to full
   equality with God" (schlecht Gott selbst gleichgesetzt). This would be
   absolutely impossible were not human nature in its original
   constitution capable of receiving all divine perfections and of
   becoming absolutely divine. Accordingly, in this connection, Thomasius
   says that man is of all creatures the nearest to God. [364] "He must
   from his nature be capable of full participation in the divine glory;
   he must be the organ into which the entire fulness of the divine love
   can be poured, and through which it can adequately act, otherwise we
   cannot understand how God could appropriate human nature as his own
   permanent form of existence."

   The result of the incarnation, therefore, is that God becomes man in
   such a sense that the Son of God has no life or activity, no knowledge,
   presence, or power outside of or apart from his humanity. In Christ
   there is but one life, one activity, one consciousness. Every act of
   the incarnate Logos is a human act, and every experience of the
   humanity of Christ, all his sorrows, infirmities, and pains, were the
   experience of the Logos. "The absolute life, which is the being of God,
   exists in the narrow limits of an earthly-human life; absolute holiness
   and truth, the essential attributes of God, develop themselves in the
   form of human thinking and willing; absolute love has assumed a human
   form, it lives as human feeling, as human sensibility in the heart of
   this man; absolute freedom has the form of human self-determination.
   The Son of God has not reserved for Himself a special existence form
   (ein besonderes Fürsichseyn), a special consciousness, a special sphere
   or power of action; He does not exist anywhere outside of the flesh
   (nec Verbum extra carnem nec caro extra Verbum). He has in the totality
   of his being become man, his existence-and-life-form is that of a
   corporeal-spiritual man subject to the limitations of time and space.
   The other side of this relation is that the human nature is taken up
   entirely into the divine, and is pervaded by it. It has neither a
   special human consciousness nor a special human activity of the will
   for itself in distinction from that of the Logos, just as the latter
   has nothing which does not belong to the former; in the human thinking,
   willing, and acting, the Logos thinks, wills, and acts. All dualism of
   a divine and human existence-form, of a divine and human consciousness,
   of a concomitancy of divine and human action, is of necessity excluded;
   as is also any successive communication (Hineinbildung) of one to the
   other; it is an identical living, activity, sensibility, and
   development, because it is one Ego, one divine human personality (unio,
   communio, communicatio, naturarum)." [365]

   As to the manner in which this complete identification of the human and
   divine in the person of Christ is effected, there are, as above
   intimated, two opinions. According to Dorner there is a human soul to
   begin with, to which the Eternal Logos, without subjecting Himself to
   any change, from time to time communicates his divinity, as the human
   becomes more and more capable of receiving the perfections of God,
   until at last it becomes completely divine. With this Dorner connected
   a philosophical theory concerning the relation of Christ to the
   universe, and especially to the whole spiritual world. [366]

   The other view of the subject is, that the Eternal Logos, by a process
   of self-limitation, divested Himself of all his divine attributes. He
   ceased to be omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. He reduced
   Himself, so to speak, to the dimensions of a man. While an infant, as
   before said, He had no knowledge or power which does not belong to any
   other human infant. He went through the regular process of growth and
   development, and had all the experiences of ordinary men, yet without
   sin. But as the substance of the Logos was the substance of the infant
   born of the Virgin, it continued to develop not only until it reached a
   height of excellence and glory to which no other man ever attained, but
   until it ultimately culminated in full equality with God.

   On this point Thomasius says, First, that if the Eternal Son, after the
   assumption of humanity, retained his divine perfections and
   prerogatives, He did not become man, nor did He unite Himself with
   humanity. He hovered over it; and included it as a larger circle does a
   smaller. But there was no real contact or communication. Secondly, if
   at the moment of the incarnation the divine nature in the fulness of
   its being and perfection was communicated to the humanity, then Christ
   could not have had a human existence. The historical life is gone; and
   all bond of relationship and sympathy with us is destroyed. Thirdly,
   the only way in which the great end in view could be answered was that
   God Himself by a process of depotentiation, or self-limitation, should
   become man; that He should take upon Himself a form of existence
   subject to the limitations of time and space, and pass through the
   ordinary and regular process of human development, and take part in all
   the sinless experiences of a human life and death. [367]

   Ebrard.

   Ebrard puts the doctrine in a somewhat different form. He molds that
   the Logos reduced Himself to the dimensions of a man; but at the same
   time retained and exercised his divine perfections as the second person
   of the Trinity. In answer to the question, How human and divine
   attributes can be united in the same person, he says the solution of
   the difficulty is to be found in the original constitution and destiny
   of humanity. Man was designed for this supreme dominion, perfect
   holiness, and boundless knowledge. "The glorification of God as Son in
   time is identical with the acme of the normal development of man." It
   is held by many, not by all of the advocates of this theory, that the
   incarnation would have taken place had men never sinned. It entered
   into the divine purpose in reference to man that he should thus attain
   oneness with Himself.

   As to the still more difficult question, How can the Son as the second
   person of the Trinity retain his divine perfections (as Ebrard holds
   that He does), and yet, as revealed on earth, lay them aside? "The one
   is world-ruling and omniscient, and the other is not," he says we must
   understand the problem. It is not that two natures become one nature.
   "Two natures as two things (Stücken) are out of the question." The
   Logos is not one nature, and the incarnate Son of God, Jesus, another;
   but the incarnate Son possesses the properties of both natures. The
   question only is, How can the incarnate Logos, since He has not the one
   nature, the divine, in the form of God (in der Ewigkeitsform), be one
   with the world-governing Logos who is in the form of God? This
   question, which is equivalent to asking, How the same individual mind
   can be finite and infinite at the same time, he answers by saying,
   first, that the continuity of existence does not depend upon continuity
   of consciousness. A man in a swoon or in a state of magnetic sleep, is
   the same person, although his consciousness be suspended or abnormal.
   That is true, but the question is, How the same mind can be conscious
   and unconscious at the same time, How th same individual Logos can be a
   feeble infant and at the same time the intelligently active
   world-governing God. Secondly, he admits that the above answer does not
   fully meet the case, and therefore adds that the whole difficulty
   disappears when we remember (dass die Ewigkeit nicht eine der Zeit
   parallellaufende Linie ist), that Eternity and Time are not parallel
   lines. But, thirdly, seeing that this is not enough, he says that the
   Eternal Logos overlooks his human form of existence with one glance
   (mit einem Schlage), whereas the incarnate Logos does not, but with
   true human consciousness, looks forward and backward. All this avails
   nothing. The contradiction remains. The theory assumes that the same
   individual mind can be conscious and unconscious, finite and infinite,
   ignorant and omniscient, at the same time. [368]

   Gess.

   Gess admits the contradiction involved in the doctrine as presented by
   Ebrard, and therefore adopts the common form of the theory. He holds
   that the Eternal Son at the incarnation laid aside the Godhead and
   became a man. The substance of the Logos remained; but that substance
   was in the form of an infant, and had nothing beyond an infant's
   knowledge or power. In the Trinity, the Father is God of Himself; the
   Son is God by the communication of the divine life from the Father.
   During the earthly career of the Logos the communication of the divine
   life was suspended. The Logos reduced to the limitations of manhood,
   received from the Father such communications of supernatural power as
   He needed. When He ascended and sat down at the right hand of God, He
   received the divine life in all its fulness as He had possessed it
   before He came into the world. "The same substance," he says,
   "slumbered in the womb of the Virgin, without self-consciousness, which
   thirty-four years after yielded itself a sacrifice, without blemish and
   spot, to the Father, having previously revealed to mankind the truth,
   which it had perfectly comprehended. At the time of this slumber there
   already existed in this substance that indestructible life by virtue of
   which it had a accomplished our redemption (Heb. vii. 16), as well as
   the power to know the Father as no other knows Him (Matt. xi. 27), but
   it was unconscious life. Moreover, the same substance which now
   slumbered in unconsciousness, had before existed with the Father as the
   Logos, by whom the Father had created, governed, and preserved the
   world, but it was no longer aware of this." [369] On the opposite page,
   it is said, that it is the self-conscious will of a man that calls all
   his powers into action. "When this sinks into slumber, all the powers
   of the soul fall asleep. It was the substance of the Logos which in
   itself had the power to call the world into existence, to uphold and
   enlighten it; but when the Logos sank into the slumber of
   unconsciousness, his eternal holiness, his omniscience, his
   omnipresence, and all his really divine attributes were gone; it being
   the self-conscious will of the Logos through which all the divine
   powers abiding in Him had been called into action. They were gone,
   i.e., suspended, -- existing still, but only potentially. Further, a
   man when he awakes from sleep is at once in full possession of all his
   powers and faculties; but when consciousness burst upon Jesus it was
   not that of the eternal Logos, but a really human self-consciousness,
   which develops by degrees and preserves its identity only through
   constant changes. . . . . It was this human form of self-conscious
   existence which the Logos chose in his act of self-divestiture. Hence
   it plainly appears that omniscience, which sees and knows all things at
   once, and from one central point, and the unchangeable merging of the
   will into the Father's, or divine holiness, are not to be attributed to
   Jesus while on earth; and the same with the unchangeable bliss of the
   divine life. Nor was it only eternal self-consciousness which the Son
   laid aside, but He also went out from the Father.' We are not to
   understand that the indwelling of the Father, Son, and Spirit in each
   other had been dissolved, but that the Father's giving the Son to have
   life in Himself, as the Father has, was suspended. Having laid aside
   his self-consciousness and activity, He lost with this the capacity of
   receiving into Himself the stream of life from the Father, and sending
   it forth again; in other words, He was no longer omnipotent. Equally
   lost, or laid aside, was his omnipresence, which must not, at all
   events, be considered as universally diffused, but as dependent on the
   self-conscious will." [370]

   Remarks.

   1. The first remark to be made on this theory in all its forms is that
   it is a departure from the faith of the Church. This objection turns up
   first on every occasion, because that is its proper place. If the Bible
   be the only infallible rule of faith and practice; and if the Bible be
   a plain book, and if the Spirit guides the people of God (not the
   external church, or body of mere professing Christians) into the
   knowledge of the truth, then the presumption is invincible that what
   all true Christians believe to be the sense of Scripture is its sense.
   The whole Christian world has believed, and still does believe, that
   Christ was a true man; that He had a real body and a human soul. The
   Council of Chalcedon in formulating this article of the common faith,
   declared that Christ was, and is, God and man in two distinct natures
   and one person forever; that according to the one nature He is
   consubstantial (homoousios) within us, and according to the other He is
   consubstantial with the Father. There is no dispute as to the sense in
   which the Council used the word nature, because it has an established
   meaning in theology, and because it is explained by the use of the
   Latin word consubstantial, and the Greek word homoousios. Nor is it
   questioned that the decisions of that Council have been accepted by the
   whole Church. This doctrine of two natures in Christ the new theory
   rejects. This, as we have seen, Dorner expressly asserts. We have seen,
   also, that Ebrard says, that the idea of two natures in the sense of
   two substances (Stücke, concrete existences) is out of the question.
   The Logos did not assume human nature, but human attributes; He
   appeared in the fashion of a man. Gess, in his luminous book, teaches
   over and over, that it was the substance of the Logos that was the
   human soul of Christ. He speaks of his "Logos-nature;" of the "Logos
   being the life, or life-principle" of his humanity. He says, in so many
   words, [371] that the soul of Jesus was "not like that of other men, a
   soul created by God and for God, but the Logos in the form of human
   existence." It is consonant, he says, "to the nature of Christ's soul,
   as being the Logos existing in human form, that God should take
   possession of it in a peculiar manner." This idea is the very essence
   of the doctrine. For if the Logos "emptied" Himself, if He laid aside
   his omnipresence and omnipotence, and became a human soul, what need or
   what possibility remains of another newly created soul?

   This is not Apollinarianism; for Apollinaris taught that the Logos
   supplied the place of a rational soul in the person of Christ. He did
   not become such a soul, but, retaining in actu as well as in potentia,
   the fulness of the divine perfections, took its place. Nor is it
   exactly Eutychianism. For Eutyches said that there were two natures
   before the union, and only one after it. The two were so united as to
   become one. This the theory before us denies, and affirms that from the
   beginning the Logos was the sole rational element in the constitution
   of the person of our Lord. It agrees, however, with both these ancient
   and Church-rejected errors in their essential principles. It agrees
   with the Apollinarians in saying that the Logos was the rational
   element in Christ; and it agrees with the Eutychians in saying that
   Christ had but one nature.

   The doctrine is in still more obvious contradiction to the decisions of
   the Council of Constantinople on the Monothelite controversy. That
   Council decided that as there were two natures in Christ, there were of
   necessity two wills. The new theory in asserting the oneness of
   Christ's nature, denies that He had two wills. The acts, emotions, and
   sufferings of his earthly life, were the acts, emotions, and sufferings
   of the Logos. So far as Christian interest in the doctrine is
   concerned, it was to get at this conclusion the theory was adopted if
   not devised. It was to explain how that more than human value belongs
   to the sufferings of Christ, and more than human efficacy to his life,
   that so many Christian men were led to embrace the new doctrine. The
   Church doctrine. however, does not consider either the sufferings or
   the life of Christ as those of a mere man. He was a divine person, God
   manifest in the flesh; and his sufferings and life were those of that
   person. Christians can say, and always have said, with an intelligent
   and cordial faith, that God purchased the Church with his blood. It was
   because the person who died was possessed of an Eternal Spirit that his
   blood cleanses from all sin.

   2. The arguments from Scripture in support of the theory are for the
   most part founded on the neglect of the principle so often referred to,
   that anything can be predicated of the person of Christ that can be
   predicated either of his human or of his divine nature. That the one
   person is said to be born and to suffer and die, no more proves that
   the Logos as such was born and suffered and died, than saying of a man
   that he is sick or wounded proves that his soul is diseased or injured.
   The same remark, of course, applies to the exaltation and dominion of
   the risen Redeemer. It is the one person who is the object of the
   worship of all created intelligences, and to whom their obedience is
   due; but this does not prove that Christ's human nature is possessed of
   divine attributes. Indeed, according to the modern doctrine of Kenosis,
   He has no human nature, as already proved.

   3. The theory in question is inconsistent with the clear doctrine both
   of revealed and natural religion concerning the nature of God. He is a
   Spirit infinite, eternal, and immutable. Any theory, therefore, which
   assumes that God lays aside his omnipotence, omniscience, and
   omnipresence, and becomes as feeble, ignorant, and circumscribed as an
   infant, contradicts the first principle of all religion, and, if it be
   pardonable to say so, shocks the common sense of men.

   4. Instead of removing any difficulties attending the doctrine of the
   incarnation, it greatly increases them. According to Dorner's view we
   are called upon to believe that a human soul receives gradually
   increasing measures of the divine fulness, until at last it becomes
   infinite. This is equivalent to saying that it ceases to exist. It is
   only on the assumption that Dorner, when he says that the essential
   nature of God is love, and that the communication of the Godhead is the
   communication of the fulness of the divine love, means that God is
   purely ethical, an attribute, but not a substance, that we can attach
   any definite meaning to his doctrine. According to Ebrard we are
   required to believe that the one divine and infinite substance of the
   Logos was finite and infinite; conscious and unconscious; omnipresent,
   and confined within narrow limits in space; and that it was active in
   the exercise of omnipotence, and as feeble as an infant at one and the
   same time. According to the more common view of the subject, we are
   called upon to believe that the infinite God, in the person of his Son,
   can become ignorant and feeble, and then omniscient and almighty; that
   He can cease to be God, and then again become God. Gess says that God
   is not omnipotent unless He has power over Himself, power, that is, to
   cease to be God. If this be true of the Son it must be true of the
   Father and of the Spirit; that is, it must be true that the Triune
   Jehovah can annihilate Himself. And, then, what follows?

   5. This doctrine destroys the humanity of Christ. He is not and never
   was a man. He never had a human soul or a human heart. It was the
   substance of the Logos invested with a human body that was born of the
   Virgin, and not a human soul. A being without a human soul is not a
   man. The Saviour which this theory offers us is the Infinite God with a
   spiritual body. In thus exalting the humanity of Christ to infinitude
   it is dissipated and lost.

   Schleiermacher.

   The prevalent Christology among a numerous and distinguished class of
   modern theologians, though not professedly pantheistic, is nevertheless
   founded on the assumption of the essential oneness of God and man. This
   class includes the school of Schleiermacher in all its modifications
   not only in Germany, but also in England and America. Schleiermacher is
   regarded as the most interesting as well as the most influential
   theologian of modern times. He was not and could not be
   self-consistent, as he attempted the reconciliation of contradictory
   doctrines. There are three things in his antecedents and circumstances
   necessary to be considered, in order to any just appreciation of the
   man or of his system. First, he passed the early part of his life among
   the Moravians, and imbibed something of their spirit, and especially of
   their reverence for Christ, who to the Moravians is almost the
   exclusive object of worship. This reverence for Christ, Schleiermacher
   retained all his life. In one of the discourses pronounced on the
   occasion of his death, it was said, "He gave up everything that he
   might save Christ." His philosophy, his historical criticism,
   everything, he was willing to make bend to the great aim of preserving
   to himself that cherished object of reverence and love. [372] Secondly,
   his academic culture led him to adopt a philosophical system whose
   principles and tendencies were decidedly pantheistic. And, thirdly, he
   succumbed to the attacks which rationalistic criticism had made against
   faith in the Bible. He could not receive it as a supernatural
   revelation from God. He did not regard it as containing doctrines which
   we are bound to believe on the authority of the sacred writers.
   Deprived, therefore, of the historical Christ, or at least deprived of
   the ordinary historical basis for faith in Christ, he determined to
   construct a Christology and a whole system of Christian theology from
   within; to weave it out of the materials furnished by his own religious
   consciousness. He said to the Rationalists that they might expunge what
   they pleased from the evangelical records; they might demolish the
   whole edifice of Church theology, he had a Christ and a Christianity in
   his own bosom. In the prosecution of the novel and difficult task of
   constructing a system of Christian theology out of the facts of
   Christian experience, he designed to secure for it a position
   unassailable by philosophy. Philosophy being a matter of knowledge, and
   religion a matter of feeling, the two belonged to distinct spheres, and
   therefore there need be no collision between them.

   Schleiermacher's Christology.

   He assumed, (1.) That religion in general, and Christianity in
   particular, was not a doctrine or system of doctrine; not a cultus, or
   a discipline; but a life, an inward spiritual power or force. (2.) That
   the true Christian is conscious of being the recipient of this new
   life. (3.) That he knows that it did not originate in himself, nor in
   the Church to which he belongs, because humanity neither in the
   individual nor in any of its organizations is capable of producing what
   is specifically new and higher and better than itself. (4.) This
   necessitates the assumption of a source, or author of this life,
   outside of the race of ordinary men or of humanity in its regular
   development. (5.) Hence he assumed the actual historical existence of a
   new, sinless, and absolutely perfect man by a new creative act. (6.)
   That man was Christ, from whom every Christian is conscious that he
   derives the new life of which he is the subject. (7.) Christ is the
   Urbild, or Ideal Man, in whom the idea of humanity is fully realized.
   (8.) He is nevertheless divine, or God in fashion as a man, because man
   is the modus existendi of God on the earth. In ordinary men, even in
   Adam, God, so to speak, was and is imperfectly developed. The
   God-consciousness, or God within, is overborne by our
   world-consciousness, or our consciousness as determined by things seen
   and temporal. (9.) In Christ this was not the case. In Him, without
   struggle or opposition, the God-consciousness, or God within,
   controlled his whole inward and outward life. (10.) Christ's
   preëminence over other men consisted in his absolute sinlessness and
   freedom from error. Of Him it is to be said, not simply potest non
   peccare, but non potest peccare. He could not be tempted for temptation
   supposes the possibility of sin, and the possibility of sin supposes
   less than perfection. (11.) The redeeming work and worth of Christ
   consists not in what He taught or in what He did, but in what He was.
   What He taught and what He did may be explained in different ways, or
   even explained away, but what He was, remains, and is the one all
   important fact. (12.) As He was thus perfect, thus the ideal and
   miraculously produced man, He is the source of life to others. He
   awakens the dormant God-consciousness in men, and gives it ascendency
   over the sensibility, or sensuous element of our nature, so that
   believers come to be, in the same sense, although ever in a less
   degree, what Christ was, God manifest in the flesh. This being the work
   of Christ, and this redeeming process being due to what He was, his
   resurrection, ascension, session at the right hand of God, etc., etc.,
   may all be dispensed with. They may be admitted on historical grounds,
   good men having testified to them as facts, but they have no religious
   import or power. (13.) The new life of which Christ is the author,
   which in this country is commonly denominated "his human divine life,"
   is the animating and constituting principle of the Church, and it is by
   union with the Church that this life passes over to individual
   believers.

   Objections to this Theory.

   This is a meagre outline of Schleiermacher's Christology. His doctrine
   concerning Christ is so implicated with his peculiar views on
   anthropology, on theology, and on the relation of God to the world,
   that it can neither be fully presented nor properly appreciated except
   as an integral part of his whole system.

   Gladly as Schleiermacher's theory was embraced as a refuge by those who
   had been constrained to give up Christianity as a doctrine, and great
   as have been its popularity and influence, it was assailed from very
   different quarters and judged from many different standpoints. Here it
   can only be viewed from the position of Christian theology. It should
   be remembered that as the idealist does not feel and act according to
   his theory, so the inward life of a theologian may not be determined by
   his speculative doctrines. This does not render error less
   objectionable or less dangerous. It is nevertheless a fact, and enables
   us to condemn a system without wounding our charity for its author.
   Schleiermacher, however, was an exceptional case. As a general rule, a
   man's faith is the expression of his inward life.

   1. The first objection to Schleiermacher's theory is that it is not and
   does not pretend to be Biblical. It is not founded upon the objective
   teachings of the Word of God. It assumes, indeed, that the religious
   experience of the Apostles and early Christians was substantially the
   same, and therefore involved the same truths, as the experience of
   Christians of the present day. Schleiermacher even admits that their
   experience was so pure and distinctly marked as to have the authority
   of a standard by which other believers are to judge of their own. But
   he denies that the interpretation which they gave of their experience
   has normal authority for us, that is, he says that we are not bound to
   believe what the Apostles believed. His appeals to the Scriptures in
   support of his peculiar doctrines are extremely rare, and merely
   incidental. He professes to build up a system independent of the Bible,
   founded on what Christians now find in the contents of their own
   consciousness.

   2. The system is not what it purports to be. Schleiermacher professed
   to discard speculation from the province of religion. He undertook to
   construct a theory of Christianity with which philosophy should have
   nothing to do, and therefore one against which it could have no right
   to object. In point of fact his system is a matter of speculation from
   beginning to end. It could never have existed except as the product of
   a mind imbued with the principles of German philosophy. It has no
   coherence, no force, and indeed no meaning, unless you take for granted
   the correctness of his views of the nature of God, of the nature of
   man, and of the relation of God to the world. This objection was urged
   against his system by all parties in Germany. The supernaturalists, who
   believed in the Bible, charged him with substituting the conclusions of
   his own philosophy for the dictates of Christian consciousness. And the
   philosophers said he was true neither to his philosophy nor to his
   religion. He changed from one ground to the other just as it suited his
   purpose. On this subject Strauss [373] says that Schleiermacher first
   betrayed philosophy to theology, and then theology to philosophy; and
   that this half-and-halfness is characteristic of his whole position.
   Although this was said in a spirit of unkindness, it is nevertheless
   true. His speculative opinions, i.e., the conclusions at which he
   arrives by the way of speculation, are the basis of his whole system;
   and therefore those who adopt it receive it on this authority of
   reason, and not on that of revelation. It is a philosophical theory and
   nothing more. This will become apparent as we proceed.

   Founded on Pantheistic Principles.

   3. A third objection is that the system is essentially pantheistic.
   This is, indeed, an ambiguous term. It is here used, however, in its
   ordinary and proper sense. It is not meant that Schleiermacher held
   that the universe is God, or God the universe, but that he denied any
   proper dualism between God and the world, and between God and man. He
   held such views of God as were inconsistent with Theism in the true and
   accepted meaning of the word. That is, he did not admit the existence
   of a personal, extramundane God. This is a charge brought against his
   system from the beginning, even by avowed pantheists themselves. They
   say that while denying the existence of a personal God he nevertheless
   teaches doctrines inconsistent with that denial, i.e., with what they
   regard as the true view of the relation of the infinite to the finite.
   Theists brought the same objection. Dr. Braniss [374] says, "Die
   Annahme eines persönlichen Gottes ist in diesem System unmöglich,"
   i.e., "The admission of a personal God is, in this system, impossible."
   [375] This he proves, among other ways, by a reference to what
   Schleiermacher teaches of the attributes of God, which with him are not
   predicates of a subject; they tell us nothing as to what God is, they
   are only forms or states of our own consciousness, as determined by our
   relation to the system of things in their causal relation. Strauss,
   from another standpoint, says that Schleiermacher could never reconcile
   himself to the acknowledgment of a personal, extra-mundane God. Christ
   was the only God he had; and this, alas! was little more than an ideal
   God; one who had been; but whether He still is, he leaves undetermined,
   at least theoretically. Baur presents the inconsistency of
   Schleiermacher in different points of view. In one place he says that
   he swung to and fro between the idealism of Kant and Fichte, and the
   pantheism of Spinoza and Schelling, which he regarded only as the
   different poles of the same system (derselben Weltanschauung). [376]
   Again he says that the essential element of Schleiermacher's doctrine
   of God is the same immanence of God in the world that Spinoza taught.
   [377] He endorses the criticism of Strauss, that all the main positions
   of the first part of Schleiermacher's Glaubenslehre are intelligible
   only when translated into the formulas of Spinoza, whence they were
   derived; and adds that he made no greater difference between God and
   the world than Spinoza made between the natura naturans and the natura
   naturata. [378] A Schleiermacher wrote at the time when the dispute
   between the Rationalists and Supernaturalists was at its height. The
   one referred all events to natural causes; the other contended for the
   possibility of miracles and of a supernatural revelation. Both parties
   being Theists, the Rationalists had no ground to stand on. For if the
   existence of an extramundane, personal God, the creator of the world,
   be admitted, it is utterly unreasonable to deny that He may intervene
   with his immediate agency in the sequence of events. Schleiermacher cut
   the knot by denying the difference between the natural and
   supernatural. There is really no extramundane God, no other sphere of
   divine activity than the world, and no other law of his action than
   necessity. [379]

   Involves the Rejection of the Doctrine of the Trinity.

   4. Schleiermacher's system ignores the doctrine of the Trinity. With
   him God in the world, is the Father; God in Christ, the Son; God in the
   Church, the Spirit. All personal preëxistence of Christ is thus
   necessarily excluded. The Scriptures and the Church teach that the
   eternal Son of God, who was with the Father from eternity; who made the
   worlds; who could say, "Before Abraham was I am," became man, being
   born of a woman, yet without sin. This Schleiermacher denies. There was
   no Son of God, before the birth of Christ in Bethlehem. Then only,
   Christ began to be as a distinct person; He had no preëxistence beyond
   that which is common to all men.

   5. This system makes Christ a mere man. He is constantly represented as
   the Ideal man, Urbild, a perfect man. In Him the idea of humanity is
   said to be fully realized. His life is said to be one; and that one a
   true human life. There was in Him but one nature, and that nature
   human. Now it matters little that with these representations Christ is
   said to be divine, and his life a divine life; for this is said on the
   ground that the divine is human, and the human divine. God and man are
   one. The difference between Christ and other men is simply one of
   degree. He is perfect, we are imperfect. He is, as Baur said, simply
   primus inter pares. Christ is the Urbild or archetypal man. But "the
   actuality of the archetypal does not go beyond our nature." [380] Even
   in the modified form in which his doctrine has been adopted in this
   country, this feature of the system has been retained. Dr. Nevin in his
   "Mystical Presence" is abundant in his assertion of the simple humanity
   of Christ. He says He had not one life of the body and another of the
   soul; nor one life of his humanity and another of his divinity. It is
   one life throughout, and it "is in all respects a true human life."
   [381] "Christ is the archetypal man in whom the true idea of humanity
   is brought to view." He "is the ideal man." Our nature is said to be
   complete only in Him. This also is the staple of the "Mercersburg
   Review" in all its articles relating either to Anthropology or
   Soteriology. It is everywhere assumed that God and man are one; that
   divinity is the completed development of humanity. "The glorification
   of Christ was the full advancement of our human nature itself to the
   power of a divine life." There is nothing in Christ which does not
   belong to humanity. Steudel therefore says of the Christology of
   Schleiermacher that it makes Christ only "a finished man." Knapp says,
   that he deifies the human and renders human the divine. [382] Dorner
   says, "He believed the perfect being of God to be in Christ; and for
   this reason regarded Him as the complete man. And so, vice versa,
   because He is the complete man, the consciousness of God has become a
   being of God in Him." [383] That is, because He is a perfect man, He is
   God. And Strauss says, that according to Schleiermacher the creation of
   man imperfect in Adam was completed in Christ; and as Christ did not
   assume a true body and a reasonable soul, but generic humanity, human
   nature as a generic life is raised to the power of divinity, not in Him
   only but also in the Church. The incarnation of God is not a unique
   manifestation in the flesh, in the person of Christ, appearing on earth
   for thirty-three years and then transferred to heaven. This, it is
   said, would have been only "a sublime avatar, fantastically paraded
   thus long before men," without any further effect. On the contrary, it
   is the introduction of the life of God into humanity rendering it
   divine. It is natural that those who thus deify themselves, should look
   upon those who regard themselves as "worms of the dust," as very poor
   creatures. [384] The objection, however, to this system now in hand is
   not so much that it deifies man, as that it makes Christ nothing more
   than an ideal man. It is therefore utterly at variance with the
   teachings of Scripture, the faith of the Church, and the intimate
   convictions of the people of God.

   Schleiermacher's Anthropology.

   6. As the system under consideration is unscriptural in what it teaches
   concerning the nature of God, and the person of Christ, it is no less
   contrary to the Scriptures in what it teaches concerning man. Indeed,
   the theology and anthropology of the system are so related that they
   cannot be separately held. According to the Bible and the common faith
   both of the Church and of the world, man is a being created by the word
   of God's power, consisting of a material body and an immaterial soul.
   There are, therefore, in the constitution of his person, two distinct
   subjects or substances, each with its own properties; so that although
   intimately united in the present state of being, the soul is capable of
   conscious existence and activity, out of the body, or separated from
   it. The soul of man is therefore a distinct individual subsistence, and
   not the form, or modus existendi of a general life. According to
   Schleiermacher, "Man as such, or in himself, is the knowing (das
   Erkennen) of the earth in its eternal substance (Seyn) and in its ever
   changing development. Or the Spirit (der Geist, God) in the way or form
   in which it comes to self-consciousness in our earth." Der Mensch an
   sich ist das Erkennen der Erde in Seinem ewigen Seyn und in seinem
   immer wechselnden Werden: oder der Geist, der nach Art und Weise
   unserer Erde zum Selbstbewusstseyn sich gestaltet. [385] By the
   Mercersburg writers the idea is set forth in rather different terms but
   substantially to the same effect. [386] Thus it is said, "The world in
   its lower view is not simply the outward theatre or stage on which man
   is set to act his part as a candidate for heaven. In the widest of its
   different forms of existence, it is pervaded throughout with the power
   of a single life, which comes ultimately to its full sense and force
   only in the human person." And [387] "The world is an organic whole
   which completes itself in man; and humanity is regarded throughout as a
   single grand fact which is brought to pass, not at once, but in the way
   of history, unfolding always more its true interior sense, and reaching
   on to its final consummation." Again, "It is a universal property of
   life to unfold itself from within, by a self-organizing power, towards
   a certain end, which end is its own realization, or in other words, the
   actual exhibition and actualization in outward form of all the
   elements, functions, powers, and capacities which potentially it
   includes. Thus life may be said to be all at its commencement which it
   can become in the end."

   The theory is that there is an infinite, absolute, and universal
   something, spirit, life, life-power, substance, God, Urwesen, or
   whatever it may be called, which develops itself by an inward force, in
   all the forms of actual existence. Of these forms man is the highest.
   This development is by a necessary process, as much so as the growth of
   a plant or of an animal. The stem of the tree, its branches, foliage,
   and fruit, are not formed by sudden, creative acts, accomplishing the
   effect, by way of miracle. All is regular, a law-work, an uninterrupted
   force acting according to its internal nature. So in the self-evolution
   of the spirit, or principle of life, there is no room for special
   intervention, or creative acts. All goes on in the way of history, and
   by regular organic development. Here there is a fault in
   Schleiermacher's doctrine. He admitted a creative, supernatural act at
   the creation. And as the quantum of life, or spirit, communicated to
   man at first was insufficient to carry on his development to
   perfection, i.e., until it realized, or actualized all that is in that
   life of which he is the manifestation (i.e., in God), there was a
   necessity for a new creative act, by which in the person of Christ, a
   perfect man was produced. From Him, and after Him, the process goes on
   naturally, by regular development. [388] The life-power, the spirit, is
   quantitively increased and henceforth develops itself historically in
   the form of the Church. The Church, therefore, consists of those to
   whom this elevated principle of life has been communicated, and in whom
   it develops itself until it realizes all it includes. That is, until
   the essential oneness of God and man is in the Church fully realized.

   There is another mode of representation current with the disciples of
   Schleiermacher, especially in this country. its advocates speak of
   humanity as a generic life. They define man to be the manifestation of
   this generic life in connection with a special corporeal organization,
   by which it is individualized and becomes personal. It was this generic
   humanity which sinned in Adam, and thenceforth was corrupt in all the
   individual men in whom it was manifested. It was this generic humanity
   that Christ assumed into personal union with his divinity, not as two
   distinct substances, but so united as to become one generic human life.
   This purified humanity now develops itself, by an inward force in the
   Church, just as from Adam generic humanity was developed in his
   posterity. All this, however, differs only in words from
   Schleiermacher's simpler and more philosophic statement. For it is
   still assumed as the fundamental idea of the gospel, that God and man
   are one. This generic humanity is only a form of the life of God. And
   as to its sinning in Adam, and being thenceforth corrupt, sin and
   corruption are only imperfect development. God, the universal life
   principle, as Dr. Nevin calls it, so variously manifested in the
   different existences in this world, is imperfectly or insufficiently
   manifested in man generally, but perfectly in Christ, and through Hun
   ultimately in like perfection in his people. Christ, therefore,
   according to Dorner, is a universal person. He comprises in Himself the
   whole of humanity. All that is separately revealed in others is summed
   up in Him. In this system "Der Mittelpunkt," says Schwarz,
   "christlicher Wahrheit, der christologische Kern der ganzen Dogmatik
   ist die Göschel-Dorner'sche monströse Vorstellung von der
   Allpersönlichkeit Christi, die ihm als dem Urmenschen zukommt. Es ist
   die Zusammenfassung des ganzen gegliederten Systems der natürlichen
   Gaben der Menschheit." [389] "The middle point of Christian truth, the
   kernel of dogmatic theology is Goschel's and Dorner's monstrous idea of
   the All-personality of Christ which belongs to Him as the Urmensch or
   archetypal man. He comprehends within Himself all the diversified forms
   or systems of the natural gifts of mankind." Göschel and Dorner, adds
   Schwarz, were driven to this view because they conceded to their
   opponent Strauss, that the Absolute could only reveal itself in the
   totality of individuals; and therefore as the Absolute was in Christ,
   he must embrace all individuals, because (the Gattungsbegriff) the true
   and total idea of humanity, the ideal man, or Urmensch, was revealed in
   Christ. The objection is constantly urged by his German critics, as
   Baur, Strauss, and Schwarz, that Schleiermacher admits that the
   Absolute is revealed in perfection in the totality of individuals, and
   yet is revealed perfectly in Christ, which according to
   Schleiermacher's own philosophy they pronounce to be a contradiction or
   impossibility. [390]

   The design of the preceding paragraphs is simply to show the
   unscriptural character of Schleiermacher's Christology in all its
   modifications, because it is founded on a view of the nature of man
   entirely at variance with the Word of God. It assumes the oneness of
   God and man. It takes for granted that fully developed humanity is
   divine; that Christ in being the ideal, or perfect man, is God.

   Schleiermacher's Theory perverts the Plan of Salvation.

   7. It need hardly be remarked that the plan of salvation according to
   Schleiermacher's doctrine is entirely different from that revealed in
   the Bible and cherished by the Church in all ages. It is, in Germany at
   least, regarded as a rejection of the Church system, and as a
   substitute for it, and only in some of its forms as a reconciliation of
   the two, as to what is deemed absolutely essential. The system in all
   its forms rejects the doctrines of atonement or satisfaction to the
   justice of God; of regeneration and sanctification by the Holy Spirit;
   of justification as a judicial or forensic act; of faith in Christ, as
   a trusting to what He has done for us, as distinguished from what He
   does in us; in short, of all the great distinctive doctrines not merely
   of the Reformation but of the Catholic faith. By many of the followers
   of Schleiermacher these doctrines are rejected in so many words; by
   others the terms are more or less retained, but not in their received
   and established meaning. For the Scriptural system of salvation,
   another is substituted. Christ saves us not by what He teaches, or by
   what He does, but by what He is. He infuses a new principle of life
   into the Church and into the world. The universal life as communicated
   to, or revealed in Adam, has been struggling on, imperfectly developed
   in all his descendants. In Christ a new influx of this life is
   communicated to, or infused into the veins of humanity. From this as a
   new starting point, humanity enters on another stage of development,
   which is to issue in the full actualization of the divine life in the
   form of humanity. As from Adam human nature was developed from within
   by an inward force in a regular historical process; so from Christ,
   there is the same historical development from within. All is natural.
   There is nothing supernatural but the initial point; the first impulse,
   or the first infusion of the divine life. There is no place in the
   system for the work of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, the very existence of
   the Holy Spirit as a personal being is by Schleiermacher expressly
   denied. By the Spirit he means the common life of the Church, that is,
   the divine life, or God as revealed in the Church. As we derive from
   Adam a quantitively deficient, and in that sense corrupt, nature, and
   have nothing more to do with him; so from Christ we receive a larger
   measure of life, spirit, or divine nature, and have nothing more to do
   with Him. His whole redeeming work is in the new leaven he has
   introduced into humanity, which diffuses itself in the way of natural
   development. This, as Baur says, comes after all to little more than
   the impression which his character has made on the world. He draws a
   parallel between Schleiermacher and Kant, between the "Glaubenslehre"
   of the former, and "Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen
   Vernunft" of the latter; the clear rationalism of the one and the
   mystical obscurity of the other. Both admit that there is a good and a
   bad principle. Both say that man's redemption consists in the triumph
   of the good principle. Both say that the deliverance from evil or the
   work of redemption, is a purely natural process. Both refer the success
   of the struggle to the influence of Christ. The one says that He
   imparts to men a new life, the other says that He awakens the dormant
   good that is already in man's nature. Everything admits of a simple and
   of a mystical explanation. [391] In every great epoch some one man not
   only impresses his character and infuses his spirit into the men of his
   generation, but also transmits his influence from age to age. The whole
   body of Lutherans are what they are because Luther was what he was. The
   spirit of Ignatius Loyola is just as active in the Jesuits of our day
   as it was in his own person. The Scotch are what they are because of
   John Knox; and the Wesleyans owe not only their doctrines and
   discipline but their whole animus and character to John Wesley. To this
   category do the merciless German critics of Schleiermacher reduce his
   theory of the redemption of man by Jesus Christ. It is a matter of
   personal influence like that of other great men. This will be regarded
   by his disciples as a most degrading and unjust view of his doctrine.
   And it doubtless is unjust. For whatever may be true of his mere
   speculative system, he unquestionably in his heart regarded Christ as
   infinitely exalted above other men, and as the proper object of
   adoration and trust.

   This Vermittelungstheologie (the mediating-theology), as it is called
   in Germany, is confessedly an attempt to combine the conclusions of
   modern speculation with Christian doctrine, or rather with
   Christianity. It is an attempt to mix incongruous elements which refuse
   to enter into combination. The modern speculative philosophy in all its
   forms insists on the denial of all real dualism; God and the world are
   correlata, the one supposes the other; without the world there is no
   God; creation is the self-evolution or self-manifestation of God: and
   is therefore necessary and eternal. God can no more be without the
   world, than mind without thought. The preservation, progress, and
   consummation of the world is by a necessary process of development, as
   in all the forms of life. There is no possibility of special
   intervention, on the part of God. Miracles whether spiritual or
   physical are an absurdity and an impossibility. [392] So is any agency
   of God in time, or otherwise than as a general life-power. This
   precludes the efficacy of prayer except as to its subjective influence.
   Schleiermacher shared in this horror of the supernatural, and this
   rejection of all miracles. In the case of Christ, he was forced to
   admit "a new creative act." But he apologized for this admission by
   representing it as only the completion of the original act of creation,
   and by saying that it was only for a moment, and that all thenceforth
   was natural.

   Schwarz, himself a great admirer, although not a disciple of
   Schleiermacher, characterizes this "mediating theology" as an utter
   failure. It is neither one thing nor the other. It is neither true to
   its speculative principles, nor true to Christianity. It virtually
   rejects the Church system, yet endeavours to save Christianity by
   adopting at least its phraseology. Schwarz says it is a system of
   "phrases;" which endeavours to heal the wounds of orthodoxy by words
   which seem to mean much, but which may be made to mean much or little
   as the reader pleases. It speaks constantly of Christianity as a life,
   as the life of God, as developing itself organically and naturally, not
   by supernatural assistance, but by an inward life-power, as in other
   cases of organic development. It assumes to rise to the conception of
   the whole world as an organism, in which God is one of the factors; the
   world and God differing not in substance or life, but simply in
   functions. It concedes to "speculation" that the fundamental truth of
   philosophy and of Christianity is the oneness of God and man. Man is
   God living in a certain form, or state of development. While "the
   mediating theology" concedes all this, it nevertheless admits of a
   miraculous or supernatural beginning of the world and of the person of
   Christ, and thus gives up its whole philosophical system. At least the
   members of one wing of Schleiermacher's school are thus inconsistent;
   those of the other are more true to their principles.

   As Christian theology is simply the exhibition and illustration of the
   facts and truths of the Bible in their due relations and proportions,
   it has nothing to do with these speculations. The "mediating theology"
   does not pretend to be founded on the Bible. It does not, at least in
   Germany, profess allegiance to the Church doctrine. It avowedly gives
   up Christianity as a doctrine to save it as a life. It is founded on
   "speculation" and not upon authority, whether of the Scriptures or of
   the Church. It affords therefore no other and no firmer foundation for
   our faith and hope, than any other philosophical system; and that, as
   all history proves, is a foundation of quick-sand, shifting and sinking
   from month to month and even from day to day. Schleiermacher has been
   dead little more than thirty years, and already there are eight or ten
   different classes of his general disciples who differ from each other
   almost as much as from the doctrines of the Reformation. Twesten and
   Ullmann, Liebner and Thomasius, Lange and Alexander, Schweizer, are
   wide apart, each having his own philosophical solvent of the doctrines
   of the Bible, and each producing a different residuum.

   The simple, sublime, and saving Christology of the Bible and of the
   Church universal is: "That the eternal Son of God became man by taking
   to Himself a true body and a reasonable soul and so was and continues
   to be God and man in two distinct natures and one person forever."

   [388] Schleiermacher (Zweites Sendschreiben zu Lücke; Works, edit.
   Berlin, 1836, first part, vol. ii. p. 653), says: "Where the
   supernatural occurs with me, it is always a first; it becomes natural
   as a second. Thus the creation is supernatural, but afterwards it is a
   natural process (Naturzusammenhang). So Christ is supernatural as to
   his beginning, but He becomes natural as a simple or pure human person.
   The same is true of the Holy Spirit and of the Christian Church." In
   like manner Dr. Nevin repeatedly says, "The supernatural has become
   natural." This inconsistency in Schleiermacher's system, this collision
   between his philosophy and his theology is dwelt upon by all his German
   critics. Thus Schwarz (Geschichte des neuesten Theologie, p. 254),
   says, "Schleiermacher steht in seiner Ontologie und Kosmologie, in Dem,
   was er über das Verhältniss Gottes zur Welt in seiner Dialektik
   feststellt, ganz und gar auf dem Boden einer einheitlichen und
   zusammenhängenden Weltanschauung. Ebenso in der Lehre von der Schöpfung
   und Erhaltung der Welt, wie sie die Dogmatik ausführt. Gott und die
   Welt sind untrennbare Correlata; das Verhältniss Gottes zur Welt ist
   ein nothwendiges, stetiges, zusammenhängendes. Für ausserordentliche
   Actionen, für ein vereinzeltes Handeln Gottes auf die Welt ausserhalb
   des Naturgesetzes oder gegen dasselbe ist nirgends ein Ort. . . . .
   Aber -- es ist zuzugeben, -- diese die philosophische Grundanschauung
   bildende Immanenz wird von dem Theologen Schleiermacher nicht streng
   innegehalten, das aus der Ontologie und Kosmologie verbannte Wunder
   dringt durch die Christologie wieder ein. Die Person Christi in ihrer
   religiössittlichen Absolutheit ist ein Wunder, eine Ausnahme vom
   Naturgesetz, sie stehet einzig da. Ihr Eintreten in die Menschheit
   erfodert trotz aller Anschliessungen nach rückwärtz wie nach vorwärtz
   einen besondern göttlichen Anstoss, sie ist aus der geschichtlichen
   Entwickelung nicht hervorgegangen und nicht zu begreifen. Und dieser
   übernaturliche Anstoss ist es, welcher, so sehr er auch wieder in die
   Natürlichkeit einlenkt, doch mit dem religiös-moralischen Wunder auch
   die Möglichkeit der damit zusammenhängenden physischen Wunder offen
   lässt und so den ganzen Weltzusammenhang durchbricht."

   [391] The writer was once sitting with Tholuck in a public garden, when
   the latter said, "I turn my eyes in the opposite direction, and still I
   am conscious of your presence. How is that?" The reply was, "You know
   the fact that I am here; and that knowledge produces the state of mind,
   you call a consciousness of my presence." Tholuck good naturedly
   rejoined, "O how stupid that is. Don't you believe that there is an
   influence which streams forth from me to you and from you to me?" The
   only answer was, "Perhaps so." Of all the genial, lovely, and loving
   men whom the writer in the course of a long life has met, Tholuck
   stands among the very first. The writer derived more good from him than
   from all other sources combined during his two years sojourn in Europe.

CHAPTER IV.

  THE MEDIATORIAL WORK OF CHRIST.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Christ the only Mediator.

   According to the Scriptures the incarnation of the eternal Son of God
   was not a necessary event arising out of the nature of God. It was not
   the culminating point in the development of humanity. It was an act of
   voluntary humiliation. God gave his Son for the redemption of man. He
   came into the world to save his people from their sins; to seek and
   save those who are lost. He took part in flesh and blood in order, by
   death, to destroy him who had the power of death, that is the devil,
   and to deliver those who through fear of death (i.e., through
   apprehension of the wrath of God), were all their lifetime subject to
   bondage. He died the just for the unjust that He might bring us near to
   God. Such is the constant representation of the Scriptures. The
   doctrine of the modern speculative theology, that the incarnation would
   have occurred though man had not sinned, is, therefore, contrary to the
   plainest teachings of the Bible. Assuming, however, that fallen men
   were to be redeemed, then the incarnation was a necessity. There was no
   other way by which that end could be accomplished. This is clearly
   taught in the Scriptures. The name of Christ is the only name whereby
   men can be saved. If righteousness could have been attained in any
   other way, Christ, says the Apostle, is dead in vain. (Galatians ii.
   21.) If the law (any institution or device) could have given life,
   verily righteousness should have been by the law. (Galatians iii. 21.)

   As the design of the incarnation of the Son of God was to reconcile us
   unto God, and as reconciliation of parties at variance is a work of
   mediation, Christ is called our mediator. As reconciliation is
   sometimes effected by mere intercession, or negotiation, the person who
   thus effectually intercedes may be called a mediator. But where
   reconciliation involves the necessity of satisfaction for sin as
   committed against God, then he only is a mediator who makes an
   atonement for sin. As this was done, and could be done by Christ alone,
   it follows that He only is the mediator between God and man. He is our
   peace-maker, who reconciles Jews and Gentiles unto God in one body by
   the cross. (Ephesians ii. 16.) To us, therefore, there is one mediator
   between God and man, the man Christ Jesus. (1 Timothy ii. 5.)

   The Romish Church regards priests, and saints, and angels, and
   especially the Virgin Mary, as mediators, not only in the sense of
   intercessors, but as peace-makers without whose intervention
   reconciliation with God cannot be attained. This arises from two
   erroneous principles involved in the theology of the Church of Rome.
   The first concerns the office of the priesthood. Romanists teach that
   the benefits of redemption can be obtained only thrpugh the
   intervention of the priests. Those benefits flow through the
   sacraments. The sacraments to be available must be administered by men
   canonically ordained. The priests offer sacrifices and grant
   absolution. They are as truly mediators, although in a subordinate
   station, as Christ himself. No man can come to God except through them.
   And this is the main idea in mediation in the Scriptural sense of the
   word.

   The other principle is involved in the doctrine of merit as held by
   Romanists. According to them, good works done after regeneration have
   real merit in the sight of God. It is possible for the people of God
   not only to acquire a degree of merit sufficient for their own
   salvation, but more than suffices for themselves. This, on the
   principle of the communion of saints, may be made available for others.
   The saints, therefore, are appealed to, to plead their own merits
   before the throne of God as the ground of the pardon or deliverance of
   those for whom they intercede. This according to the Scriptures is the
   peculiar work of Christ as our mediator; assigning it to the saints,
   therefore, constitutes them mediators. As the Christian minister is not
   a priest, and as no man has any merit in the sight of God, much less a
   superabundance thereof, the whole foundation of this Romish doctrine is
   done away. Christ is our only mediator, not merely because the
   Scriptures so teach, but also because He only can and does accomplish
   what is necessary for our reconciliation to God; and He only has the
   personal qualifications for the work.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Qualifications for the Work.

   What those qualifications are the Scriptures clearly teach.

   1. He must be a man. The Apostle assigns as the reason why Christ
   assumed our nature and not the nature of angels, that He came to redeem
   us. (Hebrews ii. 14-16.) It was necessary that He should be made under
   the law which we had broken; that He should fulfil all righteousness;
   that He should suffer and die; that He should be able to sympathize in
   all the infirmities of his people, and that He should be united to them
   in a common nature. He who sanctifies (purifies from sin both as guilt
   and as pollution) and those who are sanctified are and must be of one
   nature. Therefore as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, He
   also took part of the same. (Hebrews ii. 11-14.)

   2. The Mediator between God and man must be sinless. Under the law the
   victim offered on the altar must be without blemish. Christ, who was to
   offer Himself unto God as a sacrifice for the sins of the world, must
   be Himself free from sin. The High Priest, therefore, who becomes us,
   He whom our necessities demand, must be holy, harmless, undefiled, and
   separate from sinners. (Hebrews vii. 26.) He was, therefore, "without
   sin." (Hebrews iv. 15; 1 Peter ii. 22.) A sinful Saviour from sin is an
   impossibility. He could not have access to God. He could not be a
   sacrifice for sins; and He could not be the source of holiness and
   eternal life to his people. This sinlessness of our Lord, however, does
   not amount to absolute impeccability. It was not a non potest peccare.
   If He was a true man He must have been capable of sinning. That He did
   not sin under the greatest provocation; that when He was reviled He
   blessed; when He suffered He threatened not; that He was dumb, as a
   sheep before its shearers, is held up to us as an example. Temptation
   implies the possibility of sin. If from the constitution of his person
   it was impossible for Christ to sin, then his temptation was unreal and
   without effect, and He cannot sympathize with his people.

   3. It was no less necessary that our Mediator should be a divine
   person. The blood of no mere creature could take away sin. It was only
   because our Lord was possessed of an eternal Spirit that the one
   offering of Himself has forever perfected them that believe. None but a
   divine person could destroy the power of Satan and deliver those who
   were led captive by him at his will. None but He who had life in
   Himself could be the source of life, spiritual and eternal, to his
   people. None but an almighty person could control all events to the
   final consummation of the plan of redemption, and could raise the dead;
   and infinite wisdom and knowledge are requisite in Him who is to be
   judge of all men, and the head over all to his Church. None but one in
   whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead could be the object as well
   as the source of the religious life of all the redeemed.

   These qualifications for the office of mediator between God and man are
   all declared in the Scriptures to be essential; they are met in Christ;
   and they all were demanded by the nature of the work which He came to
   perform.

   As it was necessary that Christ should be both God and man in two
   distinct natures and one person, in order to effect our redemption, it
   follows that his mediatorial work, which includes all He did and is
   still doing for the salvation of men, is the work not of his human to
   the exclusion of his divine nature, nor of the latter to the exclusion
   of the former. It is the work of the Theanthropos, of the God-man. Of
   the acts of Christ, as already remarked, some are purely divine, as
   creation, preservation, etc.; others purely human, i.e., those which
   the ordinary powers of man are not only adequate to accomplish, but in
   which only human faculties were exercised; and, thirdly, those which
   are mixed, which belong to the whole person. As speaking in man is a
   joint exercise of the mind and of the body, so the mediatorial work in
   Christ is the joint work of his divinity and humanity. Each nature acts
   agreeably to its own laws. When a man speaks, the mind and body concur
   in the production of the effect, each according to its nature. So when
   our Lord spake, the wisdom, truth, and authority with which He spake
   were due to his divinity; the human form of the thoughts and their
   articulation were what they were in virtue of the functions of his
   human nature. So with all his redemptive acts. As the mind of man
   concurs in the endurance of the sufferings of the body according to the
   nature of mind, so the divinity of Christ concurred with the sufferings
   of his human nature according to the nature of the divinity.

   On this subject the schoolmen made the following distinctions: "(1.)
   Est ho energon, Agens seu Principium quod agit, quod est suppositum seu
   persona Christi. (2.) To energetikon seu Principium formale quo agit;
   illud per quod agens, seu persona Christi operatur, duæ scilicet
   naturæ, quarum unaquæque citra ullum confusionem operatur. (3.)
   Energeia seu operatio quæ pendet a principio quo, et naturam sui
   principii refert, ut sit divina, si principium quo sit divina natura,
   humana vero, si sit humanitas. (4.) Energema, seu apotelesma, quod
   pendet a principio quod, estque opus externum quod mediationem
   vocamus. . . . . Ita unum est agens principale, nim. persona Christi,
   et unum apotelesma seu opus mediatorium; sed operatur per duas naturas,
   ut duo principia, unde fluunt duæ energeiai seu operationes ad unum
   illud opus concurrentes." [393]

   All Christ's acts and sufferings in the execution of his mediatorial
   work were, therefore, the acts and sufferings of a divine person. It
   was the Lord of glory who was crucified; it was the Son of God who
   poured out his soul unto death. That this is the doctrine of the
   Scriptures is plain, (1.) Because they attribute the efficacy and power
   of his acts, the truth and wisdom of his words, and the value of his
   sufferings to the fact that they were the acts, words, and sufferings
   of God manifested in the flesh. They are predicated of one and the same
   person who from the beginning was with God and was God, who created all
   things and for whom all things were made and by whom all things
   consist. (2.) If the mediatorial work of Christ belongs to his human
   nature exclusively, or, in other words, if He is our mediator only as
   man, then we have only a human Saviour, and all the glory, power, and
   sufficiency of the Gospel are departed. (3.) From the nature of the
   work. The redemption of fallen men is a work for which only a divine
   person is competent. The prophetic office of Christ supposes that He
   possessed "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge;" his sacerdotal
   office required the dignity of the Son of God to render his work
   available; and none but a divine person could exercise the dominion
   with which Christ as mediator is intrusted. Only the Eternal Son could
   deliver us from the bondage of Satan, and from the death of sin, or
   raise the dead, or give eternal life, or conquer all his and our
   enemies. We need a Saviour who was not only holy, harmless, undefiled,
   and separate from sinners, but who also "is higher than the heavens."

   § 3. The Threefold Office of Christ.

   It has long been customary with theologians to exhibit the mediatorial
   work of Christ under the heads of his prophetic, sacerdotal, and kingly
   offices. To this division and classification it has been objected by
   some that these offices are not distinct, as it was the duty of the
   priests as well as of the prophets to teach; by others, that time
   sacerdotal office of Christ was identical with the prophetic, that his
   redemption was effected by teaching. This method, however, has not only
   the sanction of established usage and obvious convenience, but it is of
   substantive importance, and has a firm Scriptural basis. (1.) In the
   Old Testament the several offices were distinct. The prophet, as such,
   was not a priest; and the King was neither priest nor prophet. Two of
   these offices were at times united in the same person under the
   theocracy, as Moses was both priest and prophet, and David prophet and
   king. Nevertheless the offices were distinct. (2.) The Messiah, during
   the theocracy and in the use of language as then understood, was
   predicted as prophet, priest, and king. Moses, speaking of Christ,
   said, "The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the
   midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me." It was abundantly taught
   that the coming deliverer was to discharge all the duties of a prophet
   as a revealer of the will of God. He was to be the great teacher of
   righteousness; a light to lighten the Gentiles as well as the glory of
   his people Israel. No less clearly and frequently was it declared that
   He should be a priest. "Thou art a priest forever after the order of
   Melchizedec." He was to be a priest upon his throne. (Zechariah vi.
   13.) He was to bear the sins of the people, and make intercession for
   transgressors. His royal office is rendered so prominent in the
   Messianic prophecies that the Jews looked for Him only as a king. He
   was to reign over all nations. Of his kingdom there was to be no end.
   He was to be the Lord of lords and the King of kings. (3.) In the New
   Testament the Redeemer, in assuming the office of the promised Messiah,
   presented Him to the people as their prophet, priest, and king and
   those who received Him at all received Him in all these offices. He
   applied to Himself all the prophecies relating to the Messiah. He
   referred to Moses as predicting the Messiah as a prophet; to David, as
   setting Him forth as a priest, and to Daniel's prophecies of the
   kingdom which He came to establish. The Apostles received Him as the
   teacher sent from God to reveal the plan of salvation and to unfold the
   future destiny of the Church. In the first chapter of the Epistle to
   the Hebrews it is said, "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners
   spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last
   days spoken unto us by his Son." In that Epistle the priesthood of
   Christ is elaborately set forth, and its superiority in every respect
   to the priesthood of the old economy strenuously insisted upon. In like
   manner the New Testament is full of instruction concerning the grounds,
   the nature, the extent, and the duration of his kingdom. He is
   constantly designated as Lord, as our absolute proprietor and
   sovereign. Nothing, therefore, can be plainer than that as the Old
   Testament prophets predicted that the Messiah should be a prophet,
   priest, and king, so the New Testament writers represent the Lord Jesus
   as sustaining all these offices. (4.) That this is not a merely
   figurative representation is plain from the fact that Christ exercised
   all the functions of a prophet, of a priest, and of a king. He was not
   simply so called, but the work which He actually performed included in
   perfection all that the ancient prophets, priests, and kings performed
   in a lower sphere and as an adumbration of Christ's more perfect work.
   (5.) We as fallen men, ignorant, guilty, polluted, and helpless, need a
   Saviour who is a prophet to instruct us; a priest to atone and to make
   intercession for us; and a king to rule over and protect us. And the
   salvation which we receive at his hands includes all that a prophet,
   priest, and king in the highest sense of those terms can do. We are
   enlightened in the knowledge of the truth; we are reconciled unto God
   by the sacrificial death of his Son; and we are delivered from the
   power of Satan and introduced into the kingdom of God; all of which
   supposes that our Redeemer is to us at once prophet, priest, and king.
   This is not, therefore, simply a convenient classification of the
   contents of his mission and work, but it enters into its very nature,
   and must be retained in our theology if we would take the truth as it
   is revealed in the Word of God.

   Under the old economy the functions of these several offices were not
   only confided to different persons, no one under the theocracy being at
   once prophet, priest, and king; but when two of these offices were
   united in one person they were still separate. The same man might
   sometimes act as prophet and sometimes as priest or king; but in Christ
   these offices were more intimately united. He instructed while acting
   as a priest, and his dominion extending over the soul gave freedom from
   blindness and error as well as from the power of sin and the dominion
   of the devil. The gospel is his sceptre. He rules the world by truth
   and love. "Tria ista officia," says Turrettin, "ita in Christo
   conjunguntur, ut non solum eorum operationes distinctas exerat, sed
   eadem actio a tribus simul prodeat, quod rei admirabilitatem non parum
   auget. Sic Crux Christi, quæ est Altare sacerdotis, in quo se in
   victimam Deo obtulit, est etiam schola prophetæ, in qua nos docet
   mysterium salutis, unde Evangelium vocatur verbum crucis, et Trophæum
   regis, in qua scil. triumphavit de principatibus et potestatibus. Col.

   Spiritus, qui ut Spiritus, sapientiæ est effectus prophetiæ, ut
   Spiritus consolationis est fructus sacerdotii, ut Spiritus roboris et
   gloriæ est regis donum." [394]

CHAPTER V.

  PROPHETIC OFFICE.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Nature of the Prophetic Office.

   According to Scriptural usage a prophet is one who speaks for another.
   In Exodus vii. 1, it is said, "See, I have made thee a God to Pharaoh:
   and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet." Moses was to be the
   authoritative source of the communication, Aaron the organ of
   communication. This is the relation of the prophet to God. God
   communicates, the prophet announces the message which he has received.
   In Exodus iv. 16, it is said of Aaron in relation to Moses, "He shall
   be to thee instead of a mouth." And in Jeremiah xv. 19, it is said of
   the prophet," Thou shalt be as my mouth." In the inauguration of a
   prophet, or in constituting a man the spokesman of God, it is said, "I
   will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I
   shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not
   hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my name, I will require
   it of him." (Deuteronomy xviii. 18, 19.) A prophet, therefore, is one
   who speaks in the name of God. He must, however, be the immediate organ
   of God. In one sense every one who reads or preaches the word of God
   may be said "to speak in his name." The truths which he utters rest
   upon the authority of God; they are his words which the preacher is the
   organ of announcing to the people. Ministers, however, are not
   prophets. A broad distinction is made both in the Old and New
   Testaments between prophets and teachers. The former were inspired, the
   latter were not. Any man receiving a revelation from God, or inspired
   in the communication of it, is, in the Scriptures, called a prophet.
   Hence all the sacred writings are called prophetic. The Jews divided
   their Scriptures into the law and the prophets. The law, or pentateuch,
   was written by Moses, who was confessedly a prophet, and the other
   class, including all the historical, devotional, and prophetic portions
   (commonly so called) is also the work of prophets, i.e., of inspired
   men. The prediction of the future was only at incidental part of the
   prophet's work, because some of the communications which he received
   had reference to future events.

   When, therefore, the Messiah was predicted as a prophet it was
   predicted that He should be the great organ of God in communicating his
   mind and will to men. And when our Lord appeared on earth it was to
   speak the words of God. "The word which ye hear is not mine, but the
   Father's which sent me." (John xiv. 24.) "Jesus of Nazareth which was a
   prophet mighty in deed and word." (Luke xxiv. 19.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. How Christ executes the Office of a Prophet.

   In the execution of his prophetic office, Christ is revealed to us,
   (1.) As the eternal Word, the Logos, the manifested and manifesting
   Jehovah. He is the source of all knowledge to the intelligent universe,
   and especially to the children of men. He was, and is, the light of the
   world. He is the truth. In Him dwell all the treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge; and from Him radiates all the light that men receive or
   attain. (2.) This, although independent of his official work as prophet
   in the economy of redemption, is its necessary foundation. Had He not
   in Himself the plenitude of divine wisdom He could not be the source of
   knowledge, and especially of that knowledge which is eternal life to
   all his people. Under the old dispensation, or before his advent in the
   flesh, He made known God and his purposes and will, not only by
   personal manifestations of Himself to the patriarchs and prophets, but
   also by his Spirit, in revealing the trukh and will of God, in
   inspiring those appointed to record these revelations, and in
   illuminating the minds of his people, and thus bringing them to the
   saving knowledge of the truth. (3.) While on earth He continued the
   exercise of his prophetic office by his personal instructions, in his
   discourses, parables, and expositions of the law and of the prophets;
   and in all that He taught concerning his own person and work, and
   concerning the progress and consummation of his kingdom. (4.) Since his
   ascension He performs the same office not only in the fuller revelation
   of the gospel made to the Apostles and in their inspiration as
   infallible teachers, but also in the institution of the ministry and
   constantly calling men to that office, and by the influences of the
   Holy Ghost, who coöperates with the truth in every human heart, and
   renders it effectual to the sanctification and salvation of his own
   people. Thus from the beginning, both in his state of humiliation and
   of exaltation, both before and after his advent in the flesh, does
   Christ execute the office of a prophet in revealing to us by his Word
   and Spirit the will of God for our salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI.

  PRIESTLY OFFICE.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Christ is truly, not figuratively, a Priest.

   The meaning of the word priest and the nature of the office are to be
   determined, first, by general usage and consent; secondly, by the
   express declarations of the Scriptures; and, thirdly, by the nature of
   the functions peculiar to the office. From these sources it can be
   shown that a priest is, (1.) A man duly appointed to act for other men
   in things pertaining to God. The idea which lies at the foundation of
   the office is, that men, being sinners, have not liberty of access to
   God. Therefore, one, either having that right in himself, or to whom it
   is conceded, must be appointed to draw near to God in their behalf. A
   priest, consequently, from the nature of his office, is a mediator.
   (2.) A priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. His
   function is to reconcile men to God; to make expiation for their sins;
   and to present their persons, acknowledgments, and offerings to God.
   (3.) He makes intercession for the people. Not merely as one man may
   pray for another, but as urging the efficacy of his sacrifice and the
   authority of his office, as grounds on which his prayers should be
   answered.

   Much depends upon the correctness of this definition. It would amount
   to little to admit Christ to be a priest, if by that term we mean
   merely a minister of religion, or even one by whose intervention divine
   blessings are secured and conveyed. But if by a priest be meant all
   that is included in the above statement, then the relation in which
   Christ stands to us, our duties to Him, his relation to God, and the
   nature of his work, are all thereby determined.

   That the above definition is correct, and that Christ is a priest in
   the true sense of the term, is evident,

   1. From the general usage of the word and the nature of the office
   among all nations and in all ages of the world. Men have everywhere and
   at all times been conscious of sin. In that consciousness are included
   a sense of guilt (or of just exposure to the displeasure of God), of
   pollution, and of consequent unworthiness to approach God Their
   consciences, or the laws of their moral nature, have ever taught them
   the necessity of the expiation of guilt by a satisfaction of divine
   justice, and their own inability and unworthiness to make any adequate
   atonement, or to secure by their own efforts the favour of God. They
   have, therefore, ever sought for some one or some class of men to act
   in their behalf; to do for them what they knew must be done, and that
   which they were convinced they could not do for themselves. Hence the
   appointment of priests, who were always regarded as men whose business
   it was to propitiate God by expiatory sacrifices, by oblations, and by
   prayers. To say that a priest is merely a teacher of religion is to
   contradict the universal testimony of history.

   2. The sense in which Christ is a priest must be determined by the use
   of the word and by the nature of the office under the old dispensation.
   In the Old Testament a priest was a man selected from the people,
   appointed to act as their mediator, drawing nigh to God in their
   behalf, whose business it was to offer expiatory sacrifices, and to
   make intercession for offenders. The people were not allowed to draw
   near to God. The High Priest alone could enter within the veil; and he
   only with blood which he offered for himself and for the sins of the
   people. All this was both symbolical and typical. What the Aaronic
   priests were symbolically, Christ was really. What they in their office
   and services typified was fulfilled in Him. They were the shadow, He
   the substance. They taught how sin was to be taken away, He actually
   removed it. It would be to set the Scriptures at naught, or to adopt
   principles of interpretation which would invalidate all their teaching,
   to deny that Christ is a priest in the Old Testament sense of the term.

   3. We have in the New Testament an authoritative definition of the
   word, and an exhibition of the nature of the office. In Hebrews v. 1,
   it is said, "Every high priest . . . . is ordained for men (huper
   anthropon, for their benefit and in their place), in things pertaining
   to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins." Here all
   the ideas above insisted upon are distinctly recognized. A priest is a
   man appointed for others, to draw near to God, and to offer sacrifices.
   Such a priest Christ is declared to have been.

   4. Christ is not only called a priest in Hebrews, but the Apostle
   throughout that Epistle proves, (a.) That He had all the qualifications
   for the office. (b.) That He was appointed by God. (c.) That He was a
   priest of a higher order than Aaron. (d.) That his priesthood
   superseded all others. (e.) That He performed all the functions of the
   office, -- mediation, sacrifice, and intercession. (f.) That such was
   the efficacy of his sacrifice that it needs not to be repeated. By the
   one offering of Himself He hath obtained eternal redemption for us.

   5. The effects or benefits secured by the work of Christ are those
   which flow from the exercise of the priestly office in our behalf .
   Those benefits are, (a.) Expiation of our guilt; (b.) The propitiation
   of God; and (c.) Our consequent reconciliation with Him, whence flow
   all the subjective blessings of spiritual and eternal life. These are
   benefits which are not secured by teaching, by moral influence, by
   example, or by any inward change wrought in us. Christ, therefore, is
   truly a priest in the full Scriptural sense of the term.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Christ our only Priest.

   This follows from the nature and design of the office. (1.) No man,
   save the Lord Jesus Christ, has liberty of access unto God. All other
   men, being sinners, need some one to approach God on their behalf. (2.)
   No other sacrifice than his could take away sin. (3.) It is only
   through Him that God is propitious to sinful men; and (4.) It is only
   through Him that the benefits which flow from the favour of God are
   conveyed to his people.

   The priests of the Old Testament were, as before remarked, only symbols
   and types of the true priesthood of Christ. Their sacrifices could not
   purify the conscience from the sense of sin. They availed only to the
   purifying of the flesh. They secured reconciliation with God only so
   far as they were regarded as representing the real sacrifice of Christ
   as the object of faith and ground of confidence. Hence, as the Apostle
   teaches, they were offered continually, because, being ineffectual in
   themselves, the people needed to be constantly reminded of their guilt
   and of their need of the more effectual sacrifice predicted in their
   Scriptures.

   If the Old Testament priests were not really priests, except typically,
   much less are ministers of the gospel. When among Protestants any class
   of ministers are called priests, the word is the substitute for
   presbyter, for which it is constantly interchanged. It stands for
   presbuteros and not for hiereus. (It is defined, Greek, presbuteros,
   elder; Latin, presbyter; Spanish, presbitero; French, prêtre; Anglo
   Saxon, preost; Dutch and German, priester; Danish, præst.) Among
   Romanists it is not so. With them the minister is really a priest. (1.)
   Because he mediates between God and the people. (2.) Because he assumes
   to offer propitiatory sacrifices. (3.) Because in absolution he
   effectually and authoritatively intercedes, rendering the sacrifice for
   sin effectual in its application to individuals, which is the essential
   element in the intercession of Christ. The Roman priests are mediators,
   because it is taught that the sinner cannot for himself draw near to
   God through Christ and obtain pardon and grace, but can secure those
   blessings only through their intervention. They are sacrificers,
   because they assume to offer the real body and blood of Christ to God,
   as an expiation for the sins of the people. And they aro intercessors,
   not as one man may pray for another, but as having the power to forgive
   sins. They have therefore the power of life and death; the keys of the
   kingdom of heaven. They bind, and no man can loose; they loose, and no
   man can bind. This is the highest power which man has ever assumed over
   his fellow-men, and when recognized, reduces the people to a state of
   the most absolute subjection. No greater benefit was rendered the world
   by the Reformation than the breaking of this iron yoke. This was done
   by demonstrating, from Scripture, that the ministers of religion under
   the gospel are not priests in the official sense of the term. It was
   shown,

   1. That the word priest, hiereus, is never once applied to them in the
   New Testament. Every appropriate title of honour is lavished upon them.
   They are called the bishops of souls, pastors, teach. ers, rulers,
   governors, the servants or ministers of God; stewards of the divine
   mysteries; watchmen, heralds, but never priests. As the sacred writers
   were Jews, to whom nothing was more familiar than the word priest,
   whose ministers of religion were constantly so denominated, the fact
   that they never once use the word, or any of its cognates, in reference
   to the ministers of the gospel, whether apostles, presbyters, or
   evangelists, is little less than miraculous. It is one of those cases
   in which the silence of Scripture speaks volumes.

   2. No priestly function is ever attributed to Christian ministers. They
   do not mediate between God and man. They are never said to offer
   sacrifices for sins; and they have no power as intercessors which does
   not belong to every believer.

   3. All believers are priests in the only sense in which men are priests
   under the gospel. That is, all have liberty of access to God through
   Christ. He has made all his people kings and priests into God.

   4. This Romish doctrine is derogatory to the honour of Christ. He came
   to be the mediator between God and man; to make satisfaction for our
   sins, to secure for us pardon and reconciliation with God. To suppose
   that we still need the priestly intervention of men, is to assume that
   his work is a failure.

   5. The sacred writers expressly teach what this doctrine denies. They
   teach that men have everywhere free access to Christ, and through Him
   unto God; that faith in Him secures an interest in all the benefits of
   his redemption, and that, therefore, a thief on the cross, a prisoner
   in a dungeon, a solitary believer in his own chamber is near to God,
   and secure of his acceptance, provided he calls on the name of the
   Lord. To deny this, to teach the necessity of the intervention or
   ministration of men, to secure for us the salvation of our souls, is to
   contradict the plainest teachings of the Word of God.

   6. This doctrine contradicts the intimate convictions of the people of
   God in all ages. They know that they have through Christ, and by the
   Spirit free access unto God. They are thus taught by the Holy Ghost.
   They avail themselves of this liberty in spite of all men can do. They
   know that the doctrine which subjects them to the priesthood as the
   only authorized dispensers of grace and salvation, is not of God; and
   that it brings the souls of men into the most slavish bondage.

   7. All the principles on which the doctrine of the priesthood of the
   Christian clergy rests are false. It is false that the ministry are a
   distinct class from the people, distinguished from them by supernatural
   gifts, conveyed by the sacrament of orders. It is false that the bread
   and wine are transmuted into the body and blood of Christ. It is false
   that the Eucharist is a propitiatory sacrifice applied for the
   remission of sins and spiritual benefits, according to the intention of
   the officiating priest. Christ, therefore, as He is the only mediator
   between God and man, is the only and all-sufficient High Priest of our
   profession.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Definition of Terms.

   Christ, it is said, executeth the office of a priest, in his once
   offering up of Himself a sacrifice to satisfy divine justice, and
   reconcile us to God, and in making continual intercession for us.
   Expiation, propitiation, reconciliation, and intercession are the
   several aspects under which the work of Christ as a priest, is
   presented in the Word of God.

   Before attempting to state what the Scriptures teach in reference to
   these points, it will be well to define the terms which are of constant
   occurrence in theological discussions of this subject.

   The Word Atonement.

   The word atonement is often used, especially in this country, to
   designate the priestly work of Christ. This word does not occur in the
   English version of the New Testament except in Romans v. 11, where it
   is interchanged with "reconciliation" as the translation of the Greek
   word katallage. In the Old Testament it frequently occurs. The
   objections to its use to express the work of Christ are, --

   1. Its ambiguity. To atone is properly to be, or cause to be, at one.
   It is so used in common language as well as in theology. In this sense
   to atone is to reconcile; and atonement is reconciliation. It,
   therefore, expresses the effect, and not the nature of Christ s work.
   But it is also, in the second place, used to express that by which the
   reconciliation is effected. It then means satisfaction, or
   compensation. It answers in our version to the Hebrew word kpr; which
   in relation to the offence or guilt, means to expiate. Thus in
   Leviticus v. 16, it is said, if a man commit an offence, hkhv ykpr lvv,
   the priest shall make atonement for him; i.e., shall expiate, or make
   satisfaction for his offence. So in Ex. xxxii. 30; Lev. iv. 26; Num.
   vi. 11. In reference to the person of the offender, it means to
   reconcile by means of expiation, to propitiate God in his behalf. See
   Ex. xxx. 15; Lev. iv. 20; xvi. 6.; Ezekiel xlv. 17, "It shall be the
   prince's part to give burnt-offerings; . . . he shall prepare the
   sin-offering . . . vytysr'l lkpr bd to make reconciliation for the
   house of Israel." Thus often elsewhere. While the verb to atone thus
   means to expiate and to reconcile by expiation, the substantive means,
   either the reconciliation itself, or the means by which it is effected.
   This latter sense is not a Scriptural usage of the word, but is very
   common in theological writings. Thus when we speak of the atonement of
   Christ, of its necessity, efficacy, application, or extent, we mean
   Christ's work, what He did to expiate the sins of men. This ambiguity
   of the word necessarily gives rise to more or less confusion.

   2. Another objection to its general use is that it is not sufficiently
   comprehensive. As commonly used it includes only the sacrificial work
   of Christ, and not his vicarious obedience to the divine law. The
   atonement of Christ is said to consist of his sufferings and death. But
   his saving work includes far more than his expiatory sufferings.

   3. A third objection is that this use of the word atonement is a
   departure from the established usage of the Churches of the
   Reformation. It is important to adhere to old words if we would adhere
   to old doctrines.

   Satisfaction.

   The word satisfaction is the one which for ages has been generally used
   to designate the special work of Christ in the salvation of men. With
   the Latin theologians the word is "satisfactio," with the German
   writers, "Genugthun," its exact etymological equivalent, "the doing
   enough." By the satisfaction of Christ is meant all He has done to
   satisfy the demands of the law and justice of God, in the place and in
   behalf of sinners. This word has the advantage of being precise,
   comprehensive, and generally accepted, and should therefore be adhered
   to. There are, however, two kinds of satisfaction, which as they differ
   essentially in their nature and effects, should not be confounded. The
   one is pecuniary or commercial; the other penal or forensic. When a
   debtor pays the demand of his creditor in full, he satisfies his
   claims, and is entirely free from any further demands. In this case the
   thing paid is the precise sum due, neither more nor less. It is a
   simple matter of commutative justice; a quid pro quo; so much for so
   much. There can be no condescension, mercy, or grace on the part of a
   creditor receiving the payment of a debt. It matters not to him by whom
   the debt is paid, whether by the debtor himself, or by someone in his
   stead; because the claim of the creditor is simply upon the amount due
   and not upon the person of the debtor. In the case of crimes the matter
   is different. The demand is then upon the offender. He himself is
   amenable to justice. Substitution in human courts is out of the
   question. The essential point in matters of crime, is not the nature of
   the penalty, but who shall suffer. The soul that sins, it shall die.
   And the penalty need not be, and very rarely is, of the nature of the
   injury inflicted. All that is required is that it should be a just
   equivalent. For an assault, it may be a fine; for theft, imprisonment;
   for treason, banishment, or death. In case a substitute is provided to
   bear the penalty in the place of the criminal, it would be to the
   offender a matter of pure grace, enhanced in proportion to the dignity
   of the substitute, and the greatness of the evil from which the
   criminal is delivered. Another important difference between pecuniary
   and penal satisfaction, is that the one ipso facto liberates. The
   moment the debt is paid the debtor is free, and that completely. No
   delay can be admitted, and no conditions can be attached to his
   deliverance. But in the case of a criminal, as he has no claim to have
   a substitute take his place, if one be provided, the terms on which the
   benefits of his substitution shall accrue to the principal, are matters
   of agreement, or covenant between the substitute and the magistrate who
   represents justice. The deliverance of the offender may be immediate,
   unconditional, and complete; or, it may be deferred, suspended on
   certain conditions, and its benefits gradually bestowed.

   As the satisfaction of Christ was not pecuniary, but penal or forensic;
   a satisfaction for sinners, and not for those who owed a certain amount
   of money, it follows, --

   1. That it does not consist in an exact quid pro quo, so much for so
   much. This, as just remarked, is not the case even among men. The
   penalty for theft is not the restitution of the thing stolen, or its
   exact pecuniary value. It is generally something of an entirely
   different nature. It may be stripes or imprisonment. The punishment for
   an assault is not the infliction of the same degree of injury on the
   person of the offender. So of slander, breach of trust, treason, and
   all other criminal offences. The punishment, for the offence is
   something different from the evil which the offender himself inflicted.
   All that justice demands in penal satisfaction is that it should be a
   real satisfaction, and not merely something graciously accepted as
   such. It must bear an adequate proportion to the crime committed. It
   may be different in kind, but it must have inherent value. To fine a
   man a few pence for wanton homicide would be a mockery; but death or
   imprisonment for life would be a real satisfaction to justice. All,
   therefore, that the Church teaches when it says that Christ satisfied
   divine justice for the sins of men, is that what He did and suffered
   was a real adequate compensation for the penalty remitted and the
   benefits conferred. His sufferings and death were adequate to
   accomplish all the ends designed by the punishment of the sins of men.
   He satisfied justice. He rendered it consistent with the justice of God
   that the sinner should be justified. But He did not suffer either in
   kind or degree what sinners would have suffered. In value, his
   sufferings infinitely transcended theirs. The death of an eminently
   good man would outweigh the annihilation of a universe of insects. So
   the humiliation, sufferings, and death of the eternal Son of God
   immeasurably transcended in worth and power the penalty which a world
   of sinners would have endured.

   2. The satisfaction of Christ was a matter of grace. The Father was not
   bound to provide a substitute for fallen men, nor was the Son bound to
   assume that office. It was an act of pure grace that God arrested the
   execution of the penalty of the law, and consented to accept the
   vicarious sufferings and death of his only begotten Son. And it was an
   act of unparalleled love that the Son consented to assume our nature,
   bear our sins, and die, the just for the unjust, to bring us near to
   God. All the benefits, therefore, which accrue to sinners in
   consequence of the satisfaction of Christ are to them pure gratuities;
   blessings to which in themselves they have no claim. They call for
   gratitude, and exclude boasting.

   3. Nevertheless, it is a matter of justice that the blessings which
   Christ intended to secure for his people should be actually bestowed
   upon them. This follows, for two reasons: first, they were promised to
   Him as the reward of his obedience and sufferings. God covenanted with
   Christ that if He fulfilled the conditions imposed, if He made
   satisfaction for the sins of his people, they should be saved. It
   follows, secondly, from the nature of a satisfaction. If the claims of
   justice are satisfied they cannot be again enforced. This is the
   analogy between the work of Christ and the payment of a debt. The point
   of agreement between the two cases is not the nature of the
   satisfaction rendered, but one aspect of the effect produced. In both
   cases the persons for whom the satisfaction is made are certainly
   freed. Their exemption or deliverance is in both cases, and equally in
   both, a matter of justice. This is what the Scriptures teach when they
   say that Christ gave Himself for a ransom. When a ransom is paid and
   accepted, the deliverance of the captive is a matter of justice. It
   does not, however, thereby cease to be to the captives a matter of
   grace. They owe a debt of gratitude to him who paid the ransom, and
   that debt is the greater when the ransom is the life of their
   deliverer. So in the case of the satisfaction of Christ. Justice
   demands the salvation of his people. That is his reward. It is He who
   has acquired this claim on the. justice of God; his people have no such
   claim except through Him. Besides, it is of the nature of a
   satisfaction that it answers all the ends of punishment. What reason
   can there be for the infliction of the penalty for which satisfaction
   has been rendered?

   4. The satisfaction of Christ being a matter of covenant between the
   Father and the Son, the distribution of its benefits is determined by
   the terms of that covenant. It does not ipso facto liberate. The people
   of God are not justified from eternity. They do not come into the world
   in a justified state They remain (if adults) in a state of condemnation
   until they believe. And even the benefits of redemption are granted
   gradually. The believer receives more and more of them in this life,
   but the full plenitude of blessings is reserved for the life to come.
   All these are facts of Scripture and of experience, and they are all
   explained by the nature of the satisfaction rendered. It is not the
   payment of a debt, but a matter of agreement or covenant. It seemed
   good to the parties to the covenant of redemption that matters should
   be so arranged.

   Penalty.

   The words penal and penalty are frequently misunderstood. By the
   penalty of a law is often understood a specific kind or degree of
   suffering. The penalty of the divine law is said to be eternal death.
   Therefore if Christ suffered the penalty of the law He must have
   suffered death eternal; or, as others say, He must have endured the
   same kind of sufferings as those who are cast off from God and die
   eternally are called upon to suffer. This difficulty is sometimes met
   by the older theologians by saying, with Burman, [395] "Tenendum,
   passionem hanc Christi, licet poenarum nostrarum vim omnem quoad
   intensionem quasi exhauserit, non tamen æternitatem earum tulisse:
   temporis enim infinitatem, infinita personæ dignitas recompensavit."
   Turrettin says, [396] "Si Christus mortem æternam non tulit sed
   temporalem tantum et triduanam, non minus tamen solvit quod a nobis
   debebatur quoad infinitatem poenæ. Quia si non fuit infinita quoad
   durationem, fuit tamen talis æquivalenter quoad valorem, propter
   personæ patientis infinitam dignitatem, quia non fuit passio meri
   hominis, sed veri Dei, qui suo sanguine Ecclesiam acquisivit, Act. xx.
   28, ut quod deest finito tempori, suppleatur per personæ divinæ
   conditionem, quæ passioni temporali pondus addit infinitum."

   Another answer equally common is that Christ suffered what the law
   denounced on sinners, so far as the essence of the penalty is
   concerned, but not as to its accidents. These accidents greatly modify
   all punishments. To a man of culture and refinement, who has near
   relations of the same class, imprisonment for crime is an unspeakably
   more severe infliction than it is to a hardened and degraded offender.
   The essence of the penalty of the divine law is the manifestation of
   God's displeasure, the withdrawal of the divine favour. This Christ
   suffered in our stead. He bore the wrath of God. In the case of sinful
   creatures, this induces final and hopeless perdition, because they have
   no life in themselves. In the case of Christ, it was a transient hiding
   of his Father's face. With sinners, thus being cast off from God is
   necessarily attended by remorse, despair, and rebellious resistance and
   enmity. All these are mere circumstantial accidents, not attending the
   sufferings of Christ. Thus Turrettin says, "Vere tulit poenas quas
   damnati tulissemus, non quidam tamdiu, non omnes, non in eo loco, non
   cum illis effectis; sed tamen sensit justam Dei iram." Again, [397]
   "Licet desperatio et fremitus conjungantur cum poenis damnatorum; non
   sequitur Christum ferendo poenas peccato debitas debuisse illis exponi,
   quia non sunt de essentia poenæ, prout a judice infligitur, vel a
   sponsore sanctissimo fertur; sed habent rationem adjuncti, quod eam
   comitatur, propter vitium subjecti patientis."

   A third and more satisfactory answer to the objection in question is
   that the words penal and penalty do not designate any particular kind
   or degree of suffering, but any kind or any degree which is judicially
   inflicted in satisfaction of justice. The word death, as used in
   Scripture to designate the wages or reward of sin, includes all kinds
   and degrees of suffering inflicted as its punishment. By the words
   penal and penalty, therefore, we express nothing concerning the nature
   of the sufferings endured, but only the design of their infliction.
   Suffering without any reference to the reason of its occurrence is
   calamity; if inflicted for the benefit of the sufferer, it is
   chastisement; if for the satisfaction of justice, it is punishment. The
   very same kind and amount of suffering may in one case be a calamity;
   in another a chastisement; in another a punishment. If a man is killed
   by accident, it is a calamity. If he is put to death on account of
   crime and in execution of a judicial sentence, it is punishment. A man
   may be imprisoned to protect him from unjust violence. His
   incarceration is then an act of kindness. But if he be imprisoned in
   execution of a judicial sentence, then it is punishment. In both cases
   the evil suffered may be precisely the same. Luther was imprisoned for
   years to save him from the fury of the Pope. When, therefore, we say
   that Christ's sufferings were penal, or that He suffered the penalty of
   the law, we say nothing as to the nature or the degree of the pains
   which He endured. We only say, on the one hand, that his sufferings
   were neither mere calamities, nor chastisements designed for his own
   benefit, nor merely dogmatic, or symbolical, or exemplary, or the
   necessary attendants of the conflict between good and evil; and, on the
   other hand, we affirm that they were designed for the satisfaction of
   justice. He died in order that God might be just in justifying the
   ungodly.

   It is not to be inferred from this, however, that either the kind or
   degree of our Lord's sufferings was a matter of indifference. We are
   not authorized to say, as has so often been said, that one drop of his
   blood would have been sufficient to redeem the world. This may express
   a pious sentiment, but not a Scriptural truth. He would not have
   suffered as He did, nor to the degree He did, unless there had been an
   adequate reason for it. There must be some proportion between the evil
   endured, and the benefit to be secured. If a man were saved from death
   or bondage by a prince's paying a shilling, it would be absurd to call
   that either a satisfaction or a ransom. There must be enough of
   self-sacrifice and suffering to give dignity and inherent value to the
   proffered atonement. While, therefore, the value of Christ's sufferings
   is due mainly to the dignity of his person, their character and
   intensity are essential elements in their worth. Nevertheless, their
   character as penal depends not on their nature, but on their design.

   Vicarious.

   By vicarious suffering or punishment is not meant merely sufferings
   endured for the benefit of others. The sufferings of martyrs, patriots,
   and philanthropists, although endured for the good of the Church, the
   country, or of mankind, are not vicarious. That word, according to its
   signification and usage, includes the idea of substitution. Vicarious
   suffering is suffering endured by one person in the stead of another,
   i.e., in his place. It necessarily supposes the exemption of the party
   in whose place the suffering is endured. A vicar is a substitute, one
   who takes the place of another, and acts in his stead. In this sense,
   the Pope assumes to be the vicar of Christ on earth. He claims and
   assumes to exercise Christ's prerogatives. What a substitute does for
   the person whose place he fills, is vicarious, and absolves that person
   from the necessity of doing or suffering the same thing. [398] When,
   therefore, it is said that the sufferings of Christ were vicarious, the
   meaning is that He suffered in the place of sinners. He was their
   substitute. He assumed their obligation to satisfy justice. What He did
   and suffered precluded the necessity of their fulfilling the demands of
   the law in their own persons. This idea of substitution, and of
   vicarious obedience and suffering, pervades all the religions of the
   world; which proves that it has its foundation in the nature of man. It
   is sanctioned in the Word of God, and incorporated in the doctrines
   therein revealed. And this proves that the idea is not merely human,
   but divine; that it is in accordance, not only with the reason of man,
   but with the reason of God. It is an unfairness to use words in a sense
   inconsistent with their established meaning; to say, for example, that
   the sufferings of Christ were vicarious, when nothing more is meant
   than that his sufferings inured to the good of mankind. This may be
   said of any suffering for the public good; even of the sufferings of
   criminals; and of the finally impenitent. Christ's sufferings were
   vicarious in the sense in which the death of one man is vicarious who
   dies in the place of another to save him from a deserved penalty; in
   the sense in which the death of the Old Testament sacrifice, which was
   taken in lieu of the death of the transgressor, was vicarious. And this
   is the sense in which we are bound to use the word.

   Guilt.

   The word guilt, as has been repeatedly remarked, expresses the relation
   which sin bears to justice, or, as the older theologians said, to the
   penalty of the law. This relation, however, is twofold. First, that
   which is expressed by the words criminality and ill-desert, or demerit.
   This is inseparable from sin. It can belong to no one who is not
   personally a sinner, and it permanently attaches to all who have
   sinned. It is not removed by justification, much less by pardon. It
   cannot be transferred from one person to the other. But secondly, guilt
   means the obligation to satisfy justice. This may be removed by the
   satisfaction of justice personally or vicariously. It may be
   transferred from one person to another, or assumed by one person for
   another. When a man steals or commits any other offence to which a
   specific penalty is attached by the law of the land, if he submit to
   the penalty, his guilt in this latter sense is removed. It is not only
   proper that he should remain without further molestation by the state
   for that offence, but justice demands his exemption from any further
   punishment. It is in this sense that it is said that the guilt of
   Adam's sin is imputed to us; that Christ assumed the guilt of our sins;
   and that his blood cleanses from guilt. This is very different from
   demerit or personal ill-desert. The ordinary theological sense of the
   word guilt is well expressed by the German word Schuld, which means the
   responsibility for some wrong, or injury, or loss; or, the obligation
   to make satisfaction. It, therefore, includes the meaning of our words
   guilt and debt. "Ich bin nicht schuldig," means I am not answerable. I
   am not bound to make satisfaction. "Des Todes schuldig seyn," means to
   be under the obligation to suffer death as a penalty. "Des höllischen
   Feuers schuldig," means to be in justice bound to endure the fires of
   hell. So in the Lord's prayer, "Vergieb uns unsere Schulden," remit to
   us the obligation to satisfy for our sins. The German theologians, old
   and new, therefore, speak of the guilt (Schuld) of the offender being
   transferred in the sacrificial services of the Old Testament, from the
   offender to the victim. "Die Schuld," says Ebrard, [399] "kann, wie wir
   wissen, nur so hinweggethan werden, dass sie wirkhich gestraft, d. h.
   gesühnt wird; entweder muss der Sünder selbst die Strafe tragen, oder
   es muss sich ein stellvertretendes Opfer ausfindig machen lassen,
   welches die Schuld zu übernehmen, die Strafe zu tragen und alsdann die
   dadurch erworbene Schuldfreiheit oder Gerechitigkeit dem Menschen
   wieder mitzutheilen vermag." That is, "Guilt, as we know, can be
   removed only by punishment. Either the sinner himself must bear the
   punishment, or a substitute must be provided to assume the guilt, and
   bear the punishment, and thus freedom from guilt, or righteousness, be
   secured for the offender." This is the fundamental idea of atonement or
   satisfaction, which lies at the basis of all sacrifices for sin, the
   world over, and especially those of the Mosaic economy. And this is the
   essential idea of the doctrine of the satisfaction of Christ as it is
   presented in the Scriptures from the beginning to the end, and which is
   so inwrought into the faith and experience of the people of God that it
   has withstood all manner of assaults from within and from without, from
   philosophizing believers and from avowed unbelievers. It assumes that
   guilt, Schuld, reatus, in the sense of the obligation of the sinner to
   satisfy divine justice, may be removed, may be transferred from one
   person to another, or assumed by one in the place of another. In
   perfect consistency with this doctrine it is maintained that guilt or
   reatus in the sense of demerit or ill-desert does not admit of removal
   or transfer.

   Redemption.

   Redemption sometimes means simple deliverance; but properly, and always
   in its application to the work of Christ, it means deliverance by
   purchase. This is plain because it is a deliverance not by authority,
   or power, or teaching, or moral influence, but by blood, by the payment
   of a ransom. This is the etymological signification of the word
   apolutrosis, which is from lutron, a ransom and that from luo, to
   purchase, e.g., the freedom of a slave or captive.

   Expiation and Propitiation.

   Expiation and propitiation are correlative terms. The sinner, or his
   guilt is expiated; God, or justice, is propitiated. Guilt must, from
   the nature of God, be visited with punishment, which is the expression
   of God's disapprobation of sin. Guilt is expiated, in the Scriptural
   representation, covered, by satisfaction, i.e., by vicarious
   punishment. God is thereby rendered propitious, i.e., it is now
   consistent with his nature to pardon and bless the sinner. Propitious
   and loving are not convertible terms. God is love. He loved us while
   sinners, and before satisfaction was rendered. Satisfaction or
   expiation does not awaken love in the divine mind. It only renders it
   consistent with his justice that God should exercise his love towards
   transgressors of his law. This is expressed by the Greek verb
   hilaskomai, propitium facio. "To reconcile oneself to any one by
   expiation." [400] That by which this reconciliation is effected is
   called hilasmos or hilasterion. The effect produced is that God is
   hilaos. God is good to all, full of pity and compassion to all, even to
   the chief of sinners. But he is hilaos only to those for whose sins an
   expiation has been made. That is, according to the Old Testament usage,
   "whose sins are covered." "To cover sin," kpr, is never used to express
   the idea of moral purification, or sanctification, but always that of
   expiation. The means by which sin is said to be covered, is not
   reformation, or good works, but blood, vicarious satisfaction. This in
   Hebrew is kphr, that which covers. The combination of these two ideas
   led the LXX. to call the cover of the ark hilasterion, that which
   covered or shut out the testimony of the law against the sins of the
   people, and thus rendered God propitious. It was an hilasterion,
   however, only because sprinkled with blood. Men may philosophize about
   the nature of God, his relation to his creatures, and the terms on
   which He will forgive sin, and they may never arrive at a satisfactory
   conclusion; but when the question is simply, What do the Scriptures
   teach on this subject? the matter is comparatively easy. In the Old
   Testament and in the New, God is declared to be just, in the sense that
   his nature demands the punishment of sin; that therefore there can be
   no remission without such punishment, vicarious or personal; that the
   plan of salvation symbolically and typically exhibited in the Mosaic
   institution, expounded in the prophets, and clearly and variously
   taught in the New Testament, involves the substitution of the incarnate
   Son of God in the place of sinners who assumed their obligation to
   satisfy divine justice, and that He did in fact make a full and perfect
   satisfaction for sin, bearing the penalty of the law in their stead;
   all this is so plain and undeniable that it has always been the faith
   of the Church and is admitted to be the doctrine of the Scriptures by
   the leading Rationalists of our day. It has been denied only by those
   who are outside of the Church, and therefore not Christians, or by
   those who, instead of submitting to the simple word of God, feel
   constrained to explain its teachings in accordance with their own
   subjective convictions.

CHAPTER VII.

  SATISFACTION OF CHRIST.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Statement of the Doctrine.

   The Symbols of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches agree entire1y in
   their statement of this doctrine. In the "Augsburg Confession" [401] it
   is said, Christus "sua morte pro nostris peccatis satisfecit." In the
   "Apology for the Augsburg Confession" [402] it is more fully expounded,
   "Christus, quia sine peccato subiit poenam peccati, et victima pro
   nobis factus est, sustulit illud jus legis, ne accuset, ne damnet hos
   qui credunt in ipsum, quia ipse est propitiatio pro eis, propter quam
   nunc justi reputantur. Cum autem justi reputentur, lex non potest eos
   accusare, et damnare, etiamsi re ipsa legi non satisfecerint." "Mors
   Christi non est solum satisfactio pro culpa, sed etiam pro æterna
   morte." [403] "In propitiatore hæc duo concurrunt: Primum, oportet
   exstare verbum Dei, ex quo certo sciamus, quod Deus velit misereri et
   exaudire invocantes per hunc propitiatorem. Talis exstat de Christo
   promissio. . . . . Alterum est in propitiatore, quod merita ipsius
   proposita sunt, ut, quæ pro aliis satisfacerent, quæ aliis donentur
   imputatione divina, ut per ea, tanquam propriis meritis justi
   reputentur, ut si quis amicus pro amico solvit æs alienum, debitor
   alieno merito tanquam proprio liberatur. Ita Christi merita nobis
   donantur, ut justi reputemur fiducia meritorum Christi, cum in eum
   credimus, tanquam propria merita haberemus." [404] In the "Form of
   Concord" this doctrine is not only presented but elaborately expounded
   and vindicated. It is said, [405] "Justitia illa, quæ coram Deo fidei,
   aut credentibus, ex mera gratia imputatur, est obedientia, passio et
   resurrectio Christi, quibus ille legi nostra causa satisfecit, et
   peccata nostra expiavit. Cum enim Christus non tantum homo, verum Deus
   et homo sit, in una persona indivisa, tam non fuit legi subjectus, quam
   non fuit passioni et morti (ratione suæ personæ), obnoxius, quia
   Dominus legis erat. Eam ob causam ipsius obedientia (non ea tantum, qua
   patri paruit in tota sua passione et morte, verum etiam, qua nostra
   causa sponte sese legi subjecit, eamque obedientia illa sua implevit)
   nobis ad justitiam imputatur, ita, ut Deus propter totam obedientiam
   (quam Christus agendo et patiendo, in vita et morte sua, nostra causa
   Patri suo coelesti præstitit) peccata nobis remittat, pro bonis et
   justis nos reputet, et salute æterna donet."

   The Reformed Confessions are of like import. The Second Helvetic
   Confession [406] says, "Christus peccata mundi in se recepit et
   sustulit, divinæque justitiæ satisfecit. Deus ergo propter solum
   Christum passum et resuscitatum, propitius est peccatis nostris, nec
   illa nobis imputat." The Belgic Confession says, [407] "Credimus, Jesum
   Christum summum ilium sacerdotem esse, . . . . qui se nostro nomine
   coram Patre ad placandam ipsius iram cum plena satisfactione obtulit,
   sistens se ipsum super altare crucis, et sanguinem suum pretiosum ad
   purgationem peccatorum nostrorum profudit." The Heidelberg Catechism
   says, [408] "Deus vult justitiæ satisfieri; quocirca necesse est, vel
   per nos, vel per alium satisfaciamus." In the following answers it is
   taught that man cannot satisfy the justice of God for himself, nor any
   creature for him; that it was necessary that He who, as our substitute,
   would make satisfaction in our stead, should be both God and man. In
   answer to the question, [409] Why it was necessary that Christ should
   die, it is said, "Propterea quod justitiæ et veritati Dei nullo alio
   pacto pro nostris peccatis potuit satisfieri, quam ipsa morte filii
   Dei." The Heidelberg Catechism being the standard of doctrine in all
   the Dutch and German Reformed churches in Europe and America, is one of
   the most important and authoritative of the symbols of the Reformation.

   In the "Formula Consensus Helvetica" [410] it is said, "Ita Christus
   vice electorum obedientia mortis suæ Deo patri satisfecit, ut in censum
   tamen vicariæ justitiæ et obedientiæ illius, universa ejus, quam per
   totius vitæ suæ curriculum legi . . . . sive agendo sive patiendo
   præstitit, obedientia vocari debeat. . . . . Rotundo asserit ore
   Spiritus Dei, Christum sanctissima vita legi et justitiæ divinæ pro
   nobis satisfecisse, et pretium illud, quo empti sumus Deo, non in
   passionibus duntaxat, sed tota ejus vita legi conformata collocat."

   The "Westminster Confession" [411] says, "The Lord Jesus, by his
   perfect obedience and sacrifice of Himself, which He through the
   eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, hath fully satisfied the
   justice of his Father; and purchased not only reconciliation, but an
   everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven for all those whom the
   Father hath given unto Him."

   This, however, is not a doctrine peculiar to the Lutheran and Reformed
   churches; it is part of the faith of the Church universal. The Council
   of Trent says, [412] "Jesus Christus, cum essemus inimici, propter
   nimiam caritatem qua dilexit nos, sua sanctissima passione in ligno
   crucis nobis justificationem meruit, et pro nobis Deo patri
   satisfecit." "Christus Jesus, qui pro peccatis nostris satisfecit."
   [413] The Roman Catechism says, [414] "Hoc in passione, et morte Filius
   Dei salvator noster spectavit, ut omnium ætatum peccata redimeret ac
   deleret, et pro eis Patri abunde, cumulateque satisfaceret." "Prima
   satisfactio et præstantissima illa est, qua pro scelerum nostrorum
   ratione, etiam si Deus summo jure nobiscum velit agere, quidquid a
   nobis debeatur, cumulate persolutum est. Hæc vero ejusmodi esse
   dicitur, quæ nobis Deum propitium et placatum reddidit, eamque uni
   Christo domino acceptam ferimus, qui in cruce, pretio pro peccatis
   nostris soluto, plenissime Deo satisfecit." [415]

   § 2. The Intrinsic Worth of Christ's Satisfaction.

   The first point is that Christ's work was of the nature of a
   satisfaction, because it met and answered all the demands of God's law
   and justice against the sinner. The law no longer condemns the sinner
   who believes in Christ. Those, however, whom the infinitely holy and
   strict law of God does not condemn are entitled to the divine
   fellowship and favour. To them there can be no condemnation. The work
   of Christ was not, therefore, a mere substitute for the execution of
   the law, which God in his sovereign mercy saw fit to accept in lieu of
   what the sinner was bound to render. It had an inherent worth which
   rendered it a perfect satisfaction, so that justice has no further
   demands. It is here as in the case of state criminals. If such an
   offender suffers the penalty which the law prescribes as the punishment
   of his offence he is no longer liable to condemnation. No further
   punishment can justly be demanded for that offence. This is what is
   called the perfection of Christ's satisfaction. It perfectly, from its
   own intrinsic worth, satisfies the demands of justice. This is the
   point meant to be illustrated when the work of Christ is compared in
   Scripture and in the writings of theologians to the payment of a debt.
   The creditor has no further claims when the debt due to him is fully
   paid.

   This perfection of the satisfaction of Christ, as already remarked, is
   not due to his having suffered either in kind or in degree what the
   sinner would have been required to endure; but principally to the
   infinite dignity of his person. He was not a mere man, but God and man
   in one person. His obedience and sufferings were therefore the
   obedience and sufferings of a divine person. This does not imply, as
   the Patripassians in the ancient Church assumed, and as some writers in
   modem times assume, that the divine nature itself suffered. This idea
   is repudiated alike by the Latin, Lutheran, and Reformed churches. In
   the "Second Helvetic Confession" [416] it is said, "Minime docemus
   naturam in Christo divinam passam esse." The "Form of Concord" [417]
   teaches the same thing, quoting Luther, who says that our Saviour to
   suffer must become man, "non enim in sua natura Deus mori potest.
   Postquam autem Deus et homo unitus est in una persona, recte et vere
   dicitur: Deus mortuus est, quando videlicet ille homo moritur, qui cum
   Deo unum quiddam, seu una persona est." This is precisely what the
   Apostle, in Hebrews ii. 14, teaches, when he says that He who was the
   Son of God, who made heaven and earth, who upholds all things by the
   word of his mouth, and who is immutable and eternal, assumed our nature
   (flesh and blood) in order that He might die, and by death destroy him
   who had the power of death, that is, the devil. Christ is but one
   person, with two distinct natures, and therefore whatever can be
   predicated of either nature may be predicated of the person. An
   indignity offered to a man's body is offered to himself. If this
   principle be not correct there was no greater crime in the crucifixion
   of Christ than in unjustly inflicting death on an ordinary man. The
   principle in question, however, is clearly recognized in Scripture, and
   therefore the sacred. writers do not hesitate to say that God purchased
   the Church with his blood; and that the Lord of glory was crucified.
   Hence such expressions as Dei mors, Dei sanguis, Dei passio have the
   sanction of Scriptural as well of Church usage. It follows from this
   that the satisfaction of Christ has all the value which belongs to the
   obedience and sufferings of the eternal Son of God, and his
   righteousness, as well active as passive, is infinitely meritorious.
   This is what the Apostle clearly teaches in Hebrews ix. 13, 14: "For if
   the blood if bulls and of goats . . . . sanctifieth to the purifying of
   the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through (or
   with) an eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your
   conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" The superior
   efficacy of the sacrifice of Christ is thus referred to the infinitely
   superior dignity of his person.

   It follows from the perfection of Christ's satisfaction that it
   supersedes and renders impossible all other satisfactions for sin. The
   sufferings which justified believers are called upon to endure are not
   punishments, because not designed for the satisfaction of justice. They
   are chastisements intended for the benefit of the sufferer, the
   edification of the Church, and the glory of God. In this view all
   Protestant churches concur.

   Romish Doctrine of Satisfaction.

   Romanists, while on the one hand they exalt to the utmost the intrinsic
   value of Christ's satisfaction, yet on the other hand they restrict its
   application. At one time, it was the prevalent doctrine in the Latin
   Church that the work of Christ availed only for the pardon of sins
   committed before baptism. With regard to post-baptismal sins, it was
   held either that they were unpardonable, or that atonement must be made
   for them by the sinner himself. This idea that the satisfaction of
   Christ avails only to the forgiveness of sins committed before
   conversion has been adopted by many Rationalists, as for example by
   Bretschneider. [418] He says, "Für spätere Sünden der Christen gilt das
   Opfer Christi nicht, sondern es geht dem Sünder nur einmal, bei der
   Taufe, zu Gute." "The sacrifice of Christ does not avail for the later
   sins of the Christian. It benefits the sinner only once, at his
   baptism." [419] What is more remarkable, Dr. Emmons, Puritan though he
   was, has very much the same idea. The only benefit we receive from
   Christ, he says, is the forgiveness of sins. This is granted when we
   believe. After that, we are rewarded or punished, not only according to
   but on account of our works. [420] The doctrine that post-baptismal
   sins are unpardonable, having been rejected as heretical, the Romish
   theologians adopted the theory that the satisfaction of Christ availed
   only to the remission of the penalty of eternal death; leaving the
   sinner bound to suffer the temporal punishment due to his
   transgressions or to make satisfaction for them.

   The Romish doctrine of satisfactions arose out of a perversion of the
   penances imposed in the early ages upon the lapsed. Those penances were
   satisfactions rendered to the Church; that is, they were intended to
   satisfy the Church of the sincerity of the offender's repentance. When
   they came to be regarded as satisfactions rendered to the justice of
   God, the theologians were obliged to adopt a theory to reconcile the
   Church practice with the doctrine of the infinitely meritorious
   satisfaction of Christ. That theory was that the satisfaction of
   Christ, infinite though it was in merit, was designed only to secure
   the remission of everlasting death. Temporal punishments and the pains
   of purgatory after death are still to be endured, at the discretion of
   the Church, as satisfactions for sins. This is not the place for the
   full discussion of this subject. It is enough to remark, (1.) That if,
   as the Scriptures teach, every sin deserves God's wrath and curse, both
   in this life and in that which is to come, then it is out of all
   question for a sinner to make satisfaction for the least of all his
   sins. What he offers as the ground of pardon needs itself to be
   pardoned. This is so plain that Romanists have modified their theory so
   as in fact to destroy it, by teaching that the satisfaction rendered by
   penitents is accepted as such only for Christ's sake. But if this be so
   then the satisfaction of Christ is all-sufficient, and is not confined
   to removing the penalty of eternal death. (2.) In the Bible, the work
   of Christ is said to cleanse from all sin. All other sacrifices and
   satisfactions are said to be utterly unavailing, even should a man give
   the fruit of his body for the sin of his soul. (3.) Those who believe
   in Christ are justified, says the Apostle, from all things. They are
   not under condemnation. No one can lay anything to their charge. They
   have peace with God. (4.) This doctrine of supplementary satisfaction
   is derogatory to Christ and destructive of the peace of the believer,
   reducing him to a slavish state, and putting his salvation in the hands
   of the priests. (5.) If Christ be our only priest his work is the only
   satisfaction for sin. All others are unnecessary and every other is
   impossible.

   § 3. Doctrine of the Scotists and Remonstrants.

   While Protestants and the Church generally have held the doctrine that
   the satisfaction of Christ, because of the dignity of his person and
   the nature and degree of his sufferings was and is infinitely
   meritorious, absolutely perfect from its intrinsic worth, and
   completely efficacious in its application to all the sins of the
   believer, the Scotists in the Middle Ages, and after them Grotius and
   the Remonstrants, denied that the work of Christ had inherent value to
   satisfy divine justice, but said that it was taken as a satisfaction,
   acceptatione gratuita. The propositions laid down by Anselm, in his
   epoch-making book, "Cur Deus Homo?" were, "(1.) Quod necessarium fuit
   hominem redimi. (2.) Quod non potuit redimi sine satisfactione. (3.)
   Quod facienda erat satisfactio a Deo homine. (4.) Quod convenientior
   modus fuit hic, scilicet per passionem Christi." The argument of Anselm
   is founded on the assumption that the pardon of sin required an
   infinite satisfaction, i.e., a satisfaction of infinite merit, which
   could only be rendered by a person of infinite dignity. This principle,
   and all the propositions founded upon it, Duns Scotus contested. He
   advanced the opposite principle, namely, "Tantum valet omne creatum
   oblatum, pro quanto Deus acceptat." Therefore any man might have
   satisfied for his own sins; or one man for the sins of all men, had God
   seen fit so to ordain. "Meritum Christi," he says, "fuit finitum, quia
   a principio finito essentialiter dependens. Non enim Christus quatenus
   Deus meruit, sed quatenus homo." This principle became the foundation
   of the doctrine of the Remonstrants on the work of Christ, and of the
   work of Grotius, "De Satisfactione Christi." Limborch [421] says,
   "Satisfactio Christi dicitur, qua pro nobis poenas omnes luit peccatis
   nostris debitas, easque perferendo et exhauriendo divinæ justitiæ
   satisfecit. Verum illa sententia nullum habet in Scriptura fundamentum.
   Mors Christi vocatur sacrificium pro peccato; atqui sacrificia non sunt
   solutiones debitorum, neque plenariæ pro peccatis satisfactiones; sed
   illis peractis conceditur gratuita peccati remissio. In eo errant quam
   maxime, quod velint redemtionis pretium per omnia æquivalens esse
   debere miseriæ illi, e qua redemtio fit. Redemtionis pretium enim
   constitui solet pro libera æstimatione illius qui captivum detinet, non
   autem solvi pro captivi merito." [422] Curcellæus, another
   distinguished Remonstrant, or Arminian theologian, says the same thing:
   [423] "Non ergo, ut vulgo putant, satisfecit [Christus] patiendo omnes
   poenas, quas peccatis nostris merueramus. Nam primo, istud ad
   sacrificii rationem non pertinet. . . . . Sacrificia enim non sunt
   solutiones debitorum. . . . . Secundo, Christus non est passus mortem
   æternam quæ erat poena peccato debita, nam paucis tantum horis in cruce
   prependit, et tertia die resurrexit ex mortuis. Imo etiamsi mortem
   æternam pertulisset, non videtur satisfacere potuisse pro omnibus
   totius mundi peccatis. Hæc enim fuisset tantum una mors, quæ omnibus
   mortibus, quas singuli pro suis peccatis meruerant, non æquivaluisset."

   It is obvious that the objections presented in the above extracts arise
   from confounding pecuniary with judicial or legal satisfaction. There
   is an analogy between them, and, therefore, on the ground of that
   analogy it is right to say that Christ assumed and paid our debts. The
   analogy consists, first, in the effect produced, namely, the certain
   deliverance of those for whom the satisfaction is made; secondly, that
   a real equivalent is paid; and, thirdly, that in both cases justice
   requires that the liberation of the obligee should take place. But, as
   we have already seen, the two kinds of satisfaction differ, first, in
   that in penal satisfaction the demand is not for any specific degree or
   kind of suffering; secondly, that while the value of pecuniary
   satisfaction is independent entirely of the person by whom the payment
   is made, in the other case everything depends on the dignity of him by
   whom the satisfaction is rendered; and, thirdly, that the benefits of a
   penal satisfaction are conferred according to the terms or conditions
   of the covenant in pursuance of which it is offered and accepted.

   The principle that a thing avails for whatever God chooses to take it,
   which is the foundation of the doctrine that Christ's work was not a
   satisfaction in virtue of its intrinsic worth but only by the gracious
   acceptance of God, cannot be true. For, --

   1. It amounts to saying that there is no truth in anything. God may (if
   such language may be pardoned) take anything for anything; a whole for
   a part, or a part for the whole; truth for error, or error for truth;
   right for wrong, or wrong for right; the blood of a goat for the blood
   of the Eternal Son of God. This is impossible. The nature of God is
   immutable, -- immutable reason, truth, and goodness; and his nature
   determines his will and his judgments. Therefore it is impossible that
   He should take that to be satisfaction which is not really such.

   2. The principle in question involves the denial of the necessity of
   the work of Christ. It is inconceivable that God should send his only
   begotten Son into the world to suffer and die if the same end could
   have been accomplished in any other way. If every man could atone for
   his own sins, or one man for the sins of the whole world, then Christ
   is dead in vain.

   3. If this doctrine be true then it is not true that it is impossible
   that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. If every
   creatum oblatum tantum valet, pro quanto Deus acceptat, then why might
   not the Old Testament sacrifices have sufficed to take away sin? What
   rendered them inefficacious was their own inherent worthlessness. And
   what renders the satisfaction of Christ effectual is its own inherent
   value.

   4. The Scriptures teach the necessity of the death of Christ, not only
   by implication, but also by direct assertion. In Galatians ii. 21, the
   Apostle says, "If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in
   vain." This means that if the righteousness necessary for the salvation
   of men could have been secured in any other way the whole work of
   Christ is a matter of supererogation, an unnecessary expenditure of
   what was beyond all price. Still more explicit is his language in
   Galatians iii. 21: "If there had been a law given which could have
   given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law." It is
   here asserted that if any other method could have availed to save
   sinners it would have been adopted. Our Lord, in Luke xxiv. 26, asks,
   "Ought not Christ to have suffered these things?" There was an
   obligation, or necessity, which demanded his sufferings if the
   salvation of sinners was to be accomplished. The Apostle again, in
   Hebrews ii. 10, says, "It became him, for whom are all things, and by
   whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
   captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings." There was a
   necessity for the sufferings of Christ, and that necessity was not
   merely governmental, nor for the accumulating moral power over the
   sinner's heart, but it arose out of the nature of God. It became Him.
   It was consonant with his perfections and character, which is the
   highest conceivable kind of necessity.

   5. What the Scriptures teach of the justice of God leads to the same
   conclusion. Justice is a form of moral excellence. It belongs to the
   nature of God. It demands the punishment of sin. If sin be pardoned it
   can be pardoned in consistency with the divine justice only on the
   ground of a forensic penal satisfaction. Therefore the Apostle says
   (Romans iii. 25), that God sent forth Christ as a propitiation through
   faith in his blood, in order that God might be just in justifying the
   ungodly.

   6. The Scriptures, in representing the gift of Christ as the highest
   conceivable exhibition of the divine love, do thereby teach, first,
   that the end to be accomplished was worthy of the sacrifice; and,
   secondly, that the sacrifice was necessary to the attainment of the
   end. If the end could have been otherwise attained there would have
   been no exhibition of love in the gift of Christ for its
   accomplishment.

   7. All that the Bible teaches of the truth of God; of the immutability
   of the law; of the necessity of faith; of the uselessness and
   worthlessness of all other sacrifices for sin; and of the impossibility
   of salvation except through the work of the incarnate Son of God,
   precludes the idea that his satisfaction was not necessary to our
   salvation, or that any other means could have accomplished the object.
   And if thus absolutely necessary, it must be that nothing else has
   worth enough to satisfy the demands of God's law. It is the language
   and spirit of the whole Bible, and of every believing heart in relation
   to Christ that his "blood alone has power sufficient to atone."

   § 4. Satisfaction rendered to Justice.

   The second point involved in the Scriptural doctrine concerning he
   satisfaction of Christ is, that it was a satisfaction to the justice of
   God. This is asserted in all the Confessions above cited. And by
   justice is not meant simply general rectitude or rightness of character
   and action; nor simply rectoral justice, which consists in a due regard
   to the rights and interests of subjects in relation to rulers; much
   less does it mean commutative justice or honesty. It is admitted that
   the Hebrew word tsdyq, the Greek dikaios, the Latin justus, the English
   just or righteous, and their cognates, are used in all these senses
   both in Scripture and in ordinary life. But they are also used to
   express the idea of distributive or retributive justice; that form of
   moral excellence which demands the righteous distribution of rewards
   and punishments which renders it certain, under the government of God,
   that obedience will be rewarded and sin punished. This is also properly
   called, especially in its relation to sin, vindicatory justice, because
   it vindicates and maintains the right. Vindicatory and vindictive, in
   the ordinary sense of this latter term, are not synonymous. It is a
   common mistake or misrepresentation to confound these two words, and to
   represent those who ascribe to God the attribute of vindicatory justice
   as regarding Him as a vindictive being, thirsting for revenge. There is
   as much difference between the words and the ideas they express as
   there is between a righteous judge and a malicious murderer. The
   question then is, Does the attribute of vindicatory justice belong to
   God? Does his infinite moral excellence require that sin should be
   punished on account of its own inherent demerit, irrespective of the
   good effects which may flow from such punishment? Or is justice what
   Leibnitz defines it to be, "Benevolence guided by wisdom." It is
   admitted that the work of Christ was in some sense a satisfaction; that
   it satisfied in some way the exigencies of the case, or the conditions
   necessary to the salvation of man. It is further, at least generally,
   admitted that it was in some sense a satisfaction of justice. This
   being the case, everything depends on what is meant by justice. If
   justice is "benevolence guided by wisdom," or a benevolent disposition
   on the part of a ruler to sustain his authority as a means of promoting
   the happiness of his. kingdom, then the work of Christ is one thing. It
   may be simply a means of reformation, or of moral impression. But if
   justice is that perfection of the divine nature which renders it
   necessary that. the righteous be rewarded and the wicked punished, then
   the work of Christ must be a satisfaction of justice in that sense of
   the term. The question, therefore, concerning "the nature of the
   atonement" depends on the question whether there is in God such an
   attribute as distributive or vindicatory justice. This question has
   already been discussed when treating of the attributes of God. All that
   is necessary here is a brief recapitulation of the arguments there
   presented, --

   1. We ascribe intelligence, knowledge, power, holiness, goodness, and
   truth to God, (a.) Because these are perfections which belong to our
   own nature, and must of necessity belong to Him in whose image we were
   created. (b.) Because these attributes are all manifested in his works.
   (c.) Because they are all revealed in his Word. On the same grounds we
   ascribe to God justice; that. is, the moral excellence which determines
   Him to punish sin and reward righteousness. The argument in this case
   is not only of the same kind, but of the same cogency. We are just as
   conscious of a sense of justice as we are of intelligence or of power.
   This consciousness belongs to man as man, to all men in all ages and
   under all circumstances. It must, therefore, belong to the original
   constitution of their nature. Consequently it is as certain that God is
   just, in the ordinary sense of that word, as that He is intelligent or
   holy.

   2. The Spirit of God in convincing a man of sin convinces him of guilt
   as well as of pollution. That is, He convinces him of his desert of
   punishment. But a sense of a desert of punishment is a conviction that
   we ought to be punished; and this is of necessity attended with the
   persuasion that, under the righteous government of God, the punishment
   of sin is inevitable and necessary. They who sin, the Apostle says,
   know the righteous judgment of God, that they are worthy of death.

   3. The justice of God is revealed in his works, (a.) In the
   constitution of our nature. The connection between sin and misery is so
   intimate that many have gone to the extreme of teaching that there is
   no other punishment of sin but its natural effects. This is contrary to
   fact as well as to Scripture. Nevertheless it is true that to be
   "carnally minded is death," that is, damnation. There is no help for
   it. It is vain to say that God will not punish sin when He has made sin
   and its punishment inseparable. The absence of light is darkness; the
   absence of life is death; (b.) It is, however, not only in the
   constitution of our nature, but also in all his works of providence,
   that God has revealed his purpose to punish sin. The deluge; the
   destruction of the cities of the plain; the overthrow of Jerusalem and
   the dispersion and long-continued degradation of the Jewish people; the
   ruins of Nineveh, of Babylon, of Tyre and Sidon, and of Egypt; and the
   present condition of many of the nations of the earth, as well as the
   general administration of the divine government, are proof enough that
   God is an avenger, that He will in no wise spare the guilty.

   4. The Scriptures so constantly and so variously teach that God is
   just, that it is impossible to present adequately their testimony on
   the subject. (a.) We have the direct assertions of Scripture. Almost
   the first words which God spoke to Adam were, "In the day that thou
   eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." The angels who sinned are
   reserved in chains unto the judgment of the great lay. Death is
   declared to be the wages, i.e., the proper recompense of sin, which
   justice demands that it should receive. God is declared to be a
   consuming fire. Men can no more secure themselves from the punishment
   of their sins, by their own devices, than they can save themselves from
   a raging conflagration by a covering of chaff. The penalty of the law
   is as much a revelation of the nature of God as its precept is. As He
   cannot, consistently with his perfections, exonerate men from the
   obligation of obedience, so He cannot allow them to sin with impunity.
   It is, therefore, declared that He will reward every man according to
   his works. (b.) All the divinely ordained institutions of religion,
   whether Patriarchal, Mosaic, or Christian, were founded on the
   assumption of the justice of God, and were designed to impress that
   great truth in the minds of men. They take for granted that men are
   sinners; and that, being sinners, they need expiation for their guilt
   as well as moral purification, in order to salvation. Sacrifices,
   therefore, were instituted from the beginning to teach the necessity of
   expiation and to serve as prophetic types of the only effectual
   expiation which, in the fulness of time, was to be offered for the sins
   of men. Without the shedding of blood (i.e., without vicarious
   punishment) there is no remission. This is recorded, not merely as a
   fact under the Mosaic dispensation, but as embodying a principle valid
   under all dispensations. It is not, therefore, this or that declaration
   of Scripture, or this or that institution which must be explained away
   if the justice of God be denied, but the whole form and structure of
   the religion of the Bible. That religion as the religion for sinners
   rests on the assumption of the necessity of expiation. This is its
   corner-stone, and the whole fabric falls into ruin if that stone be
   removed. That God cannot pardon sin without a satisfaction to justice,
   and that He cannot have fellowship with the unholy, are the two great
   truths which are revealed in the constitution of our nature as well as
   in the Scriptures, and which are recognized in all forms of religion,
   human or divine. It is because the demands of justice are met by the
   work of Christ, that his gospel is the power of God unto salvation, and
   that it is so unspeakably precious to those whom the Spirit of God has
   convinced of sin. (c.) We accordingly find that the plan of salvation
   as unfolded in the New Testament is founded on the assumption that God
   is just. The argument of the sacred writers is this: The wrath of God
   is revealed against all unrighteousness and ungodliness of men. That
   is, God is determined to punish sin. All men, whether Gentiles or Jews,
   are sinners. Therefore the whole world is guilty before God. Hence no
   man can be justified by works. It is a contradiction to say that those
   who are under condemnation for their character and conduct can be
   justified on the ground of anything they are or can do. There is no
   force in this argument unless there is a necessity for the punishment
   of sin. Human sovereigns pardon criminals; earthly parents forgive
   their children. If the penalty of the law could be as easily remitted
   in the divine government then it would not follow from the fact that
   all men are sinners that they cannot be forgiven on the ground of their
   repentance and reformation. The Scriptures, however, assume that if a
   man sins he must die. On this assumption all their representations and
   arguments are founded. Hence the plan of salvation which the Bible
   reveals supposes that the justice of God which renders the punishment
   of sin necessary has been satisfied. Men can be pardoned and restored
   to the favour of God, because Christ was set forth as an expiation for
   their sins, through faith in his blood because He was made a curse for
   us; because He died, the just for the unjust; because He bore our sins
   in his own body on the tree and because the penalty due to us was laid
   on Him. It is clear therefore, that the Scriptures recognize the truth
   that God is just, in the sense that He is determined by his moral
   excellence to punish all sin, and therefore that the satisfaction of
   Christ which secures the pardon of sinners is rendered to the justice
   of God. Its primary and principal design is neither to make a moral
   impression upon the offenders themselves, nor to operate didactically
   on other intelligent creatures, but to satisfy the demands of justice;
   so that God can be just in justifying the ungodly.

   § 5. The Work of Christ Satisfies the Demands of the Law.

   A third point involved in the Church doctrine on the work of Christ, is
   that it is a satisfaction to the divine law. This indeed may seem to be
   included under the foregoing head. If a satisfaction to justice, it
   must be a satisfaction to law. But in the ordinary use of the terms,
   the word law is more comprehensive than justice. To satisfy justice is
   to satisfy the demand which justice makes for the punishment of sin.
   But the law demands far more than the punishment of sin, and therefore
   satisfaction to the law includes more than the satisfaction of
   vindicatory justice. In its relation to the law of God the Scriptural
   doctrine concerning the work of Christ includes the following points:
   --

   1. The law of God is immutable. It can neither be abrogated nor
   dispensed with. This is true both as respects its precepts and penalty.
   Such is the nature of God as holy, that He cannot cease to require his
   rational creatures to be holy. It can never cease to be obligatory on
   them to love and obey God. And such is the nature of God as just, that
   He cannot cease to condemn sin, and therefore all those who are guilty
   of sin.

   2. Our relation to the law is two-fold, federal and moral. It is of the
   nature of a covenant prescribing the conditions of life. It says, "Ye
   shall keep my statutes and my judgments; which if a man do, he shall
   live in them." And, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
   things which are written in the book of the law to do them."

   3. From this federal relation to the law we are, under the gospel,
   delivered. We are no longer bound to be free from all sin, and to
   render perfect obedience to the law, as the condition of salvation. If
   this were not the case, no flesh living could be saved. We are not
   under law but under grace.

   4. This deliverance from the law is not effected by its abrogation, or
   by lowering its demands, but by the work of Christ. He was made under
   the law that He might redeem those who were under the law.

   5. The work of Christ was therefore of the nature of a satisfaction to
   the demands of the law. By his obedience and sufferings, by his whole
   righteousness, active and passive, He, as our representative and
   substitute, did and endured all that the law demands.

   6. Those, who by faith receive this righteousness, and trust upon it
   for justification, are saved; and receive the renewing of their whole
   nature into the image of God. Those who refuse to submit to this
   righteousness of God, and go about to establish their own
   righteousness, are left under the demands of the law; they are required
   to be free from all sin, or having sinned, to bear the penalty.

   Proof of the Immutability of the Law.

   The principles above stated are not arbitrarily assumed; they are not
   deductions from any à priori maxims or axioms; they are not the
   constituent elements of a humanly constructed theory; they are not even
   the mere obiter dicta of inspired men; they are the principles which
   the sacred writers not only announce as true, but on which they argue,
   and which they employ in the construction of that system of doctrine
   which they present as the object of faith and ground of hope to fallen
   men. The only legitimate way therefore of combating these principles,
   is to prove, not that they fail to satisfy the reason, the feelings, or
   the imagination, or that they are incumbered with this or that
   difficulty; but that they are not Scriptural. If the sacred writers do
   announce and embrace them, then they are true, or we have no solid
   ground on which to rest our hopes for eternity.

   The Scriptural character of these principles being the only question of
   real importance, appeal must be made at once to the Word of God.
   Throughout the Scriptures, the immutability of the divine law; the
   necessity of its demands being satisfied; the impossibility of sinners
   making that satisfaction for themselves; the possibility of its being
   rendered by substitution; and that a wonderfully constituted person,
   could and would, and in fact has, accomplished this work in our behalf,
   are the great constituent principles of the religion of the Bible. As
   the revelation contained in the Scriptures has been made in a
   progressive form, we find all these principles culminating in their
   full development in the later writings of the New Testament. In St.
   Paul's epistle to the Romans, for example, the following positions are
   assumed and established (1.) The law must be fulfilled. (2.) It demands
   perfect obedience; and, in case of transgression, the penalty of death.
   (3.) No fallen man can fulfil those conditions, or satisfy the demands
   of the law. (4.) Christ, the Eternal Son of God, clothed in our natures
   has made this satisfaction to law for us. (5.) We are thus freed from
   the law. We are not under law, but under grace. (6.) All that is now
   required of us is faith in Christ. To those who are in Him there is no
   condemnation. (7.) By his obedience we are constituted righteous, and,
   being thus reconciled to God, we become partakers of the holy and
   immortal life of Christ, and are delivered not only from the penalty,
   but from the power of sin, and made the sons and heirs of God. (8.) The
   great condemning sin of men under the gospel, is rejecting the
   righteousness and Spirit of Christ, and insisting either that they need
   no Saviour, or that they can in some way save themselves; that they can
   satisfy all God's just demands, and deliver themselves from the power
   of sin. If the foregoing principles are eliminated from the Pauline
   epistles, their whole life and power are gone. And Paul assures us that
   he received his doctrines, not from men, but by the revelation of Jesus
   Christ. It is against this rock, -- the substitution of Christ in the
   place of sinners; his making a full satisfaction to the justice and law
   of God, thus working out for us a perfect righteousness, by which we
   may be justified, -- that the assaults of philosophy, falsely so
   called, and of heresy in all its forms have been directed from the
   beginning. This it is that the Gnostics and New Platonists in the first
   centuries; the Scotists and Franciscans during the Middle Ages; the
   Socinians and Remonstrants at, and after the Reformation; and
   Rationalists and the speculative philosophy of our own age, have
   striven to overthrow. But it remains, what it ever has been, the
   foundation of the faith, hope, and life of the Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 6. Proof of the Doctrine.

   The Scriptural evidence in support of this great doctrine, as far as it
   can well be presented within reasonable limits, has already, in great
   measure, been exhibited, in the statement and vindication of the
   several elements which it includes.

   It has been shown, (1.) That the work of Christ for our salvation, was
   a real satisfaction of infinite inherent dignity and worth. (2.) That
   it was a satisfaction not to commutative justice (as paying a sum of
   money would be), nor to the rectoral justice or benevolence of God, but
   to his distributive and vindicatory justice which renders necessary the
   punishment of sin; and (3.) That it was a satisfaction to the law of
   God, meeting its demands of a perfect righteousness for the
   justification of sinners. If these points be admitted, the Church
   doctrine concerning the satisfaction, or atonement of Christ, is
   admitted in all that is essential to its integrity. It remains,
   therefore, only to refer to certain classes of passages and modes of
   representation pervading the Scriptures, which assume or assert the
   truth of all the principles above stated.

   Christ saves us as our Priest.

   Christ is said to save men as a priest. It is not by the mere exercise
   of power, nor by instruction and mental illumination; nor by any
   objective, persuasive, moral influence; nor by any subjective
   operation, whether natural or supernatural, whether intelligible or
   mystical, but by acting for them the part of a representative,
   substitute, propitiator, and intercessor. It was in the Old Testament
   foretold that the Messiah was to be both priest and king, that he was
   to be a priest after the order of Melchisedec. In the New Testament,
   and especially in the Epistle to the Hebrews, which is devoted almost
   exclusively to the exhibition of the priestly character and work of
   Christ, it is taught, --

   1. That a priest is a substitute or representative, appointed to do for
   sinners what they could not do for themselves. Their guilt and
   pollution forbid their access to God. Someone, therefore, must be
   authorized to appear before God in their behalf, and effect
   reconciliation of God to sinners.

   2. That this reconciliation can only be effected by means of an
   expiation for sin. The guilt of sin can be removed in no other way.
   Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission. A priest,
   therefore, is one appointed for men (i.e., to act in their behalf), to
   offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin.

   3. That this expiation was effected by the substitution of a victim in
   the place of the sinner, to die in his stead, i.e., in Scriptural
   language, "to bear his sins." "Guilt," says Ebrard, in a passage
   already quoted, "can be removed only by being actually punished, i.e.
   expiated. Either the sinner himself must bear the punishment, or a
   substitute must be found, which can assume the guilt, bear the penalty,
   and give the freedom from guilt or righteousness thus secured, to the
   offender." [424] This he gives as the fundamental idea of the epistle
   to the Hebrews.

   4. Such being the nature of the priesthood and the way in which a
   priest saves those for whom he acts, the Apostle shows, first, with
   regard to the priests under the old economy, that such was the method,
   ordained by God, by which the remission of ceremonial sins and
   restoration to the privileges of the theocracy, were to be secured; and
   secondly, that the victims then offered, having no inherent dignity or
   worth, could not take away sin; they could not purge the conscience
   from the sense of guilt, or bring to the end contemplated (teleiosai)
   those for whom they were offended, and hence had to be continually
   repeated. In Hebrews ix. 9, it is said dora te kai thusiai . . . . me
   dunamenai kata suneidesin teleiosai ton latreuonta, i.e., says
   Robinson, "which could never make full expiation for the bringer, so as
   to satisfy his conscience."

   5. The Aaronic priesthood and sacrifices were, therefore, temporary,
   being the mere types and shadows of the true priest and the real
   sacrifice, promised from the beginning.

   6. Christ, the Eternal Son of God, assumed our nature in order that He
   might be a merciful and faithful high priest, to make reconciliation
   for the sins of the people. That is, to make expiation for sin. The
   word used is hilaskomai, propitium reddere; which in the Septuagint, is
   the substitute for kpr (to cover guilt), to hide sin from the sight of
   God. In the New Testament, as in the Septuagint, hilaskomai is the
   special term for sacerdotal expiation, and is not to be confounded with
   apokatallattesthai, to reconcile. The latter is the effect of the
   former; reconciliation is secured by expiation.

   7. Christ is proved, especially in Hebrews v., to be a real priest;
   first, because He has all the qualifications for the office, He was a
   man, was a substitute, had a sacrifice, and was able to sympathize with
   his people; secondly, because He was called of God to the priesthood,
   as was Aaron; thirdly, because He actually discharged all the functions
   of the office.

   8. The sacrifice which this great high priest offered in our behalf,
   was not the blood of irrational animals, but his own most precious
   blood.

   9. This one sacrifice has perfected forever (teteleioken, made a
   perfect expiation for) them that are sanctified. (Hebrews x. 14.)

   10. This sacrifice has superseded all others. No other is needed; and
   no other is possible.

   11. Those who reject this method of salvation certainly perish. To them
   there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins. (Hebrews x. 26.)

   It can hardly be questioned that this is a correct, although feeble
   statement of the leading ideas of the Epistle to the Hebrews. With this
   agree all other representations of the Scriptures both in the Old
   Testament and in the New, and therefore if we adhere to the doctrine of
   the Bible we must believe that Christ saves us, not by power, or by
   moral influence, but as a priest, by offering Himself as an expiatory
   sacrifice for our sins. To deny this; to explain away these express
   teachings of the Scriptures, as mere accommodations to the modes of
   thought prevalent in the age of the Apostles; or to substitute modern
   ideas of the nature of sacrifices, for those of the Bible and of the
   whole ancient world; or to attempt to get at the philosophical truth
   inclosed in these Scriptural forms, while we reject the forms
   themselves, are only different ways of substituting our thoughts for
   God's thoughts, our way of salvation for God's way. If the ordinary
   authoritative rules of interpretation are to be adhered to, it cannot
   be denied that the Scriptures teach that Christ saves us as a priest by
   making a full expiation for our sins, bearing the penalty of them in
   his own person in our behalf.

   Christ saves us as a Sacrifice.

   Intimately connected with the argument from the priestly office of
   Christ, and inseparable from it, is that which is derived from those
   numerous passages in which He is set forth as a sacrifice for sin. Much
   as the nature of the Old Testament sacrifices has of late years. been
   discussed, and numerous as are the theories which have been advanced
   upon this subject, there are some points with regard to which all who
   profess faith in the Scriptures, are agreed. In the first place, it is
   agreed that Christ was in some sense a sacrifice for the sins of men;
   secondly, that the sense in which He was a sacrifice is the same as
   that in which the sin offerings of the Old Testament were sacrifices;
   and, thirdly, that the true Scriptural idea of sacrifices for sin is a
   historical question and not a matter of speculation. According to
   Michaelis, they were mere fines; [425] according to Sykes, federal
   rites; according to others, expressions of gratitude, offerings to God
   in acknowledgment of his goodness; according to others, they were
   symbolical of the surrender and devotion of the life of the offerer to
   God; [426] according to others, they were confessions of sin and
   symbolical exhibitions of penitence; and according to others, their
   whole design and effect was in some way to produce a salutary moral
   impression. [427] It is admitted that the offerings of the old economy
   were of different kinds, not only as bloody and unbloody, but that
   among those which involved the shedding of blood some were designed for
   one purpose and some for another. The whole question relates to the sin
   offerings properly so called, of which the sacrifices on the great day
   of atonement were the special illustrative examples. The common
   doctrine as to these sin offerings is, (1.) That the design of such
   offerings was to propitiate God; to satisfy his justice, and to render
   it consistent and proper that the offence for which they were offered
   should be forgiven, (2.) That this propitiation of God was secured by
   the expiation of guilt; by such an offering as covered sin, so that it
   did not appear before Him as demanding punishment; (3.) That this
   expiation was effected by vicarious punishment; the victim being
   substituted for the offender, bearing his guilt, and suffering the
   penalty which he had incurred; (4.) That the effect of such sin
   offerings was the pardon of the offender, and his restoration to favour
   and to the enjoyment of the privileges which he had forfeited. If this
   be the true Scriptural idea of a sacrifice for sin, then do the
   Scriptures in declaring that Christ was a sacrifice, intend to teach
   that He was the substitute for sinners; that He bore their guilt and
   suffered the penalty of the law in their stead; and thereby reconciled
   them unto God; i.e., rendered it consistent with his perfections that
   they should be pardoned and restored to the divine fellowship and
   favour.

   Proof of the Common Doctrine concerning Sacrifices for Sin.

   That this is the true doctrine concerning sacrifices for sin may be
   argued, --

   1. From the general sentiment of the ancient world. These offerings
   arose from a sense of guilt and apprehension of the wrath of God. Under
   the pressure of the sense of sin, and when the displeasure of God was
   experienced or apprehended, men everywhere resorted to every means in
   their power to make expiation for their offences, and to propitiate the
   favour of God. Of these means the most natural, as it appears from its
   being universally adopted, was the offering of propitiatory sacrifices.
   The more numerous and costly these offerings the greater hope was
   cherished of their efficacy. Men did not spare even the fruit of their
   bodies for the sin of their souls. It was not that the Deity, to be
   propitiated, needed these oblations, or could Himself enjoy them; but
   it was that justice demanded satisfaction, and the hope was entertained
   that the death of the victims might be taken in lieu of that of the
   offender. Even those who repudiate the doctrine of expiation as
   belonging to the religion of the Bible, admit that it was the doctrine
   of the ancient world. But if it was the doctrine of the ancient world,
   two things naturally follow; first, that it has a foundation in the
   nature of man, and in the intuitive knowledge of the relation which he
   as a sinner bears to God; and, secondly, that when we find exactly the
   same rites and ceremonies, the same forms of expression and the same
   significant actions in the Scriptures, they cannot fairly be understood
   in a sense diametrically opposite to that in which all the rest of the
   world understood them.

   2. The second argument is that it is beyond doubt that the Hebrews, to
   whom the Mosaic institutions were given, understood their sacrifices
   for sin to be expiatory offerings and not mere forms of worship or
   expressions of their devotion of themselves to God; or as simply
   didactic, designed to make a moral impression on the offender and on
   the spectators. They were explained as expiations, in which the victim
   bore the guilt of the sinner, and died in his stead and for his
   deliverance. That such was the doctrine of the Hebrews is proved by
   such authors as Outram, in his work "De Sacrificiis;" by Schoettgen,
   "Horæ Hebrææ et Talmudicæ;" Eisenmenger, "Endecktes Judenthum," and
   other writers on the subject. Outram quotes from the Jewish authorities
   forms of confession connected with the imposition of hands on the
   victim. One is to the following effect: [428] "I beseech thee, O Lord,
   I have sinned, I have done perversely, I have rebelled, I have done
   (specifying the offence); but now I repent, and let this victim be my
   expiation." The design of the imposition of hands was to signify, say
   these authorities, the removal of sin from the offender to the animal.
   [429]

   3. It is no less certain that the whole Christian world has ever
   regarded the sacrifices for sin to be expiatory, designed to teach the
   necessity of expiation and to foreshadow the method by which it was to
   be accomplished. Such, as has been shown, is the faith of the Latin, of
   the Lutheran, and of the Reformed churches, all the great historical
   bodies which make up the sum of professing Christians. That this
   world-wide belief in the necessity of expiation even among the heathen;
   this uniform conviction of the Hebrews that the sacrifices, which they
   were commanded to offer for sin, were expiatory; this concurrent
   judgment of the Christian Church in all ages and places are, after all,
   mere error and delusion; that such is not the teaching either of the
   natural conscience, or of the Hebrew Scriptures, or of Christ and his
   Apostles, is absolutely incredible. The attempt to overthrow a
   conviction thus general and permanent, is chimerical.

   4. But these arguments from general conviction and assent, although
   perfectly valid in such cases as the present, are not those on which
   the faith of Christians rests. They find the doctrine of expiatory
   sacrifices clearly taught in Scripture; they see that the sin offerings
   under the Old Testament were expiations.

   The Old Testament Sacrifices Expiatory.

   This is plain from the clear meaning of the language used in reference
   to them. They are called sin offerings; trespass offerings, i.e.,
   offerings made by sinners on account of sin. They are said to bear the
   sins of the offender; to make expiation for sin, i.e., to cover it from
   the sight of God's justice; they are declared to be intended to secure
   forgiveness, not through repentance or reformation, these are
   presupposed before the offering is brought, but by shedding of blood,
   by giving soul for soul, life for life. The reason assigned in
   Leviticus xvii. 11, why blood should not be used for food, was that it
   was set apart to make expiation for sin. The Hebrew is lkpr
   tslnphstykm, which the Septuagint renders exilaskesthai peri ton
   psuchon humon; and the Vulgate, "Ut super altare in eo expietis pro
   animabus vestris." The elder Michaelis expresses clearly the meaning of
   the passage and the design of the prohibition, when he says (On
   Leviticus xvii. 10), "Ne sanguis res sanctissima, ad expiationem
   immundorum a Deo ordinata, communi usu profanaretur." The last clause
   of the verse, which in our version is rendered, "For it is the blood
   that maketh an atonement for the soul," is more literally and correctly
   rendered, "For blood by (its) soul or life makes atonement;" or, as
   Bähr and Fairbairn translate it, "The blood atones through the soul."
   The latter writer correctly remarks, [430] "This is the only sense of
   the passage that can be grammatically justified; for the preposition v
   after the verb to atone (kphr) invariably denotes that by which the
   atonement is made; while as invariably the person or object for which
   is denoted by l or l." -- Aben Ezra, quoted by Bähr, had briefly
   indicated the right interpretation. "Sanguis anima, quæ sibi inest,
   expiat." It seems impossible that this and similar express declarations
   of the Old Testament, that sacrifices for sins were expiations, can be
   reconciled with the modern speculation that they were symbolical
   expressions of devotion to God, or means of effecting a reformation of
   the offender, who because of that reformation was restored to God's
   favour.

   The argument, therefore, is that the Scriptures expressly declare that
   these sacrifices were made for the expiation of sin. This idea is
   expressed by the word kpr, to cover, to hide from view, to blot out, to
   expiate. Hence the substantive kphr means that which delivers from
   punishment or evi. It is the common word for an atonement, but it also
   is used for a ransom, because it is rendered to secure deliverance.
   Thus the half shekel required to be paid by every male Israelite as a
   ransom for his soul was called a kphr (in Greek, lutron, or lutra). See
   Exodus xxx. 12-16: "When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel,
   . . . . then shall they give every man a ransom (kphr) for his soul
   unto the Lord, . . . . half a shekel . . . . the rich shall not give
   more, and the poor shall not give less, than half a shekel, when they
   give an offering to the Lord, to make an atonement (lkpr, Gr.
   exilasasthai) for your souls." Here it is impossible to mistake the
   meaning. The half shekel was a ransom, something paid to secure
   deliverance from evil. It was not a symbol of devotion, or an
   expression of penitence, but a payment of a stipulated ransom. That the
   half shekel bore no proportion to the value of a man's life, or the
   blood of a victim to the value of the soul, does not alter the case.
   The idea is the same. The truth taught is that satisfaction must be
   made if sinners are to be saved. The constantly recurring expressions,
   "to make atonement for sin;" "to make atonement on the horns of the
   altar;" "to make atonement for the sins of the people," etc., which are
   correct renderings of the Hebrew phrases which mean "to make
   expiation," as understood from the beginning, cannot be reconciled with
   any other theory of sacrifices than that of vicarious satisfaction. In
   Numbers xxxv. 31, it is said, "Ye shall take no satisfaction (kphr,
   lutra, pretium), for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death;
   but he shall be surely put to death . . . . the land cannot be cleansed
   (ykpr; Septuagint, exilasthesetai; Vulgate, nec aliter expiari potest)
   of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed
   it." Here again there can be no mistake. To cover sin, kpr, is to
   expiate it by a penal satisfaction; that expiation is expressed, as we
   have seen, by kkr, which literally magnifies that which covers, and, in
   such connections, that which covers sin so that it no longer demands
   punishment. When, therefore, a sacrifice is said to cover sin it must
   mean that it expiates it, hides it from the eyes of justice by a
   satisfaction. A kphr is a satisfaction. This satisfaction must be made
   either by the offender or by some one in his stead. In the case of
   murder, if the perpetrator could not be discovered, a victim was to be
   slain in his stead, and thus satisfaction was to be made. The law in
   reference to this case makes the nature and design of sin offerings
   perfectly plain. The elders of the nearest city were commanded to take
   a heifer which had net borne the yoke, and wash their hands over it in
   attestation of their innocence of the blood of the murdered man; the
   priests being present. The heifer was to be slain, and thus expiation
   made for the offence. The words are, vnkpr lhm hdm; Greek, kai
   exilasthesetai autois to haima; Latin, "Et auferetur ab eis reatus
   sanguinis." The removal of guilt by a vicarious death is, therefore,
   the Scriptural idea of a sin offering. It would, however, require a
   volume to present a tithe of the evidence furnished, by the phraseology
   of the Old Testament, that the sin offerings, were regarded as
   expiations for sin; not designed proximately for the reformation of the
   offender, but to secure the remission of the penalty due to his
   transgression. The constantly recurring formula is, Let him offer the
   sacrifice for "sin, and it shall be forgiven him."

   The ceremonies attending the offering of sacrifices for sin show that
   they were understood to be expiatory. (1) The victims were selected
   from the class of clean animals appropriated for the support of the
   life of man. They were to be free from all blemish. This physical
   perfection was typical of the freedom from all sin of Him who was to be
   the substitute for sinners. (2.) The offender was required himself to
   bring the victim to the altar. The service involved an acknowledgment
   on the part of the offerer of his just exposure to punishment for his
   sin. (3.) The hands of the offender were to be laid on the head of the
   victim, to express the ideas of substitution and of transfer of guilt.
   The sin of the offerer was laid upon the head of the victim. (4.) The
   blood of the victim, slain by the priest, was received by him as the
   minister of God, sprinkled on the altar, or, on the great day of
   atonement, carried into the Most Holy place where the symbol of God's
   presence was, and sprinkled on the top of the ark of the covenant;
   showing that the service terminated on God; that it was designed to
   appease his wrath (according to Scriptural phraseology), to satisfy his
   justice, and to open the way for the free forgiveness of sin. The
   significance assigned to these ceremonial acts is that which their
   nature demands; which the Scriptures themselves assign to them; and
   which they must have either to account for the effects which the sin
   offering produced, or to make out the correspondence between the type
   and the antitype which the New Testament declares was intended. These
   symbolical acts admit of no other explanation without doing violence to
   the text, and forcing on antiquity the ideas of modern times, which is
   to substitute our speculations for the authoritative teachings of the
   Scriptures.

   The imposition of the hands of the offender upon the head of the victim
   was essential to this service. The general import of the imposition of
   hands was that of communication. Hence this ceremony was practiced on
   various occasions: (1.) In appointing to office, to signify the
   transfer of authority. (2.) In imparting any spiritual gift or
   blessing. (3.) In substituting one for another, and transferring the
   responsibility of one to another. This was the import of the imposition
   of hands upon the head of the victim. It was substituted in the place
   of the offerer, and the guilt of the one was symbolically transferred
   from the one to the other. Hence the victim was said to bear the sins
   of the people; their sins were said to be laid upon it. In the solemn
   services of the great day of atonement, the import of this rite is
   rendered especially clear It was commanded that two goats should be
   selected, one for a sin-offering and the other for a scape-goat. The
   two constituted one sacrifice, as it was impossible that one could
   signify all that was intended to be taught. Of the scape-goat it is
   said, "Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat,
   and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and
   all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head
   of the goat, . . . . and the goat shall bear upon him all their
   iniquities unto a land not inhabited." This renders it plain that the
   design of the imposition of hands was to signify the transfer of the
   guilt of the offender to the victim. The nature of these offerings is
   still further evident from the fact that the victim was said "to bear
   the sin" of the offender. For example, in Isaiah liii. that the servant
   of the Lord made "his soul an offering for sin," is explained by saying
   that "He bare the sin of many;" that "the chastisement of our peace was
   upon him;" and that "the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."
   These and similar expressions do not admit of being understood of the
   removal of sin by reformation or spiritual renovation. They have a
   fixed and definite meaning throughout the Scriptures. To bear sin is to
   bear the guilt and punishment of sin. It may be admitted that the
   Hebrew word ns' may mean to remove, or bear away, as in 1 Samuel xvii.
   34 and Judges xvi. 31, although even in these cases the ordinary sense
   is admissible. The question, however, is not what a word may mean, but
   what it does mean in a given formula and connection. The word signifies
   to raise, or lift up; to lift up the eyes, the hand, the voice, the
   head, the heart. Then it means to lift up in the sense of bearing, as a
   tree bears its fruit; or in the sense of enduring, as sorrow,
   suffering; or, of bearing as a burden, and especially the burden of
   guilt or punishment. And finally it may have the necessary meaning of
   bearing away, or of removing. If this should be insisted upon in those
   cases where sin is spoken of, then it remains to be asked what is the
   Scriptural sense of removing sin, or bearing sin away. That formula
   means two things; first, to remove the guilt of sin by expiation, and
   secondly, to remove its defilement and power by spiritual renovation.
   One or the other of these ideas is expressed by all the corresponding
   terms used in the Bible; kathairein, to purify, or katharismon poiein;
   hagiazein, to cleanse; and others, as to wash, to blot out, etc. All
   these terms are used to express either sacrificial purification by
   blood, or spiritual purification by the renewing of the Holy Ghost.
   Which, in any particular case, is intended, is determined by the
   context. Therefore, even if the words ns'tsyv; be rendered to remove
   iniquity or sin, the question would still be, Does it mean the removal
   of guilt by expiation; or the removal of pollution by moral renovation?
   In point of fact the words in question always refer to bearing the
   punishment and thus removing the guilt of sin, and never to the removal
   of moral pollution. This is plain, (1.) Because ns' is interchanged
   with svl which never means to remove, but only to sustain, or bear as a
   burden. (2.) Because usage determines the meaning of the phrase and is
   uniform. In Numbers xiv. 34, it is said, "Ye shall bear your iniquities
   forty years." Leviticus v. 1, "If a soul . . . . hear the voice of
   swearing, and is a witness; . . . . if he do not utter it, he shall
   bear his iniquity." Leviticus v. 17, "He is guilty, and shall bear his
   iniquity." Leviticus vii. 18, "The soul that eateth of it shall bear
   his iniquity." Leviticus xvii. 16, "If he wash not . . . . then he
   shall bear his iniquity." Leviticus xix. 8; xx. 17; xxii. 9, "They
   shall keep my ordinance, lest they bear sin for it." Numbers ix. 13, If
   a man forbear to keep the passover, he shall be cut off from the
   people, "he shall bear his sin." See also Numbers xviii. 22, 32.
   Ezekiel iv. 4, 5, it is said to the prophet enduring penance, "So shalt
   thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel." "Thou shalt bear the
   iniquity of the house of Judah forty days." "Lie thou upon thy left
   side . . . . according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie
   upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity." Ezekiel xviii. 20, "The son
   shall not bear the iniquity of the father; neither shall the father
   bear the iniquity of the son." In all these, and in other like cases,
   it is simply impossible that "bearing sin" should mean the removal of
   sin by moral renovation. The expression occurs some forty times in the
   Bible, and always in the sense of bearing the guilt or punishment of
   sin. It is hardly an exception to this remark that there are a few
   cases in which ns' cht't means to pardon; as in Exodus x. 17; xxxii.
   32; xxxiv. 7; Psalms xxxii. 5 (and lxxxv. 3); for pardon is not the
   removal of sin morally, but the lifting up, or removal of its guilt.
   This being the fact, it determines the nature of the sin offerings
   under the law. The victim bore the sin of the offerer, and died in his
   stead. An expiation was thereby effected by the suffering of a
   vicarious punishment. This also determines the nature of the work of
   Christ. If He was an offering for sin, if He saves us from the penalty
   of the law of God, in the same way in which the sin offering saved the
   Israelite from the penalty of the law of Moses, then He bore the guilt
   of our sins and endured the penalty in our stead. We may not approve of
   this method of salvation. The idea of the innocent bearing the sins of
   the guilty and being punished in his stead, may not be agreeable to our
   feelings or to our modes of thinking, but it can hardly be denied that
   such is the representation and doctrine of the Scriptures. Our only
   alternative is to accept that doctrine, or reject the authority of
   Scripture directly or indirectly. That is, either to deny their divine
   origin, or to explain away their explicit statements. In either case
   their plain meaning remains untouched. The German rationalists in
   general take the former of these two courses. They admit that the Bible
   teaches the doctrine of vicarious punishment, but they deny the truth
   of the doctrine because they deny the Bible to be the Word of God.

   The passages in which Christ is represented as a sacrifice for sin, are
   too numerous to be here specially considered. The New Testament, and
   particularly the Epistle to the Hebrews, as before remarked, declares
   and teaches, that the priesthood of the old economy was a type of the
   priesthood of Christ; that the sacrifices of that dispensation were
   types of his sacrifice; that as the blood of bulls and of goats
   purified the flesh, so the blood of Christ cleanses the soul from
   guilt; and that as they were expiations effected by vicarious
   punishment, in their sphere, so was the sacrifice of Christ in the
   infinitely higher sphere to which his work belongs. Such being the
   relation between the Old Economy and the New, the whole sacrificial
   service of the Mosaic institutions, becomes to the Christian an
   extended and irresistible proof and exhibition of the work of Christ as
   an expiation for the sins of the world, and a satisfaction to the
   justice of God.

   The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah.

   It is not however only in the typical services of the old economy that
   this great doctrine was set forth in the Hebrew Scriptures. In the
   fifty-third chapter of Isaiah this doctrine is presented with a
   clearness and copiousness which have extorted assent from the most
   unwilling minds. The prophet in that chapter not only foretells that
   the Messiah was to be a man of sorrows; not only that He was to suffer
   the greatest indignities and be put to a violent death; not only that
   these sufferings were endured for the benefit of others; but that they
   were truly vicarious, i.e., that He suffered, in our stead, the penalty
   which we had incurred, in order to our deliverance. This is done not
   only in those forms of expression which most naturally admit of this
   interpretation, but in others which can, consistently with usage and
   the analogy of Scripture, be understood in no other way. To the former
   class belong such expressions as the following, "He hath borne our
   griefs, and carried our sorrows." Our griefs and our sorrows are the
   griefs and sorrows which we deserved. These Christ bore in the sense of
   enduring, for He carried them as a burden. "He was wounded for our
   transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities." "With his stripes
   we are healed." "For the transgression of my people was he stricken."
   These phrases might be used of the sufferings of a patriot for his
   country, of a philanthropist for his fellow-men, or of a friend for
   those dear to him. That they however are most naturally understood of
   vicarious suffering, can hardly be denied, And that they were intended
   by the Spirit of God to be so understood, is plain by their being
   intermingled with expressions which admit of no other interpretation.
   To this class belong the following clauses: First, "the chastisement
   (or punishment) of our peace was upon him." That is, the punishment by
   which our peace was secured. Of this clause Delitzsch, one of the very
   first of living Hebraists, says, [431] "Der Begriff der poena vicaria
   kann hebräisch gar nicht schärfer ausgedrückt werden als in jenen
   Worten." "The idea of vicarious punishment cannot be more precisely
   expressed in Hebrew than by those words." Secondly, it is said, "The
   Lord hath laid on him (caused to fall, or, cast on him) the iniquity of
   us all." We have already seen that this is the language used in the Old
   Testament to express the transfer of the guilt of the offender to the
   victim slain in his stead. They have a definite Scriptural meaning,
   which cannot be denied in this case without doing open violence to
   admitted rules of interpretation. "If," says Dr. J. Addison Alexander,
   [432] "vicarious suffering can be described in words, it is so
   described in these two verses;" i.e., the verses in which this clause
   occurs. Thirdly, it is said of the Messiah that He made, or was to make
   "his soul an offering for sin." The Hebrew word is 'sm, guilt, debt;
   and then an offering which bears guilt and expiates it. It is the
   common word in the Levitical law for "trespass offering." Michaelis in
   his marginal annotations, remarks on this word (Isaiah liii. 10),
   "Delictum significat, ut notet etiam sacrificium, cui delictum
   imputatum est. Vide passim, inprimis Lev. iv. 3; v. 6, 7, 16; vii. 1,
   etc., etc. . . . . Recte etiam Raschi ad h. 1. Ascham,' inquit,
   significat satisfactionem, seu lytron, quod quis alteri exsolvit, in
   quem deliquit, Gallice, Amande, i.e. mulcta.'" The literal meaning of
   the words, therefore, is, His soul was made a satisfaction for sin.
   Fourthly, it is said, "My righteous servant shall justify many; for he
   shall bear their iniquities." "He was numbered with the transgressors,
   and he bare the sin of many." It has already been shown that to "bear
   sin" never means to sanctify, to effect a moral change by removing the
   power and pollution of sin, but uniformly, in the sacrificial language
   of the Bible, to bear the guilt or penalty for sin.

   Passages of the Hew Testament in which the Work of Christ is set forth
   as Sacrifice.

   In Romans iii. 25, it is said, He was set forth as "a propitiation
   through faith in his blood." The word here used is hilasterion, the
   neuter form of the adjective hilasterios ("propitiatory, expiatory")
   used substantively. It therefore means, as Robinson and other
   lexicographers define it, and as the great body of interpreters explain
   it, "an expiatory sacrifice." The meaning of the word is determined by
   the context and confirmed by parallel passages. The design of setting
   forth Christ as a hilasterion was precisely that which an expiatory
   sacrifice was intended to accomplish, namely, to satisfy justice, that
   God might be just in the forgiveness of sin. And the dikaiosune of God
   manifested in the sacrifice of Christ, was not his benevolence, but
   that form of justice which demands the punishment of sin. "It is a
   fundamental idea of Scripture," says Delitzsch, "that sin is expiated
   (ykpr) by punishment, as murder by the death of the murderer." [433]
   Again, "Where there is shedding of blood and of life, there is violent
   death, and where a violent death is (judicially) inflicted, there there
   is manifestation of vindicatory justice, der strafenden Gerechtigkeit."
   [434] In like manner, in Romans viii. 3, the Apostle says, God sent his
   Son as a sin offering (peri hamartias, which in Hellenistic Greek means
   an offering for sin, Hebrews x. 6), and thereby condemned sin in the
   flesh, that is, in the flesh or person of Christ. And thus it is that
   we are justified, or the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us.
   The same Apostle, in Galatians i. 4, says that Christ "gave himself for
   our sins." That is, He gave Himself unto death as a sacrifice for our
   sins that He might effect our redemption. Such is the plain meaning of
   this passage, if understood according to the established usage of the
   Scripture. "The idea of satisfaction," says Meyer, on this passage,
   "lies not in the force of the preposition [huper] but in the nature of
   the transaction, in dem ganzen Sachverhältniss." In Ephesians v. 2, it
   is said Christ gave "himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God
   for a sweet-smelling savour." His offering was a sacrifice (thusian).
   His blood was shed as an expiation. The question, says Meyer, whether
   Christ is here represented as a sin offering, "is decided not so much
   by huper hemon as by the constant New Testament, and specially the
   Pauline, conception of the death of Christ as a hilasterion." Hebrews
   ix. 14, is especially important and decisive. The Apostle, in the
   context, contrasts the sacrifices of the law with that of Christ. If
   the former, consisting of the blood of irrational animals, nothing but
   the principle of animal life, could avail to effect external or
   ceremonial purification, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who
   was possessed of an eternal spirit, or divine nature, and offered
   Himself without spot unto God, avail to the purification of the
   conscience, i.e., effect the real expiation of sin. The purification
   spoken of in both members of this comparison, is purification from
   guilt, and not spiritual renovation. The Old Testament sacrifices were
   expiatory and not reformatory, and so was the sacrifice of Christ. The
   certain result and ultimate design in both cases was reconciliation to
   the favour and fellowship of God; but the necessary preliminary
   condition of such reconciliation was the expiation of guilt. Again,
   toward the end of the same chapter, the Apostle says that Christ was
   not called upon to "offer himself often, . . . for then must he often
   have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the
   end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
   himself." The offering which He made was Himself. Its design and effect
   were to put away sin; i.e., to put away sin as was done by expiatory
   sacrifices. This is confirmed by what follows. Christ came the first
   time "to bear the sins of many;" He is to come the second time "without
   sin," without that burden which, on his first advent, He had
   voluntarily assumed. He was then burdened with our sins in the sense in
   which the ancient sacrifices bore the sins of the people. He bore their
   guilt; that is, he assumed the responsibility of making satisfaction
   for them to the justice of God. When He comes the second time, it will
   not be as a sin offering, but to consummate the salvation of his
   people. The parallel passage to this is found in 2 Corinthians v. 21:
   "He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin," The design of the
   Apostle is to explain how it is that God is reconciled unto the world,
   not imputing unto men their trespasses. He is free thus to pardon and
   treat as righteous those who in themselves are unrighteous, because for
   us and in our stead He who was without sin was treated as a sinner. The
   sense in which Christ was treated as a sinner is, says Meyer, in loco
   "in dem er nämlich die Todesstrafe erlitt, in that he suffered the
   punishment of death." Here again the idea of the poena vicaria is
   clearly expressed.

   In Hebrews x. 10, we are said to be "sanctified through the offering of
   the body of Jesus Christ once for all." The word hagiazein, here
   rendered sanctify, means to cleanse. Sin is, in Scripture, always
   regarded as a defilement in both its aspects of guilt and moral
   turpitude. As guilt, it is cleansed by blood, by sacrificial expiation,
   as defilement, by the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Which kind of
   purification is intended is determined in each case by the context. If
   the purification is effected by sacrifice, by the blood or death of
   Christ, then the removal of guilt is intended. Hence, all the passages
   in which we are said to be saved, or reconciled unto God, or purified,
   or sanctified by the blood or death of Christ, must be regarded as so
   many assertions that He was an expiatory sacrifice for sin. In this
   passage the meaning of the Apostle cannot be mistaken. He is again
   contrasting the sacrifices of the Old Testament with that of Christ.
   They were ineffectual, the latter was of sovereign efficacy. "Sacrifice
   and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me. Lo, I
   come to do thy will." By which will, i.e., by the execution of this
   purpose of sending his incarnate Son, we are cleansed by the one
   offering up of his body. The ancient sacrifices, he says (verse 11),
   had to be constantly repeated. "But this man, after he had offered one
   sacrifice for sins, forever sat down on the right hand of God." "For by
   one offering he hath perfected forever (teteleioken, brought to the end
   contemplated by a sacrifice) them that are sanctified," i.e., cleansed
   from guilt. That sacrificial cleansing is here intended is plain, for
   the effect of it is pardon. "Their sins and iniquities will I remember
   no more. Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for
   sin." And in verse 26, we are taught that for those who reject the
   sacrifice of Christ there remains "no more sacrifice for sins; but a
   certain fearful looking for of judgment." It was pardon, therefore,
   founded upon the expiation of sin, that was secured by the sacrifice of
   Christ. And this is declared to be the only possible means by which our
   guilt can be removed, or the justice of God satisfied. It is to be
   always borne in mind, however, that the end of expiation is
   reconciliation with God, and that reconciliation with God involves or
   secures conformity to his image and intimate fellowship with Him. The
   ultimate design of the work of Christ is, therefore, declared to be to
   "bring us to God;" to "purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of
   good works." The removal of guilt by expiation is, however, constantly
   set forth as the absolutely essential preliminary to this inward
   subjective reconciliation with God. This is a necessity, as the
   Scriptures teach, arising out of the nature of God as a holy and just
   Being.

   What Paul teaches so abundantly of the sacrificial death of Christ is
   taught by the Apostle John (First Epistle, ii. 2). Jesus Christ "is the
   propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins
   of the whole world." The word here used is hilasmos, propitiation,
   expiation; from "hilaskomai, to reconcile one's self to any one by
   expiation, to appease, to propitiate." And in chapter iv. 10, it is
   said, "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
   sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." The inconsistency
   between love, and expiation or satisfaction for sin, which modern
   writers so much insist upon, was not perceived by men who spoke as they
   were moved by the Holy Ghost. In chapter i. 7, this same Apostle says,
   "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." To
   cleanse, katharizein, kathairein, katharismon poiein, hagiazein, louein
   (Revelation i. 5) are established sacrificial terms to express the
   removal of the guilt of sin by expiation.

   The above are only a part of the passages in which our blessed Lord is,
   in the New Testament, set forth as a sin offering, in the Scriptural
   sense of that term. What is thus taught is taught by other forms of
   expression which imply the expiatory character of his death, or his
   priestly function of making satisfaction for sin. Thus in Hebrews ix.
   28, it is said, "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many."
   This is a quotation from Isaiah liii. 12, where the same word is used
   in the Septuagint that the Apostle here employs. The meaning of the
   Scriptural phrase "to bear sin" has already been sufficiently
   discussed. Robinson, who will not be suspected of theological bias,
   defines, in his "Greek Lexicon," the word in question (anaphero) in the
   formula anenenkein tas hamartias hemon, "to bear up our sins, to take
   upon oneself and bear our sins, i.e., to bear the penalty of sin, to
   make expiation for sin." This is the sense in which the sacrifices of
   old were said to bear the sins of the people, and in which it was said
   that one man, in God's dealings with his theocratic people, should not
   bear the sins of another. Delitzsch, on Hebrews ix. 28, says, [435]
   "This assumption of the sufferings which the sins of men had caused,
   into fellowship with whom He had entered, this bearing as a substitute
   the punishment of sins not his own, this expiatory suffering for the
   sins of others, is precisely what anenenkein amartias pollon in this
   passage means, and is the sense intended in the Italic and Vulgate
   versions; ad multorum exhaurienda peccata.'" He quotes with approbation
   the comment of Seb. Schmidt: "Quia mors in hominibus poena est,
   Christus oblatus est moriendo, ut morte sua portaret omnium hominum
   peccata h. e. omnes peccatorum poenas exæquaret satisfaciendo." [436]

   Nearly the same language is used by the Apostle Peter (First Epistle,
   ii. 24). "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree."
   Whether anaphero here means sufferre, to bear or endure, or sursum
   ferre, to carry up, the sense is the same. Only the figure is altered.
   Christ bore the guilt of our sins. This is the burden which He
   sustained; or which He carried up with Him when He ascended the cross.
   In the parallel passage in Isaiah liii. 11, evidently in the Apostle's
   mind, the words are in the Septuagint, tas hamartias auton autos
   anoisei, where in Hebrew ysbl is used, which appears decisive in favour
   of the rendering in our version, He "bare our sins," as svl always
   means to bear as a burden. As to the doctrinal meaning of this passage
   commentators of almost all classes agree. Wahl, in his "Lexicon," on
   the word anaphero referring to this place, makes it mean "peccatorum
   poenam et reatum ultro in se suscipit." Bretschneider (Rationalist)
   thus defines the word, "attollo et mihi impono, i.e., impositum mihi
   porto, tropice de poenis: poenam susceptam luo; Heb. ix. 28. . . . .
   Vide etiam Num. xiv. 33, anoisousi ten porneian humon, poena vestræ
   perfidiæ illis persolvenda est." Wegscheider, the chief of the
   systematic theologians among the Rationalists, [437] referring to this
   passage, 1 Peter ii. 24, says that almost all the New Testament writers
   regard the death of Christ "tanquam [mortem] expiatoriam, eandemque
   vicariam, velut poenam peccatorum hominum omnium ab ipso susceptam,
   etc." Calvin does not go beyond these Rationalists; his comment is,
   "Sicuti sub lege peccator, ut reatu solveretur, victimam substituebat
   suo loco: ita Christus maledictionem peccatis nostris debitam in se
   suscepit, ut ea coram Deo expiaret. Hoc beneficium sophistæ in suis
   scholis, quantum possunt, obscurant."

   Another form of expression used by the sacred writers clearly teaches
   the expiatory character of Christ's work. Under the old economy, the
   great function of the high priest was to make expiation for sin, and
   thereby restore the people to the favour of God, and secure for them
   the blessings of the covenant under which they lived. All this was
   typical of Christ and of his work. He came to save his people from
   their sins, to restore them to the favour of God, and to secure for
   them the enjoyment of the blessings of the new and better covenant of
   which He is the mediator. He, therefore, assumed our nature in order
   that He might die, and by death effect our reconciliation with God. For
   as He did not undertake the redemption of angels, but the redemption of
   man, it was the nature of man that He assumed. He was made in all
   things like unto his brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful
   high priest in things pertaining to God, eis to hilaskesthai tas
   hamartias tou laou, to make expiation for the sins of the people. The
   word hilaskomai (or exilaskomai) is the technical word in Hellenistic
   Greek to express the idea of expiation. In common Greek, the word means
   propitium reddere, and in the passive form it is used in this sense in
   the Septuagint as in Psalm lxxix. 9. But in the middle and deponent
   form followed by the word sins in the accusative, it always expresses
   the act by which that in sin is removed which hinders God from being
   propitious. This is the precise idea of expiation. Hence the word is so
   constantly rendered in the Vulgate by expiare, and is in Greek the
   rendering of kpr. Hence Christ as He who renders God propitious to us
   is called the hilasmos peri ton hamartion hemon in 1 John ii. 2, and
   hilasterion in Romans iii. 25.

   Still another form in which the doctrine of expiation is taught is
   found in those passages which refer our reconciliation to God to the
   death of Christ. The Greek word used to express this idea in Romans v.
   10; 2 Corinthians v. 18, 19, 20, is katallassein, to exchange, or to
   change the relation of one person to another, from enmity to
   friendship. In Ephesians ii. 16; Colossians i. 20, 21, the word used is
   apokatallattein, only an intensive form, to reconcile fully. When two
   parties are at enmity a reconciliation may be effected by a change in
   either or in both. When, therefore, it is said that we are reconciled
   to God, it only means that peace is restored between Him and us.
   Whether this is effected by our enmity towards Him being removed, or by
   his justice in regard to us being satisfied, or whether both ideas are
   in any case included, depends on the context where the word occurs, and
   on the analogy of Scripture. In the chief passage, Romans v. 10, the
   obvious meaning is that the reconciliation is effected by God's justice
   being satisfied, so that He can be favourable to us in consistency with
   his own nature. This is plain, --

   1. Because the means by which the reconciliation is effected is "the
   death of his Son." The design of sacrificial death is expiation. It
   would be to do violence to all Scriptural usage to make the proximate
   design and effect of a sacrifice the removal of the sinner's enmity to
   God.

   2. "Being reconciled by the death of his Son," in verse 10, is parallel
   to the clause "being justified by his blood" in verse 9. The one is
   exchanged for the other, as different forms of expressing the same
   idea. But justification is not sanctification. It does not express a
   subjective change in the sinner. And, therefore, the reconciliation
   here spoken of cannot express any such change.

   3. Those reconciled are declared to be echthroi, in the passive sense
   of the word, "those who are the objects of God's just displeasure."
   They are guilty. Justice demands their punishment. The death of Christ,
   as satisfying justice, reconciles God to us; effects peace, so that we
   can be received into favour.

   4. What is here taught is explained by all those passages which teach
   the method by which the reconciliation of God and man is effected,
   namely, by the expiation of sin. Meyer, on this passage, says,
   "katellagemen and katallagentes must of necessity be understood
   passively: ausgesöhnt mit Gott, atoned for in the sight of God, so that
   he no longer is hostile to us; he has said aside his anger, and we are
   made partakers of his grace and favour." The same doctrine is taught in
   Ephesians ii. 16. "That he might reconcile both unto God in one body by
   the cross." Here again the reconciliation of God with man is effected
   by the cross or death of Christ, which, removing the necessity for the
   punishment of sinners, renders it possible for God to manifest towards
   them his love. The change is not in man, but, humanly speaking, in God;
   a change from the purpose to punish to a purpose to pardon and save.
   There is, so to speak, a reconciliation of God's justice and of his
   love effected by Christ's bearing the penalty in our stead. In 2
   Corinthians v. 18, it is said, God "hath reconciled us to himself by
   Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation."
   This does not mean that God changed our heart, and made us love Him,
   and appointed the Apostle to announce that fact. It can only mean that
   through Christ, through what He did and suffered for us, peace is
   restored between God and man, who is able and willing to be gracious.
   This is the gospel which Paul was commissioned to announce, namely, as
   follows in the next verse, God is bringing about peace; He was in
   Christ effecting this peace, and now is ready to forgive sin, i.e., not
   to impute unto men their trespasses; and therefore the Apostle urges
   his readers to embrace this offer of mercy, to be reconciled unto God;
   i.e., to accept his overture of reconciliation. For it has a sure
   foundation. It rests on the substitution and vicarious death of Christ.
   He was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God
   in Him. It is impossible, therefore, that the reconciliation of which
   the Apostles speak as effected by the cross or death of Christ, should,
   in its primary and main aspect, be a subjective change in us from
   enmity to the love of God. It is such a reconciliation as makes God our
   friend; a reconciliation which enables Him to pardon and save sinners,
   and which they are called upon most gratefully to embrace.

   It is clearly, therefore, the doctrine of the New Testament, that Jesus
   Christ our Lord saves his people by acting for them the part of a
   priest. For this office He had all the requisite qualifications; He was
   thereto duly appointed, and He performed all its functions. He was an
   expiatory sacrifice for the sins of men. He is not only repeatedly
   declared to be a sin offering in the Old Testament sense of that term;
   but He is said to have borne our sins; to have made expiation for the
   sins of the people; and to have reconciled us, who were the just
   objects of the divine wrath, to God by his death, by his cross, by the
   sacrifice of Himself. These representations are so frequent; they are
   so formally stated, so illustrated, and so applied, as to render them
   characteristic. They constitute the essential element of the Scriptural
   doctrine concerning the method of salvation.

   Christ our Redeemer.

   There is a third class of passages equally numerous and equally
   important. Christ is not only set forth as a Priest and as a sacrifice,
   but also as a Redeemer, and his work as a Redemption. Redemption is
   deliverance from evil by the payment of a ransom. This idea is
   expressed by the words apolutrosis, from lutron, and the verbs lutros,
   agorazo (to purchase), and exagorazo (to buy from, or deliver out of
   the possession or power of any one by purchase). The price or ransom
   paid for our redemption is always said to be Christ himself, his blood,
   his death. As the evils consequent on our apostasy from God are
   manifold, Christ's work as a Redeemer is presented in manifold
   relations in the word of God.

   Redemption from the Penalty of the Law.

   1. The first and most obvious consequence of sin, is subjection to the
   penalty of the law. The wages of sin is death. Every sin of necessity
   subjects the sinner to the wrath and curse of God. The first step,
   therefore, in the salvation of sinners, is their redemption from that
   curse. Until this is done they are of necessity separated from God. But
   alienation from Him of necessity involves both misery and subjection to
   the power of sin. So long as men are under the curse, they are cut off
   from the only source of holiness and life. Such is the doctrine taught
   throughout the Bible, and elaborately in Romans, chapters vi. and vii.
   In effecting the salvation of his people, Christ "redeemed them from
   the curse of the law," not by a mere act of sovereignty, or power; not
   by moral influence restoring them to virtue, but by being "made a curse
   for them." No language can be plainer than this. The curse is the
   penalty of the law. We were subject to that penalty. Christ has
   redeemed us from that subjection by being made a curse for us.
   (Galatians iii. 13.) That the infinitely exalted and holy Son of God
   should be "accursed" (epikataratos), is so awful an idea, that the
   Apostle justifies the use of such language by quoting the declaration
   of Scripture, "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree." Suffering,
   and especially the suffering of death, judicially inflicted on account
   of sin, is penal. Those who thus suffer bear the curse or penalty of
   the law. The sufferings of Christ, and especially his death upon the
   cross, were neither calamities, nor chastisements designed for his own
   good, nor symbolical or didactic exhibitions, designed to illustrate
   and enforce truth, and exert a moral influence on others; these are all
   subordinate and collateral ends. Nor were they the mere natural
   consequences of his becoming a man and subjecting Himself to the common
   lot of humanity. They were divine inflictions. It pleased the Lord to
   bruise Him. He was smitten of God and afflicted. These sufferings were
   declared to be on account of sin, not his own, but ours. He bore our
   sins. The chastisement of our peace was on Him. And they were designed
   as an expiation, or for the satisfaction of justice. They had,
   therefore, all the elements of punishment, and consequently it was in a
   strict and proper sense that He was made a curse for us. All this is
   included in what the Apostle teaches in this passage (Gal. iii. 13),
   and its immediate context.

   Redemption from the Law.

   2. Nearly allied to this mode of representation are those passages in
   which Christ is said to have delivered us from the law. Redemption from
   bondage to the law includes not only deliverance from its penalty, but
   also from the obligation to satisfy its demands. This is the
   fundamental idea of Paul's doctrine of justification. The law demands,
   and from the nature of God, must demand perfect obedience. It says, Do
   this and live; and, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
   things which are written in the book of the law to do them." No man
   since the fall is able to fulfil these demands, yet He must fulfil them
   or perish. The only possible method, according to the Scriptures, by
   which men can be saved, is that they should be delivered from this
   obligation of perfect obedience. This, the Apostle teaches, has been
   effected by Christ. He was "made under the law to redeem them that were
   under the law." (Gal. iv. 4, 5.) Therefore, in Romans vi. 14, he says
   to believers, "Ye are not under the law, but under grace." And this
   redemption from the law in Romans vii. 4, is said to be "by the body of
   Christ." Hence we are justified not by our own obedience, but "by the
   obedience" of Christ. (Rom. v. 18, 19.) Redemption in this case is not
   mere deliverance, but a true redemption, i. e., a deliverance effected
   by satisfying all the just claims which are against us. The Apostle
   says, in Galatians iv. 5, that we are thus redeemed from the law, in
   order "that we might receive the adoption of sons"; that is, be
   introduced into the state and relation of sons to God. Subjection to
   the law, in our case, was a state of bondage. Those under the law are,
   therefore, called slaves, douloi. From this state of bondage they are
   redeemed, and introduced into the liberty of the sons of God. This
   redemption includes freedom from a slavish spirit, which is supplanted
   by a spirit of adoption, filling the heart with reverence, love, and
   confidence in God as our reconciled Father.

   Redemption from the Power of Sin.

   3. As deliverance from the curse of the law secures restoration to the
   favour of God, and as the love of God is the life of the soul, and
   restores us to his image, therefore in redeeming us from the curse of
   the law, Christ redeems us also from the power of sin. "Whosoever
   committeth sin," saith our Lord, "is the servant (the slave) of sin."
   This is a bondage from which no man can deliver himself. To effect this
   deliverance was the great object of the mission of Christ. He gave
   Himself that He might purify unto Himself a peculiar people zealous of
   good works. He died, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us
   unto God. He loved the Church and gave Himself for it, that He might
   present it unto Himself a glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle or
   any such thing. This deliverance from sin is a true redemption. A
   deliverance effected by a ransom, or satisfaction to justice, was the
   necessary condition of restoration to the favour of God; and
   restoration to his favour was the necessary condition of holiness.
   Therefore, it is said, Galatians i. 8, Christ "gave Himself for our
   sins, that He might deliver us (exeletai) from this present evil
   world." Titus ii. 14, "Who gave himself for us that he might redeem us
   from all iniquity." 1 Peter i. 18, 19, "Ye were not redeemed with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
   received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of
   Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot." Deliverance by
   sacrifice was deliverance by ransom. Therefore, here as elsewhere, the
   two modes of statement are combined. Thus our Lord in Matthew xx. 28,
   Mark x. 45, says, "The Son of Man came . . . . to give his life a
   ransom for many (anti, not merely huper, pollon)." The idea of
   substitution cannot be more definitely expressed. In these passages our
   deliverance is said to be effected by a ransom. In Matthew xxvi. 28,
   our Lord says that his blood was "shed for many for the remission of
   sins." Here his death is presented in the light of a sacrifice. The two
   modes of deliverance are therefore identical. A ransom was a
   satisfaction to justice, and a sacrifice is a satisfaction to justice.

   Redemption from the Power of Satan.

   4. The Scriptures teach that Christ redeems us from the power of Satan.
   Satan is said to be the prince and god of this world. His kingdom is
   the kingdom of darkness, in which all men, since Adam, are born, and in
   which they remain, until translated into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
   They are his subjects "taken captive by him at his will." (2 Tim. ii.
   26.) The first promise was that the seed of the woman should bruise the
   serpent's head. Christ came to destroy the works of the devil; to cast
   him down from his place of usurped power, to deliver those who are
   subject to his dominion. (2 Cor. iv. 4; Col. ii. 16.) The fact of this
   redemption of his people from the power of Satan, and the mode of its
   accomplishment, are clearly stated in Hebrews ii. 15. The eternal Son
   of God, who in the first chapter of that epistle, is proved to be God,
   the object of the worship of angels, the creator of heaven and earth,
   eternal and immutable, in verse 14 of the second chapter, is said to
   have become man, in order "that through death He might destroy him that
   had the power of death, and deliver them who through fear of death were
   all their lifetime subject to bondage." It is here taught, (1.) That
   men are in a state of bondage through fear of the wrath of God on
   account of sin. (2.) That in this state they are in subjection to Satan
   who has the power of death over them; i.e., the ability and opportunity
   of inflicting on them the sufferings due to them as sinners. (3.) That
   from this state of bondage and of subjection to the power of Satan,
   they are delivered by the death of Christ. His death, by satisfying the
   justice of God, frees them from the penalty of the law; and freedom
   from the curse of the law involves freedom from the power of Satan to
   inflict its penalty. "The strength of sin is the law." (1 Cor. xv. 56.)
   What satisfies the law deprives sin of the power to subject us to the
   wrath of God. And thus redemption from the law, is redemption from the
   curse, and consequently redemption from the power of Satan. This
   Scriptural representation took such hold of the imagination of many of
   the early fathers, that they dwelt upon it, almost to the exclusion of
   other and more important aspects of the work of Christ. They dallied
   with it and wrought it out into many fanciful theories. These theories
   have passed away; the Scriptural truth which underlay them, remains.
   Christ is our Redeemer from the power of Satan, as well as from the
   curse of the law, and from the dominion of sin. And if a Redeemer, the
   deliverance which He effected was by means of a ransom. Hence He is
   often said to have purchased his people. They are his because He bought
   them. "Know ye not that . . . . ye are not your own?" says the Apostle,
   "For ye are bought with a price." (1 Cor. vi. 20.) God, in Acts xx. 28,
   is said to have purchased the Church "with his own blood." "Ye were
   redeemed (delivered by purchase) . . . . with the precious blood of
   Christ." (1 Pet. i. 18, 19.) "Thou art worthy . . . . for thou has
   purchased us (hegorasas) for God by thy blood." (Rev. v. 9.)

   Final Redemption from all Evil.

   5. Christ redeems us not only from the curse of the law, from the law
   itself as a covenant of works, from the power of sin, and from the
   dominion of Satan, but also from all evil. This evil is the consequence
   of the curse of the law, and being redeemed from that we are delivered
   from all evil. Hence the word redemption is often used for the sum of
   all the benefits of Christ's work, or for the consummation of the great
   scheme of salvation. Thus our Lord says, Luke xxi. 28, that when the
   Son of Man shall appear in his glory, then his disciples may be sure
   that their "redemption draweth nigh." They are sealed unto the day of
   redemption. (Eph. i. 14.) Christ has "obtained eternal redemption."
   (Heb. ix. 12.) Believers are represented as waiting for their
   redemption. (Rom. viii. 23.)

   It is therefore the plain doctrine of Scripture that, as before said,
   Christ saves us neither by the mere exercise of power, nor by his
   doctrine, nor by his example, nor by the moral influence which He
   exerted, nor by any subjective influence on his people, whether natural
   or mystical, but as a satisfaction to divine justice, as an expiation
   for sin and as a ransom from the curse and authority of the law, thus
   reconciling us to God, by making it consistent with his perfections to
   exercise mercy toward sinners, and then renewing them after his own
   image, and finally exalting them to all the dignity, excellence, and
   blessedness of the sons of God.

   Argument from Related Doctrines.

   All the doctrines of grace are intimately connected. They stand in such
   relation to each other, that one of necessity supposes the truth of the
   others. The common Church doctrine of the satisfaction of Christ,
   therefore, is not an isolated doctrine. It is assumed in all that the
   Scriptures teach of the relation between Christ and his people; of the
   condition on which our interest in his redemption is suspended; and of
   the nature of the benefits of that redemption.

   1. No doctrine of the Bible, relating to the plan of salvation, is more
   plainly taught or more wide reaching than that which concerns the union
   between Christ and his people. That union in one aspect, was from
   eternity, we were in Him before the foundation of the world; given to
   Him of the Father, to redeem from the estate of sin and misery, into
   which it was foreseen our race would by transgression fall. It was for
   the accomplishment of this purpose of mercy that He assumed our nature,
   was born of a woman, and did and suffered all that He was called upon
   to do and to endure in working out our salvation. He did not,
   therefore, come into the world for Himself. It was not to work out a
   righteousness of his own to entitle Him to the exaltation and power
   which in our nature He now enjoys. In virtue of the Godhead of his
   personality, He was of necessity infinitely exalted above all
   creatures. He came for us. He came as a representative. He came in the
   same relation to his people, which Adam, in the original covenant, bore
   to the whole race. He came to take their place; to be their substitute,
   to do for them, and in their name, what they could not do for
   themselves. All He did, therefore, was vicarious; his obedience and his
   sufferings. The parallel between Adam and Christ, the two great
   representatives of man, the two federal heads, the one of all his
   natural descendants, the other of all given Him by the Father, is
   carried out into its details in Romans v. 12-21. It is assumed or
   implied, however, everywhere else in the sacred volume. What Adam did,
   in his federal capacity, was in law and justice regarded as done by all
   whom he represented. And so all that Christ did and suffered as a
   federal head, was in law and justice done or suffered by his people.
   Therefore, as we were condemned for the disobedience of Adam, so we are
   justified for the obedience of Christ. As in Adam all died, so in
   Christ are all made alive. Hence Christ's death is said to be our
   death, and we are said to rise with Him, to live with Him, and to be
   exalted, in our measure, in his exaltation. He is the head and we are
   the body. The acts of the head, are the acts of the whole mystical
   person. The ideas, therefore, of legal substitution, of vicarious
   obedience and punishment, of the satisfaction of justice by one for
   all, underlie and pervade the whole scheme of redemption. They can no
   more be separated from that scheme than the warp can be separated from
   the woof without destroying the whole texture.

   2. In like manner these same truths are implied in what sinners are
   required to do in order to become the subjects of the redemption of
   Christ. It is not enough that we should receive his doctrines; or
   endeavour to regulate our lives by his moral precepts; or that we
   confide in his protection, or submit to his control as one into whose
   hands all power in heaven and earth has been committed. It is not
   enough that we should open our hearts to all the influences for good
   which flow from his person or his work. We must trust in Him. We must
   renounce our own righteousness, and confide in his for our acceptance
   with God. We must give up the idea that we can satisfy the demands of
   God's justice and law, by anything we can do, suffer, or experience,
   and rely exclusively on what He, as our representative, substitute, and
   surety, has done and suffered in our stead. This is what the gospel
   demands. And this, the world over, is precisely what every true
   believer, no matter what his theological theories may be, actually
   does. But this act of self-renunciation and of faith in Christ as the
   ground of our forgiveness and acceptance with God, supposes Him to be
   our substitute, who has satisfied all the demands of law and justice in
   our stead.

   3. If we turn to the Scriptural account of the benefits which we
   receive from Christ, we find that this view of the nature of his work,
   is therein necessarily implied. We are justified through Him. He is our
   righteousness. We are made the righteousness of God in Him. But
   justification is not a subjective work. It is not sanctification. It is
   not a change wrought in us either naturally or supernaturally. It is
   not the mere executive act of a sovereign, suspending the action of the
   law, or granting pardon to the guilty. It is the opposite of
   condemnation. It is a declaration that the claims of justice are
   satisfied. This is the uniform meaning of the Hebrew and Greek words
   employed in Scripture, and of the corresponding words in all other
   languages, as far as those languages are cultivated to express what
   passes in the consciousness of men. But if God, in justifying sinners,
   declares that with regard to them the claims of justice are satisfied,
   it confessedly is not on the ground that the sinner himself has made
   that satisfaction, but that Christ has made it in his behalf.

   The doctrine of sanctification also, as presented in the Scriptures, is
   founded on the substitution of Christ. Sanctification is not a work of
   nature, but a work of grace. It is a transformation of character
   effected not by moral influences, but supernaturally by the Holy
   Spirit; although on that account only the more rationally. The first
   step in the process is deliverance from the curse of the law by the
   body, or death of Christ. Then God being reconciled, He admits us into
   fellowship with Himself. But as the sinner is only imperfectly
   sanctified, he is still in his state and acts far from being in himself
   an object of the divine complacency. It is only as united to Christ and
   represented by Him, that he enjoys the continuance of the divine
   favour, which is his life, and constantly receives from Him the gift of
   the Holy Spirit. So that the life that the believer lives, is Christ
   living in him. Thus in the whole process of salvation the ideas of
   substitution, of representation, of Christ's being and doing for us,
   all that we are required to be and to do, are of necessity involved.
   And even to the last we are saved only in Him. It is in virtue of this
   union that believers are raised from the dead, admitted into heaven,
   and receive the crown of eternal life. It is not for what they have
   done, nor for what they have been made, but solely for what has been
   done in their stead that they are made partakers of his life, and,
   ultimately, of his glory.

   Argument from the Religious Experience of Believers.

   By the religious experience of Christians is meant those states and
   acts of the mind produced by "the things of the Spirit," or by the
   truths of God's Word as revealed and applied by the Holy Ghost. We are
   clearly taught in Scripture that the truth is not only objectively
   presented in the Word, but that it is the gracious office of the
   Spirit, as a teacher and guide, to lead the people of God properly to
   understand the truths thus outwardly revealed, and to cause them to
   produce their proper effect on the reason, the feelings, the
   conscience, and the life. What the Holy Spirit thus leads the people of
   God to believe must be true. No man however is authorized to appeal to
   his own inward experience as a test of truth for others. His experience
   may be, and in most cases is, determined more or less by his peculiar
   training, his own modes of thinking, and diverse other modifying
   influences. But this does not destroy the value of religious experience
   as a guide to the knowledge of the truth. It has an authority second
   only to that of the Word of God. One great source of error in theology
   has always been the neglect of this inward guide. Men have formed their
   opinions, or framed their doctrines on philosophical principles, or
   moral axioms, and thus have been led to adopt conclusions which
   contradict the inward teachings of the Spirit, and even their own
   religious consciousness. The only question is, How can we distinguish
   the human from the divine? How can we determine what in our experience
   is due to the teaching of the Spirit, and what to other influences? The
   answer to these questions is, (1.) That what is conformed to the
   infallible standard in the Scriptures, is genuine, and what is not thus
   conformed is spurious. The Bible contains not only the truths
   themselves, but a record of the effects produced on the mind when they
   are applied by the Holy Spirit. (2.) Another test is universality. What
   all true Christians experience must be referred to a cause common to
   all. It cannot be accounted for by what is peculiar to individuals or
   to denominations. (3.) A subordinate test, but one of great value to
   the individual, is to be found in the nature of the experience itself,
   and its effects upon the heart and life. A religious experience which
   makes a man self-complacent, self-righteous, proud, censorious, and
   persecuting, is certainly not to be referred to the Spirit of holiness
   and love. But if a man's experience renders him humble, meek, contrite,
   forgiving, and long-suffering; if it leads him to believe all things
   and hope all things; if it renders him spiritually and heavenly minded;
   if it makes it Christ for him to live; in short, if it produces the
   same effect on him that the truth produced on the prophets and
   apostles, there can be little doubt that it is due to the teaching and
   influence of the Holy Ghost.

   It is certainly an unanswerable argument in favour of the divinity of
   Christ, for example, as a doctrine of the Bible, that all true
   Christians look up to Christ as God; that they render Him the
   adoration, the love, the confidence, the submission, and the devotion
   which are due to God alone, and which the apprehension of divine
   perfection only can produce. It is certainly a proof that the
   Scriptures teach that man is a fallen being, that he is guilty and
   defiled by sin, that he is utterly unable to free himself from the
   burden and power of sin, that he is dependent on the grace of God and
   the power of the Spirit, if these truths are inwrought into the
   experience of all true believers. In like manner, if all Christians
   trust in Christ for their salvation; if they look to Him as their
   substitute, obeying and suffering in their stead, bearing their sins,
   sustaining the curse of the law in their place; if they regard Him as
   the expiatory sacrifice to take away their guilt and satisfy the
   justice of God in their behalf; if they thank and bless Him for having
   given Himself as a ransom for their redemption from the penalty and
   obligation of the law as prescribing the condition of salvation, and
   from the dominion of Satan, from the power of sin and from all its evil
   consequences; then, beyond doubt, these are the truths of God, revealed
   by the Spirit in the word, and taught by the Spirit to all who submit
   to his guidance. That such is the experience of true believers in
   relation to the work of Christ, is plain, (1.) Because this is the form
   and manner in which holy men of old whose experience is recorded in the
   Scriptures, expressed their relation to Christ and their obligations to
   Him. He was to them an expiatory sacrifice; a ransom; an hilasmos or
   propitiation. They regarded Him as made a curse for them; as bearing
   their punishment, or "the chastisement of their peace." They received
   the "sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ," as the only means of
   being cleansed from the guilt of their sins, and of restoration to the
   favour of God and holiness of heart and life. This was undoubtedly
   their experience as it is recorded in the Bible. (2.) In the second
   place, from the times of the Apostle to the present day, the people of
   God have had the same inward convictions and feelings. This is clear
   from their confessions of faith, from their liturgies and prayers, from
   their hymns, and from all the records of their inward religious life.
   Let any one look over the hymns of the Latin Church, of the Moravians,
   the Lutherans, the Reformed, of Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists,
   Methodists, Independents, and Congregationalists, and see what truths
   on this subject constituted and now constitute the, food and atmosphere
   of their religious life: --

   "Jesus, my God, Thy blood alone hath power sufficient to atone."

   "To the dear fountain of Thy blood, incarnate God, I fly"

   "My soul looks back to see the burdens Thou didst bear, When hanging on
   the cursed tree, and hopes her sins were there."


   "Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld,

   Der Welt unnd ihren Kinder."


   "Geh hin, nimm dich der Sünder an,

   Die auch kein Engel retten kann

   Von meines Zornes Ruthen!

   Die Straf' ist schwer, der Zorn ist gross;

   Du kannst und sollst sie machen los

   Durch Sterben und durch Bluten."

   Does any Christian object to such hymns? Do they not express his inmost
   religious convictions? If they do not agree with the speculations of
   his understanding, do they not express the feelings of his heart and
   the necessities of his fallen nature? The speculations of the
   understanding are what man teaches; the truths which call forth these
   feelings of the heart are what the Holy Ghost teaches.

   This argument may be presented in another light. It may be shown that
   no other theory of the work of Christ does correspond with the inward
   experience of God's people. The theory that the work of Christ was
   didactic; that it was exemplary; that its proximate design was to
   produce a subjective change in the sinner or a moral impression on the
   minds of all intelligent creatures; these and other theories, contrary
   to the common Church doctrine, fail especially in two points. First,
   they do not account for the intimate personal relation between Christ
   and the believer which is everywhere recognized in Scripture, and which
   is so precious in the view of all true Christians. Secondly, they make
   no provision for the expiation of sin, or for satisfying the demands of
   a guilty conscience, which mere pardon never can appease.

   Throughout the New Testament, Christ is represented not only as the
   object of worship and of supreme love and devotion, but also as being
   to his people the immediate and constant source of life and of all
   good. Not Christ as God, but Christ as our Saviour. He is the head, we
   are his members. He is the vine, we are the branches. It is not we that
   live, but Christ that liveth in us. He is made unto us wisdom,
   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. His blood cleanses us
   from all sins. He redeemed us from the curse of the law by being made a
   curse for us. He bore our sins in his own body on the tree. He is our
   great High Priest who ever lives to make intercession for us. It would
   be easy to show from the records of the religious life of the Church
   that believers have ever regarded Christ in the light in which He is
   here presented. The argument is that these representations are not
   consistent with any moral or governmental theory of the atonement.

   There are two hymns which, perhaps, beyond all others, are dear to the
   hearts of all Christians who speak the English language. The one
   written by Charles Wesley, an Arminian; the other by Toplady, a
   Calvinist. It is hard to see what meaning can be attached to these
   hymns by those who hold that Christ died simply to teach us something,
   or to make a moral impression on us or others. How can they say, --


   "Jesus, lover of my soul,

   Let me to Thy bosom fly"?

   Why should they fly to Him if He be only a teacher or moral reformer?
   What do they mean when they say, --

   "Hide me, O my Saviour hide"?

   Hide from what? Not from the vindicatory justice of God, for they admit
   no such attribute.

   "Other refuge have I none;"

   refuge from what?

   "All my trust on Thee is laid."

   For what do we trust Him? According to their theory He is not the
   ground of our confidence. It is not for his righteousness, but For our
   own that we are to be accepted by God. It would seem that those only
   who hold the common Church doctrine can say, --

   "Thou, O Christ, art all I need."

   All I need as a creature, as a sinner, as guilty, as polluted, as
   miserable and helpless; all I need for time or for eternity. So of
   Toplady's precious hymn, --

   "Rock of ages, cleft for me;"

   for me personally and individually; as Paul said he lived "by faith of
   the Son of God who loved me, and gave himself for me."


   "Let the water and the blood,

   From Thy wounded side that flowed;

   Be of sin the double cure;

   Cleanse me from its guilt and power."

   How can such language be used by those who deny the necessity of
   expiation; who hold that guilt need not be washed away, that all that
   is necessary is that we should be made morally good? No one can say, --


   "Nothing in my hand I bring,

   Simply to Thy cross I cling,"

   who does not believe that Christ "bore our sins in his own body on the
   tree."

   It is a historical fact that where false theories of the atonement
   prevail, Christ and his work are put in the background. We hear from
   the pulpits much about God as a moral governor; much about the law and
   obligation, and of the duty of submission; but little about Christ, of
   the duty of fleeing to Him, of receiving Him, of trusting in Him, of
   renouncing our own righteousness that we may put on the righteousness
   of God; and little of our union with Him, of his living in us, and of
   our duty to live by faith in Him Thus new theories introduce a new
   religion.

   § 7. Objections.

   The only legitimate method of controverting a doctrine which purports
   to be founded on the Scriptures is the exegetical. If its advocates
   undertake to show that it is taught in the Bible, its opponents are
   bound to prove that the Bible, understood agreeably to the recognized
   laws of interpretation, does not teach it. This method, comparatively
   speaking, is little relied upon, or resorted to by the adversaries of
   the Church doctrine concerning the satisfaction of Christ. Their main
   reliance is on objections of two classes: the one drawn from
   speculative or philosophical principles; the other from the sentiments
   or feelings. It is not uncommon for modern writers, especially among
   the German theologians, to begin the discussion of this subject by a
   review of the Scriptural statements in relation to it. This is often
   eminently satisfactory. It is admitted that Christ saves us as a priest
   by offering Himself a sacrifice for sin; that He is a priest and sin
   offering in the Old Testament sense of those terms; and that a priest
   is a mediator, a representative of the people, and an offerer of
   sacrifices. It is admitted that the sin offerings of the old
   dispensation were expiatory sacrifices, designed to satisfy the justice
   of God and to secure the restoration of his favour to the sinner. It is
   admitted that expiation was made by substitution and vicarious
   punishment, that the victim bore the sins of the offerer and died not
   only for his benefit, but in his place. It is further admitted that all
   this was designed to be typical of the priesthood and sacrifice of
   Christ, and that the New Testament teaches that these types were
   fulfilled in Him; that He was the only true priest, and his offering of
   Himself was the only available sacrifice for sin; that He bore the sins
   of men; made expiation for their guilt by taking their place, and
   sustaining the penalty of the law and time wrath of God in their stead;
   and that the effect of his satisfaction of justice is that God is in
   such a sense reconciled to man, that He can consistently pardon their
   sins, and bestow upon them all saving blessings. Having given this
   exhibition of what the Scriptures teach on the subject, they go on to
   state what the Fathers taught; how the doctrine was presented during
   the Middle Ages, and afterwards by the Reformers; how the Rationalists
   and Supernaturalists of the last generation dealt with it; and how the
   modern speculative theologians have philosophized about it; and end,
   generally, by giving in their adhesion to some one of these modern
   theories more or less modified. All the while there stand the
   Scriptural statements untouched and unrefuted. They are allowed to go
   for what they are worth; but they are not permitted to control the
   writers own convictions. This course is adopted by different men on
   different principles. Sometimes it is upon the distinct denial of the
   inspiration of the sacred writers. They are admitted to be honest end
   faithful. They may or may not have been the recipients of a
   supernatural revelation, but they were fallible men, subject to all the
   influences which determine the modes of thought and the expressions of
   the men of any given age or nation. The sacred writers were Jews, and
   accustomed to a religion which had priests and sacrifices. It was,
   therefore, natural that they should set forth under figures and in the
   use of terms, borrowed from their own institutions, the truths that
   Christ saved sinners, and that in the prosecution of that work He
   suffered and died. These truths may be retained, but the form in which
   they are presented in the Bible may be safely discarded.

   Others, and perhaps the majority of the most popular of this class of
   theologians, go further than this. They are willing that criticism and
   forced interpretations should make what havoc they please with the
   Bible. Any and every book may be rejected from the canon. Any and every
   doctrine may be interpreted out of the sacred pages; still the only
   Christianity they value is safe. Christianity is independent of any
   form of doctrine. It is a life, an inward, organic power, which
   remodels the soul; which life is Christianity, because it is assumed to
   have its origin in Christ.

   Others again act on the principles of that form of rationalism which
   has received the name of Dogmatism. The doctrines and facts of the
   Bible are allowed to stand as true. They are allowed to be the proper
   modes of statement for popular instruction and impression. But it is
   assumed to be the office of the theologian to discover, present, and
   bring into harmony with his system, the philosophical truths which
   underlie these doctrinal statements of the Bible. And these
   philosophical truths are assumed to be the substance of the Scriptural
   doctrines, of which the doctrines themselves are the unessential and
   mutable forms. Thus the doctrine of the Trinity is admitted. The form
   in which it is presented in the Bible is regarded as its popular form,
   which it may be useful to retain for the people. But the real and
   important truth which it involves is, that original, unintelligent,
   unconscious Being (the Father) comes to conscious existence in the
   world (the Son), by an eternal process, and returns by an unceasing
   flow into the infinite (the Spirit). It is also admitted that God
   became flesh, but it was, as some say, in the whole race of man;
   mankind are the manifestation of God in the flesh; or, as others say,
   the Church is his body, that is, the form in which the incarnation is
   realized. Christ is acknowledged to be our saviour from sin, but it is
   by a purely subjective process. He introduces a new life power into
   humanity, which enters into conflict with the evil of our nature, and
   after a painful struggle overcomes it. This is called the application
   of philosophy to the explanation of Scriptural doctrines. It is patent,
   however, that this is not explanation, but substitution. It is the
   substitution of the human for the divine; of the thoughts of men, which
   are mere vapour, for the thoughts of God, which are eternal verities.
   It is giving a stone for bread, and a scorpion for an egg. It is,
   indeed, a very convenient method of getting rid of the teachings of the
   Bible, while professing to admit its authority. It is important,
   however, to notice the concession involved in these modes of
   proceeding. It is acknowledged that the Church doctrine of a true
   expiatory sacrifice for sin, of a real satisfaction of justice by means
   of the vicarious punishment of sin, is the doctrine of the Scriptures,
   as well of the Old Testament as of the New. This is all we contend for,
   and all we care for. If God teaches this, men may teach what they
   please.

   Moral Objections.

   Another class of objections to the Scriptural doctrine of satisfaction,
   which may be called philosophical, although not of the speculative
   kind, are those which are founded on certain assumed moral axioms. It
   is said to be self-evident that the innocent cannot be guilty; and if
   not guilty he cannot be punished, for punishment is the judicial
   infliction of evil on account of guilt. As the Church doctrine, while
   maintaining the perfect sinlessness of Christ, teaches that He bore the
   guilt of sin, and therefore was regarded and treated as a sinner, that
   doctrine assumes both an impossibility and an act of injustice. It
   assumes that God regards things as they are not. He regards the
   innocent as guilty. This is an impossibility. And if possible for Him
   to treat the innocent as guilty, it would be an act of gross injustice.
   On this class of objections it may be remarked, --

   1. That they avail nothing against the plain declaration of the
   Scriptures. If the Bible teaches that the innocent may bear the guilt
   of the actual transgressor; that He may endure the penalty incurred in
   his place, then it is in vain to say that this cannot be done.

   2. If it be said that these moral objections render it necessary to
   explain these representations of Scripture as figurative, or as
   anthropomorphic modes of expression, as when God is said to have eyes,
   to stand, or to walk, then the reply is that these representations are
   so didactic, are so repeated; and are so inwrought into the whole
   system of Scriptural doctrine, that they leave us no alternative but to
   receive them as the truths of God, or to reject tie Bible as his word.

   3. Rejecting the Bible does not help the matter. We cannot reject the
   facts of providence. Where is the propriety of saying that the innocent
   cannot justly suffer for the guilty, when we see that they actually do
   thus suffer continually, and everywhere since the world began? There is
   no moral principle asserted in tie Bible, which is not carried out in
   providence. God says He will visit the iniquities of the fathers upon
   their children to the third and fourth generation of those that hate
   Him. And so He does, and ever has done. Are we so confident in
   ourselves as to deny that there is a just God who governs the world,
   rather than admit that the innocent may rightfully bear the iniquity of
   the guilty? In teaching the doctrine of legal substitution, of the
   transfer of guilt from the transgressor to the innocent, of the
   satisfaction of justice by vicarious punishment, the Bible asserts and
   assumes no moral principle which does not underlie all the providential
   dealings of God with individuals or with nations.

   4. Men constantly deceive themselves by postulating as moral axioms
   what are nothing more than the forms in which their feelings or
   peculiar opinions find expression. To one man it is an axiom that a
   holy God cannot permit sin, or a benevolent God allow his creatures to
   be miserable; and he, therefore, infers either that there is no God, or
   that He cannot control the acts of free agents. To another it is
   self-evidently true that a free act cannot be certain, and therefore
   that there can be no foreordination, or foreknowledge, or prediction of
   the occurrence of such acts. To another, it is self-evident that a
   merciful God cannot permit any portion of his rational creatures to
   remain forever under the dominion of sin and suffering. There would be
   no end of controversy, and no security for any truth whatever, if the
   strong personal convictions of individual minds be allowed to determine
   what is, or what is not true, what the Bible may, and what it may not,
   be allowed to teach. It must be admitted, however, that there are moral
   intuitions, founded on the constitution of our nature, and constituting
   a primary revelation of the nature of God, which no external revelation
   can possibly contradict. The authority of these intuitive truths is
   assumed or fully recognized in the Bible itself. They have, however,
   their criteria. They cannot be enlarged or diminished. No man can add
   to, or detract from, their number. Those criteria are, (1.) They are
   all recognized in the Scriptures themselves. (2.) They are universally
   admitted as true by all rational minds. (3.) They cannot be denied. No
   effort of the will, and no sophistry of the understanding can destroy
   their authority over the reason and conscience.

   5. It is very evident that the principle that "the innocent cannot
   justly be punished for the guilty," cannot stand the application of the
   above-mentioned criteria. So far from being recognized in the Bible, it
   is contrary to its plainest declarations and facts. So far from being
   universally received among men as true, it has never been received at
   all as part of the common faith of mankind. The substitution of the
   innocent for the guilty, of victims for transgressors in sacrifice, of
   one for many; the idea of expiation by vicarious punishment, has been
   familiar to the human mind in all ages. It has been admitted not only
   as possible, but as rational, and recognized as indicating the only
   method by which sinful men can be reconciled to a just and holy God. It
   is not, therefore, to be admitted that it conflicts with any intuition
   of the reason or of the conscience; on the contrary it is congenial
   with both. It is no doubt frequently the case that opposition to this
   doctrine arises from a misapprehension of the terms in which it is
   expressed. By guilt many insist on meaning personal criminality and ill
   desert; and by punishment evil inflicted on the ground of such personal
   demerit. In these senses of the words the doctrine of satisfaction and
   vicarious punishment would indeed involve an impossibility. Moral
   character cannot be transferred. The Remonstrants were right in saying
   that man cannot be good with another's goodness, any more than he can
   be white with another's whiteness. And if punishment means evil
   inflicted on the ground of personal demerit, then it is a contradiction
   to say that the innocent can be punished. But if guilt expresses only
   the relation of sin to justice, and is the obligation under which the
   sinner is placed to satisfy its demands, then there is nothing in the
   nature of things, nothing in the moral nature of man, nothing in the
   nature of God as revealed either in his providence or in his word,
   which forbids the idea that this obligation may on adequate grounds be
   transferred from one to an other, or assumed by one in the place of
   others.

   To the head of objections founded on assumed moral axioms belong those
   urged by a large class of modern, and especially of German theologians.
   These theologians have their peculiar views of the nature of God, of
   his relation to the world, and of anthropology in all its branches,
   which underlie and determine all their theological doctrines. It is
   denied that Schleiermacher founded a school; but it is certain that he
   introduced a method of theologizing, and advocated principles, which
   have determined the character of the theology of a large class of men,
   not only in Germany, but also in England and America: Twesten, Nitsch,
   Lücke, Olshausen, Ullmann, Lange, Liebner, and even Ebrard in Germany
   and Morell and Maurice in England, belong to this class of writers. In
   this country what is known as the "Mercersburg Theology" is the product
   of the same principles. Everything which distinguishes that theology
   from the theology of the Reformed Church, comes from the introduction
   of these new German speculative principles. No two of the writers above
   mentioned agree in all points. They differ, however, only in the length
   to which they carry their common principles in modifying or
   overthrowing the faith of the Church. Ebrard, one of the best, because
   one of the most moderate and least infected of the class, says in the
   preface to his "Dogmatik," that he goes hand in hand with the old
   Reformed theology in all points, and that for that reason he is more
   true to the principles of his Church, as a church of progress. He
   professes to have carried that theology forward by a process of
   "organic development;" and this Professor Harbaugh of Mercersburg, in
   his late inaugural address, claims to have been the service, and still
   to be the office of the German Reformed Church in this country. It is
   true that the leading theologians of that Church, as was perhaps to be
   expected, have given themselves up to the guidance of the German mind.
   All they have done has been to incorporate the modern German philosophy
   with theology. Their advances, therefore, have no more worth than
   belongs to any other form of human speculation. They do not pretend to
   get their peculiar doctrines from the Bible; they only labour to make
   the Bible agree with their doctrines. But this is just as impossible as
   that the Scriptures should teach the principles of modern chemistry,
   astronomy, or geology. These philosophical principles had no existence
   in the minds of men when the Bible was written, and they have no
   authority now but what they get from their human authors. If they
   survive for a generation, it will be more than similar speculations
   have in general been able to accomplish. [438] It is, however,
   lamentable to see how even good men allow themselves to explain away
   the most catholic, and plainly revealed doctrines of the Bible, in
   obedience to the dictates of the modern transcendental philosophy. What
   however we have here immediately in view is, the objections which this
   class of writers make to the Church form of the doctrine of
   satisfaction, in obedience to the assumed moral axiom above mentioned,
   namely, that the innocent cannot by God be regarded and treated as
   guilty, or the guilty regarded and treated as righteous. It is indeed
   true that God cannot but regard every person as he really is. His
   judgments are according to truth. But this is not inconsistent with his
   regarding Christ, although personally innocent, as having voluntarily
   assumed our place and undertaken to satisfy the demands of justice in
   our place; nor with his regarding the believer, although personally
   undeserving, as righteous, in the sense of being free from just
   exposure to condemnation, on the ground of the vicarious satisfaction
   of Christ. This is precisely what the Scriptures affirm to be true, and
   that which believers in all ages have made the ground of their hope
   toward God. This is almost the identical proposition affirmed by the
   Apostle, when he declares that on the ground of the propitiation of
   Christ, God "can justify the ungodly," i.e., declare the unrighteous to
   be righteous; unrighteous personally, but righteous in that the demands
   of justice in regard to him are satisfied. This also is precisely what
   the writers referred to (not Ebrard who does not go so far as those
   with whom he is classed) deny. If God, say they, regards Christ as
   sinful, He must be really sinful; if He pronounces the believer
   righteous, he must be truly, personally, and subjectively righteous. As
   most of these writers admit the sinlessness of Christ, and yet maintain
   that only sinners can be treated as sinners, and only the personally
   righteous treated as righteous; and as they hold that imputation
   implies the real possession of the quality, act, or relation which is
   imputed, they are forced to teach that Christ in assuming our nature as
   guilty and fallen, ipso facto, assumed all the responsibilities of men,
   and was bound to answer to the justice of God for all the sins which
   hnmanity had committed. The doctrine of one class of these writers is,
   that the Logos in assuming our nature did not become an individual, but
   the universal man; He did not take to Himself "a true body and a
   reasonable soul," but the whole of humanity, or humanity as an organic
   whole or law of life; the individual dying for the sins of other
   individuals, does not satisfy justice. When He was nailed to the cross,
   not an individual merely, but humanity itself, was crucified; and,
   therefore, his sufferings were the sufferings not of an individual man,
   but of that which underlies all human individualities, and consequently
   avails for all in whom humanity is individualized. As Christ becomes
   personally responsible for the guilt which attaches to the humanity
   which He assumed, so we become personally righteous and entitled, on
   the ground of what we are or become, to eternal life, because, by our
   union with Him, we partake of his humanity as well as of his divinity.
   His theanthropic nature is conveyed to us with all its merits,
   excellence, and glories, as the nature of Adam with its guilt,
   pollution, and weaknesses, has been transmitted to his posterity. It is
   in favour of this theory that the church doctrine of the substitution
   of Christ, the innocent for the guilty; of his bearing the guilt not of
   his own nature, but of sinners; of his suffering the penalty of the law
   in the place of those by whom it had been incurred, one individual of
   infinite dignity dying in the stead of the multitude of his people (the
   shepherd for his sheep), is discarded and trodden under foot. In
   reference to this theory, it is sufficient here to remark, --

   1. That it is a mere speculative, or philosophical, anthropological
   theory. It has no more authority than the thousands of speculations
   which the teeming mind of man has produced. Schleiermacher says that
   man is the form in which the universal spirit comes to consciousness
   and individuality on this earth. These writers say that man is the form
   in which generic humanity is individualized. Every philosophy has its
   own anthropology. It is evidently most unreasonable and presumptuous to
   found the explanation of a great Scriptural doctrine, which the people
   are bound to understand and receive, and on which they are required to
   rest their hope of salvation, upon a theory as to the nature of man,
   which has no divine authority, and which not one man in a thousand,
   perhaps not one in hundreds of thousands, believes or ever has
   believed. The self-confidence and self-exaltation which such a course
   implies, can hardly be the fruit of the Holy Spirit.

   2. The theory itself is unintelligible. The phrases "universal man,"
   and "the whole of humanity," as here used, have no meaning. To say that
   "humanity itself was nailed to the cross," conveys no rational idea. By
   a universal man might be meant a universal genius, or a man who
   represents all mankind as Adam did. But this is expressly repudiated.
   By "a universal man," as distinguished from an individual man, is
   intended a man who includes the whole of humanity in himself. Though
   this might be said of Adam when he stood absolutely alone, before the
   creation of Eve, yet it cannot be said of any one of a multitude of
   men. A universal man would be a man who included in himself all human
   persons; an idea as monstrous as the modern doctrine of "the
   all-personality of God."

   In the language of the Church, to assume a nature is to assume a
   substance with its essential attributes and properties. Through all
   ages in the Church the words phusis, oisia, substantia, and natura,
   have, in relation to this subject, been used interchangeably. When it
   is said that the Logos assumed our nature, it is meant that He took
   into personal union with Himself a substance or essence having the same
   essential properties which constitute us men. But He did not assume the
   whole of that substance or essence. He assumed the whole of humanity in
   the sense of assuming all the attributes of humanity. He took upon Him
   all that was necessary to constitute Him "very man" as He was from
   eternity "very God." This, however, is not what these writers mean.
   They say He took upon Him the whole of humanity so as to be, not an
   individual, but the universal man. This is what some of the first of
   German minds have pronounced to be Unsinn, i.e., meaningless. Even if
   the idea of substance, although recognized by the Bible, the Church,
   and mankind, be discarded, and humanity, or human nature, be defined as
   a life, or organic force, or aggregate of certain forces, the case is
   not altered. A universal man would still be a man who had in himself to
   the exclusion of all others, the totality of that life or of those
   forces. There is no conceivable sense in which Christ had in Himself
   the whole of humanity, when millions of other men existed around Him.
   This whole theory, therefore, which is set up as antagonistic to the
   Church doctrine of satisfaction, rests on an unintelligible, or
   meaningless proposition. It is no new thing in the history of the human
   mind that even great men should deceive themselves with words, and take
   mystic phrases, or vague imaginings for definite ideas.

   3. There is a moral or ethical impossibility, as well as a metaphysical
   one, involved in this theory. The doctrine is, that in assuming human
   nature Christ assumed the guilt attaching to the sins humanity had
   committed. He became responsible for those sins; and was bound to bear
   the penalty they had incurred. Nevertheless human nature as it existed
   in his person was guiltless and absolutely pure. This, to our
   apprehensions, is an impossibility. Guilt and sin can be predicated
   only of a person. This if not a self-evident, is, at least, a
   universally admitted truth. Only a person is a rational agent. It is
   only to persons that responsibility, guilt, or moral character can
   attach. Human nature apart from human persons cannot act, and therefore
   cannot contract guilt, or be responsible. Christ assumed a rational
   soul which had never existed as a person, and could not be responsible
   on the ground of its nature for the sins of other men. Unless guilt and
   sin be essential attributes or properties of human nature, Christ did
   not assume guilt by assuming that nature. If guilt and sin cannot be
   predicated of Christ's person, they cannot by possibility be predicated
   of his human nature. The whole theory, therefore, which denies that
   Christ as a divine person clothed in a nature like our own, assumed the
   guilt of our sins by imputation of what did not belong to Him, and
   sustained the penalty which we had incurred, and makes that denial on
   the ground that the innocent cannot bear the sins of the guilty; that
   God could not regard Him as sin, unless He was in Himself sin, is
   founded on the moral impossibility that a nature, as distinguished from
   a person, can sin or be guilty.

   When it is said that we derive a sinful nature from Adam, and that
   guilt as well as pollution attaches to the nature of fallen men, the
   doctrine is, that we, and all who derive that nature from Adam, are
   personally sinful and guilty. We are born, as the Apostle says, the
   children of wrath. It is not an impersonal nature which is guilty, for
   this would be a contradiction, but persons whose immanent, subjective
   state is opposed to the character and law of God. All this, however, is
   denied concerning Christ. These theologians admit that, as a person, He
   was without sin. But if without sin, He was without guilt. It was
   according to the Scriptures by the imputation to Him of sins not his
   own, that He bore our guilt, or assumed the responsibility of
   satisfying justice on our account. It is only by admitting that by
   being born of a woman, or becoming flesh, Christ placed Himself in the
   category of sinful men, and became personally a sinner, and guilty in
   the sight of God, as all other men are, that it can be maintained that
   the assumption of our nature in itself involved the assumption of
   guilt, or that He thereby became responsible for all the sins which men
   possessing that nature had committed.

   4. It is another fatal objection to this scheme that it subverts the
   whole gospel plan of salvation. Instead of directing the soul to
   Christ, to his righteousness, and to his intercession; that is, to what
   is objective and out of itself, as the ground of its hope toward God,
   it turns the attention of the sinner in upon himself. The only
   righteousness he has on which to trust is within. He has a new nature,
   and because of that nature is and deserves to be, reconciled unto God
   and entitled to eternal life. It places Christ just as far from us as
   Adam is. As Adam is the source of a nature for which we are condemned,
   so Christ is the source of a nature for which we are justified and
   saved. The system, therefore, calls upon us to exchange a hope founded
   upon what Christ is and has done in our behalf, a hope which rests upon
   an infinitely meritorious righteousness out of ourselves, for a hope
   founded on the glimmer of divine life which we find within ourselves.
   We may call this new nature by what high-sounding names we please. We
   may call it theanthropic, divine-human, or divine, it makes no
   difference. Whatever it is called, it is something so weak and so
   imperfect that it cannot satisfy ourselves, much less the infinitely
   holy and just God. To call on men to trust for their acceptance before
   God on the ground of what they are made by this inward change, is to
   call upon them to build their eternal hopes upon a foundation which
   cannot sustain a straw. That this is the true view of the plan of
   salvation as proposed by these theologians, notwithstanding the lofty
   terms in which they speak of Christ as our Saviour, is plain from the
   parallel which they constantly refer to between our relation to Christ
   and our relation to Adam. This is an analogy which the Apostle insists
   upon, and which as presented by him is full of instruction and hope.
   Adam was the head and representative of his race. We stood our
   probation in him. His sin was putatively the sin of his posterity. It
   was the judicial ground of their condemnation. The penalty of that
   transgression was death, the loss of the life of God, as well as of his
   fellowship and favour. All mankind, therefore, represented by Adam in
   the first covenant came into the world in a state of condemnation and
   of spiritual death. He was a type of Christ, because Christ is the head
   and representative of his people. He fulfilled all righteousness in
   their behalf and in their stead. As Adam's disobedience was the ground
   of the condemnation of all who were in him, so Christ's obedience is
   the ground of the justification of all who are in Him; and as spiritual
   death was the penal, and therefore certain consequence of our
   condemnation for the sin of Adam, so spiritual and eternal life is the
   covenanted, and therefore the certain and inseparable consequence of
   our justification for the righteousness of Christ. But according to the
   modern speculative (or as it is called by Dorner, [439] "the
   regenerated") theology, the parallel between Christ and Adam is very
   different. We are not condemned for Adam's sin, as his sin, but only
   for that sin as it was ours, committed by us as partakers of the
   numerically same nature that sinned in him, and for the consequent
   corruption of our nature. The whole ground of our condemnation is
   subjective or inward. We are condemned for what we are. In like manner
   we are justified for what we become through Christ. He assumed
   numerically the same nature that had sinned. He sanctified it, elevated
   it, and raised it to the power of a divine life by its union with his
   divine person, and He communicates this new, theanthropic nature to his
   people, and on the ground of what they thus become they are reconciled
   and saved. It is a favourite and frequently occurring statement with
   these writers that Christ redeems us, not by what He does, but by what
   He is. His assumption of our nature was its redemption. Extreme
   spiritualism always ends in materialism. This whole theory has a
   materialistic aspect. Humanity as derived from Adam is conceived of as
   a polluted stream, into which a healing purifying element was
   introduced by Christ. From Him onward, it flows as a life-giving
   stream. What then becomes of those who lived before Christ? This is a
   question which these theologians are slow to answer. They agree,
   however, in saying that the condition of the patriarchs was deplorable;
   that their relation to Christ was essentially different from ours.
   There was no theanthropic life for them. That began with the
   incarnation, and the stream cannot flow backwards.

   No one can read the theological works of the speculative school,
   without being satisfied that their design is not to set forth what the
   Scriptures teach. To this little or no attention is paid. Their object
   is to give a scientific interpretation of certain facts of Scripture
   (such as sin and redemption), in accordance with the principles of the
   current philosophy. These writers are as much out of the reach, and out
   of contact with the sympathies and religious life of the people, as men
   in a balloon are out of relation to those they leave behind. To the
   aeronauts indeed those on the earth appear very diminutive and
   grovelling; but they are none the less in their proper sphere and upon
   solid ground. All that the excursionists can hope for is a safe return
   to terra firma. And that is seldom accomplished without risk or loss.

   Popular Objections.

   The more popular objections to the doctrine of vicarious satisfaction
   have already been considered in the progress of the discussion. A
   certain amount of repetition may be pardoned for the sake of a brief
   and distinct statement of the several points. These objections were all
   urged by Socinus and his associates at the time of the Reformation.
   They are principally the following: --

   There is no Vindicatory Justice in God.

   1. There is no such attribute in God as vindicatory justice, and
   therefore there can be no satisfaction to justice required or rendered.
   This would be a fatal objection if the assumption which it involves
   were correct. But if it is intuitively true, that sin ought to be
   punished, then it is no less true that God will, and from the
   constitution of his nature must do, what ought to be done. All men, in
   despite of the sophistry of the understanding, and in despite of their
   moral degradation, know that it is the righteous judgment of God, that
   those who sin are worthy of death. They, therefore, know that without a
   satisfaction to justice, sin cannot be pardoned. If there be no
   sacrifice for sin, there is only a fearful looking for of judgment.
   This conviction lies undisturbed at the bottom of every human breast,
   and never fails, sooner or later, to reveal itself with irrepressible
   force on the reason and the conscience.

   There can be no Antagonism in God.

   2. To the same effect it is objected that there can be no antagonism in
   God. There cannot be one impulse to punish and another impulse not to
   punish . All God's acts or manifestations of Himself toward his
   creatures, must be referred to one principle, and that principle is
   love. And, therefore, his plan of saving sinners can only be regarded
   as an exhibition of love, not of justice in any form. All that He can,
   as a God of love, require, is the return of his creatures to Himself,
   which is a return to holiness and happiness. It is true God is love.
   But it is no less true that love in God is not a weakness, impelling
   Him to do what ought not to be done. If sin ought to be punished, as
   conscience and the word of God declare, then there is nothing in God
   which impels Him to leave it unpunished. His whole nature is indeed
   harmonious, but it has the harmony of moral excellence, leading with
   absolute certainty to the judge of all the earth doing right; punishing
   or pardoning, just as moral excellence demands. The love of God has not
   prevented the final perdition of apostate angels; and it could not
   require the restoration of fallen men without an adequate atonement.
   The infinite, discriminating love of God to our race, is manifested in
   his giving his own Son to bear our sins and to redeem us from the curse
   of the law by sustaining the penalty in his own person. "Herein is
   love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent his Son to
   be the propitiation (hilasmos, propitiatio, expiatio. No man can get
   the saving import out of that word) for our sins." (1 John iv. 10.)

   The Transfer of Guilt or Righteousness Impossible.

   3. It is objected that the transfer of guilt and righteousness involved
   in the Church doctrine of satisfaction is impossible. The transfer of
   guilt or righteousness, as states of consciousness or forms of moral
   character, is indeed impossible. But the transfer of guilt as
   responsibility to justice, and of righteousness as that which satisfies
   justice, is no more impossible than that one man should pay the debt of
   another. All that the Bible teaches on this subject is that Christ paid
   as a substitute, our debt to the justice of God. The handwriting
   (cheirographon, the bond, Schuldbrief) Christ has cancelled, by nailing
   it to his cross. His complete satisfaction to the law, freed us as
   completely as the debtor is freed when his bond is legally cancelled.

   Expiation a Heathenish Idea.

   4. The idea of expiation, the innocent suffering for the guilty and God
   being thereby propitiated, is declared to be heathenish and revolting.
   No man has the right to make his taste or feelings the test of truth.
   That a doctrine is disagreeable, is no sufficient evidence of its
   untruth. There are a great many terribly unpleasant truths, to which we
   sinners have to submit. Besides, the idea of expiation is not revolting
   to the vast majority of minds, as is proved by its being incorporated
   in all religions of men, whether pagan, Jewish, or Christian. So far
   from being revolting, it is cherished and delighted in as the only hope
   of the guilty. So far from the innocent suffering for the guilty being
   a revolting spectacle, it is one of the sublimest exhibitions of
   self-sacrificing love. All heaven stands uncovered before the cross on
   which the Son of God, holy and harmless, bore the sins of men. And God
   forbid that redeemed sinners should regard the cross as an offence. God
   is not won to love by the death of his Son, but that death renders it
   consistent with moral excellence that his infinite love for sinful men
   should have unrestricted sway.

   Satisfaction to Justice unnecessary.

   5. It is objected that the doctrine of satisfaction to justice by means
   of vicarious punishment is unnecessary. All that is needed for the
   restoration of harmony in the universe can be effected by the power of
   love. The two great ends to be accomplished are a clue impression on
   rational minds of the evil of sin, and the reformation of sinners. Both
   these objects, it is contended, are secured without expiation or any
   penal suffering. According to some, the work of Christ operates
   æsthetically to accomplish the ends desired; according to others, it
   operates morally through the exhibition of love or by example, or by
   the confirmation of truth; and according to others, the operation is
   supernatural or mystical. But in any case his work was no satisfaction
   to justice or expiation for sin. It is enough to say in answer to all
   this, --

   1. That such is not the doctrine of the Bible. The Scriptures teach
   that something more was necessary for the salvation of men than moral
   influences and impressions, or the revelation and confirmation of
   truth, something very different from mystical influence on the nature
   of man. What was necessary was precisely what was done. The Son of God
   assumed our nature, took the place of sinners, bore the curse of the
   law in their stead, and thereby rendered it possible that God should be
   just and yet the justifier of the ungodly. If such be the Scripture
   doctrine, all these schemes of redemption may be dismissed without
   consideration.

   2. These schemes are not only unscriptural, but they are inoperative
   They do not meet the necessities of the case, as those necessities
   reveal themselves in the consciousness of men. They make no provision
   for the removal of guilt. But the sense of guilt is universal and
   ineradicable. It is not irrational. It is not founded on ignorance or
   misconception of our relation to God. The more the soul is enlightened,
   the more deep and painful is its sense of guilt. There are some
   philosophers who would persuade us that there is no such thing as sin;
   that the sense of moral pollution of which men complain, and under
   which the holiest men groan as under a body of death, is all a
   delusion, a state of mind produced by erroneous views of God and of his
   relation to his creatures. There are others, theologians as well as
   philosophers, who while admitting the reality of moral evil, and
   recognizing the validity of the testimony of consciousness as to our
   moral pollution, endeavour to persuade us that there is no such thing
   as guilt. Responsibility to justice, the desert of punishment, the
   moral necessity for the punishment of sin, they deny. The one class is
   just as obviously wrong as the other. Consciousness testifies just as
   clearly and just as universally to the guilt, as to the pollution. It
   craves as importunately deliverance from the one as from the other. A
   plan of salvation, therefore, which makes no provision for the removal
   of guilt, or satisfaction of justice, which admits no such thing as the
   vicarious punishment of sin, is as little suited to our necessities as
   though it made no provision for the reformation and sanctification of
   men.

   3. A third remark on these humanly devised schemes of redemption is,
   that while they leave out the essential idea of expiation, or
   satisfaction to justice by vicarious punishment, without which
   salvation is impossible, and reconciliation with a just God
   inconceivable they contain no element of influence or power which does
   not belong in a higher degree to the Scriptural and Church doctrine.
   Whatever there is of power in a perfectly sinless life, of a life of
   self-sacrifice and devotion to the service of God and the good of man,
   is to be found in the Church doctrine. Whatever there is of power in
   the prolonged exhibition of a love which passes knowledge, is to be
   found there. Whatever there is of power in the truths which Christ
   taught, and which He sealed with his blood, truths either before
   entirely unknown, or only imperfectly apprehended, belongs of course to
   the doctrine which the Church universal has ever held. And whatever
   there is of reality in the doctrine of our mystical union, and of our
   participation of the nature of Christ through the indwelling of the
   Holy Ghost, belongs to the Scriptural doctrine, without the blurring
   and enfeebling effects of modern speculation. While, therefore, we
   should lose everything in renouncing the doctrine of expiation through
   the sacrificial death of Christ, we should gain nothing, by adopting
   these modern theories.

   "If a man," says Delitzsch, "keeps in view our desert of punishment,
   and allows the three saving doctrines of Scripture to stand in their
   integrity, namely, (1.) That God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for
   us, i.e., imputed our sins to Him. (2.) That Christ, although free from
   guilt, laden with our guilt, was made a curse for us, i.e., suffered
   the wrath of God due to us; or, as the Scripture also says, that God
   executed on his Son judgment against sin, He having taken upon Him
   flesh and blood and offered Himself as a sacrifice for us for the
   expiation of sin. (3.) That in like manner his righteousness is imputed
   to believers, so that we may stand before God, as He had submitted to
   the imputation of our sins in order to their expiation; if these
   premises remain unobliterated, then it is as clear as the sun that
   Christ suffered and died as our substitute, in order that we need not
   suffer what we deserved, and in order that we instead of dying should
   be partakers of the life secured by his vicarious death." [440]

   Schleiermacher seems to be for the rising men of Germany as much a
   thing of the past, as that of the Hindus or the Cabala. The German mind

   stehen: 1. dass Gott den der von keiner Sünde wüsste für uns zur Sünde

CHAPTER VIII.

  FOR WHOM DID CHRIST DIE?
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. State of the Question.

   This is a question between Augustinians and Anti- Augustinians. The
   former believing that God from all eternity having elected some to
   everlasting life, had a special reference to their salvation in the
   mission and work of his Son. The latter, denying that there has been
   any such election of a part of the human family to salvation, maintain
   that the mission and work of Christ had an equal reference to all
   mankind.

   The question, therefore, does not, in the first place, concern the
   nature of Christ's work. It is true, if it be denied that his work was
   a satisfaction for sin, and affirmed that it was merely didactic; that
   his life, sufferings, and death were designed to reveal and confirm
   truth; then it would follow of course that it had no reference to one
   class of men more than to another, or to men more than to angels. Truth
   is designed for the illumination of all the minds to which it is
   presented. But admitting the work of Christ to have been a true
   satisfaction for sin, its design may still be an open question.
   Accordingly, Lutherans and Reformed, although they agree entirely as to
   the nature of the atonement, differ as to its design. The former
   maintain that it had an equal reference to all mankind, the latter that
   it had special reference to the elect.

   In the second place, the question does not concern the value of
   Christ's satisfaction. That Augustinians admit to be infinite. Its
   value depends on the dignity of the sacrifice; and as no limit car be
   placed to the dignity of the Eternal Son of God who offered Him self
   for our sins, so no limit can be assigned to the meritorious value of
   his work. It is a gross misrepresentation of the Augustinian doctrine
   to say that it teaches that Christ suffered so much for so many; that
   He would have suffered more had more been included in the purpose of
   salvation. This is not the doctrine of any Church on earth, and never
   has been. What was sufficient for one was sufficient for all. Nothing
   less than the light and heat of the sun is sufficient for any one plant
   or animal. But what is absolutely necessary for each is abundantly
   sufficient for the infinite number and variety of plants and animals
   which fill the earth. All that Christ did and suffered would have been
   necessary had only one human soul been the object of redemption; and
   nothing different and nothing more would have been required had every
   child of Adam been saved through his blood.

   In the third place, the question does not concern the suitableness of
   the atonement. What was suitable for one was suitable for all. The
   righteousness of Christ, the merit of his obedience and death, is
   needed for justification by each individual of our race, and therefore
   is needed by all. It is no more appropriate to one man than to another.
   Christ fulfilled the conditions of the covenant under which all men
   were placed. He rendered the obedience required of all, and suffered
   the penalty which all had incurred; and therefore his work is equally
   suited to all.

   In the fourth place, the question does not concern the actual
   application of the redemption purchased by Christ. The parties to this
   controversy are agreed that some only, and not all of mankind are to be
   actually saved.

   The whole question, therefore, concerns simply the purpose of God in
   the mission of his Son. What was the design of Christ's coming into the
   world, and doing and suffering all He actually did and suffered? Was it
   merely to make the salvation of all men possible; to remove the
   obstacles which stood in the way of the offer of pardon and acceptance
   to sinners? or, Was it specially to render certain the salvation of his
   own people, i.e., of those given to Him by the Father? The latter
   question is affirmed by Augustinians, and denied by their opponents. It
   is obvious that if there be no election of some to everlasting life,
   the atonement can have no special reference to the elect. It must have
   equal reference to all mankind. But it does not follow from the
   assertion of its having a special reference to the elect that it had no
   reference to the non-elect. Augustinians readily admit that the death
   of Christ had a relation to man, to the whole human family, which it
   had not to the fallen angels. It is the ground on which salvation is
   offered to every creature under heaven who hears the gospel; but it
   gives no authority for a like offer to apostate angels. It moreover
   secures to the whole race at large, and to all classes of men,
   innumerable blessings, both providential and religious. It was, of
   course, designed to produce these effects; and, therefore, He died to
   secure them. In view of the effects which the death of Christ produces
   in the relation of all mankind to God, it has in all ages been
   customary with Augustinians to say that Christ died "sufficienter pro
   omnibus, efficaciter tantum pro electis;" sufficiently for all,
   efficaciously only for the elect. There is a sense, therefore, in which
   He died for all, and there is a sense in which He died for the elect
   alone. The simple question is, Had the death of Christ a reference to
   the elect which it had not to other men? Did He come into the world to
   secure the salvation of those given to Him by the Father, so that the
   other effects of his work are merely incidental to what was done for
   the attainment of that object?
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Proof of the Augustinian Doctrine.

   That these questions must be answered in the affirmative, is evident,
   --

   1. From the nature of the covenant of redemption. It is admitted that
   there was a covenant between the Father and the Son in relation to the
   salvation of men. It is admitted that Christ came into the world in
   execution of that covenant. The nature of the covenant, therefore,
   determines the object of his death. According to one view, man having
   by his fall lost the ability of fulfilling the conditions of the
   covenant of life, God, for Christ's sake, enters into a new covenant,
   offering men salvation upon other and easier terms; namely, as some
   say, faith and repentance, and others evangelical obedience. If such be
   the nature of the plan of salvation, then it is obvious that the work
   of Christ has equal reference to all mankind. According to another
   view, the work of Christ was designed to secure the pardon of original
   sin and the gift of the Holy Spirit for all men, Jews or Gentiles, and
   those are saved who duly improve the grace they severally receive. The
   former is the doctrine of the ancient Semi-Pelagians and modern
   Remonstrants; the latter of the Wesleyan Arminians. The Lutherans hold
   that God sent his Son to make a full and real legal satisfaction for
   the sins of all mankind; and that on the ground of this perfect
   satisfaction the offer of salvation is made to all who hear the gospel;
   that grace is given (in the word and sacraments) which, if unresisted,
   is sufficient to secure their salvation. The French theologians at
   Saumur, in the 17th century, taught also that Christ came into the
   world to do whatever was necessary for the salvation of men. But God,
   foreseeing that, if left to themselves, men would universally reject
   the offers of mercy, elected some to be the subjects of his saving
   grace by which they are brought to faith and repentance According to
   this view of the plan of salvation, election is subordinate to
   redemption. God first redeems all and then elects some. This is the
   view extensively adopted in this country. According to Augustinians,
   men, by their fall, having sunk into a state of sin and misery, might
   justly have been left, as were the fallen angels, to perish in their
   sins. But God, in his infinite mercy, having determined to save a
   multitude whom no man could number, gave them to his Son as his
   inheritance, provided He would assume their nature and fulfil all
   righteousness in their stead. In the accomplishment of this plan Christ
   did come into the world, and did obey and suffer in the place of those
   thus given to Him, and for their salvation. This was the definite
   object of his mission, and therefore his death had a reference to them
   which it could not possibly have to those whom God determined to leave
   to the just recompense of their sins. Now this plan only supposes that
   God determined from eternity to do what in time He has actually
   accomplished. If it were just that all men should perish on account of
   their sin it was just to leave a portion of the race thus to perish,
   while the salvation of the other portion is a matter of unmerited
   favour. It can hardly be denied that God did thus enter into covenant
   with his Son. That is, that He did promise Him the salvation of his
   people as the reward of his incarnation and sufferings; that Christ did
   come into the world and suffer and die on that condition, and, having
   performed the condition, is entitled to the promised reward. These are
   facts so clearly and so repeatedly stated in the Scriptures as not to
   admit of their being called into question. But if such is the plan of
   God respecting the salvation of men then it of necessity follows that
   election precedes redemption; that God had determined whom He would
   save before He sent his Son to save them. Therefore our Lord said that
   those given to Him by his Father should certainly come to Him, and that
   He would raise them up at the last day. These Scriptural facts cannot
   be admitted without its being also admitted that the death of Christ
   had a reference to his people, whose salvation it rendered certain,
   which it had not to others whom, for infinitely wise reasons, God
   determined to leave to themselves. It follows, therefore, from the
   nature of the covenant of redemption, as presented in the Bible, that
   Christ did not die equally for all mankind. but that He gave Himself
   for his people and for their redemption.

   Argument from the Doctrine of Election.

   2. This follows also almost necessarily from the doctrine of election.
   Indeed it never was denied that Christ died specially for the elect
   until the doctrine of election itself was rejected. Augustine, the
   follower and expounder of St. Paul, taught that God out of his mere
   good pleasure had elected some to everlasting life, and held that
   Christ came into the world to suffer and die for their salvation. He
   purchased them with his own precious blood. The Semi-Pelagians, in
   denying the doctrine of election, of course denied that Christ's death
   had more reference to one class of men than to another. The Latin
   Church, so long as it held to the Augustinian doctrine of election,
   held also to Augustine's doctrine concerning the design and objects of
   Christ's death. All through the Middle Ages this was one of the
   distinctive doctrines of those who resisted the progress of the
   Semi-Pelagian party in the Western Church. At the time of the
   Reformation the Lutherans, so long as they held to the one doctrine
   held also to the other. The Reformed, in holding fast the doctrine of
   election, remained faithful to their denial of the doctrine that the
   work of Christ had equal reference to all mankind. It was not until the
   Remonstrants in Holland, under the teaching of Arminius, rejected the
   Church doctrine of original sin, of the inability of fallen man to
   anything spiritually good, the sovereignty of God in election, and the
   perseverance of the saints, that the doctrine that the atonement had a
   special reference to the people of God was rejected. It is, therefore,
   a matter of history that the doctrine of election and the Augustinian
   doctrine as to the design of the work of Christ have been inseparably
   united. As this connection is historical so also is it logical. The one
   doctrine necessarily involves the other. If God from eternity
   determined to save one portion of the human race and not another, it
   seems to be a contradiction to say that the plan of salvation had equal
   reference to both portions; that the Father sent his Son to die for
   those whom He had predetermined not to save, as truly as, and in the
   same sense that He gave Him up for those whom He had chosen to make the
   heirs of salvation.

   Express Declarations of Scripture.

   3. We accordingly find numerous passages in which the design of
   Christ's death is declared to be, to save his people from their sins.
   He did not come merely to render their salvation possible but actually
   to deliver them from the curse of the law, and from the power of sin.
   This is included in all the Scriptural representations of the nature
   and design of his work. No man pays a ransom without the certainty of
   the deliverance of those for whom it is paid. It is not a ransom unless
   it actually redeems. And an offering is no sacrifice unless it actually
   expiates and propitiates. The effect of a ransom and sacrifice may
   indeed be conditional, but the occurrence of the condition will be
   rendered certain before the costly sacrifice is offered.

   There are also very numerous passages in which it is expressly declared
   that Christ gave Himself for his Church (Ephesians v. 25); that He laid
   down his life for his sheep (John x. 15); that He laid down his life
   for his friends (John xv. 13); that He died that He might gather
   together in one the children of God that are scattered abroad (John xi.
   52); that it was the Church which He purchased with his blood (Acts xx.
   28). When mankind are divided into two classes, the Church and the
   world, the friends and the enemies of God, the sheep and the goats,
   whatever is affirmed distinctively of the one class is impliedly denied
   of the other. When it is said that Christ loved his Church and gave
   Himself for it, that He laid down his life for his sheep, it is clear
   that something is said of the Church and of the sheep, which is not
   true of those who belong to neither. When it is said that a man labours
   and sacrifices health and strength for his children, it is thereby
   denied that the motive which controls him is mere philanthropy, or that
   the design he has in view is the good of society. He may indeed be a
   philanthropist, and he may recognize the fact that the well-being of
   his children will promote the welfare of society, but this does not
   alter the case. It still remains true that love for his children is the
   motive, and their good his object. It is difficult, in the light of
   Ephesians v. 25, where the death of Christ is attributed to his love of
   his Church, and is said to have been designed for its sanctification
   and salvation, to believe that He gave Himself as much for reprobates
   as for those whom He intended to save. Every assertion, therefore that
   Christ died for a people, is a denial of the doctrine that He died
   equally for all men.

   Argument from the Special Love of God.

   4. By the love of God is sometimes meant his goodness, of which all
   sensitive creatures are the objects and of whose benefits they are the
   recipients. Sometimes it means his special regard for the children of
   men, not only as rational creatures, but also as the offspring of Him
   who is the Father of the spirits of all men. Sometimes it means that
   peculiar, mysterious, sovereign, immeasurable love which passes
   knowledge, of which his own people, the Church of the first-born whose
   names are written in heaven, are the objects. Of this love it is
   taught, (1.) That it is infinitely great. (2.) That it is
   discriminating, fixed on some and not upon others of the children of
   men. It is compared to the love of a husband for his wife; which from
   its nature is exclusive. (3.) That it is perfectly gratuitous and
   sovereign, i.e., not founded upon the special attractiveness of its
   objects, but like parental affection, or the mere fact that they are
   his children. (4.) That it is immutable. (5.) That it secures all
   saving blessings, and even all good; so that even afflictions are among
   its fruits intended for the greater good of the sufferer. Now to this
   love, not to general goodness, not to mere philanthropy, but to this
   peculiar and infinite love, the gift of Christ is uniformly referred.
   Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent
   his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. (1 John iv. 10.) Hereby
   perceive we the love of God (or, hereby we know what love is), because
   He (Christ) laid down his life for us. (1 John iii. 16.) God commendeth
   his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
   us. (Romans v. 8.) Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
   down his life for his friends. (John xv. 13.) Nothing shall be able to
   separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. (Romans
   viii. 35-39.) He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for
   us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
   (Romans vii. 32.) The whole argument of the Apostle in Romans v. 1-1l,
   and especially throughout the eighth chapter, is founded upon this
   infinite and immutable love of God to his people. From this he argues
   their absolute security for time and eternity. Because He thus loved
   them He gave his Son for them; and, having done this, He would
   certainly give them everything necessary for their salvation. No enemy
   should ever prevail against them; nothing could ever separate them from
   his love. This whole argument is utterly irreconcilable with the
   hypothesis that Christ died equally for all men. His death is referred
   to the peculiar love of God to his people, and was the pledge of all
   other saving gifts. This peculiar love of God is not founded upon the
   fact that its objects are believers, for He loved them as enemies, as
   ungodly, and gave his Son to secure their being brought to faith,
   repentance, and complete restoration to the divine image. It cannot,
   therefore, be explained away into mere general benevolence or
   philanthropy. It is a love which secured the communication of Himself
   to its objects, and rendered their salvation certain; and consequently
   could not be bestowed upon all men, indiscriminately. This
   representation is so predominant in the Scriptures, namely, that the
   peculiar love of God to his people, to his Church, to the elect, is the
   source of the gift of Christ, of the mission of the Holy Spirit, and of
   all other saving blessings, that it cannot be ignored in any view of
   the plan and purpose of salvation. With this representation every other
   statement of the Scriptures must be consistent; and therefore the
   theory which denies this great and precious truth, and which assumes
   that the love which secured the gift of God's eternal Son, was mere
   benevolence which had all men for its object, many of whom are allowed
   to perish, must be unscriptural.

   Argument from the Believer's Union with Christ.

   5. Another argument is derived from the nature of the union between
   Christ and his people. The Bible teaches, (1.) That a certain portion
   of the human race were given to Christ. (2.) That they were given to
   Him before the foundation of the world. (3.) That all thus given to Him
   will certainly come to Him and be saved. (4.) That this union, so far
   as it was from eternity, is not a union of nature, nor by faith, nor by
   the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. It was a federal union. (5.) That
   Christ, therefore, was a federal head and representative. As such He
   came into the world, and all He did and suffered was as a
   representative, as a substitute, one acting in the place and for the
   benefit of others. But He was the representative of those given to Him,
   i.e., of those who were in Him. For it was this gift and the union
   consequent upon it, that gave Him his representative character, or
   constituted Him a federal head. He was therefore the federal head, not
   of the human race, but of those given to Him by the Father. And,
   therefore, his work, so far as its main design is concerned, was for
   them alone. Whatever reference it had to others was subordinate and
   incidental. All this is illustrated and proved by the Apostle in Romans
   v. 12-21, in the parallel which he draws between Adam and Christ. All
   mankind were in Adam. He was the federal head and representative of his
   race. All men sinned in him and fell with him in his first
   transgression. The sentence of condemnation for his one offence passed
   upon all men. In like manner Christ was the representative of his
   people. He acted for them. What He did and suffered in their place, or
   as their representative, they in the eye of the law, did and suffered.
   By his obedience they are justified. As all in Adam died, so all in
   Christ are made alive. Such is the nature of the union in both cases,
   that the sin of the one rendered certain and just the death of all
   united to Adam, and the righteousness of the other rendered certain and
   just the salvation of all who are in Him. The sin of Adam did not make
   the condemnation of all men merely possible; it was the ground of their
   actual condemnation. So the righteousness of Christ did not make the
   salvation of men merely possible, it secured the actual salvation of
   those for whom He wrought. As it would be unreasonable to say that Adam
   acted for those who were not in him; so it is unscriptural to say that
   Christ acted for those who were not in Him. Nevertheless, the act of
   Adam as the head and representative of his race, was fruitful of evil
   consequences, not to man only, but to the earth and all that it
   contains; and so the work of Christ is fruitful of good consequences to
   others than those for whom He acted. But this does not justify any one
   in saying that Adam acted as much as the representative of the brute
   creation, as of his posterity; neither does it justify the assertion
   that Christ died for all mankind in the same sense that He died for his
   own people. This is all so clearly revealed in Scripture that it
   extorts the assent of those who are decidedly opposed to the
   Augustinian system. One class of those opponents, of whom Whitby may be
   taken as a representative, admit the truth of all that has been said of
   the representative character of Adam and Christ. But they maintain that
   as Adam represented the whole race, so also did Christ; and as in Adam
   all men die, so in Christ are all made alive. But they say that this
   has nothing to do with spiritual death in the one case, or with the
   salvation of the soul in the other. The death which came on all men for
   the sin of Adam, was merely the death of the body; and the life which
   comes on all through Christ, is the restoration of the life of the body
   at the resurrection. The Wesleyans take the same view of the
   representative character of Christ and of Adam. Each stood for all
   mankind. Adam brings upon all men the guilt of his first sin and
   corruption of nature. Christ secures the removal of the guilt of
   original sin and a seed of grace, or principle of spiritual life, for
   all men. So also one class of Universalists hold that as all men are
   condemned for the sin of Adam, so all are actually saved by the work of
   Christ. Rationalists also are ready to admit that Paul does teach all
   that Augustinians understand him to teach, but they say that this was
   only his Jewish mode of presenting the matter. It is not absolute
   truth, but a mere transient form suited to the age of the Apostles. In
   all these cases, however, the main fact is conceded. Christ did act as
   a representative; and what He did secured with certainty the benefits
   of his work for those for whom He acted. This being conceded, it of
   course follows that He acted as the representative and substitute of
   those only who are ultimately to be saved.

   6. There is another argument on this subject generally presented, which
   ought not to be overlooked. The unity of the priestly office rendered
   the functions of the priesthood inseparable. The high-priest interceded
   for all those for whom he offered sacrifice. The one service did not
   extend beyond the other. He bore upon his breast the names of the
   twelve tribes. He represented them in drawing near to God. He offered
   sacrifices for their sins on the great day of atonement, and for them
   he interceded, and for no others. The sacrifice and the intercession
   went together. What was true of the Aaronic priests, is true of Christ.
   The former, we are told, were the types of the latter. Christ's
   functions as priest are in like manner united. He intercedes for all
   for whom He offered Himself as a sacrifice. He himself, however, says
   expressly, "I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast
   given me." (John xvii. 9.) Him the Father heareth always, and,
   therefore, He cannot be assumed to intercede for those who do not
   actually receive the benefits of his redemption.

   The Church Doctrine embraces all the Facts of the Case.

   7. The final test of any theory is its agreeing or disagreeing with the
   facts to be explained. The difficulty with all the Anti-Augustinian
   views as to the design of Christ's death, is that while they are
   consistent with more or less of the Scriptural facts connected with the
   subject, they are utterly irreconcilable with others not less clearly
   revealed and equally important. They are consistent, for example, with
   the fact that the work of Christ lays the foundation for the offer of
   the gospel to all men, with the fact that men are justly condemned for
   the rejection of that offer; and with the fact that the Scriptures
   frequently assert that the work of Christ had reference to all men. All
   these facts can be accounted for on the assumption, that the great
   design of Christ's death was to make the salvation of all men possible,
   and that it had equal reference to every member of our race. But there
   are other facts which this theory leaves out of view, and with which it
   cannot be reconciled. On the other hand it is claimed that the
   Augustinian doctrine recognizes all the Scriptural assertions connected
   with the subject, and reconciles them all. If this be so, it must be
   the doctrine of the Bible. The facts which are clearly revealed
   concerning the death or work of Christ are, --

   (1.) That God from eternity gave a people to his Son.

   (2.) That the peculiar and infinite love of God to his people is
   declared to be the motive for the gift of his Son; and their salvation
   the design of his mission.

   (3.) That it was as their representative, head, and substitution, He
   came into the world, assumed our nature, fulfilled all righteousness,
   and bore the curse of the law.

   (4.) That the salvation of all given to Him by the Father, is thus
   rendered absolutely certain.

   That the Augustinian scheme agrees with these great Scriptural facts,
   is readily admitted, but it is denied that it accounts for the fact
   that on the ground of the work of Christ, salvation may be offered to
   every human being; and that all who hear and reject the gospel, are
   justly condemned for their unbelief. That these are Scriptural facts
   cannot be denied, and if the Augustinian doctrine does not provide for
   them, it must be false or defective. There are different grounds on
   which it is assumed that the Augustinian doctrine does not provide for
   the universal offer of the gospel. One is, the false assumption that
   Augustinians teach that the satisfaction of Christ was in all respects
   analogous to the payment of a debt, a satisfaction to commutative or
   commercial justice. Hence it is inferred that Christ suffered so much
   for so many; He paid so much for one soul, and so much for another, and
   of course He would have been called upon to pay more if more were to
   have been saved. If this be so, then it is clear that the work of
   Christ can justify the offer of salvation to those only whose debts He
   has actually cancelled. To this view of the case it may be remarked, --

   1. That this doctrine was never held by any historical church and the
   ascription of it to Augustinians can only be accounted for on the
   ground of ignorance.

   2. It involves the greatest confusion of ideas. It confounds the
   obligations which arise among men as owners of property, with the
   obligations of rational creatures to an infinitely holy God. A debtor
   is one owner, and a creditor is another. Commutative justice requires
   that they should settle their mutual claims equitably. But God is not
   one owner and the sinner another. They do not stand in relation to each
   other as two proprietors. The obligation which binds a debtor to pay a
   creditor, and the principle which impels a just God to punish sin, are
   entirely distinct. God is the absolute owner of all things. We own
   nothing. We cannot sustain to him, in this respect, the relation of a
   debtor to his creditor. The objection in question, therefore, is
   founded on an entire mistake or misrepresentation of the attribute of
   justice, to which, according to Augustinians, the satisfaction of
   Christ is rendered. Because the sin of Adam was the ground of the
   condemnation of his race, does any man infer that He sinned so much for
   one man and so much for another? Why then should it be said that
   because the righteousness of Christ is the judicial ground of our
   salvation, that He did and suffered so much for one man and so much for
   another?

   3. As this objection is directed against a theory which no Church has
   ever adopted, and as it attributes to God a form of justice which
   cannot possibly belong to Him, so it is contrary to those Scriptural
   representations on which the Augustinian doctrine is founded. The
   Scriptures teach that Christ saves us as a priest, by offering Himself
   as a sacrifice for our sins. But a sacrifice was not a payment of a
   debt, the payment of so much for so much. A single victim was sometimes
   a sacrifice for one individual; sometimes for the whole people. On the
   great day of atonement the scape-goat bore the sins of the people,
   whether they were more or less numerous. It had no reference at all to
   the number of persons for whom atonement was to be made. So Christ bore
   the sins of his people; whether they were to be a few hundreds, or
   countless millions, or the whole human family, makes no difference as
   to the nature of his work, or as to the value of his satisfaction. What
   was absolutely necessary for one, was abundantly sufficient for all.

   The objection, however, is at times presented in a somewhat different
   form. Admitting the satisfaction of Christ to be in itself of infinite
   value, how can it avail for the non-elect if it was not designed for
   them? It does not avail for the fallen angels, because it was not
   intended for them; how then can it avail for the non-elect, if not
   designed for them? How can a ransom, whatever its intrinsic value,
   benefit those for whom it was not paid? In this form the objection is
   far more specious. It is, however, fallacious. It overlooks the
   peculiar nature of the case. It ignores the fact that all mankind were
   placed under the same constitution or covenant. What was demanded for
   the salvation of one was demanded for the salvation of all. Every man
   is required to satisfy the demands of the law. No man is required to do
   either more or less. If those demands are satisfied by a representative
   or substitute, his work is equally available for all. The secret
   purpose of God in providing such a substitute for man, has nothing to
   do with the nature of his work, or with its appropriateness. The
   righteousness of Christ being of infinite value or merit, and being in
   its nature precisely what all men need, may be offered to all men. It
   is thus offered to the elect and to the non-elect; and it is offered to
   both classes conditionally. That condition is a cordial acceptance of
   it as the only ground of justification. If any of the elect (being
   adults) fail thus to accept of it, they perish. If any of the non-elect
   should believe, they would be saved. What more does any
   Anti-Augustinian scheme provide? The advocates of such schemes say,
   that the design of the work of Christ was to render the salvation of
   all men possible. All they can mean by this is, that if any man (elect
   or non-elect) believes, he shall, on the ground of what Christ has
   done, be certainly saved. But Augustinians say the same thing. Their
   doctrine provides for this universal offer of salvation, as well as any
   other scheme. It teaches that God in effecting the salvation of his own
   people, did whatever was necessary for the salvation of all men, and
   therefore to all the offer may be, and in fact is made in the gospel.
   If a ship containing the wife and children of a man standing on the
   shore is wrecked, he may seize a boat and hasten to their rescue. His
   motive is love to his family; his purpose is to save them. But the boat
   which he has provided may be large enough to receive the whole of the
   ship's company. Would there be any inconsistency in his offering them
   the opportunity to escape? Or, would this offer prove that he had no
   special love to his own family and no special design to secure their
   safety. And if any or all of those to whom the offer was made, should
   refuse to accept it, some from one reason, some from another; some
   because they did not duly appreciate their danger; some because they
   thought they could save themselves; and some from enmity to the man
   from whom the offer came, their guilt and folly would be just as great
   as though the man had no special regard to his own family, and no
   special purpose to effect their deliverance. Or, if a man's family were
   with others held in captivity, and from love to them and with the
   purpose of their redemption, a ransom should be offered sufficient for
   the delivery of the whole body of captives, it is plain that the offer
   of deliverance might be extended to all on the ground of that ransom,
   although specially intended only for a part of their number. Or, a man
   may make a feast for his own friends, and the provision be so abundant
   that he may throw open his doors to all who are willing to come. This
   is precisely what God, according to the Augustinian doctrine, has
   actually done. Out of special love to his people, and with the design
   of securing their salvation, He has sent his Son to do what justifies
   the offer of salvation to all who choose to accept of it. Christ,
   therefore, did not die equally for all men. He laid down his life for
   his sheep; He gave Himself for his Church. But in perfect consistency
   with all this, He did all that was necessary, so far as a satisfaction
   to justice is concerned, all that is required for the salvation of all
   men. So that all Augustinians can join with the Synod of Dort in
   saying, "No man perishes for want of an atonement."

   If the Atonement be limited in Design, it must be restricted in the
   Offer.

   There is still another ground on which it is urged that Augustinians
   cannot consistently preach the gospel to every creature. Augustinians
   teach, it is urged, that the work of Christ is a satisfaction to divine
   justice. From this it follows that justice cannot condemn those for
   whose sins it has been satisfied. It cannot demand that satisfaction
   twice, first from the substitute and then from the sinner himself. This
   would be manifestly unjust, far worse than demanding no punishment at
   all. From this it is inferred that the satisfaction or righteousness of
   Christ, if the ground on which a sinner may be forgiven, is the ground
   on which he must be forgiven. It is not the ground on which he may be
   forgiven, unless it is the ground on which he must be forgiven. If the
   atonement be limited in design it must be limited in its nature, and if
   limited in its nature it must be limited in its offer. This objection
   again arises from confounding a pecuniary and a judicial satisfaction
   between which Augustinians are so careful to discriminate. This
   distinction has already been presented on a previous page (470). There
   is no grace in accepting a pecuniary satisfaction. It cannot be
   refused. It ipso facto liberates. The moment the debt is paid the
   debtor is free; and that without any condition. Nothing of this is true
   in the case of judicial satisfaction. If a substitute be provided and
   accepted it is a matter of grace. His satisfaction does not ipso facto
   liberate. It may accrue to the benefit of those for whom it is made at
   once or at a remote period; completely or gradually; on conditions or
   unconditionally; or it may never benefit them at all unless the
   condition on which its application is suspended be performed. These
   facts are universally admitted by those who hold that the work of
   Christ was a true and perfect satisfaction to divine justice. The
   application of its benefits is determined by the covenant between the
   Father and the Son. Those for whom it was specially rendered are not
   justified from eternity; they are not born in a justified state; they
   are by nature, or birth, the children of wrath even as others. To be
   the children of wrath is to be justly exposed to divine wrath. They
   remain in this state of exposure until they believe, and should they
   die (unless in infancy) before they believe they would inevitably
   perish notwithstanding the satisfaction made for their sins. It is the
   stipulations of the covenant which forbid such a result. Such being the
   nature of the judicial satisfaction rendered by Christ to the law,
   under which all men are placed, it may be sincerely offered to all men
   with the assurance that if they believe it shall accrue to their
   salvation. His work being specially designed for the salvation of his
   own people, renders, through the conditions of the covenant, that event
   certain; but this is perfectly consistent with its being made the
   ground of the general offer of the gospel. Lutherans and Reformed agree
   entirely, as before stated, in their views of the nature of the
   satisfaction of Christ, and consequently, so far as that point is
   concerned, there is the same foundation for the general offer of the
   gospel according to either scheme. What the Reformed or Augustinians
   hold about election does not affect the nature of the atonement. That
   remains the same whether designed for the elect or for all mankind. It
   does not derive its nature from the secret purpose of God as to its
   application.

   Certain Passages of Scripture considered.

   Admitting, however, that the Augustinian doctrine that Christ died
   specially for his own people does account for the general offer of the
   gospel, how is it to be reconciled with those passages which. in one
   form or another, teach that He died for all men? In answer to this
   question, it may be remarked in the first place that Augustinians do
   not deny that Christ died for all men. What they deny is that he died
   equally, and with the same design, for all men. He died for all, that
   He might arrest the immediate execution of the penalty of the law upon
   the whole of our apostate race; that He might secure for men the
   innumerable blessings attending their state on earth, which, in one
   important sense, is a state of probation; and that He might lay the
   foundation for the offer of pardon and reconciliation with God, on
   condition of faith and repentance. These are the universally admitted
   consequences of his satisfaction, and therefore they all come within
   its design. By this dispensation it is rendered manifest to every
   intelligent mind in heaven and upon earth, and to the finally
   impenitent themselves, that the perdition of those that perish is their
   own fault. They will not come to Christ that they may have life. They
   refuse to have Him to reign over them. He calls but they will not
   answer. He says, "Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out."
   Every human being who does come is saved. This is what is meant when it
   is said, or implied in Scripture, that Christ gave Himself as a
   propitiation, not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole
   world. He was a propitiation effectually for the sins of his peop1e,
   and sufficiently for the sins of the whole world. Augustinians have no
   need to wrest the Scriptures. They are under no necessity of departing
   from their fundamental principle that it is the duty of the theologian
   to subordinate his theories to the Bible, and teach not what seems to
   him to be true or reasonable, but simply what the Bible teaches.

   But, in the second place, it is to be remarked that general terms are
   often used indefinitely and not comprehensively. They mean all kinds,
   or classes, and not all and every individual. When Christ said, "I, if
   I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me," He meant men
   of all ages, classes, and conditions, and not every individual man.
   When God predicted that upon the advent of the Messiah He would pour
   out his Spirit upon all flesh, all that was foretold was a general
   effusion of the Holy Ghost. And when it is said that all men shall see
   (experience) the salvation of God, it does not mean that all men
   individually, but that a vast multitude of all classes shall be saved.
   The same remark applies to the use of the term world. It means men,
   mankind, as a race or order of beings. No one hesitates to call the
   Lord Jesus the "Salvator hominum." He is so hailed and so worshipped
   wherever his name is known. But no one means by this that He actually
   saves all mankind. What is meant is that He is our Saviour, the Saviour
   of men, not of angels, not of Jews exclusively, nor yet of the Gentiles
   only, not of the rich, or of the poor alone, not of the righteous only,
   but also of publicans and sinners. He is the Saviour of all men who
   come unto Him. Thus when He is called the Lamb of God that bears the
   sin of the world, all that is meant is that He bears the sins of men;
   He came as a sin-offering bearing not his own, but the sins of others.

   In the third place, these general terms are always to be understood in
   reference to the things spoken of in the context. When all things, the
   universe, is said to be put in subjection to Christ it is, of course,
   to be understood of the created universe. In 1 Corinthians xv. 27, Paul
   expressly mentions this limitation, but in Hebrews ii. 8, it is not
   mentioned. It is, however, just as obviously involved in the one
   passage as in the other. When in Romans v. 18, it is said that by the
   righteousness of Christ the free gift of justification of life has come
   upon all men, it is of necessity limited to the all in Christ of whom
   the Apostle is speaking. So also in 1 Corinthians xv. 22, As in Adam
   all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive (zoopoiethesontai,
   i.e., quickened with the life of Christ), it is in both members of the
   sentence not absolutely all, but the all in Adam and the all in Christ.
   This is still more obvious in Romans viii. 32, where it is said that
   God gave up his own Son for us all. The us refers to the class of
   persons of which the whole chapter treats, namely, of those to whom
   there is no condemnation, who are led by the Spirit, for whom Christ
   intercedes, etc. Ephesians i. 10, and Colossians i. 20, are favourite
   texts with the Universalists, for they teach that all in heaven and on
   earth are reunited unto God by Jesus Christ. They are right in
   understanding these passages as teaching the salvation of all men, if
   by all in this connection we must understand all human beings. But why
   limit the word to all men? Why not include angels and even irrational
   creatures? The answer is, because the Bible teaches that Christ came to
   save men, and neither angels nor irrational animals. This is only
   saying that all must be limited to the objects of redemption. Who they
   are is to be learned not from these general terms, but from the general
   teaching of Scripture. The all who are to he united in one harmonious
   body by Jesus Christ are the all whom He came to save. The same remark
   applies to Hebrews ii. 9, Christ tasted "death (huper pantos) for every
   man." It is well known that Origen understood this of every creature;
   others, of every rational creature; others, of every fallen rational
   creature; others, of every man; others, of every one of those given to
   the Son by the Father. How are we to decide which of these
   interpretations is correct? So far as the mere signification of the
   words is concerned, one is as correct as another. It is only from the
   analogy of Scripture that the meaning of the sacred writer can be
   determined. Christ tasted death for every one of the objects of
   redemption. Whether He came to redeem all created sensuous beings, or
   all rational creatures, or all men, or all given to Him in the councils
   of eternity, the Bible must decide. The great majority of the passages
   quoted to prove that Christ died equally for all men come under one or
   other of the classes just mentioned, and have no real bearing on the
   question concerning the design of his death.

   There is another class of passages with which it is said that the
   Augustinian doctrine cannot be reconciled; such, namely, as speak of
   those perishing for whom Christ died. In reference to these passages it
   may be remarked, first, that there is a sense, as before stated, in
   which Christ did die for all men. His death had the effect of
   justifying the offer of salvation to every man; and of course was
   designed to have that effect. He therefore died sufficiently for all.
   In the second place, these passages are, in some cases at least,
   hypothetical. When Paul exhorts the Corinthians not to cause those to
   perish for whom Christ died, he merely exhorts them not to act
   selfishly towards those for whom Christ had exhibited the greatest
   compassion. The passage neither asserts nor implies that any actually
   perish for whom Christ died. None perish whom He came to save;
   multitudes perish to whom salvation is offered on the ground of his
   death.

   As God in the course of nature and in the dispensation of his
   providence, moves on in undisturbed majesty, little concerned at the
   apparent complication or even inconsistency of one effect or one
   dispensation with another; so the Spirit of God in the Bible unfolds
   the purposes, truths, and dealings of God, just as they are, assured
   that even finite minds will ultimately be able to see the consistency
   of all his revelations. The doctrines of foreordination, sovereignty,
   and effectual providential control, go hand in hand with those of the
   liberty and responsibility of rational creatures. Those of freedom from
   the law, of salvation by faith without works, and of the absolute
   necessity of holy living stand side by side. On the same page we find
   the assurance of God's love to sinners, and declarations that He would
   that all men should come unto Him and live, with explicit assertions
   that He has determined to leave multitudes to perish in their sins. In
   like manner, the express declarations that it was the incomprehensible
   and peculiar love of God for his own people, which induced Him to send
   his Son for their redemption; that Christ came into the world for that
   specific object; that He died for his sheep; that He gave Himself for
   his Church; and that the salvation of all for whom He thus offered
   Himself is rendered certain by the gift of the Spirit to bring them to
   faith and repentance, are intermingled with declarations of good-will
   to all mankind, with offers of salvation to every one who will believe
   in the Son of God, and denunciations of wrath against those who reject
   these overtures of mercy. All we have to do is not to ignore or deny
   either of these modes of representation, but to open our minds wide
   enough to receive them both, and reconcile them as best we can. Both
   are true, in all the cases above referred to, whether we can see their
   consistency or not.

   In the review of this subject, it is plain that the doctrine that
   Christ died equally for all men with the purpose of rendering the
   salvation of all possible, has no advantage over the doctrine that He
   died specially for his own people, and with the purpose of rendering
   their salvation certain. It presents no higher view of the love of God,
   or of the value of Christ's work. It affords no better ground for the
   offer of salvation "to every creature," nor does it render more obvious
   the justice of the condemnation of those who reject the gospel. They
   are condemned by God, angels, and all men, and by their own
   consciences, because they refuse to believe that Jesus is the Son of
   God, God manifest in the flesh, and to love, worship, trust, and obey
   Him accordingly. The opposite, or anti-Augustinian doctrine, is founded
   on a partial view of the facts of the case. It leaves out of view the
   clearly revealed special love of God to his peculiar people; the union
   between Christ and his chosen; the representative character which He
   assumed as their substitute; the certain efficacy of his sacrifice in
   virtue of the covenant of redemption; and the necessary connection
   between the gift of Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit. It moreover
   leads to confused and inconsistent views of the plan of salvation, and
   to unscriptural and dangerous theories of the nature of the atonement.
   It therefore is the limited and meagre scheme; whereas the orthodox
   doctrine is catholic and comprehensive; full of consolation and
   spiritual power, as well as of justice to all mankind.

CHAPTER IX.

  THEORIES OF THE ATONEMENT.

   The history of this doctrine is commonly divided into three per nods,
   the Patristic; the Scholastic; and the time of the Reformation and from
   that event to the present day. The method which the writers on this
   subject have usually adopted, is to pass in review in chronological
   order the distinguished theologians living during these several
   periods, and present a general outline of the teaching of each.

   The two great objects to be accomplished by the work of Christ are, the
   removal of the curse under which mankind laboured on account of sin;
   and their restoration to the image and fellowship of God. Both these
   are essential to salvation. We have guilt to be removed, and souls dead
   in sin to be quickened with a new principle of divine life. Both these
   objects are provided for in the doctrine of redemption as presented in
   the Scriptures and held in the Church. In the opposing theories devised
   by theologians, either one of these objects is ignored or one is unduly
   subordinated to the other. It was characteristic of the early Greek
   church to exalt the latter, while the Latin made the former the more
   prominent. In reviewing the history of the doctrine it will be found
   that there are five general theories which comprise all the numerous
   forms in which it has been held.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Orthodox View.

   The first is that which has been for ages regarded as the orthodox
   doctrine; in its essential features common to the Latin, Lutheran, and
   Reformed churches. This is the doctrine which the writer has
   endeavoured to exhibit and vindicate in the preceding pages. According
   to this doctrine the work of Christ is a real satisfaction, of infinite
   inherent merit, to the vindicatory justice of God; so that He saves his
   people by doing for them, and in their stead, what they were unable to
   do for themselves, satisfying the demands of the law in their behalf,
   and bearing its penalty in their stead; whereby they are reconciled to
   God, receive the Holy Ghost, and are made partakers of the life of
   Christ to their present sanctification and eternal salvation.

   This doctrine provides for both the great objects above mentioned. It
   shows how the curse of the law is removed by Christ's being made a
   curse for us; and how in virtue of this reconciliation with God we
   become, through the Spirit, partakers of the life of Christ. He is made
   unto us not only righteousness, but sanctification. We are cleansed by
   his blood from guilt, and renewed by his Spirit after the image of God.
   Having died in Him, we live in Him. Participation of his death secures
   participation of his life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Doctrine of some of the Fathers.

   The second theory is that which prevailed extensively among the
   fathers. It was intended only as a solution of the question how Christ
   delivers us from the power of Satan. It contemplated neither the
   removal of guilt nor the restoration of divine life; but simply our
   deliverance from the power of Satan. It was founded on those passages
   of Scriptures which represent man since the fall as in bondage to the
   prince of darkness. The object of redemption was to deliver mankind
   from this bondage. This could only be done by in some way overcoming
   Satan and destroying his right or power to hold men as his slaves. This
   Christ has effected, and thus becomes the Redeemer of men. This general
   theory is presented in three different forms. The first appeals to the
   old principle of the rights of war, according to which the conquered
   became the slaves of the conqueror. Satan conquered Adam, and thus
   became the rightful owner of him and his posterity. Hence he is called
   the god and prince of this world. To deliver men from this dreaded
   bondage, Christ offered Himself as a ransom to Satan. Satan accepted
   the offer, and renounced his right to retain mankind as his slaves.
   Christ, however, broke the bonds of Satan, whose power was founded upon
   the sinfulness of his subjects. Christ being divine, and without sin,
   could not be held subject to his power. In answer to the question, How
   Satan could accept Christ as the ransom for men, if he knew Him to be a
   divine person? it was said that he did not know Him to be divine,
   because his divinity was veiled by his humanity. And then in answer to
   the question, How he could accept of Him as a ransom, if he regarded
   Him as merely a man? it is said that he saw that Christ was unspeakably
   superior to other men, and perhaps one of the higher order of angels,
   whom he might hope securely to retain. The second form of this theory
   does not regard Christ as a ransom paid to Satan, but as a conqueror.
   As Satan conquered mankind and made them his slaves; so Christ became a
   man, and, in our nature, conquered Satan; and thus acquired the right
   to deliver as from our bondage and to consign Satan himself to chains
   and darkness.

   The third form of the theory is, that as the right and power of Satan
   over man is founded on sin, he exceeded his authority when he brought
   about the death of Christ, who was free from all sin; and thus justly
   forfeited his authority over men altogether. This general theory that
   Christ's great work, as a Redeemer, was to deliver man from bondage to
   Satan, and that the ransom was paid to Him and not to God; or that the
   difficulty in the way of our salvation was the right which Satan had
   acquired to us as slaves, which right Christ in some way cancelled, was
   very prevalent for a long time in the Church. It is found in Irenæus,
   Origen, Theodoret, Basil, Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine, Jerome,
   Hilary, Leo the Great, and others. [441] The Scriptural foundation for
   this view of the work of Christ is very slight. It is true that men are
   the captives of Satan, and under his dominion. It is true that Christ
   gave Himself as a ransom; and that by the payment of that ransom wc are
   freed from bondage to the prince of darkness. But it does not follow
   that the ransom was paid to Satan, or that he had any just claim to his
   authority over the children of men. What the Scriptures teach on this
   subject is, --

   1. That man by sin became subject to the penalty of the divine law.

   2. That Satan has the office of inflicting that penalty in so far as he
   is allowed to torment and degrade the children of men.

   3. That Christ by his death having satisfied the penalty of the law, of
   course has delivered us from the power of Satan. See especially Hebrews
   ii. 14. But this gives no ground for the doctrine that Satan had any
   claim in justice to hold mankind as his slaves; or that Christ offered
   Himself as a ransom to the prince of this world. This doctrine was
   strenuously opposed in the early Church by Gregory of Nyssa, and has
   long since passed into oblivion. The only interest which it now has is
   as a matter of history. It is of course not to be supposed that the
   great lights of the Church above mentioned believed that the whole work
   of Christ as the Saviour of men consisted in his delivering us from the
   power of Satan; that they ignored his office as a high priest unto God,
   or denied the effect of his death as an expiation for sin, or forgot
   that He is to us the source of spiritual life. These doctrines are as
   clearly asserted by them from time to time as are their peculiar views
   as to our deliverance from the bondage of Satan. Even Origen, so
   unrestrained in his thinking, and so disposed to explain Christian
   truths philosophically, teaches the catholic doctrine with perfect
   distinctness. In his comment on Romans iii. 25, 26, he says, [442] "Cum
   dixisset, quod pro omni genere humano redemptionem semetipsum dedisset,
   . . . . nunc addit aliquid sublimius et dicit, quia proposuit eum Deus
   propitiationem per fidem in sanguine ipsius:' quo scilicet per hostiam
   sui corporis propitium hominibus faceret Deum, et per hoc ostenderet
   justitiam suam. . . . . Deus enim justus est, et justus justificare non
   poterat injustos, ideo interventum voluit esse propitiatoris, ut per
   ejus fidem justificarentur qui per opera propria justificari non
   poterant." No one of the Reformers gives a clearer utterance to the
   truth than is contained in these words. So also he says, [443] "Posuit
   ergo et manum suam super caput vituli: hoc est peccata generis humani
   imposuit super caput suum. Ipse est enim caput corporis ecclesiæ suæ."
   In all ages of the Church, by the early fathers as well as in
   subsequent periods, the language of the New Testament in reference to
   Christ and his work is retained. He is familiarly called priest, and
   high priest, and held up as a sacrifice for sin, as a redeemer, as a
   ransom, and as one who cancelled our debts. As the early fathers were
   conversant with sacrifices, and knew the light in which they were
   regarded by the ancient world, that both heathen and Jewish sacrifices
   were expiatory, there is little doubt that the fathers, in calling
   Christ a sacrifice, meant to recognize Him as an expiation for our
   sins, although it is admitted that great vagueness, variety, and
   inconsistency prevail in their utterances on this subject. The whole
   activity of the cultivated minds was in the early ages directed first
   to the doctrines of the Trinity and of the person of Christ, and
   subsequently to those concerning sin and grace.

   § 3. The Moral Theory.

   A third general theory concerning the work of Christ is that which
   rejects all idea of expiation, or of the satisfaction of justice by
   vicarious punishment, and attributes all the efficacy of his work to
   the moral effect produced on the hearts of men by his character,
   teachings, and acts. On this account it is usually designated the
   "moral view of the atonement." The assumption is that there is no such
   attribute in God as justice; i.e., no perfection which renders it
   necessary, or morally obligatory, that sin should be punished. If this
   be so, there is no need of expiation in order to forgiveness. All that
   is necessary for the restoration of sinners to the favour of God is
   that they should cease to be sinners God's relation to his rational
   creatures is determined by their character. If they are morally corrupt
   they are repelled from his presence; if restored to holiness, they
   become the objects of his love and the recipients of his favours. All
   that Christ as the Saviour of men, therefore, came to accomplish was
   this moral reformation in the character of men. Here, as so generally
   elsewhere, errors are half truths. It is true that God's relation to
   his rational creatures is determined by their character. It is true
   that He repels sinners, and holds communion with the holy. It is true
   that Christ came to restore men to holiness, and thus to the favour and
   fellowship of God. But it is also true that to render the restoration
   of sinners to holiness possible it was necessary that the guilt of
   their sins should be expiated, or that justice should be satisfied.
   Until this is done, they are under the wrath and curse of God. And to
   be under the curse of God is to be shut out from the source of all
   holiness.

   Some of the advocates of this view of the work of Christ do indeed
   speak freely of the justice of God. They recognize Him as a just Being
   who everywhere and always punishes sin. But this is done only by the
   operation of eternal laws. Holiness, from its nature, produces
   happiness; and that is its reward. Sin, from its nature, produces
   misery; and that is its punishment. Remove the sin and you remove the
   punishment. The case is analogous to health and disease. If a man is
   well, he is physically happy; if diseased, he is in a state of
   suffering. The only way possible to remove the suffering is to remove
   the disease; and further than this nothing can be required. This is the
   view presented by John Young, D. D. [444] He says, "There is no such
   attribute in God [as rectilineal justice.] But the inevitable
   punishment of moral evil always and everywhere, is certain
   nevertheless. The justice of the universe is a tremendous fact, an
   eternal and necessary fact which even God could not set aside. There is
   an irresistible, a real force springing out of its essential
   constitution whereby sin punishes sin. This is the fixed law of the
   moral universe, a law in perfect harmony with the eternal will, and
   which never is and never can be broken. God's mercy in our Lord Jesus
   Christ does not in the least set aside this justice; what it does is to
   remove and render non-existent the only ground on which the claim of
   justice stands. Instead of arbitrarily withdrawing the criminal from
   punishment, it destroys in his soul that evil which is the only cause
   and reason of punishment, and which being removed punishment ceases of
   itself." The same doctrine is taught by Dr. Bushnell. [445] Speaking of
   Christ, he says, "His work terminates, not in the release of penalties
   by due compensation, but in the transformation of character, and the
   rescue, in that manner, of guilty men from the retributive causations
   provoked by their sins." Remission is declared to be "spiritual
   release;" a deliverance from sin which secures exemption from the
   natural effects of transgression. This system necessarily excludes the
   idea of forgiveness in the ordinary sense of the word. To subdue
   inflammation in a wound removes the pain; to remove sin from the soul
   secures exemption from the pain which sin necessarily produces. The
   idea of pardon, in the latter case, is as incongruous as in the former.
   The Bible, however, is full of the promises of forgiveness and of the
   prayers of the penitent for pardoning mercy. It is very plain,
   therefore, that this scheme does not agree with the Scriptures; and it
   is equally plain that it is not a religion suited to those who feel the
   need of forgiveness.

   Coleridge, in his "Aids to Reflection," presents the same view. In a
   note at the end of that work he gives the following illustration of the
   subject. A widow has a prodigal son, who deserts her and leaves her
   desolate. That son has a friend who takes his place and performs all
   filial duties to the unhappy mother. The prodigal, won by the
   exhibition of goodness on the part of his friend, returns to his home
   penitent and reformed. How unreasonable and revolting, says Coleridge,
   would it be to say that the friend had made expiation or rendered a
   satisfaction to justice for the sins of the prodigal.

   This moral view of the atonement, as it is called, has been presented
   in different forms. In the first form the work of Christ in the
   salvation of men is confined to his office of teacher. He introduced a
   new and higher form of religion, by which men were redeemed from the
   darkness and degradation of heathenism. This was so great a good, and
   so patent to the eyes of those who themselves were converts from
   heathenism, and who were surrounded by its evils, that it is not
   wonderful that some of the fathers exalted this function of Christ as a
   saviour, almost to the neglect of every other. In the early Church,
   however, frequent as were the recognitions of the obligations of men to
   Christ as the Redeemer from heathenism, He was still regarded by all
   Christians as a sacrifice and a ransom. In later times these latter
   aspects of his work were rejected and the former only retained.

   A second form of this theory, while it retains the idea that the real
   benefit conferred by Christ was his doctrine, yet ascribes his title of
   Saviour principally to his death. As the Scriptures so constantly
   assert that we are saved by the blood, the cross, the sufferings of
   Christ, this feature of the Scriptural teaching cannot be overlooked.
   It is therefore said that He saves us, not as a sacrifice, but as a
   martyr. He died for us. By his death his doctrines were sealed with
   blood. Not only, therefore, as attesting his own sincerity, but as
   giving assurance of the truths which He taught, especially the truths
   concerning a future life, the love of God, and his willingness to
   forgive sin, and as confirming to us the truth of those doctrines He is
   entitled to be regarded as the Saviour of men.

   Thirdly, others again regard the power of Christ in saving men from
   sin, as not due to his teaching, or to his sealing his doctrines with
   his blood, but to the manifestation which He made of self-sacrificing
   love. This exerts a greater power over the hearts of men than all else
   besides. If the wicked cannot be reclaimed by love, which manifests
   itself not only in words of gentleness, by acts of kindness, and by
   expressions of sympathy, but also by entire self-sacrifice, by the
   renunciation of all good, and by voluntary submission to all evil,
   their case must be hopeless. As such love as that of Christ was never
   before exhibited to men; as no such instance of self-sacrifice had ever
   before occurred, or can ever occur again, He is the Saviour by way of
   eminence. Other men, who through love submit to self-denial for the
   good of men, are within their sphere and in their measure, saviours
   too; the work of salvation by the exhibition of self-sacrificing love,
   is going on around us continually, and from eternity to eternity, so
   long as evil exists, in the presence of beings imbued with love. Still
   Christ in his work occupies a place peculiar and preeminent, and
   therefore we are Christians; we recognize Christ as the greatest of
   Saviours.

   Such is the view elaborately presented by Dr. Bushnell in the work just
   referred to. Toward the end of his book, however, he virtually takes it
   all back, and lays down his weapons, conquered by the instincts of his
   own religious nature and by the authority of the Word of God. He says,
   "In the facts [of our Lord's passion], outwardly regarded, there is no
   sacrifice, or oblation, or atonement, or propitiation, but simply a
   living and dying thus and thus. The facts are impressive; the person is
   clad in a wonderful dignity and beauty; the agony is eloquent of love;
   and the cross a very shocking murder triumphantly met. And if then the
   question arises, how we are to use such a history so as to be
   reconciled by it, we hardly know in what way to begin. How shall we
   come unto God by help of this martyrdom? How shall we turn it, or turn
   ourselves under it, so as to be justified and set in peace with God?
   Plainly there is a want here, and this want is met by giving a
   thought-form to the facts which is not in the facts themselves. They
   are put directly into the moulds of the altar, and we are called to
   accept the crucified God-man as our sacrifice, an offering or oblation
   for us, our propitiation; so as to be sprinkled from our evil
   conscience, washed, purged, purified, cleansed from our sin. Instead of
   leaving the matter of the facts just as they occurred, there is a
   reverting to familiar forms of thought, made familiar partly for this
   purpose; and we are told, in brief, to use the facts just as we would
   the sin-offerings of the altar, and make an altar grace of them, only a
   grace complete and perfect, an offering once for all. . . . . So much
   is there in this that, without these forms of the altar, we should be
   utterly at a loss in making any use of the Christian facts, that would
   set us in a condition of practical reconciliation with God. Christ is
   good, beautiful, wonderful, his disinterested love is a picture by
   itself, his forgiving patience melts into my feeling, his passion rends
   open my heart, but what is He for, and how shall He be made unto me the
   salvation I want? One word -- He is my sacrifice -- opens all to me,
   and beholding Him, with all my sin upon Him, I count Him my offering, I
   come unto God by Him and enter into the holiest by his blood." "We want
   to use these altar terms just as freely as they are used by those who
   accept the formula of expiation or judicial satisfaction for sin; in
   just their manner too, when they are using them most practically." "We
   cannot afford to lose these sacred forms of the altar. They fill an
   office which nothing else can fill, and serve a use which cannot be
   served without them." [446]

   Objections to this Theory.

   The obvious objections to this moral view of the atonement in all its
   forms, are, --

   1. That while it retains some elements of the truth, in that it
   recognizes the restoration of man to holiness and God, as the great end
   of the work of Christ, and regards his work as involving the greatest
   possible or conceivable manifestation of divine love, which
   manifestation is the most powerful of all natural influences to operate
   on the hearts of men; yet it leaves out entirely what is essential to
   the Scriptural doctrine of atonement. The Bible exhibits Christ as a
   priest, as offering Himself a sacrifice for the expiation of our sins,
   as bearing our sins in his own body on the tree, as having been made a
   curse for us, and as giving Himself is a ransom for our redemption. The
   Scriptures teach that this expiation of guilt is absolutely necessary
   before the souls of the guilty can be made the subjects of renewing and
   sanctifying grace. Before this expiation they are spiritually dead
   under the penalty of the law, which is death in all its forms. And
   therefore while thus under the curse, all the moral influences in the
   world would be as useless as noonday light to give sight to the blind,
   or sanitary measures to raise the dead. In rejecting, therefore, the
   doctrine of expiation, or satisfaction to justice, this theory rejects
   the very essence of the Scriptural doctrine of atonement.

   2. This theory does not meet the necessities of our condition. We are
   sinners; we are guilty as well as polluted. The consciousness of our
   responsibility to justice, and of the necessity of satisfying its
   demands, is as undeniable and as indestructible as our consciousness of
   pollution. Expiation for the one is as much a necessity as
   sanctification for the other. No form of religion, therefore, which
   excludes the idea of expiation, or which fails to provide for the
   removal of guilt in a way which satisfies the reason and conscience,
   can be suited to our necessities. No such religion has ever prevailed
   among men, or can by possibility give peace to a burdened conscience.
   It is because the Lord Jesus Christ is revealed as a propitiation for
   our sins, as bearing in our stead the penalty which we had incurred,
   that his blood cleanses us from all sin, and gives that peace which
   passes all understanding.

   The idea that there is no forgiveness with God; that by inexorable law
   He deals with his creatures according to their subjective state and
   character, and that therefore the only salvation necessary or possible
   is sanctification, is appalling. No man is in such an inward state,
   either during life or at death, that he can stand before God to be
   dealt with according to that state. His only hope is that God will, and
   does, deal with his people, not as they are in themselves, but as they
   are in Christ, and for his sake; that He loves and has fellowship with
   us although polluted and defiled, as a parent loves and delights in a
   misshapen and unattractive child. We should be now and always in hell,
   if the doctrine of Dr. Young were true, that justice by an inexorable
   law always takes effect, and that sin is always punished wherever it
   exists, as soon as it is manifested, and as long as it continues. God
   is something more than the moral order of the universe; He does not
   administer his moral government by inexorable laws over which He has no
   control. He can have mercy on whom He will have mercy, and compassion
   on whom He will have compassion. He can and does render sinners happy,
   in spite of their sin, for Christ's sake, remitting to them its penalty
   while its power is only partially broken; fostering them, and rejoicing
   over them until their restoration to spiritual health be completed.
   Anything that turns the sinner's regard inward on himself as a ground
   of hope, instead of bidding him took to Christ, must plunge him into
   despair, and despair is the portal of eternal death. In any view,
   therefore, whether as bold rationalistic Deism, or as the most
   high-toned portraiture of divine love, the moral theory of the
   atonement presents no rational, because no Scriptural, ground for a
   sinner's hope toward God. He must have a better righteousness than his
   own. He must have some one to appear before God in his stead to make
   expiation for sin, and to secure for him, independently of his own
   subjective state, the full pardon of all his offences, and the gift of
   the Holy Ghost.

   3. All the arguments presented on the preceding pages, in favour of the
   doctrine of expiation, are of course arguments against a theory which
   rejects that doctrine. Besides, this theory evidently changes the whole
   plan of salvation. It alters all our relations to Christ, as our head
   and representative, and the ground of our acceptance with God; and
   consequently it changes the nature of religion. Christianity is one
   thing if Christ is a sacrifice for sin; and altogether a different
   thing if He is only a moral reformer, an example, a teacher, or even a
   martyr. We need a divine Saviour if He is to bear our iniquities, and
   to make satisfaction for the sins of the world; but a human saviour is
   all that is needed if the moral theory of the atonement is to be
   adopted. Gieseler says, what every Christian knows must be true without
   being told, that the fathers in treating of the qualifications of
   Christ as a Saviour, insisted that He must be, (1.) God; (2.) a man;
   and (3.) as man free from sin. [447] It is a historical fact that the
   two doctrines of the divinity of Christ, and expiation through th blood
   of the Son of God, have gone hand in hand. The one has seldom been long
   held by those who deny the other. The doctrine of expiation, therefore,
   is so wrought into the whole system of revealed truth, that its
   rejection effects a radical change, not only in the theology but also
   in the religion of the Bible.

   § 4. The Governmental Theory.

   This theory was introduced into the Church by Grotius, in the
   seventeenth century. He wrote in opposition to the Socinians, and
   therefore his book is entitled: "Defensio fidei catholicæ de
   satisfactione Christi." It is in point of learning and ability all that
   could be expected from one of the greatest men of his generation. The
   design with which the book was written, and the universally received
   formulas of expression at that time prevailing, to the use of which
   Grotius adheres, give his work an aspect of orthodoxy. He speaks of
   satisfaction to justice, of propitiation, of the penal character of our
   Lord's sufferings, of his death as a vicarious sacrifice, and of his
   bearing the guilt of our sins. In short, so far as the use of terms is
   concerned, there is hardly any departure from the doctrine of the
   Reformed Church, of which he was then a member. Different principles,
   however, underlaid his whole theory, and, therefore, a different sense
   was to be attached to the terms he used. There was, after all, no real
   satisfaction of justice, no real substitution, and no real enduring of
   the penalty of the law. His Socinian opponents, when they came to
   answer his book, said that he had given up all the main principles in
   dispute. Grotius was a jurist as well as a theologian, and looked at
   the whole subject from a juridical standpoint. The main elements of his
   theory are, --

   1. That in the forgiveness of sin God is to be regarded neither as an
   offended party, nor as a creditor, nor as a master, but as a moral
   governor. A creditor can remit the debt due to him at pleasure; a
   master may punish or not punish as he sees fit; but a ruler must act,
   not according to his feelings or caprice, but with a view to the best
   interests of those under his authority. Grotius says that the
   overlooking the distinctions above indicated is the fundamental error
   of the Socinians. [448] In opposition to this view, he says: "Omnino
   hic Deum considerandum, ut rectorem. Nam poenas infligere, aut a poenis
   aliquem liberare, quam punire possis, quod justificare vocat Scriptura,
   non est nisi rectoris qua talis primo et per se: ut, puta, in familia
   patris; in republica regis, in universo Dei." [449]

   2. The end of punishment is the prevention of crime, or the
   preservation of order and the promotion of the best interests of the
   community. "Justitiæ rectoris pars est servare leges etiam positivas et
   a se latas, quod verum esse tam in universitate libera quam in rege
   summo probant jurisconsulti: cui illud est consequens, ut rectori
   relaxare legem non liceat, nisi causa aliqua accedat, si non
   necessaria, certe sufficiens: quæ itidem recepta est a jurisconsultis
   sententia. Ratio utriusque est, quod actus ferendi aut relaxandi legem
   non sit actus absoluti dominii, sed actus imperii, qui tendere debeat
   ad boni ordinis conversationem." [450] On a previous page, he had said,
   in more general terms: "Poena omnis propositum habet bonum commune,
   ordinis nimirum conservationem et exemplum."

   3. As a good governor cannot allow sin to be committed with immunity,
   God cannot pardon the sins of men without some adequate exhibition of
   his displeasure, and of his determination to punish it. This was the
   design of the sufferings and death of Christ. God punished sin in Him
   as an example. This example was the more impressive on account of the
   dignity of Christ's person, and therefore in view of his death, God can
   consistently with the best interests of his government remit the
   penalty of the law in the case of penitent believers.

   4. Punishment, Grotius defined as suffering inflicted on account of
   sin. It need not be imposed on account of the personal demerit of the
   sufferer; nor with the design of satisfying justice, in the ordinary
   and proper sense of that word. It was enough that it should be on
   account of sin. As the sufferings of Christ were caused by our sins,
   insomuch as they were designed to render their remission consistent
   with the interest of God's moral government, they fall within this
   comprehensive definition of the word punishment. Grotius, therefore,
   could say that Christ suffered the punishment of our sins, as his
   sufferings were an example of what sin deserved.

   5. The essence of the atonement, therefore, according to Grotius
   consisted in this, that the sufferings and death of Christ were
   designed as an exhibition of God's displeasure against sin. They were
   intended to teach that in the estimation of God sin deserves to be
   punished, and, therefore, that the impenitent cannot escape the penalty
   due to their offences. "Nihil iniquitatis in eo est quod Deus, cujus
   est summa potestas ad omnia per se non injusta, nulli ipse legi
   obnoxius, cruciatibus et morte Christi uti voluit, ad statuendum
   exemplum grave adversus culpas immensas nostrum omnium, quibus Christus
   erat conjunctissimus, natura, regno vadimonio." [451] Again: "Hoc ipso
   Deus non tantum suum adversus peccata odium testatum fecit, ac proinde
   nos hoc facto a peccatis deterruit (facilis enim est collectio, si Deus
   ne resipiscentibus quidem peccata remittere voluit, nisi Christo in
   poenas succedente, multo minus inultos sinet contumaces) verum insigni
   modo insuper patefecit summum erga nos amorem ac benevolentiam: quod
   ille scilicet nobis pepercit, cui non erat adiaphoron, indifferens,
   punire peccata, sed qui tanti id faciebat, ut potius quam impunita
   omnino dimitteret, Filium suum unigenitum ob illa peccata, poenis
   tradiderit." [452] It thus appears that, according to this theory, the
   work of Christ was purely didactic. It was designed to teach, by way of
   an example, God's hatred of sin. The cross was but a symbol.

   Remonstrants.

   The Synod of Dort met two years after the publication of the work in
   which this theory was propounded. Grotius joined those who remonstrated
   against the decisions of that Synod, and who on that account were
   called Remonstrants. The Remonstrant theologians, however, did not as a
   class adhere to Grotius's peculiar doctrine. They did not regard the
   work of Christ as a governmental transaction, but adhered to the
   Scriptural mode of representation. They spoke of his death as a
   sacrifice and ransom. They rejected indeed the Church doctrine. They
   denied that what Christ did was a satisfaction of justice; that He bore
   the penalty of the law; that He acted as our substitute, fulfilling in
   our place all the demands of the law. As these ideas have no part,
   according to their view, in the doctrine of sacrifices for sin, so they
   have no place in the true doctrine concerning the work of Christ. Under
   the Old Testament a sacrifice was not an equivalent for the penalty
   incurred; it was not a satisfaction to justice; the victim did not do
   what the offerer ought to have done. It was simply a divine ordinance.
   God saw fit to ordain that the offering a sacrifice should be the
   condition of the pardon of the violations of the ceremonial law. So
   also He has seen fit to ordain that the sacrificial death of Christ
   should be the condition of the pardon of sin under the gospel. Even a
   ransom is no proper equivalent. The holder of a captive may take what
   he pleases as the condition of deliverance. On this point Limborch
   says: "In eo errant quam maxime, quod velint redemtionis pretium per
   omnia æquivalens esse debere miseriæ illi, e qua redemtio fit,
   redemtionis pretium enim constitui solet pro libera æstimatione illius,
   qui captivum detinet, non autem pro captivi merito. Ita pretium, quod
   Christus persolvit, juxta Dei patris æstimationem persolutum est."
   [453] This is the old Scholastic doctrine of "acceptatio;" a thing
   avails, irrespective of its inherent value, for what God sees fit to
   take it. The death of Christ was no more a satisfaction for sin, than
   that of bulls and of goats under the old dispensation. God saw fit to
   make the latter the condition of the pardon of violations of the
   ceremonial law; and He has seen fit to make the former the condition of
   the pardon of sins against the moral law.

   The Supernaturalists.

   Although the Remonstrants as a body did not accept of the governmental
   theory as proposed by Grotius, his main idea was frequently reproduced
   by subsequent writers. This was done especially by the Supernaturalists
   in Germany in their endeavour to save something from the destructive
   principles of the Rationalists. They conceded that the work of Christ
   was not strictly a satisfaction to justice. They taught that it was
   necessary as an example and a symbol. [454] It was designed as a
   manifestation of God's displeasure against sin; and, therefore,
   necessary to render its forgiveness consistent with the interests of
   God's moral government. This is true of Stäudlin, Flatt, and even of
   Storr. Speaking of the first of these writers, Baur says, "It was
   admitted that in the New Testament doctrine concerning the death of
   Jesus the Old Testament idea of a sin offering as a substitute and
   satisfaction was actually contained, and therefore that the Church
   doctrine of satisfaction agreed with the literal sense of the
   Scriptures; yet it was insisted upon that this literal doctrine of the
   Bible involved difficulties affecting our moral nature, and was evil in
   its practical effects, and inconsistent with what the Scriptures
   themselves elsewhere taught of guilt, merit, imputation, and of God's
   justice." Hence, he goes on to say, that to escape from this dilemma it
   was taught that when in the New Testament it is said "that Jesus
   suffered punishment in the place of men, and procured for them the
   forgiveness of sin, this can only mean that God, through the death of
   Christ and the sufferings therewith connected, declared himself to be
   the righteous judge of all evil." [455]

   C. Ch. Flatt endeavoured to find "a middle way between the course of
   those who introduced into the Scriptures their own philosophical
   opinions, or the philosophy of the age in which they lived, and the
   strict grammatical, historical interpretation of those who insisted on
   taking the words of Scripture either in their etymological sense, or in
   that sense in which it can he historically proved that at least a part
   of the contemporaries of the sacred writers understood them, or which
   stupid Rabbinical literalists attached to certain phrases without
   regard to the fact how often the meaning of words, without a change of
   form, through higher culture and refinement of moral feeling, is
   spiritualized and ennobled." [456] This middle way, according to Flatt,
   leads to the conclusion that the main design of Christ's death as
   viewed by Himself was effectually to correct the false ideas of the
   Jews concerning the Messiah's kingdom as one of earthly splendor, and
   to open the way for the entrance of his doctrine which taught that
   blessedness is to be secured by moral excellence. This doctrine of
   Flatt agrees with the governmental theory so far as it denies the
   Church doctrine of a satisfaction to justice, and makes the design of
   Christ's death purely didactic.

   Storr, in all his works, and especially in his "Commentary on the
   Epistle to the Hebrews," and his dissertation on the design of Christ's
   death, makes the Scriptures his authoritative guide, and therefore
   approaches much nearer to the Church doctrine than perhaps any German
   theologian of his generation. He assumes that Christ as man was bound
   to render the same obedience to the divine law as is due from all other
   men. But in virtue of the union of his human with the divine nature He
   as man was entitled to all the exaltation and blessedness of which
   humanity is capable. Any reward, therefore, for his perfect obedience,
   are especially for his death on the cross, must be some benefit granted
   to others for his sake. The salvation of his people, therefore, is the
   Redeemer's reward. Such benefit, however, could not consistently be
   bestowed on sinners unless the death of Christ had been a vindication
   of the righteousness of God by being intended as an "example of
   punishment;" a manifestation of God's hatred of sin and of his
   determination to punish it. [457]

   American Theologians.

   The governmental theory of the atonement seems to have had an entirely
   independent origin in this country. It was the necessary consequence of
   the principle that all virtue consists in benevolence. If that
   principle be correct, all the moral attributes of God are modifications
   of benevolence. There is no such perfection in God as justice other
   than the purpose and disposition to promote happiness. The death of
   Christ, therefore, could have no other design than to render the
   forgiveness of sin consistent with the best interests of the moral
   government of God. This theory was elaborated by the younger President
   Edwards, presented in full in Dr. Beman's work on the Atonement, and
   adopted by that numerous and highly influential class of American
   theologians who embraced the principle on which the theory, as held in
   this country, is founded. In the work of Dr. E. A. Park, of Andover, on
   the Atonement, there is a collection of discourses from the pens of the
   most distinguished teachers of this doctrine. In the introduction to
   that volume Professor Park gives an interesting history of the
   development of this view of the atonement as held in this country.

   Objections to the Theory.

   1. The first and most obvious objection to this theory is that it is
   founded on an erroneous idea of the nature of punishment. It assumes
   that the special design of punishment is the good of society. If the
   best interests of a community, either human or divine, a commonwealth
   of men or the moral government of God, can be secured without the
   punishment of crime, then no such punishment ought to be inflicted. But
   suffering inflicted for the good of others is not punishment any more
   than suffering inflicted for the good of the sufferer. The amputation
   of a crushed limb is not of the nature of punishment, neither are the
   sufferings of martyrs, although intended to redound to the good of the
   Church and of the world. The sufferings of Paul, which were so abundant
   and so constant, although so fruitful of good, were not penal. And the
   sufferings of Christ, if incurred in the discharge of his mission of
   mercy, and not judicially inflicted in execution of the penalty of the
   law, had no more tendency to show God's abhorrence of sin than the
   suffering of the martyrs.

   No evil is of the nature of punishment unless it be inflicted in
   satisfaction of justice and in execution of the penalty of law. A
   writer in the "British Quarterly Review" for October, 1866, says:
   "There is a story of an English judge who once said to a criminal, You
   are transported not because you have stolen these goods, but that goods
   may not be stolen.'" The reviewer then adds, "No principle more false
   in itself or more ruinous to public morality was ever announced from
   the English bench. The whole moral effect of punishment lies in its
   being just. The man who suffers for the benefit of others is a martyr
   and not a convict." It is on this false principle that the whole
   governmental theory of the atonement is founded. It admits of no ground
   of punishment but the benefit of others. And if that benefit can be
   otherwise secured all necessity for punishment ceases, and all
   objection to the dispensing of pardon is removed. If the fundamental
   principle of a theory be false, the theory itself must be unsound.

   2. The theory contradicts the intuitive moral judgments of men. The
   testimony of every man's conscience in view of his own sins is that he
   deserves to be punished, not for the good of others, but for his own
   demerit. If not guilty he cannot justly be punished; and if guilty he
   cannot justly be pardoned without satisfaction to justice. As this is
   the testimony of conscience with regard to our own sins, it is the
   testimony of the consciousness of all men with regard to the sins of
   others. When a great crime is committed, the instinctive judgment of
   men is that the perpetrators ought to be punished. No analysis of human
   consciousness can resolve this sentiment of justice into a conviction
   of the understanding that the interests of society demand the
   punishment of crime. That indeed is true. It is one of the incidental
   benefits, but not the special design or end of punishment. Indeed, the
   whole moral effect of punishment depends upon the assumption that it is
   inflicted on the ground of ill desert, and not for the public good. If
   the latter object be made prominent, punishment loses its nature and of
   course its appropriate moral effect. A theory which ignores these
   intuitive convictions of the mind is not suited to our state, and never
   can satisfy the conscience. We know that we deserve to be punished. We
   know that we ought to be punished, and therefore that punishment is
   inevitable under the government of a just God. If it is not borne by a
   substitute in our stead, it must be borne by ourselves. Where there is
   no expiation for sin there is inevitably a fearful looking for of
   judgment.

   3. All the arguments heretofore urged in proof that the justice of God
   cannot be resolved into benevolence are valid arguments against the
   governmental theory of the atonement. The doctrine that happiness is
   the highest good, and that all virtue consists in the desire and
   purpose to promote the greatest possible amount of happiness, is almost
   discarded from the schools, and should be discarded from theology where
   it has wrought so much evil. It is so inconsistent with our moral
   nature, to assert that there is no difference between right and wrong
   except that between the expedient and the inexpedient, that the
   doctrine could never have been adopted except as a means of solving
   difficulties for the understanding, at the expense of the conscience.
   This point has been already considered when treating of the attributes
   of God and of the design of creation; and therefore it need not be
   further discussed in this place.

   4. A fourth argument against the governmental theory is that it is
   unscriptural. The Bible constantly represents Christ as a priest, as a
   sacrifice, as a propitiation, as an expiation, as the substitute and
   representative of sinners; as assuming their place and sustaining the
   curse or penalty of the law in their stead. All these representations
   are either ignored or explained away by the advocates of this theory.
   Governments, civil commonwealths, from which the principles and
   illustrations of this theory are derived, know nothing of priests,
   sacrifices, and vicarious punishments. And, therefore, these ideas do
   not enter, and cannot be admitted into the governmental theory. But
   these ideas are the vital elements of the Scriptural doctrine of the
   atonement; so that if we renounce them we renounce the doctrine itself,
   or at least seriously impair its integrity and power. Whole volumes on
   the atonement have been written in which the words priest, sacrifice,
   and propitiation hardly occur.

   5. This theory, as well as the moral view of the atonement is false,
   because defective. As it is true that the work of Christ is designed
   and adapted to exert the most powerful moral influence on sinners to
   induce them to return to God, so it is true that his work was designed
   and adapted to produce the strongest possible impression on the minds
   of all intelligent creatures of the evil of sin, and thus restrain them
   from the commission of it, but neither the one nor the other was its
   primary design. It has this moral impression on the sinner and upon the
   intelligent universe, because it was a satisfaction to the justice of
   God, and the strongest of all proofs that sin cannot be pardoned
   without an expiation, or adequate atonement.

   At other times, a symbol is that which expresses the analogy between
   the outward and the inward. Thus, in one view, the atoning death of
   Christ is symbolical of God's feelings towards sinners. In another
   view, the struggles and triumph of our Lord in conflict with physical
   evil are symbolical of the believer's struggles and triumph in the
   conflict with sin. The former was an illustration of the latter, and
   intended to encourage the people of God with the assurance of success.

   § 5. The Mystical Theory.

   The fifth theory on this subject is the mystical. This agrees with the
   moral view (under which it might be included), in that it represents
   the design of Christ's work to be the production of a subjective effect
   in the sinner. It produces a change in him. It overcomes the evil of
   his nature and restores him to a state of holiness. The two systems
   differ, however, as to the means by which this inward change is
   accomplished. According to the one it is by moral power operating
   according to the laws of mind by the exhibition of truth and the
   exercise of moral influence. According to the other it is by the
   mysterious union of God and man, of the divine with the human nature,
   i.e., of divinity with humanity, brought about by the incarnation.

   This general idea is presented in various forms. Sometimes the writers
   quoted in favour of this mystical view teach nothing more ihan what has
   ever been held in the Church, and what is clearly caught in the
   Scriptures.. It is true that there is a moral and spiritual union
   between God and man effected by the incarnation of the Son of God and
   the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He and his people are one. Our Lord
   prays to the Father, John xvii. 22, 23, that those given to Him "may be
   one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me." And the Apostle
   Peter does not hesitate to say that we are made "partakers of the
   divine nature." This, and no more than this, is necessarily implied in
   the oft-quoted language of Athanasius in reference to Christ, autos
   enenthropesen, hina hemeis theopoiethomen. But besides this Scriptural
   doctrine there has prevailed a mystical view of the union of God and
   man to which the redemption of our race is ascribed, and in which, by
   some of its advocates, it is made exclusively to consist. So far as the
   fathers are concerned, a clear distinction was made between redemption
   and reconciliation; between the objective work of Christ in delivering
   us from the curse of the law and from the power of Satan, and the
   subjective application of that work. Both were ascribed to Christ. The
   former (our redemption), was effected by his bearing our sins, by his
   being made a curse for us, by his giving Himself as a ransom, and by
   his obedience being taken as a substitute for the obedience which we
   had failed to render. Our reconciliation with God, including
   restoration to his image and fellowship, was effected, not, as the
   Church has ever taught, by the work of the Holy Spirit, but according
   to the mystical theory, by the union of the divine nature with our
   fallen nature, brought about by the incarnation. In all ages of the
   Church there have been minds disinclined to rest in the simple
   statements of the Bible, and disposed to strive after something more
   philosophical and profound. Among the early fathers, Münscher says,
   there was an obscure and peculiar notion that in some way the coming of
   Christ had produced a physical effect upon our race to ennoble it and
   render it immortal. [458] At times this idea is advanced in general
   terms and without any attempt to explain philosophically how this
   effect was produced. As Adam was the cause of the seeds of death and
   corruption being introduced into human nature, so Christ was the means
   of introducing a principle of life and immortality which operates as
   leaven in a mass of dough. Or, as any affection of one member of the
   body, especially of the head, affects the whole system, so the
   resurrection of Christ and his life has a physical effect upon the
   whole mass of mankind. They regarded the human race as one mass which,
   inasmuch as Christ had united Himself with it by his incarnation, was
   restored to its original perfection and made immortal. [459] This idea
   was more perfectly worked out by the realists. They held humanity to be
   a generic substance and life, of which individual men are the modes of
   existence; and they also held that it was this generic humanity, and
   not merely a true body and a reasonable soul that Christ assumed into
   personal union with his divine nature; thus an element of divinity was
   introduced into humanity, by which it is restored and ennobled, and
   according to some, finally deified.

   Among the Platonizing fathers, however, the mystical operation of the
   incarnation was connected with their doctrine of the Logos. What the
   real doctrine of the fathers and of Philo their predecessor and master
   in his matter concerning the Logos was, has ever been a matter of
   dispute among the learned. It is not at all even yet a settled matter
   whether Philo regarded the Logos as a person or not. Dorner, one of the
   latest and most competent authorities on this point, takes the negative
   side of the question. According to him Philo taught that the Logos was
   (1.) A faculty of God, the nous or understanding, and also the power of
   God. The two are united; thought and power. (2.) The Logos is the
   activity of God; not merely the power of thought and of creating, but
   also the actual activity of God in thinking and creating. God first
   created by thinking an ideal world, after which the actual world was to
   be fashioned. As a builder forms in his mind the plan of a city in all
   its details, before he carries that plan into execution; and as the
   dwelling-place of that ideal city is the understanding of the builder,
   so the ideal world is in the mind of God, i.e., in the Logos. (3.)
   According to Philo the Logos is not only the thinking principle which
   forms this ideal world, but the ideal world itself. (4.) This plenitude
   of ideas which constitutes the ideal world is the reality, life, and
   intelligence of the actual world. The latter is (or becomes) by the
   union of the ideal with matter, what it is. The kosmos noetos is
   realized in the kosmos aisthetos. The Logos, therefore (or the divine
   intelligence and activity), is the life and intelligence of the actual
   world. He is the reason in all rational creatures, angels and men.
   [460] According to Philo the Logos was on the one hand identical with
   God, and on the other identical with the world as its interior reality
   and life.

   In the hands of the Platonizing fathers this doctrine was only
   modified. Some of them, as Origen, held that the Logos was a person
   eternally begotten of the Father; according to Clemens Alexandrinus, He
   was, as the Logos endiathetos, eternally in God as his wisdom, and
   therefore impersonal; but as the Logos prophorikos, or united to the
   world as its formative principle, He became a person. In applying these
   philosophical speculations to the explanation of the doctrine
   concerning the person and work of Christ, there is no little diversity
   among these writers, so far as the details are concerned. In substance
   they agree. The eternal Logos or Son, became truly a man, and as such
   gave Himself as a sacrifice and ransom for the redemption of men. He
   also by his incarnation secures our recovery from the power of sin and
   restoration to the image and fellowship of God. How this latter object
   is accomplished is the mystical part of the theory. The Logos is the
   eternal Son of God; but He is also the interior life and substance of
   the world. Rational creatures included in the world, are endowed with
   personality and freedom. Some of them, both angels and men, have turned
   away from the Logos which is their life. A renewed union of the divine
   with the human restores them to their normal relation. The original
   creation of man was imperfect. The divine element was not strong enough
   to secure a right development, hence evil occurred. A larger infusion
   of the divine element corrects the evil, and secures the restoration
   ultimately. according to Origen, of all rational creatures to holiness
   and God. The Logos is the Mediator, the High-Priest between God and man
   (or rather God and the world). One with God, He is also one with the
   world. He unites the two, and they become one. The system has a
   pantheistic aspect, although it admits the freedom of rational
   creatures, and the separate existence, or an existence as self of the
   world. The whole universe, however, God and world, is one vast organism
   in which God is the only life and the only reason, and this life and
   reason are the Logos. And it is by giving the Logos, the rational or
   spiritual element, renewed power, that the world of rational creatures,
   who in the abuse of their freedom have turned away from God, are
   brought back not only to a real or substantial, but also to a cordial
   union with God, so that He becomes all in all.

   In the beginning of the ninth century John Scotus Erigena anticipated
   most of the results of the highest modern speculation. Schelling and
   Hegel had him for a predecessor and guide. With him "Creator et
   creatura unum est. Deus est omnia, et omnia Deus." The creation is
   necessary and eternal; the incarnation is necessary and eternal; and
   redemption is necessary and eternal. All is process. An eternal
   unfolding of the infinite in the finite, and return of the finite into
   the infinite. Erigena, from his place in history and his relation to
   the Church, was forced to clothe his philosophy as much as possible
   with the drapery of Christianity this secured for him an influence
   which continued long after his death over later speculative
   theologians.

   During the Middle Ages there was a succession of advocates of the
   mystical theory. Some of them following Erigena adopted a system
   essentially pantheistic; others were theistic. The one class strove to
   reduce Christianity into a system of philosophy. They adopted the
   principle of Erigena, "Conficitur inde, veram esse philosophiam veram
   religionem, conversimque, veram religionem esse veram philosophiam."
   The two sources of knowledge are recta ratio and vera auctoritas. Both
   are divine as coming from God. Reason however, as first, is the higher,
   and nothing is to be admitted as true which reason does not
   authenticate. [461] The other class strove after fellowship with God.
   Both assumed that what Münscher and Gieseler call the physical union of
   the divine and human natures, was the normal and ultimate state of man.
   Whether this identity of the two was effected by a perfect development
   of God in man and nature; or by the elevation of the human until it is
   lost in the divine, the result is the same. Man is deified. And therein
   is his salvation. And so far as Christ was recognized as a Saviour at
   all, it was as the bond of union between the two, or the channel
   through which the divine flows into the human. The incarnation itself,
   the union of the divine and human natures, was the great saving act.
   Christ redeems us by what He is, not by what He does. The race, say
   some, the consummated Church, say others, is the God man, or God
   manifest in the flesh. Almost all this class of writers held that the
   incarnation would have been necessary, had man never sinned. The
   necessity arises out of the nature of God and his relation to the
   world, and out of the nature and destiny of man.

   Mystical Theory at the Time of the Reformation.

   At the time of the Reformation the same mode of apprehending and
   presenting Christianity was adopted. While the Reformers held to the
   great objective truths of the Bible, to a historical Christ, to the
   reality and necessity of his obedience and satisfaction as something
   done for us and in our place, i.e., to an objective redemption and
   justification, a class of writers soon appeared who insisted on what
   they called the Christ within us, and merged the objective work of
   Christ into a subjective operation in the souls of his people; or at
   least subordinated the former entirely to the latter. A work, entitled
   "Die Deutsche Theologie" (German Theology), was published during the
   lifetime of Luther, which contained a great amount of important truth,
   and to which the illustrious reformer acknowledged himself greatly
   indebted. In that book, however, the mystical element was carried to a
   dangerous extreme. While the historical facts respecting Christ and his
   redeeming work were allowed to remain, little stress was laid upon
   them. The real value of the blessings received from Christ, was the
   change effected in the soul itself; and that change was not referred to
   the work of the Holy Spirit, so much as to the union of the divine
   nature with our nature, in virtue of the incarnation. The book teaches
   that if it were possible for a man to be as pure and obedient as
   Christ, he would become, through grace, what Christ was by nature.
   Through this obedience he would become one with God. Christ is not
   merely objective, isolated in his majesty, but we are all called that
   God should be incarnate in us, or that we should become God.

   Osiander.

   Osiander and Schwenkfeld, two contemporaries of Luther, were both
   advocates, although in different forms, of the same theory. Men are
   saved by the substantial union of the divine nature with the nature of
   man. According to Osiander justification is not by the imputation, but
   by the infusion of righteousness. And the righteousness infused is not
   the righteousness of Christ wrought out here on earth. What Christ did
   centuries ago cannot make us righteous. What we receive is his divine
   nature. This is the specific doctrine for which Osiander was denounced
   in the Form of Concord. Man, according to him, was originally created
   not after the image of God as such, nor of the Son as such, but of the
   Son as He was to become man. Manhood was eternally included in the idea
   and nature of the Son of God. His incarnation was, therefore, due to
   his nature, and not to the accident of man's sinning. The idea of the
   incarnation is eternal, and in reference to it the whole universe was
   created and all things consist. Christ's human nature is only the
   vehicle for conveying to us his divine nature. In the vine, he says,
   there are two natures, the one is the nature of the wood, which it
   retains, even if it should be withered up; the other is "plane occulta,
   fructifera et vinifera natura." And as the clusters of grapes could not
   have the vinous nature, unless they were wood of the wood of the vine;
   so neither can we partake of the divine nature of Christ, unless we, by
   faith and baptism, are so incorporated with Him, as to be flesh of his
   flesh and bone of his bone. But the human nature of Christ, without the
   divine (si sine Deo esset), would be of no avail. [462]

   Schwenkfeld.

   While Osiander makes the divine nature of Christ as communicated to us
   our righteousness and life, and regards his humanity as only the means
   of communication, Schwenkfeld exalts the human into the divine, and
   regards this divine human nature as the source of life to us. He agreed
   with Osiander in making justification subjective, by the infusion of
   righteousness; and also in teaching that the righteousness which is
   infused is the righteousness of Christ; but instead of depreciating the
   human nature and making it only the channel for communicating the
   divine, he laid special stress on the humanity of Christ. The human
   nature of Christ was not a creature. It was formed out of the substance
   of God; and after its sojourn on earth, was even as to the body,
   rendered completely or perfectly divine, so that whatever can be
   predicated of God, can be predicated of the humanity of Christ.
   Nevertheless, the human nature was not so absorbed into the divinity,
   that Christ had but one nature. He continues God and man, but as man is
   God. And this divine human, or human divine nature, is communicated to
   us by faith. Faith itself is the first communication of the divine
   essence, the final result of which is the complete deification of man.
   The substance of God is not communicated to the race of men, so that
   God becomes thus identified with men in general. It is in the
   regenerated that this union of the divine and human natures is
   consummated. It cannot escape notice, that the views of this class of
   writers, so far as results are concerned, differ but little from those
   of the modern speculative theologians of Germany and their followers in
   England and America. The obvious objection, that if salvation depends
   on the union of the divine nature with ours, and if this union be due
   to the incarnation of Christ, those living before his advent in the
   flesh must be excluded from the benefits of his theanthropic nature, is
   very unsatisfactorily answered by the modern theologians referred to.
   Schwenkfeld had no hesitation in cutting the knot. In a Sendbrief
   written in 1532, in which he treats of the difference between the Old
   and New Testament economies, he says, that under the former there was
   no saving faith, and no justification, and that all the patriarchs had
   therefore perished forever.

   Schwenkfeld's followers were numerous enough to form a distinct sect,
   which continues to this day. Some religionists, both in Germany and in
   this country, are still called by his name. All the writers on the
   history of doctrine give the authorities for the statements concerning
   the doctrines of Osiander and Schwenkfeld derived from sources not
   generally accessible in this country.

   Oetinger.

   The prominent representative of the mystical theory during the
   eighteenth century, was Friedrich Christopher Oetinger, a distinguished
   theologian of South Germany. He was born in 1702, and died in 1782. He
   enjoyed every advantage of culture in science, theology, and
   philosophy, which he diligently improved. After his death it was said,
   "When Oetinger died a whole academy of science died." Very early in
   life, he says, he adopted and avowed the purpose, "to understand
   whatever he learnt." By this he meant that he would receive nothing on
   authority. All that the Scriptures teach as doctrine, must be
   sublimated into truths of the reason and received, as such. He avowed
   it to be his purpose to furnish a philosophia sacra as a substitute for
   the systems of profane philosophy. For this purpose he devoted himself
   to the study of all previously received systems, extending his
   researches to the cabala of the Jews, and the mystical writers of the
   Church; to alchemy awl to all departments of science within his reach.
   He professed special reverence for Jacob Böhme, the great unlettered
   theosophist of the preceding century, to whom even Schelling and other
   of the leading modern philosophers bow as to an acknowledged seer.
   Oetinger examined the several systems in vogue before or during, his
   own period. Idealism and materialism, and realistic dualism were alike
   unsatisfactory. He assumed life to be the primordial principle. Life
   was the aggregate of all forces. These in God are united by a bond of
   necessity. In things out of God the union of these forces is not
   necessary; and hence evil may arise, and has, in fact, arisen. To
   remove this evil and bring all things back to God, the eternal Logos
   became man. He adopted the old Platonic idea, that in the Logos were
   the originales rerum antequam exstiterunt formæ: omnia constiterunt in
   ipso arehetypice sive actu. This plenitude of the Godhead dwells in
   Christ and renders his humanity divine. The union of the divine and
   human natures in Christ, secures the complete deification of his human
   nature. The hypostatical union of the two natures in Christ is the norm
   of the mystical union between Christ and his people. "Ut ibi adsumta
   caro consistit en logo per participationem hupostaseos, ita hic nostra
   subsistit in Christo per consortium gratiæ et theias phuseos," etc.
   [463] The second Adam having assumed humanity, says Oetinger, "Traxit
   carnem nostram in plenitudinem Deitatis," so that our race again
   becomes possessed of the divine nature in Him and in us; i.e., "unione
   tumu personali tum mystica." [464] It is indeed plain, as Dorner says,
   that we find in Oetinger the ideas which are the foundation of the
   philosophy of the present age. The nature of God and the nature of man
   are so homogeneous that they may be united and constitute one, which is
   divine human or human divine. We are saved not by the work of Christ
   for us, but by his work in us. The eternal Son is incarnate not in the
   man Christ Jesus, but in the Church.

   The Modern Views.

   In the present period of the Church's history, this mystical theory of
   the person and work of Christ is probably more prevalent than ever
   before. The whole school of German speculative theologians, with their
   followers in England and America, are on this ground. Of these
   theologians there are, as remarked above, two classes, the pantheistic
   and the theistic. According to the former, the nature of man at first
   was an imperfect manifestation of the absolute Being, and in the
   development of the race this manifestation is rendered complete; but
   complete only as an eternal progress. According to the other, man has
   an existence and personality, in one sense, outside of God.
   Nevertheless God and man are substantially the same. This identity or
   sameness is shown perfectly in Christ, and through Him, is realized
   more and more perfectly in the Church as some teach, or, as others say,
   in the whole race. [465]

   § 6. Concluding Remarks.

   In reviewing these several theories concerning the method of salvation
   through our Lord Jesus Christ, it is important to remark, --

   1. That it is not to be inferred because certain writers are quoted as
   setting forth one particular theory, that they recognized the truth of
   no other view of the work of Christ. This remark is especially
   applicable to the patristic period. While some of the fathers speak at
   times of Christ's saving the world as a teacher, and others of them say
   that He gave himself as a ransom to Satan, and others again that He
   brings men back to the image of God, this does not prove that they
   ignored the fact that he was a sin offering, making expiation for the
   guilt of the world. It is characteristic of the early period of the
   Church, before special doctrines had become matters of controversy,
   that the people and the theologians retain the common language and
   representations of the Bible; while the latter, especially, dwell
   sometimes disproportionately on one mode of Scriptural representation,
   and sometimes disproportionately on another. The fathers constantly
   speak of Christ as a priest, as a sacrifice, and as a ransom. They
   ascribe our salvation to his blood and to his cross. The ideas of
   expiation and propitiation were wrought into all the services of the
   early Church. These Scriptural ideas sustained the life of the people
   of God entirely independently of the speculations of philosophical
   theologians.

   2. The second remark which the preceding survey suggests is, that the
   theories antagonistic to the common Church doctrine are purely
   philosophical. Origen assumed that in man there are the three
   constituent principles: body, soul, and spirit; and that in analogy
   therewith, there are three senses of Scripture, the historical, the
   moral, and the spiritual. The first is the plain meaning of the words
   which suggests itself to any ordinary, intelligent reader; the second
   is the allegorical application of the historical sense for moral
   instruction. For example, what Moses commands about not muzzling an ox
   which treads out the corn, may be understood as teaching the general
   principle that labour should be rewarded, and, therefore, may be
   applied as it is by the Apostle, to enforce the duty of supporting
   ministers of the Gospel. The third or spiritual sense, is the general
   philosophical truth, which is assumed to underlie the doctrines of the
   Scriptures; of which truths the Scriptural doctrines are only the
   temporary forms. Thus Origen made the Bible teach Platonism. The object
   of most of the early apologists, was to show that Christianity had a
   philosophy as well as heathenism; and that the philosophy of the former
   is identical with the philosophy of the latter so far as that of the
   latter can prove itself to be true. The trouble was, and always has
   been, that whatever philosophy was assumed to be true, the doctrines of
   Scripture were made to conform to it or were sublimated into it. The
   historical and moral senses of Scripture constitute the object of
   faith; the spiritual sense is the object of gnosis or knowledge. The
   former is very well in its place and for the people; but the latter is
   something of a higher order to which only the philosophically
   cultivated can attain. That the mystical theory of the person and work
   of Christ, especially, is the product of philosophical speculation is
   obvious -- (1.) From the express avowals of its most distinguished
   advocates. (2.) From the nature of the theory itself, which reveals
   itself as a philosophy, i.e., as a speculative doctrine concerning the
   nature of being, the nature of God, the nature of man, and of the
   relation of God to the world, etc. (3.) From the fact that it has
   changed with the varying systems of philosophy. So long as Platonism
   was in vogue, the spiritual sense of Scripture was assumed to be
   Platonism; that system discarded, the schoolmen adopted the philosophy
   of Aristotle, and then the Bible taught the doctrines of
   Peripateticism. Those of them who followed Scotus Erigena found
   Pantheism in the Scriptures. When the philosophy of Leibnitz and Wolf
   dominated the schools, that philosophy determined the form of all
   Scriptural doctrine. And since the rise of the new speculative
   philosophy all that the Scriptures teach is cast in its forms of
   thought. No man can be so blind as not to see that all that is peculiar
   in what the modern theology teaches of the person and work of Christ,
   is nothing more nor less than the application of modern speculative
   philosophy to the doctrines of the Bible. This, indeed, is generally
   admitted and avowed. This being the case, all these speculations are
   without authority. They form no part of the truth as it is revealed as
   the object of faith. We are bound to understand the Scriptures in their
   plain historical sense; and to admit no philosophy to explain or modify
   that sense, except the philosophy of the Bible itself; that is, those
   facts and principles concerning the nature of God, the nature of man,
   of the world, and of the relation between God and the world, which are
   either asserted or plainly assumed in the Scriptures. To depart from
   this principle is to give up the Bible as a rule of faith; and to
   substitute for it the teachings of philosophy. That form of Rationalism
   which consists in giving a philosophical explanation of the truths of
   revelation, or in resolving them into truths of the reason, is just as
   certain in the end to teach for doctrines the speculations of men, as
   the most avowed skepticism.

   After all, apart from the Bible, the best antidote to all these false
   theories of the person and work of Christ, is such a book as Doctor
   Schaff's "Christ in Song." [466] The hymns contained in that volume are
   of all ages and from all churches. They set forth Christ as truly God,
   as truly man, as one person, a the expiation for our sins, as our
   intercessor, saviour, and king, as the supreme object of love, as the
   ultimate ground of confidence, as the all-sufficient portion of the
   soul. We want no better theology and no better religion than are set
   forth in these hymns. They were indited by the Holy Spirit in the sense
   that the thoughts and feelings which they express, are due to his
   operations on the hearts of his people.

CHAPTER X.

  INTERCESSION OF CHRIST.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  1. Christ our Intercessor.

   Under the old dispensation the High Priest, after having offered
   sacrifices for sin in the outer court, was directed, on the day of
   atonement, to take the blood of the victims and a censer with burning
   incense, and to enter within the veil, and there present the blood
   before God, sprinkling it upon the mercy seat. In like manner, as we
   are taught by the Apostle, Christ, having offered Himself on the cross
   as a sacrifice for our sins, has passed through the heavens, there to
   appear before God in our behalf. He is, therefore, said to be the
   minister of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man.
   His priestly office is now exercised in heaven, where he ever lives to
   intercede for us.

   This work of Christ is expressed in Scripture, --

   1. By saying that He appears before God for us. Hebrews ix. 24. The
   word used is emphanisthenai = emphanizein heauton tini. Christ presents
   Himself before God as our representative. His perfect manhood, his
   official character, and his finished work, plead for us before the
   throne of God. All that the Son of God as incarnate is, and all that He
   did on earth, He is, and did for us; so that God can regard us with all
   the favour which is due to Him. His presence, therefore, is a perpetual
   and prevailing intercession with God in behalf of his people, and
   secures for them all the benefits of his redemption.

   2. His intercession is expressed by saying that He draws near to God on
   our behalf. The word used is entunchanein, to meet with, to talk with.
   To meet, or approach one for (huper) another, is to intercede in his
   behalf. (Romans viii. 34; Hebrews vii. 25.) To meet one against (kata)
   another is to intercede against him. (Romans xi. 2.) According to the
   Scriptures, and speaking after the manner of men, Christ speaks to God
   in our behalf; or, as it is expressed in John xvii. 9, He prays for us.

   3. Christ is called our Paraclete, parakletos. This word is translated
   advocate in 1 John ii. 1, and comforter in John xiv. 16; xv. 26; xvi.
   7. Neither translation expresses its full meaning. It signifies
   invoked, called upon for help. The Paraclete is, therefore, in the
   comprehensive sense of the word, a helper, whatever may be the specific
   nature of the aid afforded. As, however, the guilty, the ignorant, the
   friendless, when arraigned before a tribunal of justice, need above all
   things an advocate; one who will undertake their cause; present a plea
   in their behalf; and use all his influence to secure their acquittal;
   it is in this sense especially that Christ is set forth as our
   parakletos. He is our advocate. He appears at the bar of God for us. He
   pleads our cause. He presents his work of obedience and suffering as
   the ground of our justification. He exerts his influence, the influence
   of his character as the Son of God in whom the Father is ever well
   pleased, and whom He heareth always, as well as the influence due to
   Him in virtue of the covenant of redemption, and the perfect fulfilment
   of its conditions, to secure for his people all the good they need. It
   is, therefore, especially in passages which speak of justification, and
   of judicial process, that Christ's intercession is brought into view.
   (See Romans viii. 34; 1 John ii. 1.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  2. Its Nature.

   As to the nature of Christ's intercession, little can be said. There is
   error in pressing the representations of Scripture too far; and there
   is error in explaining them away. This latter error is chargeable on
   many of the later theologians, who teach that the Scriptures intend, by
   the intercession of Christ, nothing more than his continued
   intervention or agency in the salvation of his people. Many of the
   Lutheran theologians, on the other extreme, err in insisting that this
   intercession of our Lord in our behalf in heaven is vocalis, verbalis,
   et oralis. Sounds and words suppose an atmosphere and a body, which is
   flesh and blood, which Paul says cannot inherit the kingdom of God. The
   Reformed theologians abstain from these extremes, and consider it
   enough to say that the intercession of Christ includes -- (1.) His
   appearing before God in our behalf, as the sacrifice for our sins, as
   our High Priest, on the ground of whose work we receive the remission
   of our sins, the gift of the Holy Spirit, and all needed good. (2.)
   Defence against the sentence of the law and the charges of Satan, who
   is the great accuser. (3.) His offering Himself as our surety, not only
   that the demands of justice shall be shown to be satisfied, but that
   his people shall be obedient and faithful. (4.) The oblation of the
   persons of the redeemed, sanctifying their prayers, and all their
   services, rendering them acceptable to God, through the savour of his
   own merits.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  3. Its Objects.

   As to the objects of Christ's intercession, the Lutherans make a
   distinction between his intercession as general and special. He
   intercedes generally for all men, and specially for the elect. The
   former is assumed on the authority of Luke xxiii. 34, where Christ is
   represented as praying for his murderers, saying, "Father forgive them;
   for they know not what they do." It is said to be due to the
   intercession of Christ that the wicked are not immediately cut off;
   that they have the Gospel preached to them, and every opportunity
   afforded them of returning unto God. That there is, however, an
   intercession of which the people of Christ alone are objects, Lutherans
   themselves are constrained to admit, as our Lord Himself says: "I pray
   not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me." (John xvii.
   9, 20.) So far as the intercession of Christ is part of his official
   work as the High Priest of our profession, He intercedes only for those
   who accept Him as their priest, and whom He represents in the covenant
   of redemption. This follows from the nature of his office as Priest,
   from his own express declaration, and from the fact that his
   intercession is certainly efficacious. Him the Father heareth always.
   If He interceded for all, all would certainly be saved.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  4. Intercession of Saints.

   There is but one Mediator between God and man, and but one High Priest
   through whom we draw near to God. And as intercession is a priestly
   function, it follows that Christ is our only intercessor. But as there
   is a sense in which all believers are kings and priests unto God, which
   is consistent with Christ's being our only king and priest; so there is
   a sense in which one believer may intercede for another, which is not
   inconsistent with Christ's being our only intercessor. By intercession
   in the case of believers is only meant that one child of God may pray
   for another or for all men. To intercede is in this sense merely to
   pray for. But in the case of Christ it expresses an official act, which
   none who does not fill his office can perform. As under the old economy
   one Israelite could pray for his brethren, but only the High Priest
   could enter within the veil and officially interpose in behalf of the
   people; so now, although we may pray, one for another, Christ only can
   appear as a priest before God in our behalf and plead his merits as the
   ground on which his prayers for his people should be answered.

   Protestants object to the intercession of saints as taught and
   practised in the Church of Rome.

   1. Because it supposes a class of beings who do not exist; that is, of
   canonized departed spirits. It is only those who, with the angels, have
   been officially declared by the Church, on account of their merits, to
   be now in heaven, who are regarded as intercessors. This, however, is
   an unauthorized assumption on the part of the Church. It has no
   prerogative to enable it thus to decide, and to enroll whom it will
   among glorified spirits. Often those thus dignified have been real
   enemies of God, and persecutors of his people.

   2. It leads to practical idolatry. Idolatry is the ascription of divine
   attributes to a creature. In the popular mind the saints, and
   especially the Virgin Mary, are regarded as omnipresent; able at all
   times and in all places, to hear the prayers addressed to them, and to
   relieve the wants of their worshippers.

   3. It is derogatory to Christ. As He is the only and sufficient
   mediator between God and man, and as He is ever willing to hear and
   answer the prayers of his people, it supposes some deficiency in Him,
   if we need other mediators to approach God in our behalf.

   4. It moreover is contrary to Scripture, inasmuch as the saints are
   assumed to prevail with God on account of their personal merits. Such
   merit no human being has before God. No man has any merit to plead for
   his own salvation, much less for the salvation of others.

   5. The practice is superstitious and degrading. Superstition is belief
   without evidence. The practice of the invocation of saints is founded
   on a belief which has no support from Scripture. It is calling upon
   imaginary helpers. It degrades men by turning them from the Creator to
   the creature, by leading them to put their trust in an arm of flesh,
   instead of in the power of Christ. It, therefore, turns away the hearts
   and confidence of the people from Him to those who can neither hear nor
   save.

CHAPTER XI.

  KINGLY OFFICE OF CHRIST.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  1. The Church God's Kingdom.

   God as the creator and preserver of the universe, and as infinite in
   his being and perfections, is, in virtue of his nature, the absolute
   sovereign of all his creatures. This sovereignty He exercises over the
   material world by his wisdom and power, and over rational beings as a
   moral ruler. From this rightful authority of God, our race revolted,
   and thereby became a part of the kingdom of darkness of which Satan is
   the head. To this kingdom the mass of mankind has ever since belonged.
   But God, in his. grace and mercy, determined to deliver men from the.
   consequences of their apostasy. He not only announced the coming of a
   Redeemer who should destroy the power of Satan, but He at once
   inaugurated an antagonistic kingdom? consisting of men chosen out of
   the world, and through the renewing of the Holy Ghost restored to their
   allegiance. Until the time of Abraham this kingdom does not appear to
   have had any visible organization apart from the families of the people
   of God. Every pious household was a church of which the parent was the
   priest.

   To prevent the universal spread of idolatry, to preserve the knowledge
   of the truth, to gather in his elect, and to prepare the way for the
   coming of the promised Redeemer, God entered into covenant with the
   father of the faithful and with his descendants through Isaac,
   constituting them his visible kingdom, and making them the depositaries
   and guardians of his supernatural revelations. In this covenant He
   promised eternal life upon condition of faith in Him that was to come.

   When Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, they were made a theocracy
   so constituted in its officers, in its institutions, and in its
   services, as not only to preserve alive the knowledge of God's purpose
   and plan of salvation, but also to set forth the character, offices,
   and work of the promised seed of Abraham in whom all the nations of the
   earth were to be blessed.

   The kingdom of God, therefore, as consisting of those who acknowledge,
   worship, love, and obey Jehovah as the only living and true God, has
   existed in our world ever since the fall of Adam. It has ever been the
   light and life of the world. It is the salt by which it is preserved.
   It is the leaven by which it is ultimately to be pervaded. To gather
   his people into this kingdom, and to carry it on to its consummation,
   is the end of all God's dispensations, and the purpose for which his
   eternal Son assumed our nature. He was born to be a king. To this end
   He lived and died and rose again, that He might be Lord of all those
   given to Him by the Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  2. Christ is truly a King.

   Although the kingdom of God had existed from the beginning, yet as
   everything therewith connected before the Advent was merely
   preparatory, the Scriptures constantly speak of the Messiah as a king
   who was to set up a kingdom into which in the end all other kingdoms
   were to be merged. The most familiar designation applied to Him in the
   Scriptures is Lord. But Lord means proprietor and ruler; and when used
   of God or Christ, it means absolute proprietor and sovereign ruler.
   Apart from Christ's right in us and sovereignty over us as God, He as
   the God-man is our Lord. We belong to Him by the purchase of his blood,
   and God has set Him as King on his holy hill of Zion.

   In the Book of Genesis the Messiah is set forth as the Shiloh to whom
   is to be the gathering of the people. In reference to Him it was said
   in Numbers xxiv. 17, "There shall come a Star out of Jacob; and a
   Sceptre shall rise out of Israel. In 2 Samuel vii. 16, we have the
   record of God's formal covenant with David, "Thine house and thy
   kingdom shall be established forever before thee: thy throne shall be
   established forever." In fulfilment of that promise Isaiah predicted
   that a virgin should bear a son and call his name Immanuel, on whose
   shoulder should be the government, whose name should be called
   "Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the
   Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there
   shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to
   order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
   henceforth even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform
   this." (Isaiah ix. 6, 7.) In the second Psalm God declares in reference
   to the Messiah, I have "set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. . . . .
   Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and
   the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break
   them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's
   vessel." The whole of the 45th, 72d, and 110th Psalms is devoted to the
   exhibition of the Messiah in his character as king. In Daniel vii. 13,
   14, it is said, "One like the Son of Man came with the clouds of
   heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near
   before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
   that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him; his dominion
   is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom
   that which shall not be destroyed." The prophet Micah v. 2, said,
   "Thou, Bethlehem, Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands
   of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be
   ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from
   everlasting." After the captivity the people were cheered with the hope
   that the promised king was soon to appear. "Rejoice greatly, O daughter
   of Zion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; Behold, thy King cometh unto
   thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass,
   and upon a colt the foal of an ass." (Zech. ix. 9.) This is the mode of
   representation which pervades the Old Testament Scriptures. As the
   priesthood, and sacrifices, and prophets of the former dispensation
   were typical of the prophetic and priestly offices of Christ, so the
   kings of Israel were typical of his kingly office, and so the national
   theocracy of the Mosaic economy was typical of the spiritual theocracy
   of the Messianic period.

   In the New Testament Christ is set forth as a king, in harmony with the
   predictions which foretold his advent. The Angel Gabriel, in announcing
   to the Virgin Mary the approaching birth of the Messiah said, "Thou
   shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his
   name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the
   Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
   David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his
   kingdom there shall be no end." (Luke i. 31-33.) John the Baptist, the
   forerunner of Christ, prepared the people for his coming, saying,
   "Repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." (Matt. iii. 2.) And
   our Lord himself, when He entered upon his personal ministry, went
   everywhere preaching "the gospel of the kingdom of God." (Mark i. 14.)
   Much of his teaching was devoted to setting forth the nature of the
   kingdom which He came to establish.

   Nothing, therefore, is more certain, according to the Scriptures, than
   that Christ is a king; and consequently, if we would retain the truth
   concerning Him and his work, He must be so regarded in our theology and
   religion.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  3. Nature of Christ's Kingdom.

   Although the kingdom of God on earth was set up immediately after the
   fall, yet as the Messiah was to come to make all things new, and to
   take into his hands as the Theanthropos the administration of this
   kingdom, the Old Testament predicted, and the New Testament announces,
   the establishment of a new kingdom as consequent on his advent.

   The word basileia is used in Scripture in three senses. (1.) For royal
   authority or dominion; such dominion as it is the prerogative of a king
   to exercise. (2.) For those who are subject to that authority. Among
   men any community, or commonwealth, or territory subject to a king,
   constitutes his kingdom. And in the New Testament, those who
   acknowledge Christ as their king constitute his kingdom. (3.) The word
   is used metonymically for the effects of the exercise of royal
   authority. It is to be understood in the first of these senses in all
   those cases in which a kingdom or dominion is said to be given to
   Christ; or when we pray, Thy kingdom come, or when it is said, Of his
   kingdom there is no end. It is used in the second sense when men are
   said to enter into the kingdom of Christ, or to be cast out of it, or
   when the character of those is described who are to constitute that
   kingdom. And it is used in the third sense when men are said to
   inherit, to see (or enjoy), to seek, and to value more than hid
   treasure, the kingdom of God. Hence also the kingdom of God is said to
   consist in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Such are
   the effects of the reign of Christ.

   This kingdom is called the kingdom of Christ, or of the Son of God,
   because administered by Him. The royal authority is vested in Him. It
   is called the kingdom of God, because Christ is God, and because it is
   the kingdom which God was to establish on earth in distinction from the
   kingdoms of men. It is called the kingdom of heaven, because its king
   dwells in heaven, because it is spiritual and heavenly, and because it
   is to be consummated in heaven, Various as are the applications and
   uses of these designations in the New Testament, they are included
   under the general idea of the Messianic kingdom; that kingdom which the
   Messiah came into the world to establish. That kingdom, however, is
   presented in different aspects, or, in other words, Christ exercises
   his royal authority, so to speak, in different spheres.

   Christ's Dominion over the Universe.

   Christ has what theologians are accustomed to call his kingdom of
   power. As Theanthropos and as Mediator, all power in heaven and upon
   earth has been committed to his hands. (Matt. xxviii. 18.) In Psalm
   viii. 6, it is declared to be the purpose of God that all things should
   be put under the feet of man. This purpose, we are taught by the
   Apostle, God fulfilled in the exaltation of Christ, "when he raised him
   from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly
   places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion,
   and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that
   which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him
   to be the head over all things to the church." (Eph. i. 20-22.) In 1
   Corinthians xv. 27, the argument is pushed to its utmost extreme. When
   all things are said to be put under the feet of Christ, nothing is to
   be excepted from this subjection, except Him "which did put all things
   under him." And in Hebrews ii. 8, it is said, "In that he put all (ta
   panta, the universe) in subjection under him, he left nothing that is
   not put under him." The same universality of dominion is implied in
   Christ's sitting at the right hand of God. As this session on the
   throne of God involves equality with God in glory and dominion, it
   cannot be said of any creature. And as it is said of Christ it proves
   that Christ is a divine person, and is invested with all the power and
   authority of God. This is the Apostle's argument in Hebrews i. 13. "To
   which of the angels (to what created being) said he at any time, Sit on
   my right hand?" The Apostle says to the Philippians, that Him, who
   though equal with God was found in fashion as a man, "God hath highly
   exalted, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the
   name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in
   earth, and things under the earth." (Phil. ii. 9, 10.) This is a
   perfectly exhaustive statement. All in heaven, all in earth, and all
   under the earth, include all rational creatures. The person to whom
   they are to bow the knee is Jesus, not the Logos, but the God-man. And
   the acknowledgment which they are to make is, that He is Lord, i.e.,
   their Lord, their absolute proprietor and Sovereign. It is in this
   sense also, that the Apostle says (Heb. i. 2), that God hath appointed
   the Son heir of all things. It is in virtue of this dominion over the
   universe that Christ is called Lord of lords and King of kings, i.e.
   the Sovereign over all other sovereigns in heaven and on earth.

   This universal authority is exercised in a providential control, and
   for the benefit of his Church. He employs the angels as ministering
   spirits, to minister to the heirs of salvation. He controls and
   restrains the principalities, powers, world-rulers, and spirits of
   wickedness. (Eph. vi. 12.) He overrules all the affairs of nations and
   of individuals to the same end. He directs all events concerning his
   people severally and his Church collectively. Paul constantly
   recognized this providential control of Christ as directing all his
   steps. Under the present dispensation, therefore, Christ is the God of
   providence. It is in and through and by Him that the universe is
   governed. This dominion or kingdom is to last until its object is
   accomplished, i.e., until all his enemies, all forms of evil, and even
   death itself is subdued. Then this kingdom, this mediatorial government
   of the universe, is to be given up. (1 Cor. xv. 24.)

   Christ's Spiritual Kingdom.

   But besides this kingdom of power, Christ has a kingdom of grace. This
   also is exhibited under two aspects. It includes the relation in which
   He stands to his true people individually and collectively (the
   invisible Church); and the relation He sustains to the visible Church,
   or the body of his professing people.

   He is the king of every believing soul. He translates it from the
   kingdom of darkness. He brings it into subjection to Himself. He rules
   in and reigns over it. Every believer recognizes Christ as his absolute
   Sovereign; Lord of his inward, as well as of his outward, life. He
   yields to Him the entire subjection of the reason, of the conscience,
   and of the heart. He makes Him the object of reverence, love, and
   obedience. In Him he trusts for protection from all enemies, seen and
   unseen. On Him he relies for help in every emergency, and for final
   triumph. On Him the loyalty of the believer terminates. To acquit
   himself as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, to spend and be spent in his
   service and in the promotion of his kingdom, becomes the governing
   purpose of his life.

   The terms of admission into this spiritual kingdom are faith and
   repentance (John iii. 3, 5). "Except a man be born of water and of the
   Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;" or, conversion (Matt.
   xviii. 3), "Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye
   shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven;" purity of life (1 Cor. vi.
   9), "The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God, nor
   "extortioners;" nor such as indulge in "adultery, fornication,
   uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
   emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
   drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which," the Apostle says, "I
   tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which
   do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." (Gal. v. 19-21.)

   On the other hand, we are taught that no external profession secures
   admission into this kingdom. "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
   Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven." (Matt. vii. 21.) Nor any
   punctiliousness in the performance of rites and ceremonies, "Except
   your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
   Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."
   (Matt. v. 20.) "He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is
   that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh." (Rom. ii. 28.) "For
   in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
   uncircumcision." (Gal. v. 6.) "Baptism doth also now save us; not the
   putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
   conscience towards God." (1 Pet. iii. 21.) Nor membership in any
   external community, "Think not to say within yourselves, We have
   Abraham to our father." (Matt. iii. 9.) "They are not all Israel, which
   are of Israel." (Rom. ix. 6.) The kingdom of Christ, in this aspect of
   it, is a purely spiritual community, consisting of those truly and
   inwardly his people.

   The laws of this kingdom require first and above all, faith in Jesus
   Christ; the sincere belief that He is the Son of God and the Saviour of
   the world, and cordial submission to Him and trust in Him as our
   prophet, priest, and king. With this faith is united supreme love. "He
   that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he
   that loveth son or daughter more than me, ir not worthy of me. . . . .
   He that findeth his life, shall lose it, and he that loseth his life
   for my sake shall find it." (Matt. x. 37, 39.) "If any man come to me,
   and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and
   brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my
   disciple." (Luke xiv. 26.) "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ,
   let him be anathema maranatha." (1 Cor. xvi. 22.) With this supreme
   love are to be connected all the other religious affections. Christians
   are the worshippers of Christ. (1 Cor. i. 2.) Christ requires his
   disciples to honour Him as they honour the Father. (John v. 23.) They
   are to believe in Him (put the same confidence in Him), as they do in
   God. (John xiv. 1.) It is the same offence under the new dispensation
   to refuse to worship Christ as God manifest in the flesh, that it was
   under the old economy to refuse to worship Jehovah as the only living
   and true God. In both cases it was a violation of the fundamental law
   of the kingdom, and of necessity worked excision from God's people. But
   if we are to recognize Christ as Thomas did (John xx. 28), as our Lord
   and our God, then of course we are bound not only to worship, but to
   obey Him. We stand to Him in the same relation that a slave does to his
   master, except that our subjection to Him is voluntary and joyful. We
   belong to Him, not only as the Creator, being his creatures, but also
   as the Theanthropos, being purchased by his blood. (1 Cor. vi. 19, 20.)
   His will, and not our own, must govern our conduct, and determine the
   use we make of our powers. All we gain, whether of knowledge, wealth,
   or influence, is his. He, and not we ourselves, is the object or end of
   our living. It is Christ for believers to live. His glory and the
   advancement of his kingdom, are the only legitimate objects to which
   they can devote their powers or resources; the only ends consistent
   with their relation to Christ, and the full enjoyment of the
   blessedness which membership in his Kingdom secures.

   The laws of the kingdom moreover require not only these duties to
   Christ, but that his people should be holy in heart and life. They must
   be poor in spirit; meek; merciful; peace-makers; long-suffering; ready
   to forgive; disinterested, not seeking their own; bearing all things;
   believing all things; and hoping all things. They are forbidden to be
   avaricious, or covetous, or proud, or worldly minded. In one word, they
   are required to be like Christ, in disposition, character, and conduct.

   The special law of Christ's kingdom is that its members should love one
   another, not only with the love of complacency and delight, but with
   brotherly love. A love which leads to the recognition of all Christians
   as brethren, belonging to the same family, entitled to the same
   privileges and blessings; and which prompts to and secures ministering
   to their necessities, so that there be no lack. This law is laid down
   at length by the Apostle in 2 Corinthians viii. The law of the kingdom
   is, that every man should labour to the extent of his ability to supply
   his own wants and the wants of those dependent on him; for "if any
   would not work neither should he eat" (2 Thess. iii. 10); but all
   deficiency which labour cannot supply is to be supplied by those having
   the ability. "Whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have
   need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth
   the love of God in him?" (1 John iii. 17.) In praying, therefore, that
   the kingdom of God may come, we pray, among other things, that all men
   may recognize Christ as their king, invested with divine majesty and
   authority, and that they should all be like Him in character and
   conduct.

   This kingdom of Christ over all his people is exercised not only by his
   power in their protection and direction, but especially by his Word and
   Spirit, through which and by whom He reigns in and rules over them.

   This kingdom of Christ is everlasting. That is, the relation which
   believers sustain to Christ on earth they will sustain to Him forever.

   Christ's Visible Kingdom.

   As religion is essentially spiritual, an inward state, the kingdom of
   Christ as consisting of the truly regenerated, is not a visible body,
   except so far as goodness renders itself visible by its outward
   manifestations. Nevertheless as Christ has enjoined upon his people
   duties which render it necessary that they should organize themselves
   in an external society, it follows that there is and must be a visible
   kingdom of Christ in the world. Christians are required to associate
   for public worship, for the admission and exclusion of members, for the
   administration of the sacraments, for the maintenance and propagation
   of the truth. They therefore form themselves into churches, and
   collectively constitute the visible kingdom of Christ on earth,
   consisting of all who profess the true religion, together with their
   children.

   Nature of this Kingdom.

   First, it is spiritual. That is, it is not of this world. It is not
   analogous to the other kingdoms which existed, or do still exist among
   men. It has a different origin and a different end. Human kingdoms are
   organized among men, under the providential government of God, for the
   promotion of the temporal well-being of society. The kingdom of Christ
   was organized immediately by God, for the promotion of religious
   objects. It is spiritual, or not of this world, moreover, because it
   has no power over the lives, liberty, or property of its members; and
   because all secular matters lie beyond its jurisdiction. Its
   prerogative is simply to declare the truth of God as revealed in his
   Word and to require that the truth should be professed and obeyed by
   all under its jurisdiction. It can decide no question of politics or
   science which is not decided in the Bible. The kingdom of Christ, under
   the present dispensation, therefore, is not worldly even in the sense
   in which the ancient theocracy was of this world. The latter organized
   the Hebrews as a nation, and directed all their municipal and national,
   as well as their social and religious affairs. It, therefore, could not
   coexist in time and place with any other national organization. The
   kingdom of Christ being designed to embrace all other kingdoms, can
   exist under all forms of civil government without interfering with any.
   It was especially in this view that Christ declared that his kingdom
   was not of this world. His immediate design was to vindicate his claim
   to be a king, from the charge that such claim was incompatible with the
   authority of the civil magistrate or of the Roman emperor. He intended
   to say that his kingdom was of such a nature that it necessitated no
   collision with the legitimate authority of any civil government. It
   belonged to a different sphere. It took cognizance of things which lie
   beyond the province of secular power; and it left untouched all that
   belongs peculiarly to civil rulers. Christ, therefore, could be
   recognized and obeyed as king by those who continued to render unto
   Cæsar the things which were Cæsar's. Every form or claim of the Church,
   therefore, which is incompatible with the legitimate authority of the
   State, is inconsistent with the nature of Christ's kingdom as declared
   by Himself.

   Secondly, this kingdom of Christ is catholic or universal. It embraces
   all who profess the true religion. It is confined to no one
   organization; but includes them all; because all are under the
   authority of Christ and subject to the laws which He has laid down in
   his Word. As all Christians are included in the kingdom of Christ, it
   is the duty of all to recognize each other as belonging to one great
   commonwealth, and as subjects of the same sovereign.

   Thirdly, this form of Christ's kingdom is temporary. It is to be merged
   into a higher form when He shall come the second time without sin unto
   salvation. As an external organization it is designed to answer certain
   ends, and will cease when those ends are accomplished.

   Fourthly, the kingdom of Christ is not a democracy, nor an aristocracy,
   but truly a kingdom of which Christ is absolute sovereign. This
   involves the denial, --

   1. That the State has any authority to make laws to determine the
   faith, to regulate the worship, or to administer the discipline of the
   Church. It can neither appoint nor depose its officers.

   2. It denies that any civil officer as such, or in virtue of his
   office, has any authority in the kingdom of Christ; much less can any
   such officer be the head of the Church.

   3. It denies that Church power vests ultimately in the people, or in
   the clergy. All their power is purely ministerial. It is derived from
   Christ, and is exercised by others in his name, and according to the
   rules laid down in his Word. How far the Church has discretionary power
   in matters of detail is a disputed point. By some all such discretion
   is denied. They maintain that everything concerning the organization,
   officers, and modes of action of the Church is as minutely laid down in
   the New Testament as the curtains, tassels, and implements of the
   tabernacle are detailed in the Old Testament. Others hold that while
   certain principles on this subject are laid down in Scripture,
   considerable latitude is allowed as to the means and manner in which
   the Church may carry them out in the exercise of her functions. This
   latter view has always been practically adopted. Even the Apostolical
   Churches were not all organized precisely in the same way. The presence
   of an Apostle, or of a man clothed with apostolical authority, as in
   the case of James in Jerusalem, necessarily gave to a Church a form
   which other churches where no Apostle permanently resided could not
   have. Some had deaconesses, others had not. So all churches in every
   age and wherever they have existed, have felt at liberty to modify
   their organization and modes of action so as to suit them to their
   peculiar circumstances. All such modifications are matters of
   indifference. They cannot be made to bind the conscience, nor can they
   be rendered conditions of Christian or ecclesiastical fellowship.

   As Christ is the only head of the Church it follows that its allegiance
   is to Him, and that whenever those out of the Church undertake to
   regulate its affairs or to curtail its liberties, its members are bound
   to obey Him rather than men. They are bound by all legitimate means to
   resist such usurpations, and to stand fast in the liberty wherewith
   Christ has made them free. They are under equal obligation to resist
   all undue assumption of authority by those within the Church, whether
   it be by the brotherhood or by individual officers, or by Church
   councils or courts. The allegiance of the people terminates on Christ.
   They are bound to obey others only so far as obedience to them is
   obedience to Him. In the early ages some endeavoured to impose on
   Christians the yoke of the Jewish law. This of course they were bound
   to resist. In the following centuries, and by degrees, the intolerable
   rituals, ceremonies, fasts, festivals, and priestly, prelatical, and
   papal assumptions, which oppress so large a part of the Christian
   world, have been imposed upon the people in derogation to the authority
   of Christ as the sole head of the Church. Councils, provincial and
   ecumenical, have not only prescribed creeds contrary to the Scriptures,
   but also have made laws to bind the conscience, and ordained
   observances which Christ never enjoined.

   As Christ is the head of his earthly kingdom, so is He its only
   lawgiver. He prescribes, --

   1. The terms of admission into his kingdom. These cannot be rightfully
   altered by any human authority. Men can neither add to them, nor
   detract from them. The rule which He has laid down on this subject is,
   that what He requires as a condition for admission into his kingdom in
   heaven, is to be required as a condition of admission to his kingdom on
   earth. Nothing more and nothing less is to be demanded. We are to
   receive all those whom Christ receives. No degree of knowledge, no
   confession, beyond that which is necessary to salvation, can be
   demanded as a condition of our recognizing any one as a Christian
   brother and treating him as such. Philip baptized the Eunuch on the
   confession "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." (Acts viii.
   37.) "Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
   disputations." (Rom. xiv. 1.) "Who art thou that judgest another man's
   servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth." (Verse 4.)
   "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God." (1 John
   v. 1.) For men to reject from their fellowship those whom God has
   received into his, is an intolerable assumption. All those terms of
   Church communion which have been set up beyond the credible profession
   of faith in Christ are usurpations of an authority which belongs to Him
   alone.

   2. A second law of this visible kingdom of our Lord is that heretics
   and those guilty of scandalous offences should be excommunicated. "A
   man that is an heretic, after the first and second admonition reject."
   (Titus iii. 10.) "I have written unto you not to keep company, if any
   man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an
   idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an
   one no not to eat." (1 Cor. v. 11.) Our Lord teaches that such an
   offender when he refuses to hear "the Church" is to be regarded as a
   "heathen man and a publican." (Matt. xviii. 17.)

   3. Christ has ordained that the power of exercising discipline and the
   other prerogatives of the Church should be in the hands of officers,
   having certain gifts and qualifications and duly appointed.

   4. That the right to judge of the qualifications of such officers is
   vested in, or rather belongs to those who by the Holy Ghost have
   themselves been called to be office bearers.

   5. That such officers are not lords over God's heritage, but servants.
   Their authority is restricted to prescribed limits, and the people have
   a right to a substantive part in the government of the Church through
   their representatives.

   6. Every member of Christ's kingdom is bound to obey his brethren in
   the Lord. This obligation does not rest on consent or mutual covenant,
   but on the fact that they are brethren, the temples and organs of the
   Holy Spirit. It is, therefore, not limited to those brethren with whom
   the individual chooses to associate himself. It hence follows that in
   the normal condition of Christ's kingdom, each part would be subject to
   the whole, and the whole would be one body in the Lord.

   The development of these several points belongs to the department of
   Ecclesiology.

   §  4. The Kingdom of Glory.

   The Scriptures teach that when Christ shall come again, He will gather
   his people into the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of
   the world. Concerning that kingdom it is taught, --

   1. That it shall consist only of the redeemed. None but the regenerate
   or converted can enter that kingdom. The tares are to be separated from
   the wheat. The evil, we are told (Gal. v. 21), "shall not inherit the
   kingdom of God." Nothing that defiles or is untrue can enter there.

   2. Those counted worthy of that kingdom shall not only be elevated to
   the perfection of their nature, but shall also be exalted to great
   dignity, power, and glory. They shall be kings and priests unto God.
   They are to sit on thrones. They are to judge angels. They are to reign
   with Christ, sharing his dominion and glory.

   3. This kingdom is to be everlasting.

   4. The bodies of the saints, now natural, must be rendered spiritual.
   This mortal must put on immortality, and this corruptible must put on
   incorruption; for "flesh and blood (the body as now organized) cannot
   inherit the kingdom of God." (1 Cor. xv. 50.)

   5. The seat of this kingdom is not clearly revealed. Some suppose that
   it is to be on this earth regenerated and fitted for this new order of
   things. Others understand the Scriptures to teach that heaven as
   indicating an entirely different locality, is to be the final home of
   the redeemed.

   6. Diversity of opinion exists as to the time when this kingdom shall
   be inaugurated. Chiliasts have commonly held that Christ is to come a
   thousand years (or a protracted period) before the general resurrection
   and final judgment, and reign visibly on earth, and that this is the
   kingdom to which the prophecies and promises of Scripture especially
   refer. This doctrine of necessity greatly modifies the view taken of
   the nature of this kingdom. It must be an earthly kingdom, as
   distinguished from that which is spiritual and heavenly. It must be a
   kingdom which flesh and blood can inherit. The common doctrine of the
   Church on the subject is that the general resurrection, the final
   judgment, the end of the world, and the inauguration of Christ's
   kingdom of glory are synchronous events.

   These are topics which belong to the head of Eschatology.

CHAPTER XII.

  HUMILIATION OF CHRIST.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  1. Includes his Incarnation.

   The Apostle tells us that Christ humbled Himself. In answer to the
   question, Wherein his humiliation consisted? our standards wisely
   content themselves with the simple statements of the Scriptures:
   "Christ's humiliation consisted in his being born and that in a low
   condition, made under the law, undergoing the miseries of this life,
   the wrath of God, and the cursed death of the cross; in being buried,
   and continuing under the power of death for a time."

   On all these points the schoolmen and modern philosophical theologians
   have indulged in unprofitable speculations. All that is known, or can
   be known respecting them is the facts themselves.

   The person of whom all the particulars above enumerated are predicated,
   is the Eternal Son of God. It was He who was born, who suffered, and
   who died. It was a person equal with God, who, the Apostle says, in
   Philippians ii. 7, 8, was made in the likeness of men, and found in
   fashion as a man. It was the Son of God who was born of a woman, and
   made under the law. (Gal. iv. 4.) In the Old Testament it was predicted
   that a virgin should conceive, and bring forth a son, who should be
   called Immanuel, the mighty God. In revealing these facts the
   Scriptures reveal all we can know concerning the birth of Christ. He
   was born of a woman. In the birth of an ordinary human being there are
   mysteries which neither speculation nor science can solve. All we know
   is that in conception an immaterial principle, a human soul, is joined
   in unity of life with the germ of a human body, and, after a given
   process of development, is born a perfect child. In the case of our
   Lord, by the immediate or supernatural power of the Holy Ghost, these
   elements of humanity, material and immaterial (body and soul), from the
   beginning of their existence were n personal union with the Logos, so
   that the child born of the Virgin was in a true and exclusive sense the
   Son of God.

   In opposition to the early heretics, some of whom said that Christ had
   no real human body, and others, that his body was not fashioned out of
   matter, but formed of a celestial substance, the fathers inserted in
   their creeds, that he was "born of the substance of the Virgin Mary."
   This is involved in the Scriptural statement that He was born of a
   woman, which can only mean that He was born in the sense in which other
   children of men are born of women. This is essential to his true
   humanity, and to that likeness to men which makes them his brethren,
   and which was se cured by his taking part in flesh and blood. (Heb. ii.
   14.)

   The incarnation of the Son of God, his stooping to take into personal
   and perpetual union with Himself a nature infinitely lower than his
   own, was an act of unspeakable condescension, and therefore is properly
   included in the particulars in which He humbled Himself. It is so
   represented in the Scriptures, and that it is such is involved in the
   very nature of the act, on any other hypothesis than that which assumes
   the equality of God and man; or that man is a modus existendi of the
   Deity, and that the highest.

   The Lutheran theologians exclude the incarnation as an element of
   Christ's humiliation, on the ground that his humiliation was confined
   to his earthly existence, whereas his union with our nature continues
   in heaven. This, however, is contrary to Scripture, because the Apostle
   says that He made himself of no reputation in becoming man. (Phil. ii.
   7.) It is constantly represented as a wonderful exhibition of his love
   for his people. It was for their sake that He stooped to become a
   partaker of flesh and blood. The objection that his humiliation can
   include only what is limited to the earthly stage of his existence, is
   purely verbal or technical. That He bears his glorified humanity in
   heaven, having transmuted that humble mantle into a robe of glory, does
   not detract from the condescension involved in its assumption, and in
   his bearing it with all its imperfections during his earthly
   pilgrimage.

   There are some forms of the modern speculations on this subject which
   effectually preclude our regarding the incarnation as an act of
   humiliation. It is assumed, as stated on a previous page, that this
   union of the divine and human is the culminating point in the regular
   development of humanity. Its relation to the sinfulness of man and the
   redemption of the race is merely incidental. It would have been reached
   had sin never entered into the world. It is obvious that this is a mere
   philosophical theory, entirely outside of the Scriptures, and can
   legitimately have no influence on Christian doctrine. The Bible
   everywhere teaches that God sent his Son into the world to save
   sinners; that He was born of a woman and made under the law for our
   redemption; that He became man in order that He might die, and by death
   destroy the power of Satan. No speculation inconsistent with these
   prevailing representations of the Word of God can be admitted as true
   by those to whom that word is the rule of faith.

   Christ was born in a Low Condition.

   Not only the assumption of human nature, out also all the circumstances
   by which it was attended enter into the Scriptural view of the
   humiliation of our Lord. Had He when He came into the world so
   manifested his glory, and so exercised his power, as to have coerced
   all nations to acknowledge Him as their Lord and God, and all kings to
   bow at his feet and bring Him their tributes, enthroning Him as the
   rightful and absolute sovereign of the whole earth, it had still been
   an act of unspeakable condescension for God to become man. But to be a
   servant; to be born in a stable and cradled in a manger; to be so poor
   as not to have a place where to lay his head; to appear without form or
   comeliness, so as to be despised and rejected of men, makes the
   condescension of our Lord to pass all comprehension. There is, indeed,
   a wonderfu1 sublimity in this. It shows the utter worthlessness of
   earthly pomp and splendour in the sight of God. The manifestation of
   God in the form of a servant, has far more power not only over the
   imagination but also over the heart, than his appearing in the form of
   an earthly king clothed in purple and crowned with gold. We bow at the
   feet of the poor despised Galilean with profounder reverence and love
   than we could experience had He appeared as Solomon in all his glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  2. He was made under the Law.

   The humiliation of Christ included also his being made under the law.
   The law to which Christ subjected Himself was, (1.) The law given to
   Adam as a covenant of works; that is, as prescribing perfect obedience
   as the condition of life. (2.) The Mosaic law which bound the chosen
   people. (3.) The moral law as a rule of duty. Christ was subject to the
   law in all these aspects, in that He assumed the obligation to fulfil
   all righteousness, i.e., to do everything which the law in all its
   forms demanded. This subjection to the law was voluntary and vicarious.
   It was voluntary, not only as his incarnation was a voluntary act, and
   therefore all its consequences were assumed of his own free will; but
   also because even after He assumed our nature He was free from
   obligation to the law in every sense of the word, until He voluntarily
   subjected Himself to its demands. The law is made for men, i.e., for
   human persons. But Christ was not a human person. He remained after the
   incarnation, as He had been from eternity, a divine person. All his
   relations to the law, therefore, except as voluntarily assumed, were
   those which God himself sustains to it. God being the source of all law
   cannot be subject to it, except by an act of humiliation. Even in human
   governments an autocrat is above the laws. They derive their authority
   from him. He can abrogate or change them at pleasure. He is subject so
   far as men are concerned to nothing but his own will. And so God, as
   the source of all law to his creatures, is Himself subject to none. He
   acts in consistency with his own nature, and it is inconceivable that
   He should act otherwise. He cannot be subject to any imposed rule of
   action, or to anything out of Himself. Whatever is true of God, is true
   of God manifested in the flesh. That Christ, therefore, should assume
   the obligation to fulfil the conditions of the covenant made with Adam,
   to observe all the injunctions of the Mosaic law, and submit to the
   moral law with its promises and penalty was an act of voluntary
   humiliation. This subjection to the law was not only voluntary, but
   vicarious. He was in our stead, as our representative, and for our
   benefit. He was made under the law that He might redeem those who were
   under the law. (Gal. iv. 4, 5.) It was in his character of Redeemer
   that He submitted to this subjection. There was no necessity for it on
   his part. As He was Lord of the Sabbath, so He was Lord of the law in
   all its extent and in all its forms. Obedience to it was not imposed ab
   extra as a condition of his personal happiness and enjoyment of the
   divine favour. These were secured by his Godhead. It was therefore
   solely for us that He was made under the saw. As by Adam's disobedience
   we were constituted sinners, He obeyed that we might be constituted
   righteous. (Rom. v. 19.) The whole course of Christ on earth was one of
   voluntary obedience. He came to do the will of his Father. In the Old
   Testament his common prophetic designation was servant. He was called
   the servant of the Lord, "my servant." He says of Himself, "I came down
   from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent
   me." (John vi. 38.) "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience."
   (Heb. v. 8.) "Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
   became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross." (Phil. ii.
   8.) All this was for us. His subjection to the law and to the will of
   the Father was voluntary arid vicarious for us men and for our
   salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  3. His Sufferings and Death.

   The sufferings of Christ, and especially his ignominious death on the
   cross, are an important element in his humiliation. These sufferings
   continued from the beginning to the end of his earthly life. They arose
   partly from the natural infirmities and sensibilities of the nature
   which He assumed, partly from the condition of poverty in which He
   lived, partly from constant contact with sinners, which was a continued
   grief to his holy soul and caused Him to exclaim, "How long shall I be
   with you? how long shall I suffer you;" partly from the insults,
   neglects, and opposition to which He was subjected; partly from the
   cruel buffetings and scorning to which He submitted, and especially
   from the agonies of the crucifixion, the most painful as well as the
   most ignominious mode of inflicting the penalty of death; partly from
   the anguish caused by the foresight of the dreadful doom that awaited
   the whole Jewish nation; and especially no doubt from the mysterious
   sorrow arising from the load of his people's sins and the hiding of his
   Father's face, which forced from his brow the sweat of blood in the
   garden, and from his lips the cry of anguish which He uttered on the
   cross. These are wonders not only of love, but of self-abnegation and
   of humiliation, which angels endeavour to comprehend, but which no
   human mind can understand or estimate. There was never sorrow like unto
   his sorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  4. He endured the Wrath of God.

   Our standards specify "the wrath of God," as a distinct particular of
   the burden of sorrow which Christ, for our sakes, humbled Himself to
   bear. The word wrath is the familiar Scriptural term to express any
   manifestation of the displeasure of God against sin. Christ, although
   in Himself perfectly holy, bore our sins. He was "made sin" (2 Cor. v.
   21); or, treated as a sinner. He was "numbered with the transgressors"
   (Is. liii. 12), not only in the judgment of men, but in the dealing of
   God with his soul when He stood in the place of sinners. Such Psalms as
   the sixteenth, fortieth, and especially the twenty-second, which treat
   of the sufferings of the Messiah, represent Him as passing through all
   the experiences consequent on the punishment of sin, save those which
   have their source in the sinfulness of the sufferer. We therefore find
   that even such language as that in Psalm xl. 12, "Innumerable evils
   have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so
   that I am not able to look up: they are more than the hairs of mine
   head; therefore my heart faileth me," may not inappropriately be taken
   as the language of his holy soul. In that case "mine iniquities"
   (vnty), as parallel with "evils" (rvt), must mean "my sufferings for
   sin," i.e., the punishment I am called to bear. The words uttered by
   our Lord upon the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
   show that He was suffering under the hiding of his Father's face. What
   that experience was it is impossible for us to understand. Yet as in
   other cases He suffered anxiety, fear, a sinking of the heart, and
   other natural states of mind incident to the circumstances in which He
   was placed; so also He suffered all that a holy being could suffer that
   was enduring the divinely appointed penalty for sin, which penalty He
   sustained for his people. Into the relation between his divine and
   human nature as revealed in these experiences, it is in vain for us to
   inquire. As that relation was consistent with his human nature's being
   ignorant, with its progressive development, with all its natural
   affections, with its feeling apprehension in the presence of danger,
   and dread in the prospect of death, so it was consistent with the
   feeling of depression and anguish under the obscuration of the favour
   of God. As the sufferings of Christ were not merely the pains of
   martyrdom, but were judicially inflicted in satisfaction of justice,
   they produced the effect due to their specific character. This of
   course does not imply that our Lord suffered as the finally impenitent
   suffer. Their sufferings are determined by their subjective state. The
   loss of the divine favour produces in them hatred, venting itself in
   blasphemies (Rev. xvi. 10, 11), but in Christ it produced the most
   earnest longing after the light of God's countenance, and entire
   submission, in the midst of the depressing and overwhelming darkness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  5. His Death and Burial.

   Christ humbled Himself even unto death, and continued under the power
   of death for a time. The reality of Christ's death has never been
   disputed among Christians. Some modern rationalists, unwilling to admit
   a miraculous resurrection, endeavoured to show that death was not in
   his case actually consummated, but that He was deposited in an
   unconscious state in the tomb. In answer to the arguments of
   rationalists, certain Christian writers have taken the trouble to
   demonstrate, from the facts stated in the account of the crucifixion,
   that it was not a swoon, but actual death which occurred. We are raised
   above such question by believing the inspiration of the New Testament.
   In the apostolic writings the death of Christ is so often asserted and
   assumed that the fact cannot be doubted by any who admit the infallible
   authority of those writings.

   Under the clause, "He continued under the power of death for a time,"
   is intended to be expressed all that is meant by ancient creeds which
   asserted "He descended into hell." Such at least is the view presented
   in our standards in accordance with the teachings of the majority of
   the Reformed theologians.

   That the sufferings of Christ ceased the moment He expired on the
   cross, is plain from John xix. 30, where it is recorded, "When Jesus
   had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished (Tetelestai): and he
   bowed his head, and gave up the ghost." This is universally admitted.
   As, however, such passages as Psalms xviii. 5, and cxvi. 3, "The
   sorrows of death" (Hebrew Sheol in Psalm xviii. 5), were understood to
   mean extreme suffering, many of the Reformed understood the descensus
   ad inferos to refer to the extreme agony of our Lord in the garden and
   upon the cross, under the hiding of his Father's face. But, in the
   first place, the literal meaning of those passages is, "The bands (not
   the sorrows) of Sheol, or (as it is in Psalms cxvi. 3), of death." The
   allusion in both cases is the familiar one to a net. The idea is that
   the Psalmist felt himself so entangled that death appeared inevitable.
   This is something very different from what is meant by "descending into
   Hell or Sheol." And in the second place, the position which the clause
   in question holds in the creed forbids this interpretation. It follows
   the clause referring to the death and burial of Christ. It is the
   natural exegesis of the words immediately preceding it. "He was
   crucified, dead, and buried, he descended into Sheol," i.e., he passed
   into the invisible state. But it would be utterly incongruous to say,
   "He was dead, buried, and suffered extreme agony," when it is admitted
   that his sufferings ended upon the cross.

   In the larger Westminster Catechism, [467] it is said, "Christ's
   humiliation after his death consisted in his being buried, and
   continuing in the state of the dead, and under the power of death till
   the third day, which hath been otherwise expressed in these words, He
   descended into hell." That this is the correct view of Christ's
   descensus ad inferos may be argued, --

   1. From the original and proper meaning of the Greek word hades, and
   the corresponding English word hell. Both mean the unseen world. The
   one signifies what is unseen, the other what is covered and thus hidden
   from view. Both are used as the rendering for the Hebrew word s'vl.
   (probably from s'l to ask, or demand), the state or place of the dead;
   the orcus rapax of the Latins. All the dead, the righteous and the
   wicked, alike go into the invisible world, or, in this sense, "descend
   into hell." Hence to be buried, to go down to the grave, to descend
   into hell, are in Scriptural language equivalent forms of expression.
   In Genesis xxxvii. 35, Jacob says 'rd s'vlh, which the Septuagint
   renders katabesomai eis hadou; the Vulgate, Descendam in infernum; the
   English, "I will go down into the grave." Thus also in Psalm xxx. 4,
   David says, hlyt mvs'vl nphsy, which the Septuagint renders, ex hadou
   ten psuchen mou; the Vulgate, "Eduxisti ab inferno animam meam;" and so
   Luther, "Du hast meine Seele aus der Hölle geführet;" while the English
   version is, "Thou hast brought up my soul from the grave," which is
   explained in the following clause, "Thou hast kept me alive, that I
   should not go down to the pit." In Scriptural language, therefore, to
   descend into Hades or Hell, means nothing more than to descend to the
   grave, to pass from the visible into the invisible world, as happens to
   all men when they die and are buried.

   2. This view is confirmed by the fact that these words were not in the
   creed originally. They were introduced in the fourth century, and then
   not as a separate or distinct article, but as merely explanatory. "He
   was dead and buried," i.e., he descended into hell. That the two
   clauses were at first considered equivalent is obvious, because some
   copies of the creed had the one form, some the other, and some both,
   though all were intended to say the same thing.

   3. The passages of Scripture which are adduced to prove that Christ
   descended into hell in a sense peculiar to Himself, do not teach that
   doctrine. In Psalm xvi. 10, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;
   neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption," merely
   expresses the confidence of the speaker that God would not leave him
   under the power of death. Thou wilt not deliver me to the power of
   Sheol, nor suffer me to see corruption.' This is the precise sense
   ascribed to the passage by St. Peter in Acts ii. 27-31, and by St. Paul
   in Acts xiii. 34, 35. In both cases the Psalm is quoted to prove the
   resurrection of Christ. David was left in the state of the dead; his
   body did see corruption. Christ was delivered from the grave before
   corruption had time to affect his sacred person. My soul (nphsy), may
   be taken here, as so often elsewhere, for the personal pronoun, as in
   the passage quoted above. Psalm xxx. 4: "Thou hast brought up my soul
   (me) from the grave." See Psalm iii. 2, "Many there be which say of my
   soul (me), there is no help for him in God." Psalm vii. 8, "Lest he
   tear my soul (me) like a lion." Psalm xi. 1, "How say ye to my soul (to
   me) Flee as a bird to your mountain." Psalm xxxv. 7, "A pit which
   without cause they have digged for my soul (for me)." But even if the
   words "my soul" be taken in their strict sense, the meaning is still
   the same. The souls of men at death pass into the invisible world, they
   are hidden from the view and companionship of men. This condition was
   to continue in the case of Christ only for a few days. He was to be
   recalled to life. His soul was to be reunited to his body, as it was
   before.

   A second passage relied upon in this matter is Ephesians iv. 9, "Now
   that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the
   lower parts of the earth?" By "the lower parts of the earth" many
   understand the parts lower than the earth; the lower, or infernal
   regions. But in the first place, this is altogether an unnecessary
   interpretation. The words may naturally mean here, as elsewhere, the
   lower parts, namely, the earth; the genitive tes ges being the genitive
   of apposition. See Isaiah xliv. 23, "Sing, O ye heavens; . . . . shout,
   ye lower parts the earth." In the second place, the context neither
   here nor in Psalm lxviii. whence the passage is taken, or on which the
   Apostle is commenting, suggests any other contrast than that between
   heaven and earth. He that ascended to heaven, is he who first descended
   to the earth.' In the third place, the Apostle's object does not render
   either necessary or probable any reference to what happened after the
   death of Christ. He simply says that the Psalm (lxviii.) which speaks
   of the triumph of its subject must be understood of the Messiah because
   it speaks of an ascension to heaven, which implies a previous descent
   to the earth.

   Much less can 1 Timothy iii. 16, where it said of God as manifest in
   the flesh that He was "seen of angels," be understood of Christ
   appearing in the under-world in the presence of Satan and his angels.
   The word angeloi, angels, without qualification, is never used of
   fallen angels. The Apostle refers to the evidence afforded of the
   divinity of Christ; He was justified by the Spirit, seen and recognized
   by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed upon in the world, and
   received up into glory. All classes of beings had been the witnesses of
   the fact that God was manifested in the flesh.

   Much the most difficult and important passage bearing on this question
   is 1 Peter iii. 18, 19, "Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened
   by the Spirit: by which also he went and preached to the spirits in
   prison." The English version is an exposition, as well as a translation
   of the passage. As the words stand in our Bible they afford no ground
   for the doctrine that Christ after death went into hell and preached to
   the spirits there confined. The Greek is, thanatotheis men sarki,
   zoopoietheis de pneumati, en o kai tois en phulake pneumasi poreutheis
   ekeruxen. If in this passage sarki, means the body, and pneumati, the
   soul; if the dative is to have the same force in both clauses; and if
   zoopoietheis be taken to mean preserved alive; then the natural
   interpretation undoubtedly is, Being put to death as to the body, but
   continuing alive as to the soul, in which having gone he preached to
   the spirits in prison.' However different the views entertained as to
   what spirits are here meant, whether the spirits of living men in
   spiritual bondage; or the evil spirits of the dead; or the spirits of
   the faithful of former generations, still detained in Hades; the
   passage must, in this view, be understood to teach that Christ preached
   after his death, and if so, to the spirits of the dead. This is the
   interpretation which has been extensively adopted in all ages of the
   Church. The principal argument in its favour is that when sarx and
   pneuma are placed in antithesis, if the former mean the body the latter
   must mean the soul. In the present case as Christ's death is spoken of,
   and as it was only the body that died, it is urged that sarki, must
   refer to the body. The objections, however, to this interpretation are
   very serious.

   1. When Christ is the subject the antithesis between sarx and pneuma is
   not necessarily that between the body and soul. It may be between the
   human and the divine nature. So in Romans i. 3, it is said, He was the
   son of David kata sarka, as to his human nature; but the Son of God
   kata pneuma, as to his divine nature.

   2 The word zoopoieo never means to continue in life, but always to
   impart life. Therefore to render zoopoietheis, being preserved alive,
   is contrary to the proper meaning of the word. It is more over opposed
   to the antithesis between that word and thanatotheis, as the one
   expresses the idea of the infliction of death, the other expresses that
   of vivifying. He was put to death as to his humanity, or as a man; but
   was quickened by the Spirit, or divine nature, energy or power that
   resided in his person.' He had power to lay down his life, and He had
   power to take it again.

   3. The difference between the force of the two datives is justified and
   determined by the meaning of the participles with which sarki and
   pneumati are connected. He was put to death as to the flesh; he was
   made alive by the Spirit.' The one word demands one force of the
   dative, and the other a different, but equally legitimate sense.

   4. Another objection to the interpretation above mentioned is, that it
   makes the passage teach a doctrine contrary to the analogy of faith.
   Whenever Christ is spoken of as preaching, in all cases in which the
   verb kerussein is used, it refers to making proclamation of the gospel.
   If, therefore, this passage teaches that Christ, after his death and
   before his resurrection, preached to spirits in prison, it teaches that
   He preached the gospel to them. But according to the faith of the whole
   Church, Latin, Lutheran, and Reformed, the offer of salvation through
   the gospel is confined to the present life. It is certainly a strong
   objection to an interpretation of any one passage that it makes it
   teach a doctrine nowhere else taught in the Word of God, and which is
   contrary to the teachings of that Word, as understood by the universal
   Church. For such reasons as these the authors of our standards have
   discarded the doctrine of a descensus ad inferos in any other sense
   than a departure into the invisible state. The meaning of the whole
   passage as given by Beza is in accordance with the doctrine of the
   Reformed Church. "Christus, inquit [apostolus], quem dixi virtute
   vivificatum, jam olim in diebus Noe, quum appararetur arca, profectus
   sive adveniens, e coelo videlicet, ne nunc primum putemus illum
   ecclesiæ curam et administrationem suscepisse adveniens, inquam, non
   corpore (quod nondum assumpserat), sed ea ipsa virtute, per quam postea
   resurrexit, prædicavit spiritibus illis, qui nunc in carcere meritas
   dant poenas, utpote qui recta monenti Noe . . . . parere olim
   recusarint." [468]

   The majority of modern interpreters adopt the old interpretation.
   Bretschneider [469] expresses the sense of the passage thus: "As God
   once through Noah exhorted men to repentance, and threatened to bring
   upon them the flood, as a punishment, so Jesus preached redemption, or
   announced the completion of the work of atonement, to the souls of men
   in Hades." According to others the souls to whom Christ preached were
   those who in the days of Noah had rejected the offers of mercy.
   According to the Luther and Christ after his death descended to the
   abode of evil spirits, not to preach the gospel, but to triumph over
   Satan and despoil him of his power. The "Form of Concord" [470] says on
   this subject, "Simpliciter credimus, quod tota persona (Christi), Deus
   et homo, post sepulturam, ad inferos descendent, Satanam devicerit,
   potestatem inferorum everterit, et Diabolo omnem vim et potentiam
   eripuerit. Quomodo vero Christus id effecerit, non est ut argutis et
   sublimibus imaginationibus scrutemur."

   The Romish Doctrine of the "Descensus ad Inferos."

   The Romanists teach that the department of Hades to which Christ
   descended, was not the abode of evil spirits, but that in which dwelt
   the souls of believers who died before the advent of the Redeemer, and
   that the object of his descent was neither to preach the gospel, nor to
   despoil Satan, but to deliver the pious dead from the intermediate
   state in which they then were (called the Limbus patrum), and to
   introduce them into heaven. These were the captives which, according to
   Ephesians iv. 8, He led in triumph when He ascended on high after his
   resurrection. This doctrine not only has no Scriptural foundation, but
   it rests on an unscriptural theory as to the efficacy of the truth and
   ordinances as revealed and ordained under the old dispensation.
   Believing, as the Church of Rome does, that saving grace is
   communicated only through the Christian sacraments, Romanists are
   constrained to believe that there was no real remission of sin, or
   sanctification, before the institution of the Christian Church. The
   sacraments of the Old Testament, they say simply signified grace, while
   these of the New actually convey it. This being the case, believers
   lying before the coming of Christ were not really saved, but passed
   into a state of negative existence, neither of suffering nor of
   happiness, from which it was the object of Christ's descent into Hades
   to deliver them. The above are only a few of the speculations in which
   theologians in all ages of the Church have indulged as to the nature
   and design of the descensus ad inferos in which all profess to believe.
   Whole volumes have been devoted to this subject. [471]

   The Views of Lutherans and of Modern Theologians on the Humiliation of
   Christ.

   As the Lutherans at the time of the Reformation departed from the faith
   of the Church on the person of Christ, they were led into certain
   peculiarities of doctrine on other related subjects. Insisting, as
   Luther did, on the local presence of the body and blood of Christ in
   the Eucharist, he was constrained to believe that Christ as to his
   human nature was everywhere present. This involved the assumption that,
   in virtue of the hypostatical union, the attributes of the divine, were
   communicated to his human nature, so that Christ's human soul was
   omniscient, almighty, and omnipresent. And as this communication of
   attributes took place from the very beginning, the human nature of
   Christ from the commencement of its existence, was endowed with all
   divine perfections. Yet not only in infancy, but throughout the whole
   of his earthly pilgrimage, He appeared, except on rare occasions, as an
   ordinary man, possessed as a man of no attributes which did not belong
   to other men. His miracles of knowledge and power were occasional
   manifestations of what as a man He really was, as those miracles were
   effects produced, not by his divine nature or Logos, nor by the Holy
   Spirit with which his humanity was endowed without measure, but by his
   human nature itself. His humiliation, therefore, consisted mainly and
   essentially in his voluntarily abstaining from the exercise and
   manifestation of the divine attributes with which his humanity was
   endowed and imbued. In the "Form of Concord" [472] it is said,
   "Credimus . . . . filium hominis ad dexteram omnipotentis majestatis et
   virtutis Dei realiter, hoc est, vere et reipsa secundum humanam suam
   naturam esse exaltatum, cum homo ille in Deum assumptus fuerit,
   quamprimum in utero matris a Spiritu Sancto est conceptus. . . . .
   Eamque majestatem, ratione unionis personalis semper Christus habuit:
   sed in statu suæ humilitationis sese exinanivit . . . . Quare
   majestatem illam non semper, sed quoties ipsi visum fuit, exseruit,
   donec formam servi, non autem naturam humanam post resurrectionem plene
   et prorsus deponeret, et in plenariam usurpationem manifestationem et
   declarationem divinæ majestatis collocaretur. . . . . Hanc suam
   potestatem ubique præsens exercere potest, neque quidquam illi aut
   impossibile est aut ignotum. Inde adeo, et quidem facillime, corpus
   suum verum et sanguinem suum in sacra coena præsens distribuere
   potest." "Humana natura . . . . inde . . . . quod cum divina natura
   personaliter unita est . . . . præter et supra naturales atque in ipsa
   permanentes humanas proprietates, etiam singulares . . . .
   supernaturales . . . . prærogativas majestatis, gloriæ, virtutis ac
   potentiæ super omne, quod nominatur, non solum in hoc seculo sed etiam
   in futuro, accepit." [473] "[Christus,] postquam . . . . super omnes
   coelos ascendit, et revera omnia implet, et ubique non tantum ut Deus,
   verum etiam ut homo, præsens dominatur et regnat, a mari ad mare."
   [474] "Christus . . . . etiam secundum assumptam humanam naturam omnia
   novit et potest." [475] "Eam majestatem statim in sua conceptione,
   etiam in utero matris habuit: sed ut Apostolus loquitur se ipsum
   exinanivit, eamque, ut D. Lutherus docet, in statu suæ humiliationis
   secreto habuit, neque eam semper, sed quoties ipsi visum fuit,
   usurpavit." [476]

   In the seventeenth century there was an earnest and protracted dispute
   among the Lutherans as to the question, whether the humiliation of
   Christ was a mere krupsis (or concealing) of the divine majesty of his
   human nature; or whether it was an actual kenosis, an emptying himself
   for the time being of the divine attributes which belonged to his
   humanity in virtue of the hypostatical union. According to the former
   view, Christ, as man, was from the moment of his conception, everywhere
   present, omnipotent, and omniscient, and actually in his human nature
   governed the universe. The only difference, therefore, between the
   state of humiliation and that of exaltation, concerns the mode in which
   this universal dominion was exercised. While on earth it was in a way
   not to be apparent and recognized; whereas after his ascension, it was
   open and avowed. According to the opposite view both these points were
   denied. That is, while it was admitted that the human nature was
   entitled to these divine attributes and prerogatives, from the moment
   of its conception, nevertheless it is said that they were not claimed
   or exercised while He was on earth; and therefore during his
   humiliation although there was a ktesis or possession of the
   attributes, yet there was not the chresis of them, and consequently
   during that period He was not as man omnipresent, omniscient, and
   everywhere dominant. The exaltation, therefore, was not a mere change
   in the mode of exercising his divine prerogatives, but an entering on
   their use as well as on their manifestation. The theologians of
   Tubingen maintained the former view, those of Giessen the latter. The
   question having been referred to the Saxon theologians they decided
   substantially in favour of the latter doctrine, and this was the view
   generally adopted by the Lutheran divines. The precise point of dispute
   between the parties was "An homo Christus in Deum assumtus in statu
   exinanitionis tanquam rex præsens cuncta licet latenter gubernarit?"
   This the one party affirmed and the other denied. The one made
   omnipresence and dominion the necessary consequence of the hypostatical
   union, the other, while admitting the actual potential possession of
   the divine attributes by the human nature as a consequence of its union
   with the divine, regarded their use as dependent on the divine will. It
   is conceivable that power should be dependent on the will, and
   therefore in relation to that attribute the distinction between the
   possession and use might be admitted; but no such distinction is
   possible in reference to the attribute of omnipresence. If that
   perfection belonged to the human nature of Christ (to his body and
   soul), in virtue of the hypostatical union, it must have been
   omnipresent from the moment that this union was consummated. This is
   involved in the very statement of the doctrine of the hypostatical
   union as given by the Lutheran divines. Thus Gerhard [477] says, "Neque
   enim pars parti, sed totus logos toti carni et tota caro toti logo est
   unita; ideo propter hupostaseos tautoteta kai ton phuseon perichoresin,
   logos ita præsens est carni et caro ita præsens est to logo, ut nec
   logos sit extra carnem nec caro extra logon, sed ubicunque est logos ,
   ibi etiam præsentissimam sibi habet carnem, quippe quam in personæ
   unitatem assumsit: et ubicunque est caro, ibi præsentissimum sibi habet
   ton logon, quippe in cujus hypostasin est assumta. Quemadmodum logos
   non est extra suam deitatem, cujus est hypostasis: sic etiam non est
   extra suam carnem, essentia quidem finitam, in logo tamen personaliter
   subsistentem. Ut enim to logo propria est sua deitas per æternam a
   Patre generationem: sic eidem to logo propria facta est caro per
   unionem personalem."

   According to the Lutheran system, therefore, the subject of the
   humiliation was the human nature of Christ, and consisted essentially
   in the voluntary abstaining from the exercise and manifestation of the
   divine attributes with which it was imbued and interpenetrated.
   According to the Reformed doctrine it was He who was equal with God who
   emptied Himself in assuming the fashion of a man, and this divine
   person thus clothed in our nature humbled Himself to be obedient even
   unto death. It is therefore of the eternal Son of whom all that is
   taught of the humiliation of Christ is to be predicated. This is
   clearly the doctrine of the Apostle in Philippians ii. 6-8. It is the
   person who thought it no robbery to be equal with God, of whom it is
   said, (1.) That He made Himself of no reputation (heauton ekenose).
   (2.) That this was done by his taking upon Himself the form of a
   servant, being made in the likeness of men. (3.) That being thus
   incarnate, or found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself by being
   obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. In this matter, as
   characteristically on all other points of doctrine, the Reformed Church
   adheres to the simple statements of the Scriptures, and abstains from
   the attempt to bring those doctrines within the grasp of the
   understanding.

   The modern theologians, of whom Ebrard is a representative, in
   discarding the Church doctrine of two natures (in the sense of
   substances) in Christ, and in making the incarnation consist in a
   voluntary self-limitation, are necessarily led into a theory as to the
   humiliation of Christ at variance with both the Lutheran and Reformed
   views on that subject. According to this modern doctrine the Eternal
   Son of God did not assume a human nature, in the Church sense of those
   words, but He became a man. His infinite intellect was reduced to the
   limits of the intellect of human intelligence, to be gradually
   developed as in the case of other men. His omnipotence was reduced to
   the limits of human power. His omnipresence was exchanged for
   limitation to a definite portion of space. He did not, however, as
   stated above, when treating of the doctrine of Christ's person, cease
   to be God. According to this theory the incarnation resulted, as Ebrard
   says, [478] "In Christ's being a man. (1.) So far as his will is
   concerned, in statu integritatis, i.e., as Adam was before the fall, in
   a state to choose between good and evil. (2.) So far as natural
   endowments are concerned, with all the powers pertaining to humanity,
   which lay undeveloped in the first Adam. . . . . (3.) And as concerns
   his ability dominant over the laws of nature in the present disordered
   state of nature. Thus the eternal Son of God," he says, "had reduced
   himself, so that as God he willed, having assumed the form of man, to
   exert his activity only as man. . . . . The exercise of omnipotence,
   omniscience, omnipresence had been to renounce his humanity. . . . .
   His act of self-limitation in thus reducing himself to the limitations
   of humanity, is the kenosis; his voluntary submission to pain, shame,
   and death, is the tapeinosis spoken of by the Apostle in Philippians
   ii. 6-8: but both included in the wider sense of his humiliation."

CHAPTER XIII.

  THE EXALTATION OF CHRIST.

   According to our standards the exaltation of Christ includes, (1.) His
   resurrection. (2.) His ascension. (3.) His sitting at the right hand of
   God. (4.) His coming to judge the world at the last day.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  1. Resurrection of Christ.

   The resurrection of Christ is not only asserted in the Scriptures, but
   it is also declared to be the fundamental truth of the gospel. "If
   Christ be not risen," says the Apostle, "then is our preaching vain,
   and your faith is also vain" (1 Cor. xv. 14). "If Christ be not raised,
   your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins" (verse 17). It may be
   safely asserted that the resurrection of Christ is at once the most
   important, and the best authenticated fact in the history of the world.

   (1.) It was predicted in the Old Testament. (2.) It was foretold by
   Christ Himself. (3.) It was a fact admitting of easy verification. (4.)
   Abundant, suitable, and frequently repeated evidence was afforded of
   its actual occurrence. (5.) The witnesses to the fact that Christ was
   seen alive after his death upon the cross, were numerous, competent,
   and on every account worthy of confidence. (6.) Their sincerity of
   conviction was proved by the sacrifices, even that of life, which their
   testimony entailed upon hem. (7.) Their testimony was confirmed by God
   bearing witness together with them (sunepimartorountos tou theou, Heb.
   ii. 4), in signs and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the
   Holy Ghost. (8.) That testimony of the Spirit is continued to the
   present time and granted to all the true children of God, for the
   Spirit bears witness to the truth in the heart and conscience. (9.) The
   fact of Christ's resurrection has been commemorated by a religious
   observance of the first day of the week from its occurrence to the
   present time. (10.) The effects produced by his gospel, and the change
   which it has effected in the state of the world, admit of no other
   rational solution than the truth of his death and subsequent
   resurrection. The Christian Church is his monument. All believers are
   his witnesses.

   The importance of Christ's resurrection arises, --

   1. From the circumstance that all his claims, and the success of his
   work, rest on the fact that He rose again from the dead. If He rose,
   the gospel is true. If He did not rise, it is false. If He rose, He is
   the Son of God, equal with the Father, God manifest in the flesh; the
   Salvator Hominum; the Messiah predicted by the prophets; the prophet,
   priest, and king of his people; his sacrifice has been accepted as a
   satisfaction to divine justice, and his blood as a ransom for many.

   2. On his resurrection depended the mission of the Spirit, without
   which Christ's work had been in vain.

   3. As Christ died as the head and representative of his people, his
   resurrection secures and illustrates theirs. As He lives, they shall
   live also. If He remained under the power of death, there is no source
   of spiritual life to men; for He is the vine, we are the branches; if
   the vine be dead the branches must be dead also.

   4. If Christ did not rise, the whole scheme of redemption is a failure,
   and all the predictions and anticipations of its glorious results for
   time and for eternity, for men and for angels of every rank and order,
   are proved to be chimeras. "But now is Christ risen from the dead and
   become the first-fruits of them that slept." Therefore the Bible is
   true from Genesis to Revelation. The kingdom of darkness has been
   overthrown. Satan has fallen like lightning from heaven; and the
   triumph of truth over error, of good over evil, of happiness over
   misery, is forever secured.

   Nature of Christ's Resurrection Body.

   1. The identity of the body in which Christ rose with that which
   expired upon the cross, was proved by indubitable evidence. It retained
   even the print of the nails which had pierced his hands and his feet.
   Nevertheless it was changed. To what extent, however, is not clearly
   made known. The facts recorded in the sacred history bearing on the
   nature of the Lord's body during the period between his resurrection
   and ascension are, (a.) That it was not at first clearly recognized as
   the same. Mary Magdalene mistook Him for the gardener. (John xx. 15.)
   The two disciples whom He joined on their way to Emmaus, did not
   recognize Hun until He was made known to them in the breaking of bread.
   (Luke xxiv. 31.) When He appeared to the disciples on the shore of the
   Sea of Tiberias they did not know who He was, until the miraculous
   draft of fishes taken at his command revealed Him. (John xxi. 7.) (b.)
   It appeared suddenly in the midst of his disciples in a room of which
   the doors were shut. (John xx. 19, and Luke xxiv. 36.) (c.)
   Nevertheless it was the same material body having "flesh and bones."
   That the appearance recorded in Luke xxiv. 36 was preternatural may be
   inferred from the effect which it produced upon the disciples: "They
   were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a
   spirit." Our Lord reassured them saying, "Behold my hands and my feet,
   that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh
   and bones as ye see me have." It appears from the transfiguration of
   Christ that his body while here on earth, was capable of passing from
   one state to another without losing its identity.

   2. Such was the state of our Lord's body during the forty days
   subsequent to his resurrection. It then passed into its glorified
   state. What that state is we know only so far as may be learned from
   what the Apostle teaches from the nature of the bodies with which
   believers are to be invested after the resurrection. Those bodies, we
   are told, are to be like Christ's "glorious body." (Phil. iii. 21.) A
   description of the one is therefore a description of the other. That
   description is found in the contrast between the present body and that
   which the believer is to inhabit after the resurrection. The one is a
   soma psuchikon, and the other a soma pneumatikon. The one is adapted to
   the psuche, (principle of animal life) and to the present state of
   existence; the other to the pneuma (the rational and immortal
   principle) and to the future state of existence. The change which the
   "natural body" is to undergo in becoming a "spiritual body" is thus
   described. "It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it
   is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it
   is raised in power:" in one word, "It is sown a natural body; it is
   raised a spiritual body." (1 Cor. xv. 42-44.) It is still a body and
   therefore material, retaining all the essential properties of matter.
   It is extended. It occupies space. It has a definite form, and that a
   human form. It was seen by Paul on his way to Damascus and upon other
   occasions, and by John as recorded in the Apocalypse, as well as by the
   dying martyr Stephen. Nevertheless it is no longer "flesh and blood,"
   for "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God." Flesh and
   blood are from their nature corruptible; and so the apostle adds,
   "neither doth corruption inherit incorruption." Hence "this corruptible
   must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality." (1
   Cor. xv. 50-53.) The future body will not be subject to the wants, the
   infirmities, or the passions which belong to the present state of
   existence. "In the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
   marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven." (Matt. xxii. 30.)
   The saints are to he like angels, not in being incorporeal, but as
   being immortal, and not needing reproduction for the continuance of
   their race.

   The risen body of Christ, therefore, as it now exists in heaven,
   although retaining its identity with his body while here on earth, is
   glorious, incorruptible, immortal, and spiritual. It still occupies a
   definite portion of space, and retains all the essential properties of
   a body.

   The efficient Agent in the Resurrection of Christ.

   In numerous passages of Scripture the resurrection of our Lord is
   referred to God as God or to the Father. The same person who in the
   second Psalm says, "Thou art my Son," is addressed in the sixteenth
   Psalm by that Son, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt
   thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." In Romans vi. 4, it is
   said, that Christ "was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
   Father;" so also in Acts ii. 24, "Whom God hath raised up." In Acts
   xiii. 30, it is said, "God raised him from the dead." So in Ephesians
   i. 19, 20, we are told that sinners are converted by the same mighty
   power "which wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead." In
   other passages, however, it is said to be the work of Christ himself.
   Our Lord speaking of his body said, "Destroy this temple, and in three
   days I will raise it up." (John ii. 19.) And again, John x. 17. 18, "I
   lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me,
   but I lay it down of myself; I have power to lay it down, and I have
   power to take it again." In Romans viii. 11, according to the reading
   adopted by Tischendorf, the resurrection of Christ is, constructively
   at least, referred to the Holy Spirit. This diverse reference of the
   same act to the several persons of the Trinity is in accordance with
   the common usage of the Scriptures. The three persons of the Godhead
   being the same in substance, the act of the one ad extra, is the act of
   the others. Any external divine act, i.e. any act terminating
   externally, is an act of the Godhead; and therefore may, with equal
   propriety, be referred to either of the divine persons. "What things
   soever he [the Father] doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise." (John
   v. 19.) All, therefore, that the Scriptures teach on this subject is
   that Christ was raised by the divine power. The Lutherans hold that
   Christ rose by the power of his human nature, to which divine
   attributes had, in the act of incarnation, been communicated. All the
   miracles of Christ, as before stated, according to their view of his
   person, were the works of his human nature distinctively, and so of
   course the crowning miracle of his resurrection.

   §  2. Ascension of Christ.

   The next step in the exaltation of Christ was his ascension to heaven.
   In Mark xvi. 19, it is recorded that after Jesus had spoken unto his
   disciples, "He was received up into heaven." In Luke xxiv. 50, 51, "He
   led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and
   blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted
   from them, and carried up into heaven." The most detailed account of
   our Lord's ascension is found in the first chapter of the Acts. There
   the last words of Christ to the Apostles are recorded, and it is added,
   "When he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up;
   and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked
   steadfastly toward heaven, as he went up, behold two men stood by them
   in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
   gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
   heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye nave seen him go into
   heaven." (Acts i. 9-11.) From these accounts it appears, (1.) That the
   ascension of Christ was of his whole person. It was the Theanthropos,
   the Son of God clothed in our nature, having a true body and a
   reasonable soul, who ascended. (2.) That the ascension was visible. The
   disciples witnessed the whole transaction. They saw the person of
   Christ gradually rise from the earth, and "go up" until a cloud hid Him
   from their view. (3.) It was a local transfer of his person from one
   place to another; from earth to heaven. Heaven is therefore a place. In
   what part of the universe it is located is not revealed. But according
   to the doctrine of Scripture it is a definite portion of space where
   God specially manifests his presence, and where He is surrounded by his
   angels (who not being infinite, cannot be ubiquitous), and by the
   spirits of the just made perfect. It is true that the word "heaven,"
   both in the Old and New Testaments, is used in various senses, (1)
   Sometimes for the region of the atmosphere; as when the Bible speaks of
   the clouds, or birds of heaven, or of the rain as descending from
   heaven. (2.) Sometimes for the region of the stars, which are called
   the hosts of heaven. (3.) Sometimes it means a state, and answers to
   some of the senses of the phrase, "kingdom of heaven." The believer is
   said to be delivered from the power of darkness, and translated into
   the kingdom of God's dear Son. We are therefore said even in this world
   to be "in heaven," as in Ephesians ii. 6, where it is said, God "hath
   raised us up together (with Christ), and made us sit together (en tois
   epouraniois = en to ourano, agreeably to the constant usage of that
   Epistle) in heavenly places," i.e., in heaven. In the same sense we are
   said to be, "the citizens of heaven;" that is, the polis in which we
   dwell, and to the rights and privileges of which we are entitled.
   (Phil. iii. 20.) [479] The Apostle's words are, hemon to politeuma en
   ouranois huparchei, "Heaven is the city of which we are the citizens,
   or, in which is our citizenship." (4.) But, fourthly, it means the
   place where God dwells, where the angels and the spirits of the just
   are congregated; whence Christ came, and to which He has returned. He
   told his disciples that He went to prepare a place for them. (John xiv.
   2.) In this sense the word is used when the Bible speaks of God as our
   Father "in Heaven;" or of heaven as his throne, his temple, his
   dwelling place. If Christ has a true body, it must occupy a definite
   portion of space. And where Christ is, there is the Christian's heaven.

   In opposition to this Scriptural and generally accepted view of the
   ascension of Christ, as a transfer from one place to another, from the
   earth, as one sphere of the universe, to heaven, another, and equally
   definite locality, the Lutherans made it a mere change of state, of
   which change the human nature of Christ was the subject. Prior to his
   resurrection, the human nature of our Lord, although really possessed
   of the attributes of omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence,
   voluntarily forbore the exercise and manifestation of these divine
   perfections. His ascension was his entering on their full enjoyment and
   exercise. He passed from the condition of an ordinary man to being as a
   man (as to his soul and body) everywhere present, and everywhere the
   supreme ruler. The heaven He entered is immensity. Thus the "Form of
   Concord" [480] says, "Ex hac unione et naturarum communione humana
   natura habet illam exaltationem, post resurrectionem a mortuis, super
   omnes creaturas in coelo et in terra, quæ revera nihil aliud est, quam
   quod Christus formam servi prorsus deposuit; humanam vero naturam non
   deposuit, sed in omnem æternitatem retinet, et ad plenam possessionem
   et divinæ majestatis usurpationem secundam assumptam humanam naturam
   evectus est. Eam vero majestatem statim in sua conceptione, etiam in
   utero matris habuit: sed ut Apostolus Phil. ii. 8 [7], loquitur,
   seipsum exinanivit, eamque, ut D. Lutherus docet, in statu suæ
   humiliationis secreto habuit, neque eam semper, sed quoties ipsi visum
   fuit, usurpavit. Jam vero, postquam non communi ratione, ut alius
   quispiam sanctus in coelos ascendit, sed ut Apostolus, Eph. iv. 10,
   testatur, super omnes coelos ascendit, et revera omnia implet, et
   ubique non tantum ut Deus, verum etiam ut homo, præsens dominatur et
   regnat a mari ad mare et usque ad terminos terræ." Luther argued that
   as God's right hand at which Christ in his glorified body sits, is
   everywhere, so that body must be everywhere. In the "Form of Concord"
   [481] it is said, Dextera Dei "non est certus aliquis . . . . locus,
   sed nihil aliud est, nisi omnipotens Dei virtus, quæ coelum et terram
   implet." Gerhard [482] presents the same view, "Qualis est Dei dextra,
   taliter quoque sessio ad dextram Dei intelligenda. Jam vero dextra Dei
   non est locus aliquis corporeus, circumscriptus, limitatus, definitus,
   sed est infinita Dei potestas ac præsentissima ejus majestas in coelo
   et terra, est præsentissiinum illud dominium, quo Deus omnia conservat
   et gubernat." Whence it is inferred that the soul and body of Christ
   must have a like ubiquity. The omnipresence of God, however, is not to
   he conceived of as infinite extension, for extension is a property of
   matter; so the Lutheran theologians do not hold the infinite extension
   of the body of Christ. They merely say that He is present as God is
   present everywhere in knowledge and power. But a thing cannot act where
   it is not; and therefore omnipresence of knowledge and power implies
   omnipresence as to substance. And consequently as Christ in both
   natures is everywhere active, He must in both natures be everywhere
   present. Augustine found occasion to write against this notion of the
   ubiquity of the humanity of Christ, even in his age of the Church,
   "Noli itaque dubitare, ibi nunc esse hominem Christum Jesum, unde
   venturus est. . . . Et sic venturus est, illa angelica voce testante,
   quemadmodum ire visus est in coelum, i.e., in eadem carnis forma atque
   substantia; cui profecto immortalitatem dedit, naturam non abstulit.
   Secundum hanc formam non est putandus ubique diffusus. Cavendum est
   enim ne ita divinitatem astruamus hominis ut veritatem corporis
   auferamus. Non est autem consequens ut quod in Deo est, ita sit ubique,
   ut Deus [483] . . . Nam spatia locorum tolle corporibus, nusquam erunt,
   et quia nusquam erunt, nec erunt. Tolle ipsa corpora qualitatibus
   corporum, non erit ubi sint, et ideo necesse est ut non sint [484] . .
   . Christum autem Dominum nostrum unigenitum Dei filium æqualem Patri,
   eundemque hominis filium quo major est Pater, et ubique totum præsentem
   esse non dubites tanquam Deum, et in eodem templo Dei esse tanquam
   inhabitantem Deum, et in loco aliquo coeli propter veri corporis
   modum." [485]

   The modern theory which makes the incarnation of the Son of God to
   consist in his laying aside "the existence-form" or God, and, by a
   process of self-limitation assuming that of a man, of necessity
   modifies the view taken of his exaltation and ascension. That ascension
   is admitted to be a transfer from one portion of space to another, from
   earth to heaven. It is also admitted that our Lord now as a man
   occupies a definite portion of space. He is as to his human nature in
   one place and not everywhere. But his present existence-form is still
   human and only human. On this point Ebrard says, That the only begotten
   Son of God became a human soul, and formed itself a body in the womb of
   the Virgin Mary, and was born of her as a man. In the human nature thus
   assumed there were two elements. The one including all the essentials
   of humanity without which man is no longer man. The other includes only
   what is accidental and variable; as for example, weakness, subjection
   to death, and other evils consequent on sin. All these on his ascension
   he laid aside, and now dwells in heaven as a glorified man (verklärter
   Mensch). He has laid aside forever the existence-form of God, and
   assumed that of man in perpetuity, in which form by his Spirit He
   governs the Church and the world. Locally, therefore, He is absent from
   the world, but He is dynamically present to all his people in his
   present human existence-form. On this last mentioned point he quotes
   with approbation the language of Polanus: [486] "Ideo corpus Christi
   non est jam in terra, nedum ubique. Etsi autem Christus corpore suo non
   sit jam in terra, tamen est etiam conjunctus et præsens corpori nostro
   secundum carnem, sed non loco; sicut caput uniuscujusque hominis non
   est eo loco quo pedes, et tamen est illis suo modo unitum. Proinde
   adest Christus ecclesiæ suæ non tantum secundum divinam sed etiam
   secundum humanam naturam, verum spiritualiter sicut caput membris,
   quibus unitum est et quæ vivificat." This dynamic presence of Christ as
   to his human nature and oven as to his body, which Calvin asserted in
   reference to the Lord's Supper, has no special connection with Ebrard's
   doctrine of the incarnation. It is held by those who believe that the
   Eternal Son of God became man by taking to Himself a true body and a
   reasonable soul, and so was, and continueth to be God and man in two
   distinct natures, and one person forever. The doctrine in question has
   no doubt a form of truth in it. We are present with Christ, in a
   certain sense, in reference to his human, as well as in reference to
   his divine nature. The person to whom we are present, or, who is
   present with us, is theanthropic. We have all the advantage of his
   human sympathy and affection; and the form of divine life which we
   derive from Him comes from Him as God still clothed in our nature. All
   this may be admitted without admitting that the Eternal Son "became a
   human soul;" that He laid aside the existence-form of God, and assumed
   for eternity, that of man. If this be so, then He is a man and nothing
   more. If an adult man, by a process of self-limitation, or
   self-contraction, assumes the existence-form of an infant, he is an
   infant, and ceases to be an adult man. If he assumes the existence-form
   of an idiot, he is an idiot; or of a brute, he has only the instincts
   and sagacity of a brute. If, therefore, the Logos became man by
   self-contraction, He is no longer God.

   According to the teaching of Scripture the ascension of Christ was
   necessary, --

   1. In the first place He came from heaven. Heaven was his home. It was
   the appropriate sphere of his existence. His presence makes heaven, and
   therefore until this earth is purified from all evil, and has undergone
   its great process of regeneration, so as to become a new heavens and a
   new earth, this world is not suited for the Redeemer's abode in his
   state of exaltation.

   2. It was necessary that as our High Priest He should, after offering
   Himself as a sacrifice, pass through the heavens, to appear before God
   in our behalf. An essential part, and that a permanent one, of his
   priestly office was to be exercised in heaven. He there makes constant
   intercession for his people. As He died for our sins, He rose for our
   justification. All this was typified under the old dispensation. The
   victim was slain without in the court of the temple; the high priest
   bore the blood with much incense within the veil and sprinkled it on
   the Mercy Seat. What the high priest did in the earthly temple, it was
   necessary for the High Priest of our profession to do in the temple
   made without hands, eternal in the heavens. This is set forth with all
   clearness in the Epistle to the Hebrews.

   3. It was expedient, our Lord said, that He should go away; "for if I
   go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I
   will send him unto you." (John xvi. 7.) It was necessary that
   redemption should not only be acquired but applied. Men if left to
   themselves would have remained in their sins, and Christ had died in
   vain. The great blessing which the prophets predicted as characteristic
   of the Messianic period, was the effusion of the Holy Spirit. To secure
   that blessing for the Church his ascension was necessary. He was
   exalted to give repentance and the remission of sins; to gather his
   people from all nations and during all ages until the work was
   accomplished. His throne in the heavens was the proper place whence the
   work of saving men, through the merits of his death, was to be carried
   on.

   4. Again our Lord told his sorrowing disciples, "I go to prepare a
   place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
   again and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be
   also." (John xiv. 2, 3.) His ascension, therefore, was necessary for
   the completion of his work.

   §  3. Sitting at the Right Hand of God.

   This is the next step in the exaltation of our Lord. He rose from the
   dead, ascended into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God; that
   is, was associated with Him in glory and dominion. The subject of this
   exaltation was the Theanthropos, not the Logos specially or
   distinctively; not the human nature exclusively; but the theanthropic
   person. When a man is exalted it is not the soul in distinction from
   the body; nor the body in distinction from the soul, but the whole
   person.

   The ground of Christ's exaltation is twofold: the possession of divine
   attributes by which He was entitled to divine honour and was qualified
   to exercise absolute and universal dominion; and secondly, his
   mediatorial work. Both these are united in Hebrews i. 3. It is there
   said, that Christ "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;"
   first (on, being, i.e.), because He is the brightness of the Father's
   glory and his express image, and sustains the universe by the word of
   his power; and secondly, because by the sacrifice of Himself, He made
   purification for our sins. So also in Philippians ii. 6-11, where we
   are taught that it was He who existed in the form of God and was equal
   with God, who humbled Himself to be obedient unto death even the death
   of the cross, and therefore, for those two reasons, "God also hath
   highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
   that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven,
   and things in earth, and things under the earth." In Ephesians i.
   20-22, it is said, God raised Christ from the dead "and set him at his
   own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and
   power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only
   in this world, but also in that which is to come; and hath put all
   things under his feet." This latter passage, taken from the eighth
   Psalm, is repeatedly quoted to prove the absolutely universal dominion
   of the risen Saviour, as in Hebrews ii. 8: "In that he put all in
   subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him." And
   also 1 Corinthians xv. 27, when it is said, "All things are put under
   him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under
   him." No creature therefore is excepted. This also is what our Lord
   Himself teaches. when He says, "All power is given unto me in heaven
   and in earth." (Matt. xxviii. 18.) Heaven and earth in Scriptural
   language, is the whole universe. In 1 Peter iii. 22, it is said, "Who
   is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and
   authorities and powers (i.e., all rational creatures) being made
   subject unto him." In the prophetic books of the Old Testament it was
   predicted that the Messiah should be invested with this universal
   dominion. (See Ps. ii., xlv., lxxii., cx.; Isa. ix. 67; Dan. vii. 14,
   etc.) That such authority and power could not be intrusted to a mere
   creature is plain from the nature of the case. Divine perfections,
   omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence, as well as infinite wisdom
   and goodness, are requisite for the effectual and righteous
   administration of a dominion embracing all orders of beings, all
   creatures rational and irrational, extending over the reason and
   conscience as well as over the external world. On this point the
   Scriptures are explicit. They teach expressly that to no angel, i, e.,
   to no rational creature, as the term angel includes all intelligences
   higher than man, hath God ever said, "Sit on my right hand." (Heb. i.
   13.) All angels, all rational creatures, are commanded to worship Him.

   This universal dominion is exercised by the Theanthropos. It is vain
   for us to speculate on the relation of the divine and human natures in
   the acts of this supreme ruler. We cannot understand the relation
   between the soul and the body in the voluntary exercises in which both
   are agents, as when we write or speak. We know that such acts are
   neither exclusively mental nor exclusively corporeal; but how the two
   elements are combined, passes our comprehension. It is most
   unreasonable, therefore, and presumptuous, for us to endeavour to make
   intelligible to our feeble understandings, how the divine and human in
   the person of our Lord, cooperate in full accordance with the nature of
   each. In the case of our own voluntary exercises, we know that the
   attributes of the mind are not transferred to the body; much less are
   those of the body transferred to the mind. In like manner we know that
   the attributes of Christ's divine nature are not transferred to his
   human nature, nor those of his humanity to his divinity. It is enough
   for us to know that this supreme ruler of the universe is a perfect man
   as well as a perfect God; that He still has all human sympathies and
   affections, and can be touched with a sense of our infirmities. That a
   person in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, and who is
   filled with all the love, tenderness, compassion, meekness, and
   forbearance, which Christ manifested while here on earth, has all power
   in heaven and earth committed to his hands, and is not far from any one
   of us, is an unspeakable delight to all his people.

   In this exaltation of Christ to supreme dominion was fulfilled the
   prediction of the Psalmist, as the organ of the Holy Ghost, that all
   things, the whole universe, according to the interpretation of the
   Apostle as given in Hebrews ii. 8, and 1 Corinthians xv. 27. were to be
   put under subjection to man. In the former passage the Apostle argues
   thus: The world to come of which he spoke, i.e., the gospel
   dispensation, the world during the Messianic period, was not put under
   subjection to angels, for the Scriptures say that all things are put
   under man. And when it is said all things (ta panta) are put under Him,
   nothing is excepted. We do not yet, however, see all things put under
   man as man; but we do see the man Christ Jesus, on account of the
   suffering of death, crowned with this absolutely universal dominion. It
   is, therefore, at the feet of a man in whom dwells the fulness of the
   Godhead, that all principalities and powers bow themselves in willing
   subjection and adoring love. And it is at the feet of this once
   crucified man that all the redeemed are to cast down their crowns.

   This absolute dominion has been committed to Christ as mediator. He who
   is over all is the head of the Church; it is for the Church, for the
   consummation of the work of redemption that as the God-man He has been
   thus exalted over all created beings. (Eph i. 22; Col. i. 17, 18; 1
   Cor. xv. 25-28.) Having been committed to Him for a special purpose,
   this universal dominion as Mediator will be relinquished when that
   purpose is accomplished. He will reign until all his enemies are put
   under his feet. And when the last enemy is subdued He will deliver up
   this kingdom unto the Father, and reign forever as King over the
   redeemed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   §  4. Christ's coming to judge the World.

   This is the last step in his exaltation. He who was arraigned as a
   criminal at the bar of Pilate; who was unrighteously condemned, and who
   amid cruel mockings, was crucified with malefactors, is to come again
   with power and great glory; before Him are to be gathered all nations
   and all the generations of men, to receive from his lips their final
   sentence. He will then be exalted before all intelligences, as visibly
   their sovereign judge.

   What the Scriptures teach on this subject is, (1.) That Christ is to
   come again. (2.) That this coming is to be personal, visible, and
   glorious. (3.) That the object of his second advent is to judge the
   world. (4.) That the persons to be judged are the quick and the dead,
   i.e., those then alive and those who died before his appearing. (5.)
   That the rule of judgment will be the law of God, either as written on
   the heart or as revealed in his Word. Those having the written
   revelation will be judged by it; those who have had no such external
   revelation, will be judged according to the light they have actually
   enjoyed. (6.) That the ground of judgment will be the deeds done in the
   body. (7.) That the sentence to be pronounced will be final, fixing the
   destiny of those concerned for eternity.

   This whole subject belongs to the department of Eschatology, to which
   its more detailed consideration must be deferred. It is introduced here
   simply as connected with the exaltation of Christ, of which it is to be
   the culminating point.

CHAPTER XIV.

  VOCATION.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Scriptural Usage of the Word.

   The Scriptures clearly teach that the several persons of the adorable
   Trinity sustain an economical relation to the work of man's redemption.
   To the Father is referred the plan itself, the selection of its
   objects, and the mission of the Son to carry the gracious purpose into
   effect. To the Son, the accomplishment of all that is requisite to
   render the salvation of sinful men consistent with the perfections and
   law of God, and to secure the final redemption of those given to Him by
   the Father. The special work of the Spirit is the application of the
   redemption purchased by Christ. Such is the condition of men since the
   fall, that if left to themselves they would continue in their rebellion
   and refuse the offers of reconciliation with God. Christ then had died
   in vain. To secure the accomplishment of the promise that He should
   "see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied," the Holy Spirit so
   operates on the chosen people of God, that they are brought to
   repentance and faith, and thus made heirs of eternal life, through
   Jesus Christ their Lord.

   This work of the Spirit is in the Scriptures called Vocation. It is one
   of the many excellences of the Reformed Theology that it retains, as
   far as possible, Scriptural terms for Scriptural doctrines. It is
   proper that this should be done. Words and thoughts are so intimately
   related that to change the former, is to modify, more or less
   seriously, the latter. And as the words of Scripture are the words of
   the Spirit, it is becoming and important that they should be retained.

   The act of the Spirit by which men are brought into saving union with
   Christ, is expressed by the word klesis, vocation. As in Hebrews iii.
   1, "Partakers of the heavenly calling." Ephesians i. 18, "Hope of his
   calling." Ephesians iv. 1, "Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye
   are called." Ephesians iv. 4, "In one hope of your calling." 2 Timothy
   i. 9, "Hath . . . . called us with an holy calling." 2 Peter i. 10,
   "Make your calling and election sure," etc., etc. The verb used to
   express this act of the Spirit is kalein, to call. Romans viii. 30,
   "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and, whom he called,
   them he also justified." Also Romans ix. 11 and 24. 1 Corinthians i. 9:
   "By whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son." Verse 26: "Ye
   see your calling brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh,
   not many mighty, not many noble, are called." Galatians i. 6: "Him that
   called you." Verse 15, "It pleased God, who separated me from my
   mother's womb, and called me by his grace." 1 Thessalonians ii. 12,
   "Who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory." 1 Thessalonians v.
   24, "Faithful is he that calleth you." 2 Thessalonians ii. 14,
   "Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory
   of our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Peter ii. 9, "Who hath called you out of
   darkness into his marvellous light." 1 Peter v. 10, "Who hath called us
   unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus." 2 Peter i. 3, "Through the
   knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue."

   Those who are the subjects of this saving influence of the Spirit, are
   designated "the called." Romans i. 6, "The called of Jesus Christ."
   Romans viii. 28, "To them who are the called according to his purpose."
   To one class of the hearers of the gospel, the Apostle says (1 Cor. i.
   24), Christ is a stumbling-block, and to another foolishness, "but unto
   them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God,
   and the wisdom of God." Jude addresses his epistle to the "preserved in
   Jesus Christ, and called." "The called," and "the elect," hoi kletoi
   and hoi eklektoi, are convertible terms. Revelation xvii. 14, "The Lamb
   . . . . is the Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with
   him are called, and chosen (kletoi, kai eklektoi), and faithful." So in
   1 Corinthians i. 26, 27, Paul says, "Not many wise . . . . are called:
   but God hath chosen the foolish . . . . to confound the wise." In
   Hebrews ix. 15, it is said that Christ "is the mediator of the New
   Testament, that . . . . they which are called might receive the promise
   of eternal inheritance."

   Such then is the established usage of Scripture. It is by a divine
   call, that sinners are made partakers of the benefits of redemption.
   And the influence of the Spirit by which they are translated from the
   kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son, is a vocation,
   or effectual calling. The ground of this usage is to be found in the
   Scriptural idea of God and of his relation to the world. He speaks and
   it is done. He said, Let there be light, and light was. He calls the
   things that are not, and they are. All effects of his power are
   produced by a word. As in the external world He created all things by
   the word of his power; so all effects in the moral or spiritual world
   are accomplished by a volition or a command. To call, therefore, in
   Scriptural language, is to effect, to cause to be, or to occur. There
   are two things involved in this form of expression. The one is, that
   God is the author or cause of the effect, which occurs in consequence
   of his call or command. The other is, that the efficiency to which the
   effect is due is not in second causes. God in such cases may work with
   means or without them, but in either event it is not through them. In
   creation and miracles, for example, there is neither intervention nor
   concomitancy of causes. God spoke (or willed). and the universe was.
   Our Lord said, Lazarus come forth, and Lazarus lived. He said to the
   leper, I will, be thou clean. When He put clay on the eyes of the blind
   man and bade him wash in the pool of Siloam, the restoration of sight
   was in no degree due to the properties of the clay or of the water. It
   was as truly the effect of the immediate divine efficiency, as raising
   the dead by a word. When, therefore, the Scriptures ascribe that
   subjective change in the sinner by which he becomes a new creature, to
   the call of God, it teaches that the effect is due not to natural or
   moral causes, or to the man's own agency, but simply to the power of
   God. Hence, as just said, to call is frequently in the Bible, to
   effect, to cause to be. A people or an individual becomes by the call
   of God that which the people or person is called to be. When God called
   the Hebrews to be his people, they became his people. When a man was
   called to be a prophet, he became a prophet. When Paul was called to be
   an apostle, he became an apostle. And those called to be saints become
   saints.

   § 2. The External Call.

   The Scriptures, however, distinguish between this effectual call and
   the external call addressed in the Word of God to all to whom that word
   is made known. In this sense "many are called but few are chosen." God
   said by his prophet (Isa. lxv. 12), "When I called, ye did not answer."
   And our Lord said, "I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
   repentance." (Matt. ix. 13.)

   This external call includes, (1.) A declaration of the plan of
   salvation. (2.) The promise of God to save all who accede to the terms
   of that plan. (3.) Command, exhortation, and invitation to all to
   accept of the offered mercy. (4.) An exhibition of the reasons which
   should constrain men to repent and believe, and thus escape from the
   wrath to come. All this is included in the gospel. For the gospel is a
   revelation of God's plan of saving sinners. It contains the promise,
   Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Whosoever
   cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out. In the gospel God commands
   all men everywhere to repent and to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
   In the gospel men are not only commanded but exhorted to return unto
   God in the way of his appointment. Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye
   die, is the language which it addresses to all to whom its message
   comes. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
   thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon
   him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon. Look unto me all ye
   ends of the earth and be ye saved. The gospel moreover addresses the
   reason, the conscience, the feelings, the hopes and the fears of men;
   and presents every consideration which should determine rational and
   immortal beings to comply with its gracious invitations.

   This call is universal in the sense that it is addressed to all men
   indiscriminately to whom the gospel is sent. It is confined to no age,
   nation, or class of men. It is made to the Jew and Gentile, to
   Barbarians and Scythians, bond and free; to the learned and to the
   ignorant; to the righteous and to the wicked; to the elect and to the
   non-elect. This follows from its nature. Being a proclamation of the
   terms on which God is willing to save sinners, and an exhibition of the
   duty of fallen men in relation to that plan, it of necessity binds all
   those who are in the condition which the plan contemplates. It is in
   this respect analogous to the moral aw. That law is a revelation of the
   duties binding all men in virtue of their relation to God as their
   Creator and moral Governor. It promises the divine favour to the
   obedient, and threatens wrath to the disobedient. It therefore of
   necessity applies to all who sustain the relation of rational and moral
   creatures to God. So also the gospel being a revelation of the relation
   of fallen men to God as reconciling the world unto Himself, comes to
   all belonging to the class of fallen men.

   The Scriptures, therefore, in the most explicit terms teach that the
   external call of the gospel is addressed to all men. The command of
   Christ to his Church was to preach the gospel to every creature. Not to
   irrational creatures, and not to fallen angels these two classes are
   excluded by the nature and design of the gospel. Further than this
   there is no limitation, so far as the present state of existence is
   concerned. We are commanded to make the offer of salvation through
   Jesus to every human being on the face of the earth. We have no right
   to exclude any man; and no man has any right to exclude himself. God so
   loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
   believeth in Hun might not perish but have everlasting life. The
   prediction and promise in Joel ii. 32, "Whosoever shall call on the
   name of the Lord shall be delivered," is repeatedly renewed in the New
   Testament, as in Acts ii. 21; Romans x. 13. David says (Psalm lxxxvi.
   5), "Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy
   unto all them that call upon thee." The prophet Isaiah lv. 1, gives the
   same general invitation: "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
   waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy
   wine and milk without money, and without price." Our Lord's call is
   equally unrestricted, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
   laden, and I will give you rest." (Matt. xi. 28.) And the sacred canon
   closes with the same gracious words, "The Spirit and the bride say,
   Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst,
   come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." (Rev.
   xxii. 17.) The Apostles, therefore, when they went forth in the
   execution of the commission which they had received, preached the
   gospel to every class of men, and assured every man whom they
   addressed, that if he would repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
   he should be saved. If, therefore, any one holds any view of the
   decrees of God, or of the satisfaction of Christ, or of any other
   Scriptural doctrine, which hampers him in making this general offer of
   the gospel, he may be sure that his views or his logical processes are
   wrong. The Apostles were not thus hampered, and we act under the
   commission given to them.

   It is not Inconsistent with the Doctrine of Predestination.

   This general call of the gospel is not inconsistent with the doctrine
   of predestination. For predestination concerns only the purpose of God
   to render effectual in particular cases, a call addressed to all. A
   general amnesty on certain conditions may be offered by a sovereign to
   rebellious subjects, although he knows that through pride or malice
   many will refuse to accept it; and even although, for wise reasons, he
   should determine not to constrain their assent, supposing that such
   influence over their minds were within his power. It is evident from
   the nature of the call that it has nothing to do with the secret
   purpose of God to grant his effectual grace to some and not to others.
   All the call contains is true. The plan of salvation is designed for
   men. It is adapted to the condition of all. It makes abundant provision
   for the salvation of all. The promise of acceptance on the condition of
   faith is made to all. And the motives and reasons which should
   constrain obedience are brought to bear on every mind to which the call
   is sent. According to the Augustinian scheme, the non-elect have all
   the advantages and opportunities of securing their salvation, that,
   according to any other scheme, are granted to mankind indiscriminately.
   Augustinianism teaches that a plan of salvation adapted to all men and
   adequate for the salvation of all, is freely offered to the acceptance
   of all, although in the secret purpose of God, he intended that it
   should have precisely the effect which in experience it is found to
   have. He designed in its adoption to save his own people, but
   consistently offers its benefits to all who are willing to receive
   them. More than this no anti-Augustinian can demand.

   It is Consistent with the Sincerity of God.

   It is further said to be inconsistent with the sincerity of God, to
   offer salvation to those whom He has predetermined to leave to the just
   recompense of their sins. It is enough to say in answer to this
   objection, so strenuously urged by Lutherans and Arminians, that it
   bears with equal force against the doctrine of God's foreknowledge,
   which they admit to be an essential attribute of his nature. How can He
   offer salvation to those whom He foreknows will despise and reject it;
   and when He also knows that their guilt and condemnation will thereby
   be greatly aggravated. There is no real difficulty in either case
   except what is purely subjective. It is in us, in our limited and
   partial apprehensions; and in our inability to comprehend the ways of
   God, which are past finding out. We cannot understand how God governs
   the world and accomplishes his infinitely wise designs. We must be
   satisfied with facts. Whatever actually is, it must be right for God to
   permit to be. And it is no less evident that whatever He permits to be,
   it must be right for Him to intend to permit. And this is all that the
   Augustinian scheme, in obedience to the Word of God, is constrained to
   assert. It is enough that the offer of salvation through Jesus Christ,
   is to be made to every creature; that whosoever accepts that offer
   shall be saved; and that for the salvation of all, abundant provision
   has been made. What God's purposes may be in instituting and
   promulgating this scheme of mercy, has nothing to do with our duty as
   ministers in making the proclamation, or with our obligation and
   privilege as sinners in accepting his proffered grace. If it is not
   inconsistent with the sincerity of God to command all men to love Him,
   it is not inconsistent with his sincerity to command them to repent and
   believe the gospel.

   The Lutheran Doctrine.

   The Lutherans from their anxiety to get rid of the sovereignty of God
   in the dispensation of his grace, are led to hold that the gospel offer
   is universal, not only in the sense above stated, in that the command
   is given to the Church, to make it known to all men, but that it has in
   some way been actually communicated to all. They admit the difficulty
   of reconciling this assumption with the present state of the world.
   They attempt to meet this difficulty by saying, that at three different
   epochs the knowledge of the plan of salvation was actually known to all
   men. First, when the promise of redemption through the seed of the
   woman, was made to our first parents. Secondly, in the days of Noah;
   and thirdly, during the age of the Apostles, by whom, it is assumed,
   the gospel was carried to the ends of the world, even to the
   inhabitants of this western continent. That this knowledge has since
   been lost, is to be referred not to the purpose of God, but to the
   wilful ingratitude and wickedness of the ancestors of the present
   inhabitants of the heathen world. They refer also to the fact that the
   Church is as a city set upon a hill; that it does more or less attract
   the attention of the whole earth. All men have heard of Christians and
   of Christianity; and it is their own fault if they do not seek further
   knowledge on the subject. It is very plain, however, that these
   considerations do not touch the difficulty. The heathen are without
   Christ and without God in the world. This is Paul's account of their
   condition. It is in vain, therefore, for us to attempt to show that
   they have the knowledge which the Apostle asserts they do not possess,
   and which, as all history shows, does not exist among them. The
   Lutheran divines feel the unsatisfactory nature of their own solution
   of this great problem. Gerhard, after referring to all possible sources
   of divine knowledge accessible to the heathen, says, [487] "Sed demus,
   in his et similibus exemplis specialibus non posse nos exacte causas
   divinorum consiliorum exquirere vel proponere; non tamen ad absolutum
   aliquod reprobationis decretum erit confugiendum sed adhæreamus
   firmiter pronunciatis istis universalibus. 1 Tim. ii. 4; Ezek. xxxiii.
   11." "The Symbolical Books," says Schmid, [488] "adhere to the simple
   proposition quod non tantum prædicatio poenitentiæ, verum etiam
   promissio evangelii sit universalis, hoc est ad omnes homines
   pertineat,'" [489] and that this vocatio is per verbum; without
   attempting to reconcile these statements with the facts of experience.

   The Call to Salvation is only through the Gospel.

   The call in question is made only through the Word of God, as heard or
   read. That is, the revelation of the plan of salvation is not made by
   the works or by the providence of God; nor by the moral constitution of
   our nature, nor by the intuitions or deductions of reason; nor by
   direct revelation to all men everywhere and at all times; but only in
   the written Word of God. It is not denied that God may, and in past
   ages certainly did, convey this saving knowledge by direct revelation
   without the intervention of any external means of instruction. Such was
   the fact in the case of the Apostle Paul. And such cases, for all we
   know, may even now occur. But these are miracles. This is not the
   ordinary method. For such supernatural revelations of truth after its
   being made known in the Scriptures and committed to the Church with the
   command to teach all nations, we have no promise in the Scriptures and
   no evidence from experience.

   It has ever been, and still is, the doctrine of the Church universal in
   almost all its parts, that it is only in and through the Scriptures
   that the knowledge necessary to salvation is revealed to men. The
   Rationalists, as did the Pelagians, hold that what they call "the light
   of nature," reveals enough of divine truth to secure the return of the
   soul to God, if it be properly improved. And many Arminians, as well as
   Mystics, hold that the supernatural teaching of the Spirit is granted
   in sufficient measure to every man to secure his salvation, if he
   yields himself up to its guidance. It would be very agreeable to our
   natural feelings to believe this, as it would be to believe that all
   men will be saved. But such is not the doctrine of the Bible; and it
   requires but little humility to believe that God is better as well as
   wiser than man; that his ways are higher than our ways, and his
   thoughts than our thoughts; and that whatever He ordains is best.

   That the Scriptures do teach that saving knowledge is contained only in
   the Bible, and consequently that those ignorant of its contents, are
   ignorant of the way of salvation, is plain, --

   1. Because the Scriptures both of the Old and of the New Testament,
   constantly represent the heathen as in a state of fatal ignorance. They
   are declared by the ancient prophets to be afar off from God; to be the
   worshippers of idols, to be sunk in sin. The people of Israel were
   separated from other nations for the express purpose of preserving the
   knowledge of the true religion. To them were committed the oracles of
   God. In the New Testament the same representation is given of their
   condition. It is said, They know not God. The Apostle proves at length
   in the first chapter ef his Epistle to the Romans, that they are
   universally and justly in a state of condemnation. He exhorts the
   Ephesians to call to mind their condition before they received the
   gospel. They were "without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth
   of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope,
   and without God, in the world." (Eph. ii. 12.) Such is the uniform
   teaching of the Word of God. It is utterly inconsistent with these
   representations, to assume that the heathen had such knowledge of God
   either by tradition, or by inward revelation, as was sufficient to lead
   them to holiness and God.

   2. This doctrine follows also from the nature of the gospel. It claims
   to be the only method of salvation. It takes for granted that men are
   in a state of sin and condemnation, from which they are unable to
   deliver themselves. It teaches that for the salvation of men the
   Eternal Son of God assumed our nature, obeyed and suffered in our
   stead, and having died for our sins, rose again for our justification;
   that, so far as adults are concerned, the intelligent and voluntary
   acceptance of Christ as our God and Saviour is the one indispensable
   condition of salvation; that there is no other name under heaven
   whereby men can be saved. It provides, therefore, for a Church and a
   Ministry whose great duty it is to make known to men this great
   salvation. All this takes for granted that without this knowledge, men
   must perish in their sins.

   3. This is further evident from the nature of the message which the
   ministers of the gospel are commissioned to deliver. They are commanded
   to go into all the world, and say to every creature, "Believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt he saved." "He that believeth on the
   Son, hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall
   not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him." Where is the
   propriety of such a message if men can be saved without the knowledge
   of Christ, and consequently without faith in Him.

   4. This necessity of a knowledge of the gospel is expressly asserted in
   the Scriptures. Our Lord not only declares that no man can come unto
   the Father, but by Him; that no man knoweth the Father, but the Son,
   and he to whom the Son shall revel Him; but He says expressly, "He that
   believeth not, shall be damned." (Mark xvi. 16; John iii. 18.) But
   faith without knowledge is impossible. The Apostle John says, "He that
   hath the Son, hath life; he that hath not the Son of God, hath not
   life." (1 John v. 12.) The knowledge of Christ is not only the
   condition of life, but it is life; and without that knowledge, the life
   in question cannot exist. Him to know is life eternal. Paul, therefore,
   said, "I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge
   of Christ Jesus my Lord." (Phil. iii. 8.) Christ is not only the giver,
   but the object of life. Those exercises which are the manifestations of
   spiritual life terminate on Him; without the knowledge of Him,
   therefore, there can be no such exercises; as without the knowledge of
   God there can be no religion. It is consequently, as the Apostle
   teaches, through the knowledge of Christ, that God "hath called us to
   glory and virtue." (2 Peter i. 3.) To be without Christ is to be
   without hope, and without God. (Eph. ii. 12.) The Apostle Paul, while
   asserting the general vocation of men, saying, "Whosoever shall call
   upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved;" immediately adds, "How then
   shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? and how shall
   they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they
   hear without a preacher?" (Rom. x. 14.) Invocation implies faith; faith
   implies knowledge; knowledge implies objective teaching. "Faith cometh
   by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." (Verse 17.) There is no
   faith, therefore, where the gospel is not heard; and where there is no
   faith, there is no salvation.

   This is indeed an awful doctrine. But are not the words of our Lord
   also awful, "Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to
   destruction, and many there be which go in thereat; because strait is
   the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there
   be that find it"? (Matt. vii. 13, 14.) Is not the fact awful which
   stares every man in the face, that the great majority even of those who
   hear the gospel reject its offers of mercy? Facts are as mysterious as
   doctrines. If we must submit to the one, we may as well submit to the
   other. Our Lord has taught us, in view of facts or doctrines which try
   our faith, to remember the infinite wisdom and rectitude of God, and
   say, "Even so Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight." The proper
   effect of the doctrine that the knowledge of the gospel is essential to
   the salvation of adults, instead of exciting opposition to God's word
   or providence, is to prompt us to greatly increased exertion to send
   the gospel to those who are perishing for lack of knowledge.

   Why is the Gospel addressed to all Men?

   As all men are not saved, the question arises, Why should the call he
   addressed to all? or, What is the design of God in making the call of
   the gospel universal and indiscriminate? The answer to this question
   will be determined by the views taken of other related points of
   Christian doctrine. If we adopt the Pelagian hypothesis that God limits
   Himself by the creation of free agents. that such agents must from
   their nature be exempt from absolute control; then the relation to God
   in this matter is analogous to that of one finite spirit to another. He
   can instruct, argue, and endeavour to persuade. More than this free
   agency does not admit. Men as rational, voluntary beings, must be left
   to determine for themselves, whether they will return to God in the way
   of his appointment, or continue in their rebellion. The call of the
   gospel to them is intended to bring them to repentance. This is an end
   which God sincerely desires to accomplish, and which He does all He can
   to effect. He cannot do more than the preaching of the gospel
   accomplishes, without doing violence to the freedom of voluntary
   agents.

   The Lutherans admit total depravity, and the entire inability of men
   since the fall to do anything spiritually good; but they hold that the
   Word of God has an inherent, supernatural, and divine power, which
   would infallibly secure the spiritual resurrection of the spiritually
   dead, were it not wilfully neglected, or wickedly resisted. The call of
   the gospel is, therefore, addressed to all men with the same intention
   on the part of God. He not only desires, as an event in itself well
   pleasing in his sight, that all may repent and believe, but that is the
   end which He purposes to accomplish. Its accomplishment is hindered, in
   all cases of failure, by the voluntary resistance of men. While,
   therefore, they attribute the conversion of men to the efficacious
   grace of God, and not to the coöperation or will of the subjects of
   that grace, they deny that grace is "irresistible." The fact that one
   man is converted under the call of the gospel and not another, that one
   accepts and another rejects the offered mercy, is not to be referred to
   anything in the purpose of God, or to the nature of the influence of
   which the hearers of the gospel are the subjects, but solely to the
   fact that one does, and the other does not resist that influence. The
   Lutheran doctrine is thus clearly stated by Quenstedt: "Vocatio est
   actus gratiæ applicatricis Spiritus Sancti, quo is benignissimam Dei
   erga universum genus humanum lapsum voluntatem per externam Verbi
   prædicationem, in se semper sufficientem ac efficacem, manifestat, et
   bona per Redemtoris meritum parta, omnibus in universum hominibus
   offert, ea seria intentione, ut omnes per Christum salvi fiant et
   æterna vita donentur." And again: "Forma vocationis consistit in seria
   atque ex Dei intentione semper sufficiente, semperque efficaci
   voluntatis divinæ manifestatione ac beneficiorum per Christum
   acquisitorum oblatione. . . . . Nulla enim vocatio Dei sive ex se et
   intrinseca sua qualitate, sive ex Dei intentione est inefficax, ut nec
   possit nec debeat effectum salutarem producere, sed omnis efficax est
   licet, quo minus effectum suum consequatur, ab hominibus obicem
   ponentibus, impediatur, atque ita inefficax fit vitio malæ obstinatæque
   hominum voluntatis." [490]

   The objections to this view are obvious.

   1. It proceeds on the assumption that events in time do not correspond
   to the purpose of God. This is not only inconsistent with the divine
   perfection, but contrary to the express declarations of Scripture,
   which teaches that God works all things according to the counsel of his
   own will. He foreordains whatever comes to pass.

   2. It supposes either that God has no purpose as to the futurition of
   events, or that his "serious intentions" may fill of being
   accomplished. This is obviously incompatible with the nature of an
   infinite Being.

   3. It not only assumes that the purpose of God may fail, but also that
   it may be effectually resisted; that events may occur which it is his
   purpose or intention should not occur. How then can it be said that God
   governs the world; or, that He does his pleasure in the army of heaven
   and among the inhabitants of the earth?

   4. It assumes without proof, and contrary to Scripture and experience,
   that the Word of God as read or spoken by men, has an inherent,
   supernatural, life-giving power, adequate to raise the spiritually
   dead. Whereas the Scriptures constantly teach that the efficacy of the
   truth is due to the attending influence of the Holy Spirit, ab extra
   incidens; that the Word is effectual only when attended by this
   demonstration of the Spirit, and that without it, it is foolishness to
   the Greek and an offence to the Jew; that Paul may plant, and Apollos
   water, but that God only can give the increase.

   5. It assumes that the only power which God exercises in the conversion
   of sinners is that inherent in the Word, whereas the Scriptures abound
   with prayers for the gift of the Spirit to attend the Word and render
   it effectual; and such prayers are constantly offered, and ever have
   been offered, by the people of God. They would, however, be not only
   unnecessary but improper, if God had revealed his purpose not to grant
   any such influence, but to leave men to the unattended power of the
   Word itself. Any doctrine contrary to what the Bible prescribes as a
   duty, and what all Christians do by the instinct of their renewed
   nature, must be false.

   6. This doctrine, moreover, takes for granted that the ultimate reason
   why some hearers of the gospel believe and others do not, is to be
   found in themselves; that the one class is better, more impressible, or
   less obstinate than the other. The Scriptures, however, refer this fact
   to the sovereignty of God. Our Lord says, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord
   of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise
   and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." (Matt. xi. 25.) The
   Apostle says, "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
   but of God that sheweth mercy." "I will have mercy," saith God, "on
   whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
   compassion." (Rom. ix. 15, 16.) "Of him [God] are ye in Christ Jesus,
   not of yourselves, lest any should boast." (1 Cor. i. 30.)

   7. The doctrine in question has no support from Scripture. The passages
   constantly referred to in its favour are, 1 Timothy ii. 3, 4. "God our
   Saviour, who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
   knowledge of the truth;" and Ezekiel xxxiii. 11, "As I live, saith the
   Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the
   wicked turn from his way and live." God forbid that any man should
   teach anything inconsistent with these precious declarations of the
   Word of God. They clearly teach that God is a benevolent Being; that He
   delights not in the sufferings of his creatures; that in all cases of
   suffering there is an imperative reason for its infliction, consistent
   with the highest wisdom and benevolence. God pities even the wicked
   whom He condemns, as a father pities the disobedient child whom he
   chastises. And as the father can truthfully and with a full heart say
   that he delights not in the sufferings of his child, so our Father in
   heaven can say, that He delights not in the death of the wicked. The
   difficulty as to the passage in 1 Timothy ii. 4, arises simply from the
   ambiguity of the word thelein there used. Commonly the word means to
   will, in the sense of to intend, to purpose. Such cannot be its meaning
   here, because it cannot be said that God intends or purposes that all
   men should be saved; or, that all should come to the knowledge of the
   truth. This is inconsistent with Scripture and experience. The word,
   however, often means to delight in, and even to love. In the Septuagint
   it is used as the equivalent of hphts, as in Psalms xxii. 9, cxii. 1,
   cxlvii. 10. In Matthew, xxvii. 43, ei thelei auton, is correctly
   rendered in our version, "If he will have him." (Heb. x. 5, 8; Luke xx.
   46; Mark xii. 38; Col. ii. 18.) The Apostle. therefore, says only what
   the prophet had said. God delights in the happiness of his creatures.
   He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. But this is perfectly
   consistent with his purpose not to "spare the guilty."

   8. Finally, the Lutheran doctrine relieves no difficulty. The Reformed
   doctrine assumes that some men perish for their sins; and that those
   who are thus left to perish are passed by not because they are worse
   than others, but in the sovereignty of God. The Lutheran doctrine
   concedes both those facts. Some men do perish; and they perish, at
   least in the case of the heathen, without having the means of salvation
   offered to them. There is the same exercise of sovereignty in the one
   case as in the other. The Lutheran must stand with his hand upon his
   mouth, side by side with the Reformed, and join him in saying, "Even so
   Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight."

   The simple representation of Scripture on this subject, confirmed by
   the facts of consciousness and experience is, that all men are sinners;
   they are all guilty before God; they have all forfeited every claim
   upon his justice. His relation to them is that of a father to his
   disobedient children; or, of a sovereign to wickedly rebellious
   subjects. It is not necessary that all should receive the punishment
   which they have justly incurred. In the sight of an infinitely good and
   merciful God, it is necessary that some of the rebellious race of man
   should suffer the penalty of the law which all have broken. It is God's
   prerogative to determine who shall be vessels of mercy, and who shall
   be left to the just recompense of their sins. Such are the declarations
   of Scripture; and such are the facts of the case. We can alter neither.
   Our blessedness is to trust in the Lord, and to rejoice that the
   destiny of his creatures is not in their own hands, nor in the hands
   either of fate or of chance; but in those of Him who is infinite in
   wisdom, love and power.

   But if the Lutheran doctrine that the call of the gospel is universal,
   or indiscriminate, because it is the intention of God that all should
   be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth, is contrary to
   Scripture, the question remains, Why are those called whom it is not
   the intention of God to save? Why are all called, if God has a fixed
   purpose of rendering that call effectual to some and not to others?

   1. The most obvious answer to that question is found in the nature of
   the call itself. The call of the gospel is simply the command of God to
   men to repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, with the promise
   that those who believe shall be saved. It is the revelation of a duty
   binding upon all men. There is as much reason that men should be
   commanded to believe in Christ, as that they should be commanded to
   love God. The one duty is as universally obligatory as the other. The
   command to believe no more implies the intention on the part of God to
   give faith, than the command to love implies the intention to give
   love. And as the latter command does not assume that men have of
   themselves power to love God perfectly, so neither does the command to
   believe assume the power of exercising saving faith, which the
   Scriptures declare to be the gift of God.

   2. The general call of the gospel is the means ordained by God to
   gather in his chosen people. They are mingled with other men, unknown
   except by God. The duty obligatory on all is made known to all; a
   privilege suited to all is offered indiscriminately. That some only are
   made willing to perform the duty, or to accept the privilege, in no way
   conflicts with the propriety of the universal proclamation.

   3. This general call of the gospel with the promise that whoever
   believes shall be saved, serves to show the unreasonable wickedness and
   perverseness of those who deliberately reject it. The justice of their
   condemnation is thus rendered the more obvious to themselves and to all
   other rational creatures. "This is the condemnation, that light is come
   into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their
   deeds were evil. He that believeth not is condemned already, because he
   hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." (John
   iii. 19, 18.) The most unreasonable sin which men commit is refusing to
   accept of the Son of God as their Saviour. This refusal is as
   deliberate, and as voluntary, according to the Reformed doctrine, as it
   is according to the Lutheran or even the Pelagian theory.

   § 3. Common Grace.

   The word charis, hmd, means a favourable disposition, or kind feeling;
   and especially love as exercised towards the inferior, dependent, or
   unworthy. This is represented as the crowning attribute of the divine
   nature. Its manifestation is declared to be the grand end of the whole
   scheme of redemption. The Apostle teaches that predestination,
   election, and salvation are all intended for the praise of the glory of
   the grace of God which He exercises towards us in Christ Jesus. (Eph.
   i. 3-6.) He raises men from spiritual death, "and makes them sit
   together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come
   he might show the exceeding riches of his grace." (Eph. ii. 6, 7.)
   Therefore it is often asserted that salvation is of grace. The gospel
   is a system of grace. All its blessings are gratuitously bestowed; all
   is so ordered that in every step of the progress of redemption and in
   its consummation, the grace, or undeserved love of God, is
   conspicuously displayed. Nothing is given or promised on the ground of
   merit. Everything is an undeserved favour. That salvation was provided
   at all, is a matter of grace and not of debt. That one man is saved,
   and another not, is to the subject of salvation, a matter of grace. All
   his Christian virtues, are graces, i.e., gifts. Hence it is that the
   greatest of all gifts secured by the work of Christ, that without which
   salvation had been impossible, the Holy Ghost, in the influence which
   He exerts on the minds of men, has in all ages and in all parts of the
   Church been designated as divine grace. A work of grace is the work of
   the Holy Spirit; the means of grace, are the means by which, or in
   connection with which, the influence of the Spirit is conveyed or
   exercised. By common grace, therefore, is meant that influence of the
   Spirit, which in a greater or less measure, is granted to all who hear
   the truth. By sufficient grace is meant such kind and degree of the
   Spirit's influence, as is sufficient to lead men to repentance, faith,
   and a holy life. By efficacious grace is meant such an influence of the
   Spirit as is certainly effectual in producing regeneration and
   conversion. By preventing grace is intended that operation of the
   Spirit on the mind which precedes and excites its efforts to return to
   God. By the gratia gratum faciens is meant the influence of the Spirit
   which renews or renders gracious. Cooperating grace is that influence
   of the Spirit which aids the people of God in all the exercises of the
   divine life. By habitual grace is meant the Holy Spirit as dwelling in
   believers; or, that permanent, immanent state of mind due to his
   abiding presence and power. Such is the established theological and
   Christian usage of this word. By grace, therefore, in this connection
   is meant the influence of the Spirit of God on the minds of men.

   This is an influence of the Holy Spirit distinct from, and accessary to
   the influence of the truth. There is a natural relation between truth,
   whether speculative, æsthetic, moral, or religious, and the mind of
   man. All such truth tends to produce an effect suited to its nature,
   unless counteracted by inadequate apprehension or by the inward state
   of those to whom it is presented. This is of course true of the Word of
   God. It is replete with truths of the highest order; the most elevated;
   the most important; the most pertinent to the nature and necessities of
   man; and the best adapted to convince the reason, to control the
   conscience, to affect the heart, and to govern the life. Opposed to
   this doctrine of the supernatural influence of the Spirit of God on the
   minds of men, additional to the moral influence of the truth, is the
   deistical theory of God's relation to the world. That theory assumes
   that having created all things, and endowed his creatures of every
   order, material and immaterial, rational and irrational, with the
   properties and attributes suited to their nature and destiny, he leaves
   the world to the control of these subordinate or second causes, and
   never intervenes with the exercise of his immediate agency. This same
   view is by many Rationalists, Pelagians, and Remonstrants, transferred
   to the sphere of the moral and religious relations of man. God having
   made man a rational and moral being and endowed him with free agency;
   and having revealed in his works and in his Word the truth concerning
   Himself and the relation of man to the great Creator, leaves man to
   himself. There is no influence on the part of God exerted on the minds
   of men, apart from that which is due to the truth which He has
   revealed. Those numerous passages of Scripture which attribute the
   conversion and sanctification of men to the Spirit of God, the
   advocates of this theory explain by saying: That as the Spirit is the
   author of the truth, He may be said to be the author of the effects
   which the truth produces; but they deny any intervention or agency of
   the Spirit additional to the truth objectively present to the mind. On
   this point Limborch [491] says, "Interna vocatio . . . . quæ fit per
   Spiritum Dei, . . . . non est virtus Spiritus seorsim operans a verbo,
   sed per verbum, et verbo semper inest . . . . . Non dicimus duas esse
   (verbi et Spiritus) actiones specie distinctas: sed unam eandemque
   actionem; quoniam verbum est Spiritus, hoc est, Spiritus verbo inest."
   [492] This may be understood either in a Rationalistic, or in a
   Lutheran sense. It expresses the views of those extreme Remonstrants
   who inclined most to Pelagianism. With Pelagius little more was meant
   by grace than the providential blessings which men enjoyed in a greater
   or les degree. Even free will as a natural endowment he called grace.

   Lutheran Doctrine on Common Grace.

   A second view on this subject is that of the Lutherans already referred
   to. They also deny any influence of the Spirit accessary to the power
   inherent in the Word. But they are very far from adopting the deistical
   or rationalistic hypothesis. They fully admit the supernatural power of
   Christianity and all its ordinances. They hold that the Word "habet vim
   aut potentiam activam supernaturalem ac vere divinam ad producendos
   supernaturales effectus, scilicet, mentes hominum convertendas,
   regenerandas et renovendas." [493] This divine efficacy is inherent in,
   and inseparable from the Word. The words of man have only human power,
   presenting arguments and motives to convince and to persuade. The Word
   of God has supernatural and divine power. If in any case it fail to
   produce supernatural effect, i.e., to renew and sanctify, the fault is
   in the hearer. It is like articles of the materia medica, which have
   inherent virtue, but which nevertheless require a suitable condition in
   those to whom they are administered, in order to their proper effect.
   Or, to take a much higher illustration and one of which the Lutheran
   divines are especially fond; the Word is like the person of our Lord
   Jesus Christ when here on earth. He was replete with divine virtue.
   Whoever touched even the hem of his garment, was made whole of whatever
   disease he had. Nevertheless without faith, contact with Christ was
   inefficacious. There is all the difference, therefore, according to the
   Lutheran doctrine, between the word of man and the Word of God, that
   there was between Christ and ordinary men. The effect of the Word is no
   more to be attributed to its natural power as truth on the
   understanding and conscience, than the cures effected by Christ are to
   be referred to any natural remedial agencies. The effect in both cases
   is supernatural and divine. "Verbum Dei," says Quensted, [494] "non
   agit solum persuasiones morales, proponendo nobis objectum amabile, sed
   etiam vero, reali, divino et ineffabili influxu potentiæ suæ gratiosæ,
   ita ut efficaciter et vere convertat, illuminet, salvet in illo, cum
   illo et per illud operante Spiritu Sancto; in hoc enim consistit verbi
   divini et humani differentia." So Hollaz says, [495] "Verbum Dei, qua
   tale, non potest fingi sine divina virtute aut sine Spiritu Sancto, qui
   a verbo suo inseparabilis est. Nam si a verbo Dei separetur Spiritus
   Sanctus, non esset id Dei verbum vel verbum Spiritus, sed esset verbum
   humanum." As the Spirit, so to speak, is thus immanent in the Word, he
   never operates on the mind except through and by the Word. On this
   point Luther and the Lutheran divines insisted with great earnestness.
   They were especially led to take this ground from the claims of
   fanatical Anabaptists, to direct spiritual communications independent
   of the Scriptures to which they made the written Word subordinate:
   "Pater neminem trahere vult, absque mediis, sed utitur tanquam
   ordinariis mediis et instrumentis, verbo suo et sacramentis." [496]
   "Constanter tenendum est, Deum nemini Spiritum vel gratiam suam
   largiri, nisi per verbum et cum verbo externo et præcedente, ut ita
   præmuniamus nos adversum enthusiastas, id est, spiritus, qui jactitant,
   se ante verbum et sine verbo Spiritum habere, et ideo scripturam sive
   vocale verbum judicant, flectunt et reflectunt pro libito, ut faciebat
   Monetarius, et multi adhuc hodie, qui acute discernere volunt inter
   Spiritum et literam, et neutrum norunt, nec quid statuant, sciunt."
   [497] The Lutherans, therefore, reject the distinction made by
   Calvinists between the external and internal call. They admit such a
   distinction, "sed," as Quenstedt [498] says, "ut externam vocationem
   internæ non opponamus, nec unam ab altera separemus, cum externa
   vocatio internæ medium sit ac organon et per illam Deus efficax sit in
   cordibus hominum. Si externa vocatio non ex asse congruit internæ, si
   externe vocatus esse potest qui non interne, vana fuerit, fallax,
   illusoria."

   Rationalistic View.

   A third doctrine which is opposed to the Scriptural teaching on this
   subject, is that which makes no distinction between the influence of
   the Spirit and the providential efficiency of God. Thus Wegscheider
   [499] says, "Operationes gratiæ immediatas et supernaturales jam olim
   nonnulli recte monuerunt, nec diserte promissas esse in libris sacris
   nec necessarias, quum, quæ ad animum emendandum valeant, omnia legibus
   naturæ a Deo optime efficiantur, nec denique ita conspicuas ut cognosci
   certo et intelligi possint. Accedit, quod libertatem et studium hominum
   impediunt, mysticorum somnia fovent et Deum ipsum auctorem arguunt
   peccatorum ab hominibus non emendatis commissorum. . . . . Omnis igitur
   de gratia disputatio rectius ad doctrinam de providentia Dei singulari
   et concursu refertur." To the same effect De Wette says: "It is one and
   the same efficiency, producing good in men, which according to the
   natural anthropological view we ascribe to themselves, and according to
   the religious view to God. These two modes of apprehension ought not to
   be considered as opposed to each other, but as mutually compensative."
   Again, "Religious faith regards the impulse to good (die Begeisterung
   zum Guten) as an efflux from God; philosophical reflection as the force
   of reason." [500]

   It depends of course on the view taken of God's relation to the world,
   what is the degree or kind of influence to be ascribed to Him in
   promoting the reformation or sanctification of men. According to the
   mechanical theory, adopted by Deists, Rationalists, or (as they are
   often called in distinction from Supernaturalists) Naturalists, there
   is no exercise of the power of God on the minds of men. As He leaves
   the external world to the control of the laws of nature, so He leaves
   the world of mind to the control of its own laws. But as almost all
   systems of philosophy assume a more intimate relation between the
   Creator and his creatures than this theory acknowledges, it follows
   that confounding the providential agency of God over his creatures with
   the influence of the Holy Spirit, admits of the ascription to Him of an
   agency more or less direct in the regeneration and sanctification of
   men.

   According to the common doctrine of Theism second causes have a real
   efficiency, but they are upheld and guided in their operation by the
   omnipresent and universally active efficiency of God; so that the
   effects produced are properly referred to God. He sends rain upon the
   earth; He causes the grass to grow; He fashions the eye and forms the
   ear; and He feeds the young ravens when they cry. All the operations of
   nature in the external world, which evince design, are due not to the
   working of blind physical laws, but to those laws as constantly guided
   by the mind and will of God. In like manner He is said to control the
   laws of mind: to sustain and direct the operation of moral causes. His
   relation to the world of mind is, in this point, analogous to his
   relation to the material world. And in the same sense, and for the same
   reason that He is said to give a plentiful harvest, He is said to make
   men fruitful in good feelings and in good works. Conversion, according
   to this view, is just as much a natural process as intellectual
   culture, or the growth of vegetables or animals. This is the doctrine
   of Rationalists as distinguished from Supernaturalists.

   Many philosophical systems, however, ignore all second causes. They
   assume that effects are due to the immediate agency of God. This is the
   doctrine not only of Pantheists, but also of many Christian
   philosophers. This idea is involved in the theory of occasional causes,
   and in the doctrine so popular at one time among theologians that
   preservation is a continual creation. If God creates the universe ex
   nihilo every successive moment, as even President Edwards strenuously
   asserts, then all effects and changes are the product of his
   omnipotence, and the efficiency or agency of second causes is of
   necessity excluded. According to this doctrine there can be no
   distinction between the operations of nature and those of grace. The
   same thing is obviously true in reference to the theory of Dr. Emmons
   and the high Hopkinsians. Dr. Emmons teaches that God creates all the
   volitions of men, good or bad. The soul itself is but a series of
   exercises. First in chronological order comes a series of sinful
   volitions; then, in some cases, not in all, this is followed by a
   series of holy volitions. God is equally the author of the one and of
   the other. This is true of all mental exercises. No creature can
   originate action. God is the only real agent in the universe. According
   to this doctrine all operations of the Spirit are merged in this
   universal providential efficiency of God; and all distinction between
   nature and grace, the natural and the supernatural is obliterated.

   In opposition, therefore, first, to the proper naturalistic theory,
   which excludes God entirely from his works, and denies to Him any
   controlling influence either over material or mental operations and
   effects; secondly, in opposition to the doctrines which identify the
   operations or influence of the Spirit with the power of the truth; and
   thirdly, in opposition to the theory which ignores the influence
   between the providential efficiency of God and the operations of the
   Holy Spirit; the Scriptures teach that the influence of the Spirit is
   distinct from the mere power, whether natural or supernatural, of the
   truth itself; and that it is no less to be distinguished from the
   providential efficiency (or potentia ordinata) of God which coöperates
   with all second causes.

   There is an influence of the Spirit distinct from the Truth.

   As to the first of these points, namely, that there is an influence of
   the Spirit on the minds distinct from and accessary to the power of the
   truth, which attends the truth sometimes with more, and sometimes with
   less power, according to God's good pleasure, the proof from Scripture
   is plain and abundant.

   1. The Bible makes a broad distinction between the mere hearers of the
   Word, and those inwardly taught by God. When our Lord says (John vi.
   44), "No man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw
   him;" he evidently refers to an inward drawing and teaching beyond that
   effected by the truth as objectively presented to the mind. All the
   power which the truth as truth has over the reason and conscience is
   exerted on all who hear it. This of itself is declared to be
   insufficient. An inward teaching by the Spirit is absolutely necessary
   to give the truth effect. This distinction between the outward teaching
   of the Word and the inward teaching of the Spirit is kept up throughout
   the Scriptures. The Apostle in 1 Corinthians i. 23-26, as well as
   elsewhere, says that the gospel however clearly preached, however
   earnestly enforced, even though Paul or Apollos were the teacher, is
   weakness and foolishness, without power to convince or to convert,
   unless rendered effectual by the demonstration of the Spirit. "The
   called," therefore, according to the Scriptures are not the hearers of
   the Word, but are those who receive an inward vocation by the Spirit.
   All whom God calls, He justifies, and all whom He justifies He
   glorifies. (Rom. viii. 30.)

   2. The reason is given why the truth in itself is inoperative and why
   the inward teaching of the Spirit is absolutely necessary. That reason
   is found in the natural state of man since the fall, He is spiritually
   dead. He is deaf and blind. He does not receive the things of the
   Spirit, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
   discerned. It is therefore those only who are spiritual, i.e., in whom
   the Spirit dwells, and whose discernment, feelings and whole life are
   determined by the Spirit, who receive the truths which are freely given
   unto all who hear the gospel. This is the doctrine of the Apostle as
   delivered in 1 Corinthians ii 10-15. And such is the constant
   representation of the word of God on this subject.

   3. The Scriptures therefore teach that there is an influence of the
   Spirit required to prepare the minds of men for the reception of the
   truth. The truth is compared to light, which is absolutely necessary to
   vision; but if the eye be closed or blind it must be opened or restored
   before the light can produce its proper impression. The Psalmist
   therefore prays, "Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous
   things out of thy law." (Psalm cxix. 18.) In Acts xvi. 14, it is said
   of Lydia, "Whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the
   things which were spoken of Paul."

   4. Accordingly the great promise of the Scriptures especially in
   reference to the Messianic period was the effusion of the Holy Spirit.
   "Afterward," said the prophet Joel, "I will pour out my Spirit upon all
   flesh" (ii. 28). The effects which the Spirit was to produce prove that
   something more, and something different from the power of the truth was
   intended. The truth however clearly revealed and however imbued with
   supernatural energy could not give the power to prophesy, or to dream
   dreams or to see visions. The Old Testament abounds with predictions
   and promises of this gift of the Holy Ghost, which was to attend and to
   render effectual the clearer revelation of the things of God to be made
   by the Messiah. Isaiah xxxii. 15, "Until the Spirit be poured upon us
   from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful
   field be counted for a forest." Isaiah xliv. 3, "I will pour water upon
   him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my
   Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring." Ezekiel
   xxxix. 29, "I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel."
   Zechariah xii. 10, "1 will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications; and
   they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn
   for him, as one mourneth for his only son."

   After the resurrection of our Lord He directed his disciples to remain
   at Jerusalem until they were imbued with power from on high. That is,
   until they had received the gift of the Holy Spirit. It was on the day
   of Pentecost that the Spirit descended upon the disciples, as the
   Apostle said, in fulfilment of the predictions of the Old Testament
   prophets. The effect of his influence was not only a general
   illumination of the minds of the Apostles, and the communication of
   miraculous gifts, but the conversion of five thousand persons to the
   faith at once. It is impossible to deny that these effects were due to
   the power of the Spirit as something distinct from, and accessary to,
   the mere power of the truth. This is the explanation of the events of
   the day of Pentecost given by the Apostle Peter, in Acts ii. 32, 38,
   "This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore
   being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the
   Father the prom ise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which
   ye now see and hear." This was the fulfilment of the promise which
   Christ made to his disciples that He would send them another Comforter,
   even the Spirit of truth who should abide with them forever. (John xiv.
   16.) That Spirit was to teach them; to bring all things to their
   remembrance; He was to testify of Christ; reprove the world of sin, of
   righteousness, and of judgment; and he was to give the Apostles a mouth
   and wisdom which their adversaries should not be able to gainsay or
   resist. Believers, therefore, are said to receive the Holy Ghost. They
   have an unction from the Holy One, which abides with them and teaches
   them all things. (1 John ii. 20 and 27.)

   When our Lord says (Luke xi. 13), that our Father in heaven is more
   willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him, than parents are
   to give good gifts unto their children, He certainly means something
   more by the gift of the Spirit, than the knowledge of his Word.
   Thousands hear and do not understand or believe. The Spirit is promised
   to attend the teaching of the Word and to render it effectual, and this
   is the precious gift which God promises to bestow on those who ask it.
   "Hereby we know," says the Apostle, "that he abideth in us, by the
   Spirit which he bath given us." (1 John iii. 24.) The Holy Ghost,
   therefore, is a gift. It is a gift bestowed on those who already have
   the Word, and consequently it is something distinct from the Word.

   5. Another clear proof that the Spirit exercises upon the minds of men
   an influence distinguishable from the influence of the truth either in
   the Lutheran or Remonstrant view, is that those who have the knowledge
   of the Word as read or heard, are directed to pray for the gift of the
   Spirit to render that Word effectual. Of such prayers we have many
   examples in the Sacred Scriptures. David, in Psalm li. 11, prays," Take
   not thy Holy Spirit from me." The Apostle prays in behalf of the
   Ephesians to whom for more than two years he had been preaching the
   Gospel, that God would give them the Holy Spirit, that they might have
   the knowledge of Him, that their eyes might be opened to know the hope
   of their calling, and the riches of the glory of the inheritance of the
   saints, and the exceeding greatness of the power of which they were the
   subjects. (Eph. i. 17-19.) He makes a similar prayer in behalf of the
   Colossians. (Col. i. 9-11.) On the other hand men are warned not to
   grieve or quench the Spirit lest he should depart from them. The great
   judgment which ever hangs over the impenitent hearers of the Gospel is,
   that God may withhold the Holy Spirit, leaving them to themselves and
   to the mere power inherent in the truth. Such are reprobates; men with
   whom the Spirit has ceased to strive. It is obvious, therefore, that
   the Scriptures recognize an influence of the Holy Ghost which may be
   given or withheld, and which is necessary to give the truth any power
   on the heart.

   6. The Scriptures therefore always recognize the Holy Spirit as the
   immediate author of regeneration, of repentance, of faith, and of all
   holy exercises. He dwells in believers, controlling their inward and
   outward life. He enlightens, leads, sanctifies, strengthens, and
   comforts. All these effects are attributed to his agency. He bestows
   his gifts on every one severally as he will. (1 Cor. xii. 11.) The
   Bible does not more clearly teach that the gifts of tongues, of
   healing, of miracles, and of wisdom, are the fruits of the Spirit, than
   that the saving graces of faith, love, and hope are to be referred to
   his operations. The one class of gifts is no more due to the inherent
   power of the truth than the other. The Apostle, therefore, did not
   depend for the success of his preaching upon the clearness with which
   the truth was presented, or the earnestness with which it was enforced,
   but on the attending "demonstration of the Spirit." (1 Cor. ii. 4.) He
   gave thanks to God that the Gospel came to the Thessalonians "not in
   word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost." (1 Thess. i. 5.)
   He prayed that God would fulfil in them "the work of faith with power."
   (2 Thess. i. 11.) He reminded the Philippians that it was God who
   worked in them "both to will and to do of his good pleasure." (Phil.
   ii. 13.) In Hebrews xiii. 21, he prays that God would make his people
   perfect, working in them "that which is well-pleasing in his sight."
   Indeed, every prayer recorded in the Scriptures for the conversion of
   men, for their sanctification, and for their consolation, is a
   recognition of the doctrine that God works on the mind of men by his
   Holy Spirit according to his own good pleasure. This is especially true
   of the apostolic benediction. By the "communion of the Holy Ghost,
   which that benediction invokes, is meant a participation in the
   sanctifying and saving influences of the Spirit.

   7. This truth, that the Spirit does attend the Word and ordinances of
   God by a power not inherent in the Word and sacraments themselves, but
   granted in larger or less measures, as God sees fit, is inwrought into
   the faith of the whole Christian Church. All the Liturgies of the
   Greek, Latin, and Protestant churches are filled with prayers for the
   gift of the Spirit to attend the Word and sacraments. Every Christian
   offers such prayers daily for himself and others. The whole history of
   the Church is full of the record of facts which are revelations of this
   great doctrine. Why were thousands converted on the day of Pentecost,
   when so few believed under the preaching of Christ himself? Why during
   the apostolic age did the Church make such rapid progress in all parts
   of the world? Why at the Reformation, and at many subsequent periods,
   were many born in a day? Every revival of religion is a visible
   manifestation of the power of the Holy Ghost accessary to the power of
   the truth. This, therefore, is a doctrine which no Christian should
   allow himself for a moment to call into question.

   The Influence of the Spirit may be without the Word.

   There is another unscriptural view of this subject which must at least
   be noticed, although its full consideration belongs to another
   department. Many admit that there is a supernatural power of the Spirit
   attending the Word and sacraments, but they hold that the Spirit is
   confined to these channels of communication; that He works in them and
   by them but never without them. On this subject Romanists hold that
   Christ gave the Holy Spirit to the Apostles. They transmitted the gift
   to their successors the bishops. Bishops in the laying on of hands in
   ordination communicate the grace of orders to the priests. In virtue of
   this grace the priests have supernatural power to render the sacraments
   the channels of grace to those who submit to their ministrations.
   Those, therefore, who are in the Romish Church, and those only, are,
   through the sacraments, made partakers of the Holy Spirit. All others,
   whether adults or infants, perish because they are not partakers of
   those ordinances through which alone the saving influences of the
   Spirit are communicated. This also is the doctrine held by those called
   Anglicans in the Church of England.

   The Lutheran Church rejected with great earnestness the doctrine of
   Apostolic Succession, the Grace of Orders, and the Priesthood of the
   Christian Ministry as held by the Church of Rome. Lutherans, however,
   taught not only that there is "a mystical union" between the Spirit and
   the Word, as we have already seen, so that all saving effects are
   produced by the power inherent in the Word itself, and that the Spirit
   does not operate on the hearts of men without the Word, but also that
   there is an objective supernatural power in the sacraments themselves,
   so that they are, under all ordinary circumstances, the necessary means
   of salvation.

   The Reformed, while they teach that, so far as adults are concerned,
   the knowledge of the Gospel is necessary to salvation, yet hold that
   the operations of the Holy Spirit are confined neither to the Word nor
   to the sacraments. He works when and where He sees fit, as in the times
   of the Old Testament and during the Apostolic age his extraordinary
   gifts were not conveyed through the medium of the truth, so neither now
   are the gifts for ecclesiastical office, nor is the regeneration of
   infants, effected by any such instrumentality. The saving efficacy of
   the Word and sacraments where they take effect, is not due to "any
   virtue in them; . . . . but only" to "the blessing of Christ, and the
   working of his Spirit in them that by faith receive them."

   The Work of the Spirit is distinct from Providential Efficiency.

   As grace, or the influence of the Holy Spirit, is not inherent in the
   Word or sacraments, so neither is it to be confounded with the
   providential efficiency of God. The Scriptures clearly teach, (1.) That
   God is everywhere present in the world, upholding all the creatures in
   being and activity. (2.) That He constantly coöperates with second
   causes in the production of their effects. He fashioned our bodies. He
   gives to every seed its own body. (3.) Besides this ordered efficiency
   (potentia ordinata), which works uniformly according to fixed laws, He,
   as a free, personal, extramundane Being, controls the operations of
   these fixed laws, or the efficiency of second causes, so as to
   determine their action according to his own will. He causes it to rain
   at one time and not at another. He sends fruitful seasons, or He causes
   drought. "Elias . . . . prayed earnestly that it might not rain; and it
   rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And
   he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth
   her fruit." (James. v. 17, 18.) (4.) A like control is exercised over
   mankind. The king's heart is in the. hands of the Lord, and He turns it
   as the rivers of water are turned. He makes poor and makes rich. He
   raises up one and puts down another. A man's heart deviseth his way;
   but the Lord directeth his steps. By Him kings rule and princes decree
   justice. Such, according to the Scriptures, is the providential
   government of God who works all things according to the counsel of his
   own will.

   As distinct from this providential control which extends over all
   creatures, the Scriptures tell of the sphere of the Spirit's
   operations. This does not imply that the Spirit has nothing to do in
   the creation, preservation, and government of the world. On the
   contrary the Bible teaches that whatever God does in nature, in the
   material world and in the minds of men, He does through the Spirit.
   Nevertheless the Scriptures make a broad distinction between
   providential government, and the operations of the Spirit in the moral
   government of men and in carrying forward the great plan of redemption.
   This is the distinction between nature and grace. To these special
   operations of the Spirit are attributed, --

   1. The revelation of truth. Nothing is plainer than that the great
   doctrines of the Bible were made known not in the way of the orderly
   development of the race, or of a growth in human knowledge, but by a
   supernatural intervention of God by the Spirit.

   2. The inspiration of the sacred writers, who spake as they were moved
   by the Holy Ghost.

   3. The various gifts, intellectual, moral, and physical, bestowed on
   men to qualify them for the special service of God. Some of these gifts
   were extraordinary or miraculous, as in the case of the Apostles and
   others; others were ordinary, i.e., such as do not transcend the limits
   of human power. To this class belong the skill of artisans, the courage
   and strength of heroes, the wisdom of statesmen, the ability to rule,
   etc. Thus it was said of Bezaleel, "I have filled him with the Spirit
   of God, in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all
   manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in
   silver, and in brass." (Exod. xxxi. 3, 4.) Of the seventy elders chosen
   by Moses, it is said, "I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee,
   and will put it upon them." (Num. xi. 17.) Joshua was appointed to
   succeed Moses, because in him was the Spirit. (Num. xxvii. 18.) "The
   Spirit of the Lord came upon" Othniel "and he judged Israel." (Judg.
   iii. 10.) So the Spirit of the Lord is said to have come upon Gideon,
   Jephtha, and Samson. When Saul was called to be king over Israel, the
   Spirit of the Lord came upon him; and when he was rejected for
   disobedience, the Spirit departed from him. (1 Sam. xvi. 14.) When
   Samuel anointed David, it is said, "The Spirit of the Lord came upon
   David from that day forward." (1 Sam. xvi. 13.) In like manner under
   the new dispensation, "There are diversities of gifts, but the same
   Spirit." (1 Cor. xii. 4.) And by these gifts some were made apostles,
   some prophets, some teachers, some workers of miracles. (1 Cor. xii.
   29.) Paul, therefore, exhorted the elders of Ephesus to take heed to
   the flock, over which the Holy Ghost had made them overseers. (Acts xx.
   28.)

   4. To the Spirit are also referred conviction of sin, righteousness,
   and judgment; the resistance and rebuke of evil in the heart; strivings
   and warnings; illumination of the conscience; conviction of the truth;
   powerful restraints; and temporary faith founded on moral convictions;
   as well as regeneration, sanctification, consolation, strength,
   perseverance in holiness, and final glorification both of the soul and
   of the body.

   All these effects which the Bible clearly and constantly refers to the
   Holy Spirit, Rationalism refers to second causes and to the attending
   providential efficiency of God. It admits of revelation, but only of
   such as is made in the works of God and in the constitution of our
   nature, apprehended by the mind in its normal exercises. All truth is
   discovered by the intuitive or discursive operations of reason.
   Inspiration is only the subjective state due to the influence of these
   truths on the mind. Miracles are discarded, or referred to some higher
   law. Or if admitted, they are allowed to stand by themselves, and all
   other subsequent intervention of God in controlling the minds of men is
   reduced to the regular process of human development and progress. The
   Bible and the Church universal recognize a broad distinction between
   the work of the Spirit and the operation of second causes as energized
   and controlled by the general efficiency of God. It is to one and the
   same divine agent that all the influences which control the conduct,
   form the character, and renew and sanctity the children of men, are to
   be referred; that by his energy revealed the truth to the prophets and
   apostles, rendered them infallible as teachers, and confirmed their
   divine missions by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles. The former
   class no more belong to the category of nature or natural operations,
   than the latter. God as an extramundane Spirit, a personal agent, has
   access to all other spirits. He can and He does act upon them as one
   spirit acts upon another, and also as only an Almighty Spirit can act;
   that is, producing effects which God alone can accomplish.

   The Bible therefore teaches that the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of
   truth, of holiness, and of life in all its forms, is present with every
   human mind, enforcing truth, restraining from evil, exciting to good,
   and imparting wisdom or strength, when, where, and in what measure
   seemeth to Him good. In this sphere also He divides "to every man
   severally as He will." (1 Cor. xii. 11.) This is what in theology is
   called common grace.

   The Influences of the Spirit granted to all Man.

   That there is a divine influence of the Spirit granted to all men, is
   plain both from Scripture and from experience.

   1. Even in Genesis vi. 3 (according to our version), it is said, "My
   Spirit shall not always strive with man." The Hebrew verb dvv means, to
   rule, to judge. The sense of the passage therefore may be, as given by
   Gesenius, De Wette, and others, "Nicht für immer soll mein Geist walten
   im Menschen." My Spirit shall not always rule in man. But this means
   more than the Septuagint expresses by katameine and the Vulgate by
   permanebit. The Spirit of God, as Keil and Delitzsch properly remark,
   is the principle of spiritual as well as of natural life. What God
   threatened was to withdraw his Spirit from men on account of their
   wickedness, and to give them up to destruction. This includes the idea
   expressed in the English version of the passage. The Spirit of God had
   hitherto exerted an influence in the government of men which, after the
   appointed time of delay, was to cease. Rosenmüller's explanation is,
   "Non feram, at Spiritus meus, per prophetas admonens homines, ab his in
   perpetuum contemnatur: puniam!" The clause per prophetas admonens has
   nothing in the text to suggest or justify it. It is inserted because
   Rosenmüller admitted no influence of the Spirit that was not indirect
   or mediate.

   2. The martyr Stephen (Acts vii. 51) tells the Jews, "As your fathers
   did . . . . ye do always resist the Holy Ghost," as the prophet Isaiah
   lxiii. 10, said of the men of his generation, that they vexed God's
   Holy Spirit. The Spirit, therefore, is represented as striving with the
   wicked, and with all men. They are charged with resisting, grieving,
   vexing, and quenching his operations. This is the familiar mode of
   Scriptural representation. As God is everywhere present in the material
   world, guiding its operations according to the laws of nature; so He is
   everywhere present with the minds of men, as the Spirit of truth and
   goodness, operating on them according to the laws of their free moral
   agency, inclining them to good and restraining them from evil.

   3. That the Spirit does exercise this general influence, common to all
   men, is further plain from what the Scriptures teach of the reprobate.
   There are men from whom God withdraws the restraints of his Spirit;
   whom for their sins, He gives up to themselves and to the power of
   evil. This is represented as a fearful doom. It fell, as the Apostle
   teaches, upon the heathen world for their impiety. As they "changed the
   truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more
   than the Creator . . . . God gave them up unto vile affections . . . .
   As they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them
   over to a reprobate mind" (Rom. i. 25-28.) "My people would not hearken
   to my voice: and Israel would none of me. So I gave them up unto their
   own hearts' lusts: and they walked in their own counsels." (Ps. lxxxi.
   11, 12.) As men are warned against grieving the Spirit as they are
   taught to pray that God would not take his Holy Spirit from them; as
   withdrawing the Spirit from any individual or people is represented as
   a direful judgment, the fact that the Spirit of God does operate on the
   minds of all men, to a greater or less degree, is clearly taught in
   Scripture.

   4. The Bible therefore speaks of men as partakers of the Spirit who are
   not regenerated, and who finally come short of eternal life. It not
   only speaks of men repenting, of their believing for a time, and of
   their receiving the Word with joy, but still further. of their being
   enlightened, of their tasting of the heavenly gift, and of their being
   made partakers of the Holy Ghost. (Heb. vi. 4.)

   Argument from Experience.

   What is thus taught in Scripture is confirmed by the experience of
   every man, and of the Church in the whole course of its history. God
   leaves no man without a witness. No one can recall the time when he was
   not led to serious thoughts, to anxious inquiries, to desires and
   efforts, which he could not rationally refer to the operation of
   natural causes. These effects are not due to the mere moral influence
   of the truth, or to the influence of other men over our minds, or to
   the operation of the circumstances in which we may be placed. There is
   something in the nature of these experiences, and of the way in which
   they come and go, which proves that they are due to the operation of
   the Spirit of God. As the voice of conscience has in it an authority
   which it does not derive from ourselves, so these experiences have in
   them a character which reveals the source whence they come. They are
   the effects of that still small voice, which sounds in every human ear,
   saying, This is the way; walk ye in it. This is much more obvious at
   one time than at others. There are seasons in every man's life, when he
   is almost overwhelmed with the power of these convictions. He may
   endeavour to suppress them by an effort of the will, by arguments to
   prove them to be unreasonable, and by diverting his mind by business or
   amusement, without success. God reveals Himself as distinctly in the
   workings of our inward nature as He does in the outward world. Men feel
   that they are in the hands of God; that He speaks to them, argues with
   them, expostulates, reproves, exhorts, and persuades them. And they
   know that they are resisting Him, when they are striving to stifle this
   mysterious voice within them.

   During the apostolic period the Spirit, in fulfilment of the prophecy
   of Joel, was poured out on all classes of men. The effects of his
   influence were, (1) The various spiritual gifts, whether miraculous or
   ordinary, then so abundantly enjoyed. (2.) The regeneration, holiness,
   zeal, and devotion of the multitudes added to the Church. And (3.) The
   moral conviction of the truth, the excitement of all the natural
   affections, temporary faith, repentance, and reformation. The latter
   class of effects was just as conspicuous and as undeniable as either of
   the others. And such has been the experience of the Church in all ages.
   Whenever and wherever the Spirit has been manifested to a degree in any
   measure analogous to the revelation of his presence and power on the
   day of Pentecost, while many have been truly born of God, more have
   usually been the subjects of influences which did not issue in genuine
   conversion.

   The evidence therefore from Scripture, and from experience, is clear
   that the Holy Spirit is present with every human mind, and enforces,
   with more or less power, whatever of moral or religious truth the mind
   may have before it.

   The Effects of common Grace.

   The effects produced by common grace, or this influence of the Spirit
   common to all men, are most important to the individual and to the
   world. What the external world would be if left to the blind operation
   of physical causes, without the restraining and guiding influence of
   God's providential efficiency, that would the world of mind be, in all
   its moral and religious manifestations, without the restraints and
   guidance of the Holy Spirit. There are two ways in which we may learn
   what the effect would be of the withholding the Spirit from the minds
   of men. The first is, the consideration of the effects of reprobation,
   as taught in Scripture and by experience, in the case of individual
   men. Such men have a seared conscience. They are reckless and
   indifferent, and entirely under the control of the evil passions of
   their nature. This state is consistent with external decorum and
   polish. Men may be as whitened sepulchres. But this is a restraint
   which the wise regard to their greatest selfish gratification places on
   the evil principles which control them. The effects of reprobation are
   depicted in a fearful manner by the Apostle in the first chapter of his
   Epistle to the Romans. Not only individuals, but peoples and churches
   may be thus abandoned by the Spirit of God, and then unbroken spiritual
   death is the inevitable consequence. But, in the second place, the
   Scriptures reveal the effect of the entire withdrawal of the Holy
   Spirit from the control of rational creatures, in the account which
   they give of the state of the lost, both men and angels. Heaven is a
   place and state in which the Spirit reigns with absolute control. Hell
   is a place and state in which the Spirit no longer restrains and
   controls. The presence or absence of the Spirit makes all the
   difference between heaven and hell. To the general influence of the
   Spirit (or to common grace), we owe, --

   1. All the decorum, order, refinement, and virtue existing among men.
   Mere fear of future punishment, the natural sense of right, and the
   restraints of human laws, would prove feeble barriers to evil, were it
   not for the repressing power of the Spirit, which, like the pressure of
   the atmosphere, is universal and powerful, although unfelt.

   2. To the same divine agent is due specially that general fear of God,
   and that religious feeling which prevail among men, and which secure
   for the rites and services of religion in all its forms, the decorous
   or more serious attention which they receive.

   3. The Scriptures refer to this general influence of the Spirit those
   religious experiences, varied in character and degree, which so often
   occur where genuine conversion, or regeneration does not attend or
   follow. To this reference has already been made in a general way as a
   proof of the doctrine of common grace. The great diversity of these
   religious experiences is due no doubt partly to the different degrees
   of religious knowledge which men possess; partly to their diversity of
   culture and character; and partly to the measure of divine influence of
   which they are the subjects. In all cases, however, there is in the
   first place a conviction of the truth. All the great doctrines of
   religion have a self-evidencing light; an evidence of their truth to
   which nothing but the blindness and hardness of heart produced by sin,
   can render the mind insensible. Men may argue themselves into a
   theoretical disbelief of the being of God, of the obligation of the
   moral law, and of a future state of retribution. But as these truths
   address themselves to our moral constitution, which we cannot change,
   no amount of sophistry can obscure their convincing light, if our
   amoral nature be aroused. The same is true also of the Bible. It is the
   Word of God. It contains internal evidence of being his Word. All that
   is necessary to produce an irresistible conviction of its truth is that
   the veil which sin and the God of this world have spread over the mind,
   should be removed. This is done, at least sufficiently to admit light
   enough to produce conviction, whenever the moral elements of our nature
   assume their legitimate power. Hence it is a matter of common
   observation that a man passes suddenly from a state of scepticism to
   one of firm belief, without any arguments being addressed to his
   understanding, but simply by a change in his inward moral state. When,
   as the Bible expresses it, "the eyes of the heart" are thus opened, he
   can no more doubt the truths perceived, than he can doubt the evidence
   of his senses.

   In the second place, with this conviction of the truths of religion is
   connected an experience of their power. They produce to a greater or
   less degree an effect upon the feelings appropriate to their nature; a
   conviction of sin, the clear perception that what the Bible and the
   conscience teach of our guilt and pollution, produces
   self-condemnation, remorse, and self-abhorrence. These are natural, as
   distinguished from gracious affections. They are experienced often by
   the unrenewed and the wicked. A sense of God's justice necessarily
   produces a fearful looking for of judgment. Those who sin, the Apostle
   says, know the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things
   are worthy of death. (Rom. i. 32.) The attending conviction of entire
   helplessness; of the soul's utter inability either to make expiation
   for its guilt, or to destroy the inward power of sin, and wash away its
   defilement, tends to produce absolute despair. No human suffering is
   more intolerable than that which is often experienced even in this life
   from these sources. "Heu me miserum et nimis miserum! nimis enim
   miserum, quem torquet conscientia sua quam fugere non potest! nimis
   enim miserum quem exspectat damnatio sua, quam vitare non potest! Nimis
   est infelix, qui sibi ipsi est horribilis; nimis infelicior, cui mors
   æeterna erit sensibilis. Nimis ærumnosus, quem terrent continui de sua
   infelicitate horrores." [501]

   It is also natural and according to experience, that the promise of the
   Gospel, and the exhibition of the plan of salvation, contained in the
   Scriptures, which commend themselves to the enlightened conscience,
   should often appear not only as true but as suited to the condition of
   the awakened sinner. Hence he receives the Word with joy. He believes
   with a faith founded on this moral evidence of the truth. This faith
   continues as long as the state of mind by which it is produced
   continues. When that changes, and the sinner relapses into his wonted
   state of insensibility, his faith disappears. To this class of persons
   our Saviour refers when He speaks of those who receive the Word in
   stony places or among thorns. Of such examples of temporary faith there
   are numerous instances given in the Scriptures, and they are constantly
   occurring within our daily observation.

   In the third place, the state of mind induced by these common
   operations of the Spirit, often leads to reformation, and to an
   externally religious life. The sense of the truth and importance of the
   doctrines of the Bible constrains men often to great strictness of
   conduct and to assiduous attention to religious duties.

   The experiences detailed above are included in the "law work" of which
   the older theologians were accustomed to speak as generally preceding
   regeneration and the exercise of saving faith in Christ. They often
   occur before genuine conversion, and perhaps more frequently attend it;
   but nevertheless they are in many cases neither accompanied nor
   followed by a real change of heart. They may be often renewed, and yet
   those who are their subjects return to their normal state of unconcern
   and worldliness.

   No strictness of inward scrutiny, no microscopic examination or
   delicacy of analysis, can enable an observer, and rarely the man
   himself, to distinguish these religious exercises from those of the
   truly regenerated. The words by which they are described both in the
   Scriptures and in ordinary Christian discourse, are the same. Unrenewed
   men in the Bible are said to repent, to believe, to be partakers of the
   Holy Ghost, and to taste the good Word of God, and the powers of the
   world to come. Human language is not adequate to express all the soul's
   experiences. The same word must always represent in one case, or in one
   man's experience, what it does not in the experience of another. That
   there is a specific difference between the exercises due to common
   grace, and those experienced by the true children of God, is certain.
   But that difference does not reveal itself to the consciousness, or at
   least, certainly not to the eye of an observer. "By their fruits ye
   shall know them." This is the test given by our Lord. It is only when
   these experiences issue in a holy life, that their distinctive
   character is known.

   As to the nature of the Spirit's work, which He exercises, in a greater
   or less degree, on the minds of all men, the words of our Lord admonish
   us to speak with caution. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
   hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and
   whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit." (John
   iii. 8.) This teaches that the mode of the Spirit's operation whether
   in regeneration or in conviction, is inscrutable. If we cannot
   understand how our souls act on our bodies, or how evil spirits act on
   our minds, the one being a familiar fact of consciousness, and the
   other a clear fact of revelation, it cannot be considered strange that
   we should not understand how the Holy Spirit acts on the minds of men.
   There are certain statements of the Bible, however, which throw some
   light on this subject. In the first place, the Scriptures speak of
   God's reasoning with men; of his teaching them and that inwardly by his
   Spirit; of his guiding or leading them; and of his convincing,
   reproving, and persuading them. These modes of representation would
   seem to indicate "a moral suasion;" an operation in accordance with the
   ordinary laws of mind, consisting in the presentation of truth and
   urging of motives. In the second place, so far as appears, this common
   influence of the Spirit is never exercised except through the truth. In
   the third place, the moral and religious effects ascribed to it never
   rise above, so to speak, the natural operations of the mind. The
   knowledge, the faith, the conviction, the remorse, the sorrow, and the
   joy, which the Spirit is said to produce by these common operations,
   are all natural affections or exercises; such as one man may measurably
   awaken in the minds of other men. In the fourth place, these common
   influences of the Spirit are all capable of being effectually resisted.
   In all these respects this common grace is distinguished from the
   efficacious operation of the Spirit to which the Scriptures ascribe the
   regeneration of the soul. The great truth, however, that concerns us is
   that the Spirit of God is present with every human mind, restraining
   from evil and exciting to good; and that to his presence and influence
   we are indebted for all the order, decorum, and virtue, as well as the
   regard for religion and its ordinances, which exist in the world. And
   consequently that the greatest calamity that can befall an individual,
   a church, or a people, is that God should take his Holy Spirit from
   them. And as this is a judgment which, according to the Scriptures,
   does often come upon individuals, churches, and people, we should above
   all things dread lest we should grieve the Spirit or quench his
   influences. This is done by resistance, by indulgence in sin, and
   especially, by denying his agency and speaking evil of his work.
   "Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven
   him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
   forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come."
   (Matt. xii. 32.)

   § 4. Efficacious Grace.

   Besides those operations of the Spirit, which in a greater or less
   degree are common to all men, the Scriptures teach that the covenant of
   redemption secures the Spirit's certainly efficacious influence for all
   those who have been given to the Son as his inheritance.

   Why called Efficacious.

   This grace is called efficacious not simply ab eventu. According to one
   view the same influence at one time, or exerted on one person, produces
   a saving effect; and at other times, or upon other persons, fails of
   such effect. In the one case it is called efficacious, and in the other
   not. This is not what Augustinians mean by the term. By the
   Semi-Pelagians, the Romanists, and the Arminians, that influence of the
   Spirit which is exerted on the minds of all men is called "sufficient
   grace." By the two former it is held to be sufficient to enable the
   sinner to do that which will either merit or secure larger degrees of
   grace which, if duly improved, will issue in salvation. The Arminians
   admit that the fall of our race has rendered all men utterly unable, of
   themselves, to do anything truly acceptable in the sight of God. But
   they hold that this inability, arising out of the present state of
   human nature, is removed by the influence of the Spirit given to all.
   This is called "gracious ability"; that is, an ability due to the
   grace, or the supernatural influence of the Spirit granted to all men.
   On both these points the language of the Remonstrant Declaration or
   Confession is explicit. It is there said, "Man has not saving faith
   from himself, neither is he regenerated or converted by the force of
   his own free will; since, in the state of sin, he is not able of and by
   himself to think, will, or do any good thing, any good thing that is
   saving in its nature, particularly conversion and saving faith. But it
   is necessary that he be regenerated, and wholly renewed by God in
   Christ, through the truth of the gospel and the added energy of the
   Holy Spirit, -- in intellect, affections, will, and all his faculties,
   -- so that he may be able rightly to perceive, meditate upon, will, and
   accomplish that which is a saving good." [502] On the point of
   sufficient grace the Declaration says: "Although there is the greatest
   diversity in the degrees in which grace is bestowed in accordance with
   the divine will, yet the Holy Ghost confers, or at least is ready to
   confer, upon all and each to whom the word of faith is ordinarily
   preached, as much grace as is sufficient for generating faith and
   carrying forward their conversion in its successive stages. Thus
   sufficient grace for faith and conversion is allotted not only to those
   who actually believe and are converted, but also to those who do not
   actually believe and are not in fact converted." [503] In the Apology
   for the Remonstrance, it is said, "The Remonstrants asserted that the
   servitude to sin, to which men (per naturæ conditionem) in their
   natural state, are subject, has no place in a state of grace. For they
   hold that God gives sufficient grace to all who are called, so that
   they can be freed from that servitude, and at the same time they have
   liberty of will to remain in it if they choose." [504] In the Apology
   it is expressly stated, "Gratia efficax vocatur . . . . ab eventu,"
   which is said to mean, "Ut statuatur gratia habere ex se sufficientem
   vim, ad producendum consensum in voluntate, sed, quia vis illa
   partialis est, non posse exire in actum sine coöperante liberæ
   voluntatis humanæ, ac proinde, ut effectum habeat, pendere a libera
   voluntate." [505] Limborch [506] teaches the same doctrine. "Sufficiens
   vocatio, quando per coöperationem liberi arbitrii sortitur suum
   effectum, vocatur efficax."

   Augustinians of course admit that common grace is in one sense
   sufficient. It is sufficient to render men inexcusable for their
   impenitence and unbelief. This Paul says even of the light of nature.
   The heathen are without excuse for their idolatry, because the eternal
   power and Godhead of the divine Being are revealed to them in his
   works. Knowing God, they glorified Him not as God. (Rom. i. 20, 21.) So
   common grace is sufficient to convince men, (1.) Of sin and of their
   need of redemption. (2.) Of the truth of the gospel. (3.) Of their duty
   to accept its offers and to live in obedience to its commands; and (4.)
   That their impenitence and unbelief are due to themselves, to their own
   evil hearts; that they voluntarily prefer the world to the service of
   Christ. These effects the grace common to all who hear the gospel tends
   to produce. These effects it does in fact produce in a multitude of
   cases, and would produce in all were it not resisted and quenched. But
   it is not sufficient to raise the spiritually dead; to change the
   heart, and to produce regeneration; and it is not made to produce these
   effects by the coöperation of the human will. This is a point which
   need not be discussed separately. The Remonstrant and Romish doctrine
   is true, if the other parts of their doctrinal system are true; and it
   is false if that system be erroneous. If the Augustinian doctrine
   concerning the natural state of man since the fall, and the sovereignty
   of God in election, be Scriptural, then it is certain that sufficient
   grace does not become efficacious from the coöperation of the human
   will. Those who hold the last mentioned doctrine reject both the
   others; and those who hold the two former of necessity reject the last.
   It is not, however, only in virtue of its logical relation to other
   established doctrines that the doctrine of sufficient grace is
   rejected. It may be proved to be contrary to what the Scriptures teach
   on regeneration and the mode in which it is effected. These arguments,
   however, may be more properly presented when we come to the answer to
   the question, Why the grace of God is efficacious in the work of
   conversion?

   Congruity.

   Another erroneous view on this subject is that the influence of the
   Spirit in conversion owes its efficacy to its congruity. By this is
   sometimes meant its adaptation to the state of mind of him who is its
   subject. When a man is in one state, the same influence, both as to
   kind and degree, may fail to produce any serious impression; when in a
   different and more favourable frame of mind, it may issue in his true
   conversion. In this view the doctrine of congruity does not differ from
   the view already considered. It supposes that the subject of the
   Spirit's influence, in one state of mind resists, and in another,
   submits to, and coöperates with it and that its efficacy is in the end
   due to this coöperation.

   Sometimes, however, more is meant than that the grace is congruous to
   the state of mind of its subject. Cardinal Bellarmin objects to the
   view above stated that it assumes that the reason why one man believes
   and another disbelieves, is to be found in the free will of the
   subject. This, he says, is directly contrary to what the Apostle says
   in 1 Corinthians iv. 7, "Who maketh thee to differ? And what hast thou
   that thou didst not receive?" "Nam," he adds, "si duo sint, qui eandem
   concionatorem audiant, et eandem interius inspirationem habeant, et
   unus credat, alter non credat, nonne dicere poterit is qui crediderit,
   se discerni ab infideli, per liberum arbitrium quia ipse inspirationem
   acceperit, quam alter rejecit? nonne gloriari poterit contra infidelem,
   quod ipse Dei gratiæ coöperatus sit, quam ille contempsit? et tamen
   Apostolus hoc omnino prohibet?" [507] Here the main principle which
   distinguishes Augustinianism from all other schemes of doctrine is
   conceded. Why does one man repent and believe the Gospel, while another
   remains impenitent? The Augustinian says it is because God makes them
   to differ. He gives to one what He does not give to another. All
   Anti-Augustinians say that the reason is, that the one coöperates with
   the grace of God, and the other does not; or, the one yields, and the
   other does not; or, that the one resists, and the other does not.
   Bellarmin here sides with Augustine and Paul. His own theory, however,
   is a virtual retraction of the above mentioned concession. He says that
   the different results in the cases supposed, are to be referred to the
   congruity between the influence exerted and the state of mind of the
   person on whom that influence is exerted. But this congruity is
   foreseen and designed. God knows just what kind and degree of influence
   will be effectual in determining the will of a given person, under
   given circumstances, and in a given state of mind. And this influence
   he determines to exert with the purpose of securing the sinner's
   conversion, and with the certain foreknowledge of success. Bellarmin
   [508] says, "Ut efficacia proveniat non tam ex vehementia persuasionis,
   quam ex dispositione voluntatis, quam Deus prævidet. Nimirum cum Deus
   ita proponit aliquid interna persuasione, ut videt voluntatem aptam
   esse ad consentiendum." And again, "Infallibilitas [rei] non oriatur ex
   vehementia motionis divinæ, sed ex prævisione aptitudinis ipsius
   voluntatis." [509] In one view this seems to refer the cause of the
   difference between the believer and the unbeliever, to the purpose of
   God; as it is He who foresees and intends the issue and adapts the
   means for the attainment of the end. But really the cause of the
   difference is in the man himself. One man is susceptible and yielding;
   another is hard and obstinate. Besides, this view as well as the
   preceding, regards the influence by which regeneration is effected, as
   a mere suasion, which is contrary to the representations of Scripture.
   It ignores the Scriptural doctrine of the natural state of man since
   the fall as one of spiritual death; and it professedly repudiates that
   of the divine sovereignty. It cannot, therefore, be reconciled with the
   Scriptures, if those doctrines are taught, as all Augustinians believe,
   in the Word of God. The Jesuits adopted much the same view as that
   presented by Bellarmin. Molina, in his celebrated work, "Liberi
   arbitrii cum gratiæ donis, divina præscientia, providentia,
   prædestinatione et reprobatione concordia," says, "Una et eadem est
   natura gratiæ sufficientis et efficacis; a nostro arbitrio et libero
   consensu pendet, ut efficax fiat nobis consentientibus, aut inefficax,
   nobis dissentientibus. Dens infallibiliter operatur ope scientiæ mediæ:
   vidit per scientiam rerum sub conditione futurarum, quem hæc aut illa
   gratia effectum habitura sit in homine, si detur; ponit decretum talem
   largiendi, cum qua prævidet consensuram voluntatem; talis gratia est
   efficax, -- itaque præscientia non fallitur." [510]

   Neither the Symbols of the Romish Church, nor the majority of its
   theologians adopt this doctrine of Bellarmin. They make the difference
   between sufficient and efficacious grace to be determined simply by the
   event. One man coöperates with the grace he receives, and it becomes
   efficacious; another does not coöperate, and it remains without saving
   effect. On this point the Council of Trent [511] decided, "Si quis
   dixerit, liberum hominis arbitrium a Deo motum, et excitatum nihil
   cooperari assentiendo Deo excitanti atque vocanti, quo ad obtinendam
   justificationis gratiam se disponat, ac præparet, neque posse
   dissentire, si velit, sed velut inanime quoddam nihil omnino agere,
   mereque passive se habere, anathema sit." "According to Catholic
   principles," says Möhler, [512] "two agencies are combined in the holy
   work of regeneration, a human and divine, which interpenetrate each
   other, when the work is effected; so that it is a divine-human work.
   God's holy power goes before, exciting, awakening, and quickening,
   without the man's meriting, procuring, or determining this influence,
   but he must yield to, and freely follow it." This he confirms by citing
   the language of the Council of Trent. [513] "Ut, qui per peccata a Deo
   aversi erant, per ejus excitantem atque adjuvantem gratiam ad
   convertendum se ad suam ipsorum justificationem eidem gratia libere
   assentiendo, et cooperando, disponantur: ita ut tangente Deo cor
   hominis per Spiritus Sancti illuminationem, neque homo ipse nihil
   omnino agat, inspirationem illam recipiens, quippe qui illam et
   abjicere potest, neque tamen sine gratia Dei movere se ad justitiam
   coram illo libera sua voluntate possit."

   Augustinian Doctrine of Efficacious Grace.

   According to the Augustinian doctrine the efficacy of divine grace in
   regeneration depends neither upon its congruity nor upon the active
   coöperation, nor upon the passive non-resistance of its subject, but
   upon its nature and the purpose of God. It is the exercise of "the
   mighty power of God," who speaks and it is done. This is admitted to be
   the doctrine of Augustine himself. He says, "Non lege atque doctrina
   insonante forinsecus, sed interna et occulta, mirabili ac ineffabili
   potestate operari Deum in cordibus hominum non solum veras
   revelationes, sed bonas etiam voluntates." [514] "Nolentem prævenit, ut
   velit; volentem subsequitur, ne frustra velit." [515]

   The Jansenists, the faithful disciples of Augustine, endeavoured to
   revive his doctrine in the Roman Church. Among the propositions
   selected from their writings and condemned by Pope Clement XI. in the
   famous Bull, Unigenitus, are the following: "Num. ix., Gratia Christi
   est gratia suprema, sine qua Christum confiiteri nunquam possumus, et
   cum qua nunquam illum abnegamus. 1 Cor. xii. 3. Num. x., Gratia est
   manus omnipotentis Dei, jubentis et facientis quod jubet. Mar. ii. 11.
   Num. xix., Dei gratia nihil aliud est quam ejus omnipotens voluntas:
   hæc est idea, quam Deus ipse nobis tradit in omnibus suis Scripturis.
   Rom. xiv. 4. Num. xxi., Gratia Jesu Christi est gratia fortis, potens,
   suprema, invincibilis, utpote quæ est operatio voluntatis omnipotentis,
   sequela et imitatio operationis Dei incarnantis et resuscitantis filium
   suum. 2 Cor. v. 21. Num. xxiv., Justa idea, quam centurio habet de
   omnipotentia Dei et Jesu Christi in sanandis corporibus solo motu suæ
   voluntatis, est imago ideæ, quæ haberi debet de omnipotentia suæ gratiæ
   in sanandis animabus a cupiditate. Luc. vii. 7" [516]

   It is not a matter of doubt or dispute that the Reformed Church adopted
   the Augustinian doctrine on this subject. In the "Second Helvetic
   Confession," it is said, "Quantum ad bonum et ad virtutes, intellectus
   hominis, non recte judicat de divinis ex semetipso. . . . . Constat
   vero mentem vel intellectum, ducem esse voluntatis, cum autem coecus
   sit dux, claret, quousque et voluntas pertingat. Proinde nullum est ad
   bonum homini arbitrium liberum nondum renato, vires nullæ ad
   perficiendum bonum. . . . . In regeneratione . . . . voluntas non
   tantum mutatur per Spiritum, sed etiam instruitur facultatibus, ut
   sponte velit et possit bonum. . . . . Observandum est -- regeneratos in
   boni electione et operatione, non tantum agere passive, sed active.
   Aguntur enim a Deo, ut agant ipsi, quod agunt." [517]

   The Synod of Dort, [518] "Omnes homines in peccato concipiuntur . . . .
   inepti ad omne bonum salutare . . . . et absque Spiritus Sancti
   regenerantis gratia, ad Deum redire, naturam depravatam corrigere, vel
   ad ejus correctionem se disponere nec volunt, nec possunt." "Fides Dei
   donum est, non eo, quod a Deo hominis arbitrio offeratur, sed quod
   homini reipsa conferatur, inspiretur, et infundatur." [519] Quando Deus
   . . . . veram in electis conversionem operatur, non tantum evangelium
   illis externe prædicari curat et mentem eorum per Spiritum Sanctum
   potenter illuminat, . . . . sed ejusdem etiam Spiritus regenerantis
   efficacia ad intima hominis penetrat, cor clausum aperit, durum
   emollit, . . . . voluntati novas qualitates infundit, facitque eam ex
   mortua vivam, ex mala bonam, ex nolente volentem." [520]

   The following proposition contains one of the positions assume by
   Remonstrants on which the Synod was called to decide. "Operatio gratiæ
   in prima conversione indifferens est et resistibilis, ut per eam possit
   homo converti vel non converti: nec sequatur ejus conversio nisi libero
   assensu ad eam se determinet, et converti velit." On this proposition
   the Theologians of the Palatinate in their "Judicium," after referring
   to the Remonstrant idea that regeneration is effected by moral suasion,
   say, "Scriptura vero, etsi moralem (quam vocant) suasionem non removet
   ab hoc negotio (quid enim est totum ministerium reconciliationis, quam
   ejusmodi commendatio ac suasio? 2 Cor. v. 18-20), præcipuam tamen vim
   conversionis in ea minime collocat, verum in actione longe diviniore,
   quæ efficacia nec creationi, nec resuscitationi mortuorum quicquam
   concedat. . . . . Et irresistibilis quidem est tum ex parte gratiæ Dei,
   tum ex parte voluntatis. Ex parte gratiæ: quia efficax Dei operatio est
   in actu posita, cui nemo potest resistere, Rom. ix. 19, prout Christus
   ne gratia sapientiæ Apostolis datæ dixit: cui omnes non poterunt
   resistere, Luc. xxi. 15. . . . . Ex parte voluntatis: nam subdita
   gratiæ eflicaci jam non vult resistere: et quia non vult, necessario
   non vult, sicque resistere velle non potest salva sua libertate." [521]

   The "Westminster Confession" [522] says, "All those whom God hath
   predestinated unto life, and those only, He is pleased, in his
   appointed and accepted time, effectually to call, by his Word and
   Spirit, out of that state of sin and death in which they are by nature,
   to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ; enlightening their minds,
   spiritually and savingly, to understand the things of God, taking away
   their heart of stone, and giving unto them a heart of flesh; renewing
   their wills, and by his almighty power determining them to that which
   is good; and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ; yet so as they
   come most freely, being made willing by his grace.

   "II. This effectual call is of God's free and special grace alone, not
   from anything at all foreseen in man, who is altogether passive
   therein, until, being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is
   thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered
   and conveyed in it.

   "III. Elect infants, dying in infancy, are regenerated and saved by
   Christ through the Spirit, who worketh when, where, and how He
   pleaseth. So also are all other elect persons, who are incapable of
   being outwardly called by the ministry of the Word."

   In the "Larger Catechism," [523] effectual calling is declared to be
   "the work of God's almighty power and grace."

   The Main Principle involved.

   These authoritative declarations of the faith of the Reformed Church
   agree as to the one simple, clear, and comprehensive statement, that
   efficacious grace is the almighty power of God. There are, as has been
   before remarked, three classes into which all events of which we have
   any knowledge may be arranged. First, those which are produced by the
   ordinary operations of second causes as guided and controlled by the
   providential agency of God. Secondly, those events in the external
   world which are produced by the simple volition, or immediate agency of
   God, without the cooperation of second causes. To this class all
   miracles, properly so called, belong. Thirdly, those effects produced
   on the mind, heart, and soul, by the volition, or immediate agency of
   the omnipotence of God. To this class belong, inward revelation,
   inspiration, miraculous powers, as the gift of tongues, gift of
   healing, etc., and regeneration.

   Efficacious Grace Mysterious and Peculiar.

   If this one point be determined, namely, that efficacious grace is the
   almighty power of God, it decides all questions in controversy on this
   subject.

   1. It is altogether mysterious in its operations. Its effects are not
   to be explained rationally, i.e., by the laws which govern our
   intellectual and moral exercises. To this aspect of the case our Lord
   refers in John iii. 8, "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
   hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and
   whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit." Volumes
   have been written on the contrary hypothesis; which volumes lose all
   their value if it be once admitted that regeneration, or effectual
   calling, is the work of omnipotence. No one is hardy enough to attempt
   to explain how the efficiency of God operates in creation; or how the
   mere volition of Christ healed the sick or raised the dead. Neither
   would men attempt to explain how Christ raises the spiritually dead,
   did they believe that it was a simple work of almighty power.

   2. Another equally obvious corollary of the above proposition is, that
   there is a specific difference between not only the providential
   efficiency of God and efficacious grace, but also between the latter
   and what is called common, or sufficient grace. It is not a difference
   in degree, or in circumstances, or in congruity, but the operations are
   of an entirely different kind. There is no analogy between an influence
   securing or promoting mental development, or the formation of moral
   character, and the efficiency exerted in raining the dead.

   Not Moral Suasion.

   3. It is no less clear that efficacious grace is not of the nature of
   "moral suasion." By moral suasion is meant the influence exerted by one
   mind over the acts and states of another mind, by the presentation of
   truth and motives, by expostulations, entreaty, appeals, etc. Under the
   influence of this kind of moral power, the mind yields or refuses. Its
   decision is purely its own, and within its own power. There is nothing
   of all this in the exercise of omnipotence. Healing the sick by a word,
   is an essentially different process from healing him by medicine. A
   living man may be persuaded not to commit suicide; but a dead man
   cannot be persuaded into life. If regeneration be effected by the
   volition, the command, the almighty power of God, it certainly is not
   produced by a process of argument or persuasion.

   Efficacious Grace Acts Immediately.

   4. It is a no less obvious conclusion that the influence of the Spirit
   acts immediately on the soul. All effects in the ordinary dealings of
   God with his creatures are produced through the agency of second
   causes. It is only in miracles and in the work of regeneration that all
   second causes are excluded. When Christ said to the leper, "I will; be
   thou clean," nothing intervened between his volition and the effect.
   And when He put clay in the eyes of the blind man, and bade him wash in
   the pool of Siloam, there was nothing in the properties of the clay or
   of the water that coöperated in the restoration of his sight. In like
   manner nothing intervenes between the volition of the Spirit and the
   regeneration of the soul. Truth may accompany or attend the work of the
   Spirit, but it has no coöperation in the production of the effect. It
   may attend it, as the application of the clay attended the miracle of
   restoring sight to the blind man; or as Naaman's bathing in the Jordan
   attended the healing of his leprosy. It is however to be remembered
   that the word regeneration (or its equivalents) is used, sometimes in a
   limited, and sometimes in a comprehensive sense. The translation of a
   soul from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son,
   is a great event. It involves a varied and comprehensive experience.
   There is much that usually precedes and attends the work of
   regeneration in the limited sense of the word; and there is much that
   of necessity and (in the case of adults) immediately succeeds it. In
   all that thus precedes and follows, the truth has an important, in some
   aspects, an essential part in the work. In most cases conviction of the
   truth, and of sin, a sense of shame, of remorse, of sorrow, and of
   anxiety, and longing desires after peace and security, precede the work
   of regeneration; and faith, joy, love, hope, gratitude, zeal, and other
   exercises follow it, in a greater or less degree. In all these states
   and acts, in everything, in short, which falls within the sphere of
   consciousness, the truth acts an essential part. These states and acts
   are the effects of the truth attended by the power, or demonstration of
   the Spirit. But regeneration itself, the infusion of a new life into
   the soul, is the immediate work of the Spirit. There is here no place
   for the use of means any more than in the act of creation or in working
   a miracle. Moses smiting the rock attended the outflow of the water,
   but had not the relation of a means to an effect. So the truth (in the
   case of adults) attends the work of regeneration, but is not the means
   by which it is effected. Much preceded and much followed the healing of
   the man with a withered arm; but the restoration of vitality to the
   limb, being an act of divine omnipotence was effected without the
   coöperation of secondary causes. There are two senses in which it may
   be said that we are begotten by the truth. First, when the word to
   beget (or regeneration), is meant to include the whole process, not the
   mere act of imparting life, but all that is preliminary and consequent
   to that act. The word "to beget" seems to be used sometimes in
   Scripture, and very often in the writings of theologians in this wide
   sense. And secondly, when the word by expresses not a coöperating
   cause, or means, but simply an attending circumstance. Men see by the
   light. Without light vision is impossible. Yet the eyes of the blind
   are not opened by means of the light. In like manner all the states and
   acts of consciousness preceding or attending, or following
   regeneration, are by the truth; but regeneration itself, or the
   imparting spiritual life, is by the immediate agency of the Spirit.

   The Use of the Word Physical.

   This idea is often expressed by the word physical. The Schoolmen spoke
   of "a physical influence of the Spirit." The Pope condemned Jansenius
   for teaching, "Gratia de se efficax vere, realiter et physice præmovens
   et prædeterminans, immutabiliter, infallibiliter insuperabiliter, et
   indeclinabiliter necessaria est," etc. Thus also Turrettin says: [524]
   "Gratiæ efficacis motio, nec physica nec ethica proprie dicenda est,
   sed supernaturalis et divina, quæ utramque illam schesin quadantenus
   includit. Non est simpliciter physica, quia agitur de facultate morali,
   quæ congruenter naturæ suæ moveri debet; nec simpliciter ethica, quasi
   Deus objective solum ageret, et leni suasione uteretur, quod
   pertendebant Pelagiani. Sed supernaturalis est et divina, quæ
   transcendit omnia hæc genera. Interim aliquid de ethico et physico
   participat, quia et potenter et suaviter, grate et invicte, operatur
   Spiritus ad nostri conversionem. Ad modum physicum pertinet, quod Deus
   Spiritu suo nos creat, regenerat, cor carneum dat, et efficienter
   habitus supernaturales fidei et charitatis nobis infundit. Ad moralem,
   quod verbo docet, inclinat, suadet et rationibus variis tanquam
   vinculis amoris ad se trahit." Here as was common with the writers of
   that age, Turrettin includes under "conversion," what is now more
   frequently distinguished under the two heads of regeneration and
   conversion. The former including what the Spirit does in the soul, and
   the latter what the sinner, under his influence, is induced to do. With
   his usual clearness he refers what is now meant by regeneration to the
   physical operation of the Spirit; and all that belongs to conversion or
   the voluntary turning of the soul to God, to the mediate influence of
   the Holy Ghost through the truth.

   Owen, in his work on the Spirit, strenuously insists on the necessity
   of this physical operation. He uses the words conversion and
   regeneration interchangeably, as including all that Turrettin
   understands by them. And hence he says that in the work of conversion
   there is both a physical and moral influence exerted by the Spirit.
   Speaking of moral suasion, he says, "That the Holy Spirit doth make use
   of it in the regeneration or conversion of all that are adult, and that
   either immediately in and by the preaching of it, or by some other
   application of light and truth unto the mind derived from the Word; for
   by the reasons, motives, and persuasive arguments which the Word
   affords, are our minds affected, and our souls wrought upon in our
   conversion unto God, whence it becomes our reasonable obedience. And
   there are none ordinarily converted, but they are able to give some
   account by what considerations they were prevailed on thereunto. But,
   we say that the whole work, or the whole of the work of the Holy Ghost
   in our conversion, doth not consist herein; but there is a real,
   physical work, whereby He infuseth a gracious principle of spiritual
   life into all that are effectually converted, and really regenerated,
   and without which there is no deliverance from the state of sin and
   death which we have described; which among others may be proved by the
   ensuing arguments. The principal arguments in this case will ensue in
   our proofs from the Scriptures, that there is a real, physical work of
   the Spirit on the souls of men in their regeneration. That all He doth,
   consisteth not in this moral suasion, the ensuing reasons do
   sufficiently evince." [525]

   It is too obvious to need remark that the word physical is used
   antithetically to moral. Any influence of the Spirit that is not simply
   moral by the way of argument and persuasion, is called physical. The
   word, perhaps, is as appropriate as any other; if there be a necessity
   for any discriminating epithet in the case. All that is important is,
   on the one hand, the negation that the work of regeneration is effected
   by the moral power of the truth in the hands of the Spirit; and, upon
   the other, the affirmation that there is a direct exercise of almighty
   power in giving a new principle of life to the soul.

   This doctrine both in what it denies and in what it affirms, is not
   peculiar to the older theologians. The modern German divines, each in
   the language of his peculiar philosophy, recognize that apart from the
   change in the state of the soul which takes place in the sphere of
   consciousness, and which is produced by God through the truth, there is
   a communication by his direct efficiency of a new form of life. This is
   sometimes called the life of Christ; sometimes the person of Christ;
   sometimes his substance; sometimes his divine-human nature, etc. They
   teach that man is passive in regeneration, but active in repentance.
   [526] "Man is every moment unspeakably more than lies in
   consciousness," says Ebrard. [527] This is true, and it should teach us
   that there is much pertaining to our internal life, which it is
   impossible for us to analyze and explain.

   Efficacious Grace Irresistible.

   5. It will of course be admitted that, if efficacious grace is the
   exercise of almighty power it is irresistible. That common grace, or
   that influence of the Spirit which is granted more or less to all men
   is often effectually resisted, is of course admitted. That the true
   believer often grieves and quenches the Holy Spirit, is also no doubt
   true. And in short that all those influences which are in their nature
   moral, exerted through the truth, are capable of being opposed, is also
   beyond dispute. But if the special work of regeneration, in the narrow
   sense of that word, be the effect of almighty power, then it cannot be
   resisted, any more than the act of creation. The effect follows
   immediately on the will of God, as when He said let there be light, and
   light was.

   The Soul passive in Regeneration.

   6. It follows, further, from the same premises, that the soul is
   passive in regeneration. It is the subject, and not the agent of the
   change. The soul coöperates, or, is active in what precedes and in what
   follows the change, but the change itself is something experienced, and
   not something done. The blind and the lame who came to Christ, may have
   undergone much labour in getting into his presence, and they joyfully
   exerted the new power imparted to them, but they were entirely passive
   in the moment of healing. They in no way coöperated in the production
   of that effect. The same must be true in regeneration, if regeneration
   be the effect of almighty power as much as the opening the eyes of the
   blind or the unstopping by a word the ears of the deaf.

   Regeneration Instantaneous.

   7. Regeneration, according to this view of the case, must be
   instantaneous. There is no middle state between life and death. If
   regeneration be a making alive those before dead, then it must be as
   instantaneous as the quickening of Lazarus. Those who regard it as a
   protracted process, either include in it all the states and exercises
   which attend upon conversion; or they adopt the theory that
   regeneration is the result of moral suasion. If the work of
   omnipotence, an effect of a mere volition on the part of God, it is of
   necessity instantaneous. God bids the sinner live; and he is alive,
   instinct with a new and a divine life.

   An Act of Sovereign Grace.

   8. It follows, also, that regeneration is an act of sovereign grace. If
   a tree must be made good before the fruit is good; the goodness of the
   fruit cannot be the reason which determines him who has the power to
   change the tree from bad to good. So if works spiritually good are the
   fruits of regeneration, then they cannot be the ground on which God
   exerts his life-giving power. If, therefore, the Scriptures teach the
   doctrine of efficacious grace in the Augustinian sense of those terms,
   then they teach that regeneration is a sovereign gift. It cannot be
   granted on the sight or foresight of anything good in the subjects of
   this saving change. None of those whom Christ healed, pretended to seek
   the exercise of his almighty power in their behalf on the ground of
   their peculiar goodness, much less did they dream of referring the
   restoration of their sight or health to any coöperation of their own
   with his omnipotence.

   § 5. Proof of the Doctrine.

   Common Consent.

   1. The first argument in proof of the Augustinian doctrine of
   efficacious grace, is drawn from common consent. All the great truths
   of the Bible are impressed on the convictions of the people of God; and
   find expression in unmistakable language. This is done in despite of
   the theologians, who often ignore or reject these truths in their
   formal teachings. There are in fact but two views on this subject.
   According to the one, regeneration is the effect of the mighty power of
   God; according to the other, it is the result of moral suasion. This
   latter may be understood to be nothing more than what the moral truths
   of the Bible are in virtue of their nature adapted to produce on the
   minds of men. Or, it may characterize the nature of the Spirit's
   influence as analogous to that by which one man convinces or persuades
   another. It is from its nature one which may be effectually resisted.
   All those, therefore, who hold to this theory of moral suasion, in
   either of its forms, teach that this influence is effectual or not,
   according to the determination of the subject. One chooses to yield,
   and another chooses to refuse. Every man may do either. Now, infants
   are confessedly incapable of moral suasion. Infants, therefore, cannot
   be the subjects of regeneration, if regeneration be effected by a
   process of rational persuasion and conviction. But, according to the
   faith of the Church Universal, infants may be renewed by the Holy
   Ghost, and must be thus born of the Spirit, in order to enter the
   kingdom of God. It therefore follows that the faith, the in-wrought
   conviction of the Church, the aggregate body of God's true and
   professing people, is against the doctrine of moral suasion, and in
   favour of the doctrine that regeneration is effected by the immediate
   almighty power of the Spirit. There is no possibility of its operating,
   in the case of infants, mediately through the truth as apprehended by
   the reason. It is hard to see how this argument is to be evaded. Those
   who are consistent and sufficiently independent, admit its force, and
   rather than give up their theory, deny the possibility of infant
   regeneration. But even this does not much help the matter. A place
   outside of the faith of the universal Church is a very unpleasant
   position. It is, moreover, unsafe and untenable. The whole Church, led
   and taught by the Spirit of Truth, cannot be wrong, and the
   metaphysicians and theorists alone right. The error of the Papists as
   to the authority of the Church as a teacher, was twofold: first, in
   rendering it paramount to the Scriptures; and secondly, in
   understanding by the Church, not the body of Christ filled by his
   Spirit, but the mass of unconverted wicked men gathered with the true
   people of God within the pale of an external organization. With them
   the Church consists of that external commonwealth of which the Pope is
   the head, and to which all belong who acknowledge his authority. It is
   a matter of very small moment what such a body may believe. But if we
   understand by the Church the aggregate of the true children of God, men
   renewed, guided, and taught by the Holy Spirit, then what they agree in
   believing, must be true. This universality of belief is a fact which
   admits of no rational solution, except that the doctrine thus believed
   is revealed in the Scriptures, and taught by the Spirit. This argument
   is analogous to that for the being of God founded upon the general
   belief of the existence of a Supreme Being among all nations. It is a
   philosophical maxim that "What all men believe must be true." This
   principle does not apply to the facts of history or science, the
   evidence of which is present only to the minds of the few. But it does
   apply to all facts, the evidence of which is contained either in the
   constitution of our nature or in a common external revelation. If what
   all men believe must be accepted as a truth revealed in the
   constitution of human nature, what all Christians believe must be
   accepted as a truth taught by the Word and the Spirit of God. The fact
   that there are many theoretical, speculative, or practical atheists in
   the world, neither invalidates nor weakens the argument for the being
   of God, founded upon the general convictions of men; so neither does
   the fact that theorists and speculative theologians deny the
   possibility of infant regeneration either invalidate or weaken the
   argument for its truth, founded on the faith of the Church Universal.
   But if infants may be subjects of regeneration, then the influence by
   which regeneration is effected is not a moral suasion, but the simple
   volition of Him whose will is omnipotent.

   Argument from Analogy.

   2. A second argument, although most weighty, is nevertheless very
   difficult adequately to present. Happily its force does not depend on
   the clearness or fulness of its presentation. Every mind will apprehend
   it for itself. It is founded on that analogy between the external and
   spiritual world, between matter and mind, which pervades all our forms
   of thought and language, and which is assumed and sanctioned in the
   Word of God. We borrow from the outward and visible world all the terms
   by which we express our mental acts and states. We attribute sight,
   hearing, taste, and feeling to the mind. We speak of the understanding
   as dark, the heart as hard, the conscience as seared. Strength,
   activity, and clearness, are as truly attributes of the mind, as of
   material substances and agencies. Dulness and acuteness of intellect
   are as intelligibile forms of speech, as when these characteristics are
   predicated of a tool. Sin is a leprosy. It is a defilement, a
   pollution, something to be cleansed. The soul is dead. It needs to be
   quickened, to be renewed, to be cleansed, to be strengthened, to be
   guided. The eyes of the mind must be opened, and its ears unstopped. It
   would be impossible that there should be such a transfer of modes of
   expression from the sphere of the outward and material to that of the
   inward and spiritual, if there were not a real analogy and intimate
   relation between the two. A feeble or diseased mind is scarcely more a
   figurative mode of speech than a feeble or diseased body. The one may
   be strengthened or healed as well as the other. The soul may be
   purified as literally as the body. Birth and the new-birth, are equally
   intelligible and literal forms of expression. The soul may be quickened
   as really as the body. Death in the one case is not more a figure of
   speech than it is in the other. When the body dies, it is only one form
   of activity that ceases; all the active properties belonging to it as
   matter remain. When the soul is dead, it also is entirely destitute of
   one form of life, while intellectual activity remains.

   Such being the state of the case; such being the intimate relation and
   analogy between the material and spiritual, and such being the
   consequent law of thought and language which is universal among men,
   and which is recognized in Scripture, we are not at liberty to explain
   the language of the Bible when speaking of the sinful state of men, or
   of the method of recovery from that state, as purely metaphorical, and
   make it mean much or little according to our good pleasure. Spiritual
   death is as real as corporeal death. The dead body is not more
   insensible and powerless in relation to the objects of sense, than the
   soul, when spiritually dead, is to the things of the Spirit. This
   insensibility and helplessness are precisely what the word dead in both
   cases is meant to express. It is as literal in the one case as in the
   other. It is on the ground of this analogy that much of the language
   descriptive of the moral and spiritual state of man, used in the Bible,
   is founded. And the account given of the mode of his recovery from his
   estate of sin has the same foundation. As the blind could not open
   their own eyes, or the deaf unstop their own ears, or the dead quicken
   themselves in their graves; as they could not prepare themselves for
   restoration, or coöperate in effecting it, so also with the blind, the
   deaf, and the dead in sin. The cure in both cases must be supernatural.
   It can be accomplished by nothing short of almighty power. One grand
   design of Christ's miracles of healing was to teach this very truth.
   They were intended to teach the sinner that his case was beyond all
   creature-help; that his only hope was in the almighty, and unmerited
   grace of Christ, to whom he must come and to whom he must submit. "As
   many as touched [Him] were made perfectly whole." Their cure was by no
   medicinal process. It was not a gradual work. It was not a change to be
   understood and accounted for by the laws of matter or mind. It was due
   to the simple volition of an almighty will. As there have been persons
   disposed to give the rationale of these cures; to explain them on the
   theory of animal magnetism, of occult forces, or of the power of the
   imagination, so there are those who prefer to explain the process of
   regeneration on rational principles, and to show how it is accomplished
   by moral suasion, and how it depends for its success on the coöperation
   of the subject of the work. This is not the Scriptural account. Our
   Lord said to the leper, I will; be thou clean; as he said to the winds,
   Be still.

   There is another view of the subject. As the Bible recognizes and
   teaches this analogy between the material and spiritual worlds, so it
   constantly assumes a like analogy between the relation which God
   sustains to the one and the relation which He sustains to the other. He
   has given to his creatures, the aggregate of whom constitutes nature,
   their properties, attributes, and powers. These are not inert. They act
   constantly and each according to its own laws. What we regard as the
   operations of nature, especially in the external world, are the effects
   of these agencies, that is, of the efficiency of second causes, which
   God has ordained, and which act with uniformity and certainty, so that
   like causes always produce like effects. God, however, is everywhere
   present with his creatures, not only upholding, but guiding, so that
   the effects produced, in the infinite diversity of vegetable and animal
   forms, are indicative of an everywhere present and everywhere active
   intelligence. In the exercise of this potentia ordinata God acts
   uniformly according to the laws which He has ordained. But the
   Scriptures teach that God has not limited Himself to this ordered
   action. He is over, as well as in all things. He controls the
   operations of the laws of nature so as to produce given results. He so
   directs the agencies that produce rain, that it rains at one time and
   place and not at others, as seems to Him good. He so controls the winds
   that they sink navies in the depths of the sea, or waft the richly
   freighted vessel to its desired haven. This providential control,
   everywhere distinguished from his providential efficiency, or potentia
   ordinata, is universal and constant, extending even to the casting of
   the lot, the flight of an arrow, or the falling of a sparrow. In all
   this providential control, however, God acts with and through second
   causes. It was not by a mere volition that He scattered the Spanish
   Armada; He made the winds and the waves his instruments. The Bible,
   however, teaches that He is not confined to this use of means; that He
   intervenes by his immediate efficiency producing effects by his simple
   volition without any intervention of second causes. In such cases the
   effect is to be referred exclusively to his almighty power. There
   special interventions of God, for what we know, may be, and probably
   are, innumerable. However this may be, it is certain that the Bible is
   full of recorded cases of this kind. All his supernatural revelations,
   all inspiration and prophecy, all supernatural gifts, and all miracles,
   whether in the Old Testament or in the New, belong to this class. There
   were no second causes employed in revealing the future to the mind of
   the ancient seer, or in healing the sick, or in opening the eyes of the
   blind, or in raising the dead by a word.

   In strict analogy to this relation of God to the external world, is,
   according to the Scriptures, his relation to his rational and moral
   creatures. They have their essential attributes and faculties. Those
   faculties act according to established laws; for there are laws of mind
   as well as laws of matter, and the one are as uniform and as imperative
   as the other. Mental action, not in accordance with the laws of mind,
   is insanity. God is in all his rational creatures, sustaining them and
   all their faculties. He is, moreover, over them and out of them,
   controlling and guiding them at his pleasure, in perfect consistency
   with their free agency. He restrains the wrath of men. He puts it into
   the hearts of the wicked to be favourable to his people. He conducts
   all the progress of history, overruling the minds of men, with unerring
   certainty and infinite wisdom. All this is mediate government; a rule
   exercised not only according to the laws of human agency, but through
   the rational influences by which that agency is determined in its
   operations. In like manner in his dealings with his people by the
   Spirit, He argues, remonstrates, reproves, exhorts, excites, comforts,
   and strengthens, through the truth. But He is not confined to this
   mediate action. He operates when, where, and how He sees fit, without
   the intervention of any second cause. By a word, or a volition, raising
   the spiritually dead, opening the eyes of the heart, renewing the will,
   communicating what the Scriptures call a new nature.

   There are men who deny the providential intervention of God in nature
   and in the government of the world. To them the world is a great
   mechanism, which, admitting it to have been framed by an intelligent
   first cause, does not need the constant supervision and intervention of
   its Maker to keep it in successful operation. There are others who
   acknowledge the necessity of such providential intervention for the
   preservation of second causes in their activity, but deny anything
   beyond this potentia ordinata of God. They deny any special providence.
   Events in the natural world and among the nations of the earth, are not
   determined by his control, but by natural causes and the uncontrolled
   free agency of men. And there are others, who admit not only the
   general concursus or coöperation of the first, with all second causes,
   but also the special providence of God, and yet who insist that He
   always operates through means; He never intervenes by the immediate
   exercise of his power; there can be no such thing as a miracle, in the
   ordinary and proper sense of that word. In like manner in reference to
   the relation of God to moral and rational creatures, there are those
   who deny that He is anything more than their creator. Having made them,
   He leaves them entirely to their own control. He neither positively
   upholds them in being; nor does He control them by an operation on
   their minds by truth and motives presented and urged by his Spirit.
   There are others who admit the universal agency of God in sustaining
   rational creatures, and who are willing to concede that He operates on
   them according to the laws of mental action, as one mind may influence
   other minds; but they deny any more than this. They deny any miracles
   in the sphere of grace, any effects produced by the immediate exertion
   of the omnipotence of God.

   It is a strong argument in favour of the Augustinian doctrine of
   efficacious grace, which teaches that regeneration is an act of
   almighty power, or, in its subjective sense, an effect produced in the
   soul by the omnipotence of God, that it is in analogy with the whole
   teaching of the Bible as to the relation between the outward and
   spiritual world, and as to the relation in which God stands to the one
   and to the other. This doctrine assumes nothing beyond what is
   recognized as true in every other department of the universe of God. He
   is everywhere present, and everywhere active, governing all creatures
   and all their actions in a way suited to their nature, working in,
   with, through, or without second causes, or instrumental agency, as
   seems good in his sight.

   Argument from Ephesians i. 17-19.

   3. A third argument on this subject is founded on Ephesians i. 17-19.
   The truth involved in this doctrine was so important in the eyes of the
   Apostle Paul, that he earnestly prayed that God would enable the
   Ephesians by his Spirit to understand and believe it. It was a truth
   which the illumination and teaching of the Holy Ghost alone could
   enable them duly to appreciate. Paul prayed that their eyes might be
   enlightened not only to know the blessedness of being the subjects of
   God's vocation, and the glory of the inheritance in reserve for them,
   but also "the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe,
   according to the working of his mighty power which He wrought in
   Christ, when He raised him from the dead." There are two questions to
   be decided in the interpretation of this passage. First, does the
   Apostle speak of the present or of the future? Does he refer to what
   the believer experiences in this life, or to what he is to experience
   at the last day? In other words, does the passage refer to the
   spiritual resurrection from a state of death in sin, or to the
   resurrection of the body and the glory that is to follow? The great
   majority of commentators, Greek as well as Latin, Protestant as well as
   Catholic, ancient as well as modern, understand the passage to refer to
   the conversion or regeneration of believers. This general consent is
   primâ facie evidence of the correctness of this interpretation.
   Besides, the whole context, preceding and subsequent, shows that such
   is the meaning of the Apostle. In what precedes, the prayer refers to
   the present experience of the believer. Paul prayed that the Ephesians
   might be made to know the value of the vocation they had already
   received; the preciousness of the hope they then enjoyed, and the
   greatness of the power of which they had already been the subjects.
   Here a reference to the future would be out of place. Besides, in what
   follows, the Apostle does not trace the analogy between the
   resurrection of Christ and the future resurrection of his people. He
   does not say here as he does in Romans viii. 11, "He that raised up
   Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies," but He
   that raised Christ from the dead, has quickened you "who were dead in
   trespasses and sins." It is clear, therefore, that it is the analogy
   between the resurrection of Christ from the grave, and the spiritual
   resurrection of believers, that the Apostle has in view. And this is an
   analogy to which the Scriptures elsewhere refer, as in Romans vi. 4.
   The parallel passage in Colossians ii. 12. "Buried with him in baptism,
   wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation
   of God who hath raised him from the dead;" renders it plain that it is
   the spiritual resurrection of believers which the Apostle refers to the
   mighty power of God, and not the future resurrection of their bodies.

   But if this be, as seems so clear, the meaning of the Apostle, what
   does the passage teach? What is it that Paul desired that the Ephesians
   should understand, when he says, that their regeneration, or spiritual
   resurrection was effected by the mighty power of God? (1.) In the first
   place it is very clear that he meant them to understand that it was not
   their own work. They had not by their own power, by the efficiency of
   their own will, raised themselves from the dead. (2.) It is no less
   clear that he does not mean to teach that there was any special
   difficulty in the case, as it regards God. To Him all things are easy.
   He speaks and it is done. He upholds all things by the word of his
   power. It is not the difficulty, but the nature of the work, he would
   have them to understand. (3.) And, therefore, the precise truth which
   the passage teaches is that regeneration belongs to that class of
   events which are brought about by the immediate agency, or almighty
   power of God. They are not the effect of natural causes. They are not
   due to the power of God acting through second causes. This is the
   definite meaning of the words. There can be no reason for saying that
   the Ephesians had experienced the effects of the mighty power of God,
   if they were subjects of no other influence than that of moral suasion,
   which all more or less experience, ano which all may resist. The
   language would be incongruous to express that idea. Besides, the very
   point of the illustration would then be lost. The Ephesians had been
   quickened by the very power which wrought in Christ when God raised Him
   from the dead. This was the immediate power of God. It was not
   exercised through second causes. It was not a natural process aided by
   divine efficiency; much less was it the result of any form of moral
   suasion. As then Christ was raised by the immediate power of God, so
   are the people of God raised from spiritual death by the same almighty
   power.

   This was in the view of the Apostle a most important truth. It
   determines the whole nature of religion. It raises it from the sphere
   of the natural, into that of the supernatural. If regeneration is a
   change effected by the man's own will; if it be due to the mere force
   of truth and motives, it is a small affair. But if it be the effect of
   the mighty power of God, it is as to its nature and consequences
   supernatural and divine. The whole nature of Christianity turns on this
   point. The conflict of ages concerns the question, Whether our religion
   is natural or supernatural; whether the regeneration, sanctification,
   and salvation promised and effected under the gospel, are natural
   effects, produced by second causes, aided and guided, it may be, by the
   coöperation of God, as He aids and guides the forces of nature in the
   production of their wonderful effects; or whether they are something
   entirely above nature, due to the supernatural intervention and
   constant operation of the Holy Spirit. Which of these views is
   Scriptural, can hardly be a question among unsophisticated Christians.
   And if the latter be the true view, it goes far to decide the question,
   Whether regeneration be due to moral suasion, or to the almighty power
   of the Spirit.

   Argument from the General Teaching of Scripture.

   4. This introduces the fourth argument on this subject. It is drawn
   from the general account given in the Scriptures of subjective
   Christianity, or the nature of the divine life in the soul. It is the
   tendency of all anti-Augustinian systems, as just remarked, to
   represent all inward religion as a rational affair, that is, something
   to be accounted for and explained on rational principles; the result of
   moral culture, of the right exercise of our free agency, and the
   favourable influence of circumstances. Such is not the view given in
   the Bible. When our Lord said, "I am the vine, ye are the branches: he
   that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit:
   for without me ye can do nothing" (John xv. 5), He certainly meant that
   the vital union between Him and his people is something more than that
   which may subsist between disciples and their master, -- a union
   including merely trust, congeniality, and affection. The influence to
   which the fruitfulness of the believer is attributed is something more
   than the influence of the truth which He taught; however that truth may
   be applied or enforced. Their abiding in Him, and He in them, is
   something more than abiding in the profession and belief of the truth.
   Christ is the head of the Church not merely as its ruler, but as the
   source of its life. It is not I, says the Apostle, that live, "but
   Christ liveth in me." (Gal. ii. 20.) "Know ye not your own selves, how
   that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?" (2 Cor. xiii.
   5.) It is from Him, as the same Apostle teaches us, that the whole body
   derives those supplies by which it lives and grows. (Eph. iv. 16.)
   "Because I live, ye shall live also. (John xiv. 19.) "I am the
   resurrection, and the life." (John xi. 25.) "1 am that bread of life."
   (John vi. 48.) "He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood,
   dwelleth in me and I in him." (John vi. 56.) "This is that bread which
   came down from heaven: . . . . he that eateth of this bread shall live
   forever." (John vi. 58.) "We shall be saved by his life." (Rom. v. 10.)
   "The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a
   quickening spirit." (1 Cor. xv. 45.) "As the Father hath life in
   himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself." (John v.
   26.) "Thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give
   eternal life to as many as thou hast given him." (John xvii. 2.) "Your
   life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall
   appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory." (Col. iii. 3, 4.)

   The Scriptures, therefore, plainly teach that there is a vital union
   between Christ and his people; that they have a common life analogous
   to that which exists between the vine and its branches, and between the
   head and members of the body. The believer is truly partaker of the
   life of Christ. This great truth is presented under another aspect. The
   Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one God. Wherever, therefore,
   the Father is, there is the Son, and where the Son is, there is the
   Spirit. Hence if Christ dwells in the believer, the Father does and the
   Spirit also does. In answer to the question of the disciples, "Lord,
   how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the
   world?" our Lord answered, "If a man love me, he will keep my words:
   and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our
   abode with him." (John xiv. 22, 23.) In the Bible, therefore, it is
   said that God dwells in his people; that Christ dwells in them, and
   that the Spirit dwells in them. These forms of expression are
   interchanged, as they all mean the same thing. Thus in Romans viii.
   9-1l, "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
   Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
   Christ he is none of his." Here the same person is called the Spirit of
   God and the Spirit of Christ. But in the next verse it is said, "If
   Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin;" and then in verse
   11, "But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
   in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
   mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." It is thus plain
   that the indwelling of the Spirit is the indwelling of Christ. And
   therefore those numerous passages in which the Spirit of God is said to
   dwell in his people, are so many proofs of the mystical union between
   Christ and all true believers. They are One. One with Him and one with
   one another. For by one Spirit they are all baptized into one body. (1
   Cor. xii. 13.)

   These representations of Scripture concerning the union between Christ
   and his people, are neither to be explained nor explained away. Both
   attempts have often been made. Numerous theories have been adopted and
   urged as divine truth, which in fact are only philosophical
   speculations. Some say that it is "the substance of Christ's person"
   that dwells in the believer. Others say that it is his divine nature,
   the Logos, who becomes incarnate in the Church; others that it is the
   humanity of Christ, his soul and body; others that it is the
   theanthropic nature; others that it is generic humanity raised by its
   union with the divine nature to the power of divinity. All this is
   darkening counsel by words without wisdom. It is, however, far better
   than the opposite extreme, which explains everything away. The one
   method admits the vital fact, however unauthorized may be the
   explanations given of it. The other denies the fact, and substitutes
   something easily intelligible for the great Scriptural mystery. It is
   enough for us to know that Christ and his people are really one. They
   are as truly one as the head and members of the same body, and for the
   same reason; they are pervaded and animated by the same Spirit. It is
   not merely a union of sentiment, of feeling, and of interests. These
   are only the consequences of the vital union on which the Scriptures
   lay so much stress.

   Now if the whole nature of religion, of the life of God in the soul,
   is, according to the Scriptures, thus something supernatural aid
   divine; something mysterious; something which is not to be explained by
   the ordinary laws of mental action or moral culture, then assuredly
   regeneration, or the commencement of this divine life in the soul, is
   no simple process, the rationale of which can be made intelligible to a
   child. It is no unassisted act of the man himself yielding to the force
   of truth and motives; nor is it an act to which he is determined by the
   persuasion of the Spirit, giving truth its due influence on the mind.
   It is an event of a different kind. It is not thus natural but
   supernatural; not referrible to any second cause, but to the mighty
   power of God. This does not involve any undervaluing of the truth, nor
   any oversight of the constant mediate influence of the Spirit on the
   minds of all men, and especially upon the minds of the people of God.
   We may admit the value and absolute necessity of light, while we deny
   that light can open the eyes of the blind, or preserve the restored
   organ in its normal vigour. The man who contends for the possibility
   and truth of miracles, does not make everything miraculous. He may
   admit both the potentia ordinata of God, and his constant providential
   control over second causes, while he holds that there are occasions in
   which He acts immediately by his power, without the intervention of any
   other agency. So Augustinians, while they hold to the supernatural
   character of the inward life of the believer, and to the fact that
   regeneration is due to the immediate exercise of the almighty power of
   God, nevertheless believe that the Holy Spirit constantly operates on
   the minds of men, according to the laws of mind, enlightening,
   convincing, persuading, and admonishing. They believe all that their
   opponents believe, but they believe more.

   Argument from the Nature of Regeneration.

   5. The Scriptures not only teach that regeneration is the work of the
   immediate omnipotent agency of the Spirit, but they give such an
   account of its nature as admits of no other explanation of its cause.
   It is a kind of work which nothing but almighty power can accomplish.
   It is a zoopoiesis, a making alive. Originating life is from its nature
   an act of God, for He alone can give life. It is also an act of
   immediate power. It precludes the intervention of second causes as much
   as creation does. Christ was raised from the dead by the power of God.
   So was Lazarus. So are the regenerated. Spiritual resurrection is just
   as really and as literally an act of making alive as calling a dead
   body to life. The one occurs in the sphere of the outward, the other in
   the sphere of the spiritual world. But the one is just as real a
   communication of life as the other. When the principle of life is
   communicated to a dead body, all the chemical properties which belong
   to it are controlled by the vital force, so as to make them work for
   its preservation and increase, instead of for its disintegration. And
   when the principle of spiritual life is imparted to the soul, it
   controls all its mental and moral energies, so that they work to its
   spiritual nourishment and growth in grace. The Scriptures, therefore,
   in teaching that regeneration is a quickening, do thereby reveal to us
   its nature as a work not of man, or of moral suasion, or of divine
   efficiency operating through second causes, but of the immediate, and
   therefore the almighty power of God.

   The Bible teaches the same truth when it declares believers to be new
   creatures, and says that they are created anew in Christ Jesus.
   Creation is the work of God, and it is an immediate work It precludes
   the intervention of means. It is of necessity the work of almighty
   power, and therefore the Scriptures so often claim it as the peculiar
   prerogative of God. It is true that the Greek and Hebrew words which we
   translate by the English word create, are often used in the sense of to
   make, to fashion out of preexistent materials. They occur, also, in a
   secondary or figurative sense, and express in such cases only the idea
   of a great, and generally a favourable change, no matter how produced.
   It would not, therefore, be sufficient to establish the Augustinian
   doctrine of regeneration, that it is called a creation, if in other
   parts of Scripture it were spoken of as a change produced by second
   causes, and if the means and the mode were described. In that case it
   would be natural to take the word in a figurative sense. But the
   contrary of all this is true. If the Bible taught the eternity of
   matter, or that the world is an emanation from God, or a mode of God's
   existence, we should be forced to give a figurative sense to the words,
   "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." But as the
   Scriptures tell us that God alone is eternal, and that all else owes
   its existence to his will, we are authorized and bound to retain these
   words in their simple and sublime significance. Now, as regeneration is
   always declared to be God's work, his peculiar work, and a work of his
   mighty power, analogous to that which He wrought in Christ, when He
   raised Him from the dead; as it is declared to be a making alive, an
   opening of the eyes, and an unstopping the ears; then, when it is also
   called a new creation, we are bound to understand that term as
   containing a new assertion that it is a work of almighty power.

   Another common Scriptural representation leads to the same conclusion.
   Believers are the children of God, not merely as his rational
   creatures, but as the subjects of a new birth. They are born of God.
   They are born of the Spirit. They are begotten of God. 1 John v. 1-18.
   The essential idea in such representations, is that of communication of
   life. We derive one form of life from our corrupt earthly parents, and
   another from the Spirit. "That which is born of the flesh, is flesh;
   and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit." (John iii. 6.) In the
   case of creatures, this communication of life by the parent to the
   offspring is merely transmission. In the case of God, the fountain of
   all life, it is a real communication. He originates the life which He
   gives. As it is utterly incongruous to think of a creature's begetting
   itself, or originating its own life; and no less incongruous to regard
   this commencement of life or being, as brought about by secondary
   influences, so is it utterly inconsistent with the Scriptures to regard
   regeneration as a man's own work, or as due to his coöperation, or as
   produced by the influences of truth. As well might it be assumed that
   light, heat, and moisture could make a dead seed germinate, and bring
   forth fruit. All beginning of life is directly from God; and this is
   what the Bible most explicitly asserts to be true of regeneration.
   Those who become the children of God are "born, not of blood, nor of
   the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." (John i.
   13.)

   This argument is not invalidated by the fact that Paul says to the
   Corinthians, "I have begotten you through the gospel." All words are
   used literally and figuratively; and no man is misled (or need be) by
   this change of meaning. We are accustomed to speak of one man as the
   spiritual father of another man, without any fear of being
   misunderstood. When the historian tells us that the monk Augustine
   converted the Britons, or the American missionaries the Sandwich
   Islanders, we are in no danger of mistaking his meaning; any more than
   when it is said that Moses divided the Red Sea, or brought water out of
   the rock, or gave the people manna out of heaven. The same Paul who
   told the Corinthians that he had "begotten them through the gospel,"
   told them in another place, "I have planted, Apollos watered: but God
   gave the increase. So then, neither is he that planteth anything,
   neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase." (1 Cor.
   iii. 6, 7.)

   In 1 Peter i. 23, it is written, "Being born again, not of corruptible
   seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and
   abideth forever." From this passage it is sometimes inferred that the
   new birth is a change produced not by the immediate agency of God, but
   instrumentally by the Word, and therefore by a rational process, or
   moral suasion. It has, however, been already remarked that regeneration
   is often taken in the wide sense of conversion. That is, for the whole
   change which takes place in the sinner when he is made a child of God.
   This is a comprehensive change, including all that takes place in the
   consciousness, and all that occurs in the soul itself (so to speak),
   below the consciousness, and subsequently in the state and relation of
   the soul to God. In this change the Word of God is eminently
   instrumental. It is by the Word that the sinner is convinced, aroused,
   made to seek reconciliation with God, and enlightened in the way of
   salvation. It is by the Word that the person and work of Christ are
   revealed, and all the objects on which the activity of the regenerated
   soul terminates, are presented to the mind. The Gospel is, therefore,
   the wisdom and power of God unto salvation. It is by the Word that all
   the graces of the Spirit are called into exercise, and without it
   holiness, in all its conscious manifestations, would be as impossible
   as vision without light. But this does not prove that light produces
   the faculty of seeing; neither does truth produce the principle of
   spiritual life. The Apostle Paul, who glories so much in the gospel,
   who declares that it is by the foolishness of preaching that God saves
   those that believe, still teaches that the inward work of the Spirit is
   necessary to enable men to receive the things freely given to them of
   God; that the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit, that
   they must be spiritually discerned. (1 Cor. ii. 8-11.) As examples of
   the latitude with which the words beget, begotten, and new-birth are
   used in Scripture, reference need be made only to such passages as 1
   Peter i. 3, where it is said, He "hath begotten us again unto a lively
   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead;" and 1
   Corinthians iv. 15. There is therefore nothing in what the Scriptures
   teach of the agency of the truth in conversion, or regeneration in the
   wide sense of the word, inconsistent with their distinct assertion that
   in its narrow sense of quickening or imparting spiritual life, it is an
   act of the immediate omnipotence of God. This point was adverted to in
   a previous chapter.

   The fact then that the Bible represents regeneration as a spiritual
   resurrection, as a new creation, and as a new birth, proves it to be
   the work of God's immediate agency. There is another familiar mode of
   speaking on this subject which leads to the same conclusion. In
   Deuteronomy xxx. 6, Moses says: "The Lord thy God will circumcise thine
   heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all
   thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live." In Ezekiel
   xi. 19, it is said, "I will give them one heart, and I will put a new
   spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh,
   and will give them an heart of flesh." And in chapter xxxvi. 26, "A new
   heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and
   I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you
   an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you
   to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them."
   Jeremiah xxiv. 7, "I will give them an heart to know me. The Psalmist
   prayed, "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
   within me." (Ps. li. 10.) It is admitted that the word heart, like all
   other familiar terms, is used in different senses in the Scriptures. It
   often means the whole soul; as when mention is made of the eyes, the
   thoughts, and the intentions of the heart. It very frequently means the
   feelings or affections, or is used collectively for them all, or for
   the seat of the feelings. A cold, hard, sluggish, timid, humble,
   broken, heart are all common forms of expression for what exists in the
   consciousness; for transient and changeable states of the mind, or
   inward man. Notwithstanding it is no less clear that the word is often
   used in the same sense in which we use the word nature, for a principle
   of action, a permanent habit or disposition. Something that exists not
   in the consciousness, but below it. That such is its meaning in the
   passages just quoted, and in all others in which God is said to change
   or renew the heart, is plain: (1.) Because it is something which God
   not only gives, but which He creates. (2.) Because it is the source of
   all right action. It cannot be a volition, or a generic purpose, or any
   state of mind which the man himself produces; because it is said to be
   the source of love, of fear, and of new obedience. Our Lord's
   illustration, derived from trees good and bad, forbids any other
   interpretation. A good tree produces good fruit. The goodness of the
   tree precedes and determines the goodness of the fruit; and so a good
   heart precedes all just thoughts, all right purposes, all good feelings
   and all holy exercises of every kind. (3.) The Scriptures explain what
   is meant by "creating a new heart" by the exegetical expression, "I
   will put my Spirit within you." This surely is not a right purpose. The
   indwelling Spirit or Christ dwelling in us, is the principle and source
   of that new life of which the believer is made the subject. All those
   passages in which God promises to give a new heart, are proofs that
   regeneration is a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit; not a moral
   suasion, but a creating and imparting a principle of a new form of
   life.

   Argument from related Doctrines.

   6. Another decisive argument in favour of the Augustinian doctrine of
   efficacious grace, is derived from its necessary connection with other
   Scriptural doctrines. If the latter be true, the former must be true
   also. If the Bible teaches that men since the Fall have not lost all
   ability to what is spiritually good; that they are not dead in
   trespasses and sins; that they still have the power to turn themselves
   unto God, or, at least, the power to yield to the influence which God
   exerts for their conversion, and power to resist and refuse, then so
   far as this point is concerned it might be true that regeneration is
   the result of moral suasion. It might be true that "God offers the same
   necessary conditions of acceptance to all men; desires from the heart
   that all men as free agents comply with them and live; brings no
   positive influence upon any mind against compliance, but, on the
   contrary, brings all those kinds and all that degree of influence in
   favour of it, upon each individual, which a system of measures best
   arranged for the success of grace in a world of rebellion allows; and
   finally, saves, without respect of kindred, rank, or country, whether
   Scythian, Greek or Jew, all who under this influence, accept the terms
   and work out their own salvation, and reprobates alike all who refuse."
   [528] But, on the other hand, if the Scriptures teach that "man, by his
   fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any
   spiritual good accompanying salvation; so as a natural man being
   altogether averse from that good, and dead in sin, is not able, by his
   own strength, to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto;"
   [529] then must it also be true that "when God converts a sinner, and
   translates him into the state of grace, He freeth him from his natural
   bondage under sin, and by his grace alone, enables him freely to will
   and to do that which is spiritually good." [530] Then is it also true,
   that man in effectual calling "is altogether passive, until, being
   quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to
   answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed in it."
   [531] If man is as really spiritually dead, in his natural state since
   the fall, as Lazarus was corporeally dead, then is the spiritual
   resurrection of the one as really a work of divine omnipotence as the
   bodily resurrection of the other. These doctrines, therefore, thus
   logically connected, have never in fact been dissociated. All who hold
   that original sin involves spiritual death and consequent utter
   inability to any spiritual good, do also hold that his recovery from
   that state is not effected by any process of moral suasion human or
   divine, but by the immediate exercise of God's almighty power. It is in
   reference to both classes of the dead that our Lord said, "As the
   Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son
   quickeneth whom he will. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is
   coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
   God: and they that hear shall live." (John v. 21, 25.)

   There is the same intimate connection between the doctrines of God's
   sovereignty in election and efficacious grace. If it were true that men
   make themselves to differ; that election is founded on the foresight of
   good works; that some who hear the Gospel and feel the influence of the
   Spirit, allow themselves to be persuaded, that others refuse, and that
   the former are therefore chosen and the latter rejected, then it would
   be consistent to represent the grace exercised in the vocation of men
   as an influence to be submitted to or rejected. But if God has mercy on
   whom He will have mercy; if it is not of him that willeth, nor of him
   that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy; if it be of God, and not
   of ourselves, that we are in Christ Jesus; if God hides these things
   from the wise and prudent and reveals them unto babes as seems good in
   his sight; then the influence by which He carries his purpose into
   effect must be efficacious from its own nature, and not owe its success
   to the determination of its subjects.

   The same conclusion follows from what the Scriptures teach of the
   covenant of redemption. If in that covenant God gave to the Son his
   people as the reward of his obedience and death, then all those thus
   given to Him must come unto Him; and the influence which secures their
   coming must be certainly efficacious. Thus this doctrine is implicated
   with all the other great doctrines of grace. It is an essential, or, at
   least, an inseparable element of that system which God has revealed for
   the salvation of men; a system the grand design of which is the
   manifestation of the riches of divine grace, i.e., of his unmerited,
   mysterious love to the unworthy; and which, therefore, is so devised
   and so administered that he that glories must glory in the Lord; he
   must be constrained to say, and rejoice in saying, "Not unto us, O
   Lord; not unto us, but unto thy name give glory." (Ps. cxv. 1.)

   Argument from Experience.

   7. Appeal on this subject may safely be made to the experience of the
   individual believer, and to the history of the Church. All the
   phenomena of the Christian life are in accordance with the Augustinian
   doctrine of efficacious grace. No believer ever ascribes his
   regeneration to himself. He does not recognize himself as the author of
   the work, or his own relative goodness, his greater susceptibility to
   good impression, or his greater readiness of persuasion, as the reason
   why he rather than others, is the subject of this change. He knows that
   it is a work of God; and that it is a work of God's free grace. His
   heart responds to the language of the Apostle when he says: "Not by
   works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy
   he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the
   Holy Ghost." (Tit. iii. 5.) Paul says of himself that God, having
   separated him from his mother's womb called him by his grace. (Gal. i.
   15.) There was nothing in him, who was injurious and a persecutor, to
   demand the special intervention of God in his behalf. So far from his
   referring his vocation to himself, to his greater readiness to yield to
   the influence of the truth, he constantly represents himself as a
   monument of the wonderful condescension and grace of God. He would have
   little patience to listen to the philosophical account of conversion,
   which makes the fact so intelligible why one believes and another
   rejects the offer of the Gospel. Paul's conversion is the type of every
   genuine conversion from that day to this. The miraculous circumstances
   attending it were simply adventitious. He was not converted by the
   audible words or by the blinding light, which encountered him on his
   way to Damascus. Our Lord said, "If they hear not Moses and the
   prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the
   dead." (Luke xvi. 31.) Neither was the change effected by a process of
   reasoning or persuasion. It was by the instantaneous opening his eyes
   to see the glory of God in the person of Jesus Christ. And this opening
   his eyes was as obviously an act of unmerited favour and of God's
   almighty power, as was the restoration of the blind Bartimeus to sight.
   God, says the Apostle, revealed his Son in Him. The revelation was
   internal and spiritual. What was true in his own experience, he tells
   us, is no less true in the experience of other believers. "The god of
   this world," he says, "hath blinded the minds of them which believe
   not." But "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
   shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
   of God in the face of Jesus Christ." (2 Cor. iv. 4, 6.) The truth
   concerning the person and work of Christ is presented objectively to
   all. The reason why some see it, and others do not, the Apostle refers
   to the simple fiat of Him who said in the beginning, "Let there be
   light." This is Paul's theory of conversion.

   Five thousand persons were converted on the day of Pentecost. Most of
   them had seen the person and works of Christ. They had heard his
   instructions. They had hitherto resisted all the influences flowing
   from the exhibition of his character and the truth of his doctrines.
   They had remained obdurate and unbelieving under all the strivings of
   the Spirit who never fails to enforce truth on the reason and the
   conscience. Their conversion was sudden, apparently instantaneous. It
   was radical, affecting their whole character and determining their
   whole subsequent life. That this was not a natural change, effected by
   the influence of truth on the mind, or produced by a process of moral
   suasion, in primâ facie certain from the whole narrative and from the
   nature of the case. The Holy Ghost was poured out abundantly, as the
   Apostle tells, in fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel. Three classes of
   effects immediately followed. First, miracles; that is, external
   manifestations of the immediate power of God. Secondly, the immediate
   illumination of the minds of the Apostles, by which they were raised
   from the darkness, prejudices, ignorance, and mistakes of their Jewish
   state, into the clear comprehension of the Gospel in all its
   spirituality and catholicity. Thirdly, the instantaneous conversion of
   five thousand of those who with wicked hands had crucified the Lord of
   glory, into his broken-hearted, adoring, devoted worshippers and
   servants. This third class of effects is as directly referred to the
   Spirit as either of the others. They all belong to the same general
   category. They were all supernatural, that is, produced by the
   immediate agency or volition of the Spirit of God. The Rationalist
   admits that they are all of the same general class. But he explains
   them all as natural effects, discarding all supernatural intervention.
   He has the advantage, so far as consistency is concerned, over those
   who admit the gift of tongues and the illumination of the Apostles to
   be the effects of the immediate agency of the Spirit, but insist on
   explaining the conversions as the consequents of argument and
   persuasion. This explanation is not only inconsistent with the
   narrative, but with the Scriptural method of accounting for these
   wonderful effects. The Bible says they are produced by "the exceeding
   greatness of" the power of God; that He raises those spiritually dead
   to a new life: that He creates a new heart in them; that He takes from
   them the heart of stone and gives them a heart of flesh; that He opens
   their eyes, and commands light to shine into their hearts, as in the
   beginning He commanded light to shine in the darkness which brooded
   over chaos. The Bible, therefore, refers conversion, or regeneration,
   to the class of events due to the immediate exercise of the power of
   God.

   The scenes of the day of Pentecost do not stand alone in the history of
   the Church. Similar manifestations of the power of the Spirit have
   occurred, and are still occurring, in every part of the world. They all
   bear as unmistakably the impress of divine agency, as the miracles of
   the apostolic age did. We are justified, therefore, in saying that all
   the phenomena of Christian experience in the individual believer and in
   the Church collectively, bear out the Augustinian doctrine of
   Efficacious Grace, and are inconsistent with every other doctrine on
   the subject.

   § 6. Objections.

   There are no specific objections against the doctrine of efficacious
   grace which need to be considered. Those which are commonly urged are
   pressed with equal force against other allied doctrines, and have
   already come under review. Thus, --

   1. It is urged that this doctrine destroys human responsibility. If we
   need a change which nothing but almighty power can effect before we can
   do anything spiritually good, we cease to be responsible. This is the
   old objection that inability and responsibility are incompatible. This
   difficulty has been presented thousands of times in the history of the
   Church, and has been a thousand times answered. It assumes
   unwarrantably that an inability which arises from character, and
   constitutes character, is incompatible with character.

   2. It is objected that if nothing but the creative power of God can
   enable us to repent and believe, we must patiently wait until that
   power is exerted. It is thus doubtless that those reason who are in
   love with sin and do not really desire to be delivered from it. Some
   leper, when Christ was upon earth, might have been so unreasonable as
   to argue that because he could not heal himself, he must wait until
   Christ came to heal him. The natural effect, however, of a conviction
   of utter helplessness is to impel to earnest application to the source
   whence alone help can come. And to all who feel their sinfulness and
   their inability to deliver themselves, there is the promise, "Come unto
   me . . . . and I will give you rest." "Ask, and it shall be given you;
   seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." It
   will be time enough for any man to complain when he fails to experience
   Christ's healing power, after having sought it as long, as earnestly,
   and as submissively to the directions of God's Word as its importance
   demands; or, even with the assiduity and zeal with which men seek the
   perishing things of this life.

   3. It is objected that a doctrine which supposes the intervention of
   the immediate agency of the Great First Cause in the development of
   history, or regular series of events, is contrary to all true
   philosophy, and inconsistent with the relation of God to the world.
   This is a point, however, as to which philosophy and the Bible, and not
   the Bible only, but also natural religion, are at variance. The
   Scriptures teach the doctrines of creation, of a particular providence,
   of supernatural revelation, of inspiration, of the incarnation, of
   miracles, and of a future resurrection, all of which are founded on the
   assumption of the supernatural and immediate agency of God. If the
   Scriptures be true, the philosophy which denies the possibility of such
   immediate intervention, must be false. There every Christian is willing
   to leave the question.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 7. History of the Doctrine of Grace.

   The doctrines of sin and grace are so intimately related, that the one
   cannot be stated without involving a statement of the other. Hence the
   views of different parties in the Church in reference to the work of
   the Spirit in the salvation of men, have already been incidentally
   presented in the chapter on Sin. With regard to the period antecedent
   to the Pelagian controversy, it may be sufficient to remark, (1.) As
   there was no general discussion of these subjects, there were no
   defined parties whose opinions were clearly announced and generally
   known. (2.) It is therefore, not the creeds adopted by the Church, but
   the opinions of individual writers, to which reference can be made as
   characteristic of this period. (3.) That the statements of a few
   ecclesiastical writers are very insufficient data on which to found a
   judgment as to the faith of the people. The convictions of believers
   are not determined by the writings of theologians, but by the
   Scriptures, the services of the Church, and the inward teaching of the
   Spirit, that is, by the unction from the Holy One of which the Apostle
   speaks, 1 John ii. 20. (4.) There is abundant evidence that the Church
   then, as always, held that all men since the fall are in a state of sin
   and condemnation; that this universality of sin had its historical and
   causal origin in the voluntary apostasy of Adam; that deliverance from
   this state of sin and misery can be obtained only through Christ, and
   by the aid of his Spirit; and that even infants as soon as born need
   regeneration and redemption. The practice of infant baptism was a
   constant profession of faith in the doctrines of original sin and of
   regeneration by the immediate agency of the Holy Spirit. (5.) It is no
   doubt true that many declarations may be cited from the early writers,
   especially of the Greek Church, inconsistent with one or more of the
   doctrines just stated; but it is no less true that these same writers
   and others of equal authority explicitly avow them. (6.) As the
   prevalent heresies of that time tended to fatalism, the natural counter
   tendency of the Church was to the undue exaltation of the liberty and
   ability of the human will. (7.) That this tendency was specially
   characteristic of the Greek Church, and has continued to distinguish
   the theology of that Church to the present day.

   Pelagian Doctrine.

   The Pelagian doctrine has already repeatedly been presented. It is only
   in reference to the views of Pelagius and his followers on the subject
   of grace that anything need now be said. As the Pelagians insisted so
   strenuously upon the plenary ability of man to avoid all sin, and to
   fulfil all duty, it was obvious to object that they ignored the
   necessity of divine grace of which the Scriptures so frequently and so
   plainly speak. This objection, however, Pelagius resented as an injury.
   He insisted that he fully recognized the necessity of divine grace for
   everything good, and magnified its office on every occasion. [532] In a
   letter to Innocent he assures the Roman bishop that while praising the
   nature of man, we always add the help of the grace of God; "ut Dei
   semper gratiæ addamus auxilium." [533] By grace, however, he meant,
   (1.) Free will, the ability to do right under all circumstances. This
   inalienable endowment of our nature he regarded as a great distinction
   or gift of God. (2.) The law, and especially the revelation of God in
   the Gospel, and the example of Christ. He says God rouses men from the
   pursuit of earthly things, by his promises of future blessedness, etc.
   [534] (3.) The forgiveness of sin. The Pelagian heresy "asserts that
   the grace of God includes our being so created that we have power to
   avoid sin, that God has given us the help of the law and of his
   commands, and further that he pardons those who having sinned return
   unto him.' [535] In these things alone is the grace of God recognized."
   (4.) Both Pelagius and Julian speak of the operation of the Spirit on
   the minds of men as a form of divine grace. In commenting on the words,
   "Ye are . . . . the epistle of Christ" (2 Cor. iii. 3), Pelagius says,
   "To all it is manifest that through our doctrine ye have believed on
   Christ, confirmante virtutem Spiritu Sancto.'" This influence of the
   Spirit, however, he regarded as didactic, or enlightening the mind;
   while he denied the absolute necessity of such spiritual influence, and
   taught that it only rendered obedience more easy. [536]

   We have already seen that Augustine, holding as he did that man since
   the fall is in a state of spiritual death, utterly disabled and
   opposite to all good, taught that his restoration to spiritual life was
   an act of God's almighty power; and being an act of omnipotence was
   instantaneous, immediate, and irresistible. This point is sufficiently
   well known and already established.

   Semi-Pelagianism.

   The doctrine of Pelagius had been condemned in the provincial Synod of
   Carthage, A.D. 412; in the Council of Jerusalem, 413; and in the Third
   General Council at Ephesus, 431. The opposite doctrine of Augustine was
   declared to be Scriptural and the doctrine of the Church. It was one of
   the inevitable consequences of Augustine's doctrine of efficacious
   grace, that God is sovereign in election and reprobation. If the sinner
   cannot convert himself, nor prepare himself for that work, nor
   coöperate in effecting it, then it can neither be out of regard to such
   preparation or coöperation, nor because of the foresight thereof that
   God makes one, and not another the subject of his saving grace. This
   Augustine freely admitted, and taught, in accordance with the plain
   teachings of the Scriptures, that God has mercy on whom He will have
   mercy. It was this inevitable consequence of the doctrine rather than
   the doctrine itself, whether of total depravity and helplessness, or of
   irresistible grace, that led to the strenuous opposition which
   continued to be made to the Augustinian system notwithstanding the
   decision of councils in its favour. So prominent was the doctrine of
   predestination in these controversies, and so strong was the antipathy
   to that doctrine, that the Augustinians were called by their opponents
   Prædestinati. To avoid the dreaded conclusion that fallen men lie at
   the mercy of God, and that He has mercy on whom He will have mercy, the
   Semi-Pelagians denied that the grace of God was irresistible. If not
   irresistible, then it depends on the sinner whether it be yielded to or
   rejected. But this yielding to the grace of God, is something right and
   good, and something leading to salvation. Fallen men therefore are not
   utterly disabled to all good. And if not thus powerless for spiritual
   good, they are not spiritually dead. Original sin consequently, is not
   so dreadful an evil as Augustine represented it. Men are weak and sick;
   but not helpless and dead. The Semi-Pelagians, as the designation
   implies, therefore, endeavoured to hold a middle ground between
   Augustine and Pelagius. They held, (1.) That in consequence of the fall
   of Adam, and our connection with him, all men are born in a state of
   sin and condemnation. (2.) That in consequence of this inherent,
   hereditary corruption, all the powers of man are weakened, so that he
   is of himself unable to resist sin and turn himself unto God. (3.) But
   while divine grace or aid is thus necessary to conversion, men may
   begin the work. They may seek after God, strive to walk in his ways,
   and comply with all the demands of the gospel. (4.) Those who thus
   begin the work of conversion, God assists in their endeavours by his
   grace; and if the sinner makes due improvement of this divine
   assistance, the work of conversion is effected. (5.) As it rests with
   those who hear the gospel to receive or to reject it, it cannot be
   admitted that any definite portion of the human race was given to
   Christ as us inheritance whose salvation is rendered certain by that
   gift, and by the efficacious grace of God securing their conversion and
   their perseverance in faith. As the conversion of the sinner depends
   upon himself, so does his perseverance. The truly regenerated,
   therefore, may fall away and be lost.

   On some of these points the original leaders of the Semi-Pelagian party
   differed among themselves, but this is a correct exhibition of the
   system as known in history as a form of doctrine. The characteristic
   principle of the Semi-Pelagian theory, by which it is distinguished
   from the doctrine afterwards adopted in the Romish Church, and by the
   Remonstrants and others, is that the sinner begins the work of
   conversion. The Semi-Pelagians denied "preventing grace." God helps
   those only who begin to help themselves. He is found only of those who
   seek Him.

   The historical details of the rise of Semi-Pelagianism are given above
   in the section on Original Sin. The most obscure point in the system is
   the meaning to be attached to the word "grace." It was used, as before
   remarked, in a sense so wide as to include all divine help, whether
   afforded externally in the revelation of the truth, the institutions of
   the Church, or the circumstances of life, or by the providential
   efficiency of God as exerted in coöperation with all second causes, or
   by the special influence of the Holy Spirit. This last came to be the
   accepted meaning of the word grace. According to Augustinians, this
   influence of the Spirit was mediate, or through the truth, in all those
   exercises which, in the case of adults, usually precede the work of
   regeneration, such as conviction, remorse, anxiety, desire for
   deliverance from the curse of the law, etc.; and also in the constant
   activity of the soul after regeneration in the exercise of all the
   gifts of the Spirit. It is, however, immediate, creative, and almighty
   in the work of regeneration. A blind man might be deeply sensible of
   the misery of his sightless state, and earnestly desire that his eyes
   should be opened. He might be informed that Jesus of Nazareth restored
   sight to the blind. Arguments might be used to awaken confidence in the
   power and willingness of Jesus to grant that blessing to him. Under
   these mediate influences he might frequent the place where Jesus was to
   be found, and seek his aid. If the Lord spake the word, his eyes were
   instantly opened. Then all the glories of the heavens and the wonders
   of the earth broke on his view. The state of that man's mind was very
   complex. It was the result of many coöperating causes. But the
   restoration of sight itself, was the simple, mediate, instantaneous
   effort of almighty power. This was precisely what the Semi-Pelagians
   denied as in relation to regeneration. They saw that if that was
   admitted, they must admit the sovereignty of God in election and all
   the other features of the Augustinian system. They, therefore, insisted
   not only that the preliminary work was from the man himself, and not
   due to the Spirit's drawing one man and not another, but that in every
   state of the process, the Spirit's influence was mediate, i.e., a moral
   suasion through the truth, which could be, and in multitudes of cases
   actually is, effectually resisted. These are the doctrines condemned in
   the Councils of Orange and Valence, A.D. 529. The decrees of those
   Councils being ratified by the Bishop of Rome, Augustinianism was
   reestablished as the authoritative form of doctrine for the Latin
   Church.

   Scholastic Period.

   All conceivable forms of doctrine concerning sin and grace were
   ventilated successively by the subtle intellects of the schoolmen of
   the Middle Ages. Some of the theologians of that period were really
   pantheistic in their philosophy; others, while recognizing a personal
   God, merge all the efficiency of second causes in his omnipresent
   agency; others went to the opposite extreme of making the human will
   independent of God, and maintained that men can act contrary to all
   kinds and degrees of influence not destructive of their nature, which
   may be brought to bear upon them. These sided naturally with Pelagius.
   Plenary ability, the power to do whatever is obligatory, they said, is
   essential to free agency. Men may, therefore, abstain from all sin.
   When sinners they may turn themselves unto God. If God condescends to
   aid them in this work, either by external revelations or by inward
   influence, they must have the power to yield or to refuse. The
   alternative rests with themselves. Others again come nearer to the
   Semi-Pelagian theory, admitting that man cannot save himself; cannot
   turn unto God; cannot repent or believe without divine aid. But this
   aid they held was given to all in sufficient measure to enable every
   man to become and to continue a true penitent and believer. Many of the
   most distinguished theologians of the Latin Church, however, during
   this period adhered more or less closely to the doctrines of Augustine.
   This was the case with Leo and Gregory the Great, in the fifth and
   sixth centuries, and Bede and Alcuin in the eighth and ninth. When,
   however, Gottschalk avowed the Augustinian doctrine, not only of
   original sin and grace, but also of predestination, it gave rise to
   violent opposition and issued in his condemnation in the Council of
   Chiersy, 849, under the influence of Hincmar; but in the opposing
   Council of Valence, 855 A.D., the doctrines of election and grace in
   the Augustinian sense were maintained.

   Anselm in the eleventh century was essentially Augustinian in his views
   of sin and grace. He held that man is born in a state of sin, with a
   will enslaved to evil, free only in sinning. From this state of
   helplessness, he can be freed only by the grace of the Holy Spirit, not
   by his own power, and not by an influence which owes its success to the
   coöperation of an enslaved will. [537]

   The two great contending powers in the Latin Church for two centuries
   before the Council of Trent, were the Dominicans and Franciscans, the
   Thomists and Scotists, the former the followers of Thomas Aquinas, and
   the latter of Duns Scotus. As Aquinas adopted very nearly the doctrine
   of Augustine concerning original sin, he approached more nearly to
   Augustinianism in his views concerning grace and predestination than
   the majority of the schoolmen. He held that man since the fall had lost
   all ability to anything spiritually good; that, without grace, he could
   do nothing acceptable to God or which secured salvation. But he held,
   --

   1. That a gratia preveniens, a divine influence which precedes any good
   effort on the part of the sinner is granted to men, by which they are
   excited, encouraged, and aided. If this influence be improved, it
   secures the merit of congruity, "Quia congruum est, ut dum homo bene
   utitur sua virtute, Deus secundum superexcellentem virtutem
   excellentius operetur." [538] This divine influence is called "gratia
   prima," and "gratia gratis data."

   2 To this preventing grace when improved, is added the "gratia gratum
   faciens," renewing grace, called also "gratia operans;" and, in
   reference to its effects, "gratia habitualis," by which is meant,
   "infusio gratiæ."

   3. To this succeeds the constant "gratia cooperans." "Gratia," he says,
   "dupliciter potest intelligi. Uno modo divinum auxilium quo nos movet
   ad bene volendum et agendum. Alio modo habituale donum." Again, "Gratia
   dividitur in operantem et cooperantem, secundum diversos effectus, ita
   etiam in prævenientem et subsequentem, qualitercunque gratia
   accipiatur. Sunt autem quinque effectus gratiæ in nobis, quorum primus
   est, ut anima sanetur: secundus, ut bonum velit; tertius est, ut bonum
   quod vult, efficaciter operetur: quartus est, ut in bono perseveret:
   quintus est, ut ad gloriam perveniat." [539]

   Duns Scotus, in his philosophy and theology, was indeed devoted to the
   Church, but antagonistic to the views of her most distinguished
   teachers. This antagonism was most pronounced against Thomas Aquinas,
   whose opinions he took every opportunity of opposing. Scotus
   endeavoured, as far as possible, to obliterate the distinction between
   the supernatural and the natural. Admitting the operations of divine
   grace, and their necessity, he endeavoured to reduce them to the
   category of the natural or established agency of God in coöperation
   with second causes. He held the doctrine of "absolute power," according
   to which everything, the moral law, the method of salvation, everything
   but absolute contradictions, are subject to the arbitrary will of God.
   God can, as Scotus taught, make right wrong and wrong right, love a
   crime and malice a virtue. Nothing has any value or merit in itself. It
   depend. simply on the good pleasure of God, what it avails. There is no
   merit, much less infinite merit in the work of Christ. God might have
   made anything else, even the most insignificant, the ground of our
   salvation. The requisition of faith and repentance in order to
   salvation is alike arbitrary. It depends solely on the absolute will of
   God that holiness, the supernatural work of the Spirit, has higher
   value than morality, which is the product of the unassisted free-will
   of man. Sin is wholly voluntary. Hereditary depravity is not truly sin;
   it is simply the want of the supernatural righteousness which Adam lost
   for himself and for all his posterity. The will remains free. Man can
   sin or avoid all sin. Nevertheless, God determines to accept only the
   fruits of grace, with which the will coöperates. It was principally the
   doctrine of Duns Scotus concerning original sin, and its universality,
   and especially in reference to the Virgin Mary, which was the subject
   of constant conflict between the Dominicans and Franciscans in the
   Latin Church. [540]

   The Tridentine Doctrine.

   The Council of Trent had a very difficult task to perform in framing a
   statement of the doctrines of sin and grace which, while it condemned
   the Protestant doctrine, should not obviously infringe against either
   the acknowledged doctrines of the Latin Church, or the cherished views
   of one or other of the conflicting parties within its pale. This,
   indeed, was not merely a difficult, but an impossible task. It was
   impossible to condemn the Protestant doctrine on these subjects without
   condemning the doctrine of Augustine, which the Church had already
   sanctioned. The Council availed itself of generalities as far as
   possible, and strove so to frame its canons as to secure the assent of
   the greatest number. On the subject of grace it, (1.) Expressly
   condemned the Pelagian doctrine of free-will or plenary ability. "Si
   quis dixerit hominem suis operibus, quæ vel per humanæ naturæ vires,
   vel per legis doctrinam fiant, absque divina per Jesum Christum gratia
   posse justificari (become holy) coram Deo; anathema sit." "Si quis
   dixerit, ad hoc solum gratiam per Jesum Christum dari, ut facilius homo
   justi vivere, ac vitam æternam promereni possit; quasi per liberum
   arbitrium sine gratia utrumque, sed ægre tamen, et difficiliter possit;
   anathema sit." (2.) It condemned with equal distinctness the
   Semi-Pelagian doctrine that man begins the work of conversion: "Si quis
   dixerit, sine prævenienti Spiritus Sancti inspiratione, atque ejus
   adjutorio, hominem credere, sperare, diligere aut poenitere posse,
   sicut oportet, ut ei justificationis (regeneration) gratia conferatur;
   anathema sit." (3.) Against the Reformers and Augustine the Council
   decided, "Si quis dixerit, liberum hominis arbitrium a Deo motum, et
   excitatum nihil cooperari assentiendo Deo excitanti, atque vocanti, quo
   ad obtinendam justificationis gratiam se disponat, ac præparet; neque
   posse dissentire si velit; sed velut inanime quoddam nihil omnino
   agere, mereque passive se habere; anathema sit." "Si quis liberum
   homninis arbitrium [by which is meant, potestas ad utramque partem]
   post Adæ peccatum amissum, et extinctum esse dixerit; aut rem esse de
   solo titulo, immo titulum sine re, figmentum denique a Satana invectum
   in ecclesiam: anathema sit." [541]

   There is of course confusion and misapprehension in all these
   statements. The Protestants did not deny that men coöperate in their
   own conversion, taking that word in the sense in which the Romanists
   used the term (and the still broader term justificatio), as including
   the whole work of turning unto God. No one denies that the man in the
   synagogue coöperated in stretching out his withered arm or that the
   impotent one at the pool was active in obeying the command of Christ,
   "Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house." But the question is,
   Did they coöperate in the communication of vital power to their
   impotent limbs? So Protestants do not deny that the soul is active in
   conversion, that the "arbitrium a Deo motum" freely assents; but they
   do deny that the sinner is active and coöperating in the production of
   the new life in the exercise of which the sinner turns to God. Moehler,
   the ablest and most plausible of the modern defenders of Romanism, uses
   the word "new-birth" as including the life-long process of
   sanctification, in which the soul is abundantly coöperative. He
   recognizes, however, the radical difference between the Tridentine
   doctrine and that of the Protestants. He insists that in the whole
   work, in regeneration in its limited sense, as well as in conversion,
   the soul coöperates with the Spirit, and that it depends on this
   coöperation, whether the sinner receives the new life or not. The power
   of the Spirit in all its inward operations may be resisted or assented
   to as the free-will of the subjects of his influence may decide.
   "According to Catholic principles," as before quoted, he says, "there
   are two agencies combined in the work of the new birth, the human and
   the divine, so that it is a divine-human work. The divine influence
   goes first, exciting, awakening and vivifying, without any agency of
   the man in meriting, invoking, or procuring it; but the subject must
   allow himself to be aroused and must freely follow. God offers his help
   to deliver from the fall, but the sinner must consent to be helped and
   embrace the offered aid; if he accepts, he is taken by the divine
   Spirit, and gradually, although in this life never perfectly, restored
   to the heights from which he fell. The Spirit of God does not work by
   necessitating, although he is actively urgent; his omnipotence sets
   itself a limit in human liberty, which it does not overstep; for such
   violation of free agency would be the destruction of the moral order of
   the world which eternal wisdom has founded on liberty." He therefore
   justifies the Papal condemnation of the Jansenist doctrine: "Quando
   Deus vult animam salvam facere, et eam tangit interiori gratiæ suæ
   manu, nulla voluntas humana ei resistit. -- Dei gratia nihil aliud est,
   quam ejus omnipotens voluntas." [542] On the following page, [543] he
   says, "The Catholic doctrine that there are in fallen men moral and
   religious powers which do not always sin, and which must in the new
   birth be called into exercise, gave rise to the idea, that this
   activity of what is natural in man, was a transition into grace, that
   is, that the right use of what is natural conditions or secures grace.
   This would indeed be Pelagian, and the man, not Christ, would merit
   grace, and grace cease to be grace. . . . . The delicate and refined
   sense of the Catholic doctrine, which carefully distinguishes between
   nature and grace, avoids that difficulty. The finite, even when
   sinless, may stretch itself to the utmost, it never reaches the
   Infinite, so as to seize and appropriate it. Nature may honestly unfold
   all its powers, it never can by and out of itself be sublimated into
   the Supernatural; the human can by no exertion of power make itself
   divine. There is an impassable gulf between the two, if grace does not
   interpose. The divine must come down to the human, if the human is to
   become divine." This is philosophy. The question is not, whether the
   finite can attain the Infinite, or the human become divine. Nor is the
   question between Romanists and Protestants, Whether fallen men can
   become holy without the supernatural grace of the Holy Spirit. But the
   question is, Whether the regeneration of the soul is due to the nature
   of the Spirit's influence, and to the purpose of God, or to the consent
   and coöperation of the subject of that influence.

   The Synergistic Controversy.

   The Lutherans from the beginning held the doctrine of original sin in
   its most extreme form. In the Augsburg Confession, in the Apology for
   that Confession, in the Smalcald Articles, and finally, in the Form of
   Concord, that doctrine is stated in stronger terms than in any other
   Christian Symbol. If men are since the fall in a state of condemnation,
   if the hereditary corruption derived from Adam is not only truly sin,
   but the deepest and greatest of all sins; if the soul is not merely
   morally sick and enfeebled, but spiritually dead, as taught in those
   Symbols, then it follows: (1.) That man since the fall has no ability
   to anything spiritually good (2.) That in order to his return to God he
   needs the life giving power of the Spirit of God. (3.) That the sinner
   can in no way prepare himself to be the subject of this grace, he
   cannot merit it, nor can he coöperate with it. Regeneration is
   exclusively the work of the Spirit, in which man is the subject and not
   the agent. (4.) That, therefore, it depends on God, and not on man, who
   are, and who are not, to be made partakers of eternal life. (5.) That
   consequently God acts as a sovereign, according to his good pleasure,
   and according to the counsel of his own will, in saving some and in
   passing by others, who are left to the just recompense of their sins.
   All these inferences are, as Augustinians believe, drawn in Scripture,
   and were freely accepted by Luther and, at first, by the Lutheran
   Church. Before the death of the Reformer, and more openly after that
   event, many of the Lutheran theologians adopted the later views of
   Melancthon, who taught, "Concurrunt tres causæ bonæ actionis, verbum
   Dei, Spiritus Sanctus, et humana voluntas assentiens nec repugnans
   verbo Dei. Posset enim excutere, ut excutit Saul sua sponte." [544] He
   defined freewill as "facultas applicandi se, ad gratiam." [545] In
   these views, which of necessity involved a modification of the doctrine
   of original sin, Melancthon was followed by a large class of Lutheran
   theologians, especially those of Wittemberg. The theologians of Jena,
   with one prominent exception, Strigel, adhered to the old Lutheran
   doctrine. Besides this discussion about sin and grace, there were
   several other subjects which greatly agitated the Lutheran Church. The
   doctrine concerning the person of Christ, the nature of justification,
   the necessity of good works, toleration of Papal ceremonies (the
   adiaphora), and the Lord's Supper, were debated with so much zeal that
   the Protestant rulers were constrained to interfere. Under their
   auspices, Andreas and Chemnitz, assisted by other theologians, drew up
   what is known as the "Form of Concord," in which with great clearness
   and skill they reviewed all the matters in dispute, and endeavoured to
   adopt a mode of statement which should secure general assent. In this
   they were not disappointed. The Form of Concord was so generally
   adopted that it received full symbolical authority, and has ever since
   been regarded as the standard of orthodoxy among the Lutherans. [546]

   As to original sin, and the consequent utter inability of man to any
   spiritual good, the doctrine of Luther was retained in its integrity.
   Luther had said in his book, "De Servo Arbitrio," [547] "Admonitos
   velim liberi arbitrii tutores, ut sciant, sese esse abnegatores Christi
   dum asserunt liberum arbitrium. Nam si meo studio gratiam Dei obtineo,
   quid opus est Christi gratia pro mea gratia accipienda?" "Humiliari
   penitus non potest homo, donec sciat, prorsus extra suas vires, studia,
   voluntatem, opera, omnino ex alterius arbitrio, consilio, voluntate,
   opere suam pendere salutem, nempe Dei solius." [548] On this point the
   "Form of Concord" says, inter alia, "Credimus, quantum abest, ut corpus
   mortuum seipsum vivificare atque sibi ipsi corporalem vitam restituere
   possit, tantum abesse, ut homo, qui ratione peccati spiritualiter
   mortuus est, seipsum in vitam spiritualem revocandi ullam facultatem
   habeat." [549] Of course, if such be the state of the natural man,
   there can be no coöperation on the part of the sinner in the work of
   regeneration. This Symbol, therefore, says, "Antequam homo per Spiritum
   Sanctum illuminatur, convertitur, regeneratur et trahitur, ex sese et
   propriis naturalibus suis viribus in rebus spiritualibus et ad
   conversionem aut regenerationem suam, nihil inchoare operari, nut
   cooperari potest, nec plus, quam lapis, truncus, aut limus." [550]
   Again, "Quamvis renati etiam in hac vita eousque progrediantur, ut
   bonum velint eoque delectentur, et bene agere atque in pietate
   proficere studeant: tamen hoc ipsum non a nostra voluntate aut a
   viribus nostris proficiscitur, sed Spiritus Sanctus operatur in nobis
   illud velle et perficere." [551]

   If original sin involves spiritual death, and spiritual death implies
   utter inability to spiritual good, and to all coöperation in the work
   of regeneration, it follows that regeneration is exclusively the work
   of the Spirit, in which the subject is entirely passive. This, also,
   the "Form of Concord" admits. "Item, quod D. Lutherus scripsit, hominis
   voluntatem in conversione pure passive se habere: id recte et dextere
   est accipiendum, videlicet respectu divinæ gratiæ in accendendis novis
   motibus, hoc est, de eo intelligi oportet, quando Spiritus Dei per
   verbum auditum, aut per usum sacramentorum hominis voluntatem
   aggreditur, et conversionem atque regenerationem in homine operatur.
   Postquam enim Spiritus Sanctus hoc ipsum jam operatus est atque
   effecit, hominisque voluntatem sola sua divina virtute et operatione
   immutavit atque renovavit: tunc revera hominis nova illa voluntas
   instrumentum est et organon Dei Spiritus Sancti, ut ea non modo gratiam
   apprehendat, verum etiam in operibus sequentibus Spiritui Sancto
   cooperetur." [552]

   But if the reason why any man is regenerated is not that he yields of
   his own will to the grace of God, or that he coöperates with it, but
   simply that God gives him a new heart, then it would seem to follow
   that God saves some and not others of the fallen race of men, of his
   own good pleasure. In other words, it follows that election to eternal
   life is not founded in anything in us, but solely in the will or
   purpose of God. This conclusion the "Form of Concord" admits, so far as
   the saved are concerned. It teaches (1) That predestination has
   reference only to the saved. That God predestinates no one either to
   sin or to eternal death. (2.) That the election of some persons to
   salvation is not for anything good in them, but solely of the mercy or
   grace of God. (3.) That predestination to life is the cause of
   salvation. That is, it is because God from eternity purposed to save
   certain individuals of the human family, that they are saved. (4.) That
   this predestination or election renders the salvation of the elect
   certain. Should they for a time fall away, their election secures their
   restoration to a state of grace. The following passages contain the
   avowal of these several principles. "Prædestinatio, seu æterna Dei
   electio, tantum ad bonos et dilectos filios Dei pertinet; et hæc est
   causa ipsorum salutis. Etenim eorum salutem procurat, et ea, quæ ad
   ipsam pertinent, disponit. Super hanc Dei prædestinationem salus nostra
   ita fundata est, ut inferorum portæ eam evertere nequeant." [553] "Hac
   pia doctrina et declaratione articuli de æterna et salvifica electorum
   filiorum Dei prædestinatione Deo gloria sua omnis solide tribuitur,
   quod videlicet mera et gratuita misericordia in Christo (absque omnibus
   nostris meritis aut bonis operibus) salvos nos faciat, secundum
   voluntatis suæ propositum. Eph i. 5 sq. . . . . Falsum igitur est et
   cum verbo Dei pugnat, cum docetur, quod non sola Dei misericordia, et
   unicum sanctissimum Christi meritum, verum etiam aliquid in nobis causa
   sit electionis divinæ, propter quod nos Deus ad vitam æternam
   prædestinaverit. Non enim tantum antequam aliquid boni faceremus, verum
   etiam priusquam nasceremur, imo ante jacta fundamenta mundi elegit nos
   Deus in Christo. Ut secundum electionem propositum Dei maneret, non ex
   operibus, sed ex vocante, dictum est ei: Major serviet minori. Rom. 9,
   [11.]" [554]

   As to the perseverance of the saints, it is said, "Cum etiam electio
   nostra ad vitam æternam non virtutibus aut justitia nostra, sed solo
   Christi merito, et benigna coelestis Patris voluntate nitatur, qui
   seipsum negare non potest (cum in voluntate et essentia sua sit
   immutabilis), eam ob causam, quando filii ipsius obedientiam non
   præstant, sed in peccata labuntur, per verbum eos ad poenitentiam
   revocat, et Spiritus Sanctus per verbum vult in iis efficax esse, ut in
   viam redeant, et vitam emendent." [555] The older Lutheran theologians
   adhered to this doctrine. Hutter [556] asks, "Siccine ergo electi non
   possunt excidere gratia Dei? Immo vero possunt; sed ita, ut per veram
   poenitentiam et fidem sese rursus virtute Spiritus Sancti ad Deum
   convertant et ad vitam redeant. Nisi enim redirent, non essent in
   numero electorum."

   But if all men since the fall are in a state of spiritual death,
   utterly unable to do anything to secure the grace of God, or to give
   that grace, when offered, a saving effect; if election is not a mere
   general purpose to save those who believe, but a purpose to save
   particular individuals; if that purpose is of God's mere good pleasure,
   and not founded upon anything actual or foreseen in its objects; if,
   moreover, it is the cause of salvation, and renders the salvation of
   its objects certain; then it would seem inevitably to follow, that
   although the judicial reason why the non-elect fail of salvation is
   their own sin, yet the reason why they, and not others equally guilty
   are left to suffer the penalty of their sins, is to be found in the
   sovereignty of God. "Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy
   sight." This, however, the Lutherans of that day could not admit; and
   therefore, with what Guericke calls "göttlich nothwendiger
   Verstandes-Inconsequenz" [557] (a divinely necessitated logical
   inconsistency), they rejected that consequence of their avowed
   principles. In this illogical position the theologians of the Lutheran
   Church could not remain, and therefore, since Gerhard (who died A.D.
   1637), they have adopted the more consistent scheme which has already
   been exhibited. According to that scheme, God sincerely not only
   desires, but purposes the salvation of all men; He makes abundant
   provision for the salvation of all; sends grace and truth to all, which
   grace and truth become certainly efficacious, unless resisted. Those
   whom God foresees will not resist, He elects to eternal life; those
   whom He foresees will resist unto the end, He foreordains to eternal
   death.

   Reformed Church.

   The experience of the Reformed Church conformed to that of the
   Lutheran, in so far as that the same defection from the original
   confessional doctrines occurred in both. As the followers of Melancthon
   adopted the theory of synergism, or of the coöperation of the sinner in
   his own regeneration, on which coöperation his fate depended,
   substantially the same view was adopted by the Remonstrants or
   Arminians within the pale of the Reformed Church. The departure of the
   Remonstrants from the principles of the Reformation, as to original
   sin, grace, ability, the satisfaction of Christ, justification and
   faith, was far more serious than that which occurred among the
   Lutherans. Another marked difference between the two cases is, that the
   synergistic controversy resulted in a modification of the Lutheran
   scheme of doctrine which became general and permanent; whereas the
   Remonstrants or Arminians formed a distinct ecclesiastical organization
   outside of the Reformed churches which adhered to the Reformed faith.
   The peculiar doctrines of the Remonstrants, both as to sin and as to
   grace, were stated above; [558] and also those of the Evangelical or
   Wesleyan Arminians. [559] The decision of the Synod of Dort,
   condemnatory of the Arminian doctrines, was unanimous. That Synod
   included delegates from all the Reformed churches except that of
   France, whose delegates were prevented from attending by an order from
   the King. The established churches of England and Scotland, as well as
   those of Holland, Germany, and Switzerland were represented. The
   judgment of the Synod was therefore the judgment of the Reformed
   Church. In accordance with the acknowledged Symbols of that Church, the
   Synod decided, (1.) That "all mankind sinned in Adam and became exposed
   to the curse and eternal death. That God would have done no injustice
   to any one, if He had determined to leave the whole human race under
   sin and the curse." [560] (2.) "That God out of the human race, fallen
   by their fault into sin and destruction, according to the most free
   good pleasure of his own will, and of mere grace, chose a certain
   number of men, neither better nor worthier than others to salvation in
   Christ." [561] (3.) That this decree to elect "a certain number" to
   eternal life, involves of necessity and according to the teaching of
   Scripture, a purpose to pass by, and leave those not elected to suffer
   the just punishment of their sins. [562] (4.) That God out of infinite
   and unmerited love sent his Son "efficaciously to redeem" all those
   "who were from eternity chosen unto salvation and given to Him by the
   Father." [563] (5.) That Christ makes satisfaction for us, being "made
   sin and a curse upon the cross for us, or in our stead," and that "this
   death of the Son of God is a single and most perfect sacrifice and
   satisfaction for sins, if infinite value and price abundantly
   sufficient to expiate the sins of the whole world." [564] "The promise
   of the Gospel is, that whosoever believeth in Christ crucified shall
   not perish, but have eternal life. Which promise ought to be announced
   and proposed, promiscuously and indiscriminately, to all nations and
   men to whom God, in his good pleasure, hath sent the Gospel, with the
   command to repent and believe." [565] "But because many who are called
   by the Gospel do not repent, nor believe in Christ, but perish in
   unbelief; this doth not arise from defect or insufficiency of the
   sacrifice offered by Christ upon the cross, but from their own fault."
   [566] This general invitation or call is perfectly sincere on the part
   of God; "for sincerely and most truly God shows in his Word what is
   pleasing to Him; namely, that they who are called should come to Him.
   And He sincerely promises to all who come to Him, and believe, the
   peace of their souls and eternal life." [567] That some do come and are
   converted, "is not to be ascribed to man, as if he distinguished
   himself by free-will from others furnished with equal or sufficient
   grace for faith and conversion (which the proud heresy of Pelagius
   states) but to God, who, as He chose his own people in Christ from
   eternity, so He effectually calls them in time." [568] "This
   regeneration is declared in the Scriptures to be a new creation, a
   resurrection from the dead, a giving of life which God without us (that
   is, without our concurrence) worketh in us. And this is by no means
   effected by the doctrine alone sounding without, by moral suasion, or
   by such a mode of operation, that after the operation of God (as far as
   He is concerned) it should remain in the power of man, to be
   regenerated or not regenerated, converted or not converted; but it is
   manifestly an operation supernatural, at the same time most powerful,
   most sweet, wonderful, secret, ineffable in its power, according to
   Scripture (which is inspired by the author of this operation) not less
   than, or inferior to, creation, or the resurrection of the dead." [569]
   "This grace God owes to no man." He who receives it must render
   everlasting thanks; he who does not receive it, either cares not for
   spiritual things, and rests satisfied with himself, or, secure, he
   vainly boasts that he has that which he has not. [570] "This divine
   grace of regeneration does not act upon men like stocks and trees, or
   take away the properties of his will, or violently compel it while
   unwilling; but it spiritually quickens (vivifies), heals, corrects, and
   sweetly, and at the same time powerfully inclines it." [571] "Those
   whom God, according to his purpose, calleth to fellowship of his Son
   our Lord Jesus Christ, and regenerates by his Holy Spirit, He indeed
   sets free from the dominion and slavery of sin, but not entirely in
   this life from the flesh and the body of sin." [572] Because of these
   remains of sin, believers, if left to themselves, would fall away, "but
   God is faithful, who confirms them in the grace once mercifully
   conferred upon them, and powerfully preserves them in the same even
   unto the end." [573]

   Hypothetical Universalism.

   A class of theologians in the Reformed Church who did not agree with
   the Remonstrants against whom the decisions of the Synod of Dort,
   sustained by all branches of the Reformed body, were directed, were
   still unable to side with the great mass of their brethren. The most
   distinguished of these theologians were Amyraut, La Place, and
   Cappellus. Their views have already been briefly stated in the sections
   treating of mediate imputation; and of the order of decrees and of the
   design of redemption. These departures from the accepted doctrines of
   the Reformed Church produced protracted agitation, not in France only
   but also in Holland and Switzerland. The professors of the University
   of Leyden. Andreas Rivet and Frederick Spanheim, were especially
   prominent among the opposers of the innovations of the French
   theologians. The clergy of Geneva drew up a protest in the form of a
   Consensus of the Helvetic Churches which received symbolical authority
   The doctrines against which this protest was directed are, (1.) That
   God, out of general benevolence towards men, and not out of special
   love to his chosen people, determined to redeem all mankind, provided
   they should repent and believe on the appointed Redeemer. Hence the
   theory was called hypothetical universalism. (2.) That the death or
   work of Christ had no special reference to his own people; it rendered
   the salvation of no man certain, but the salvation of all men possible.
   (3.) As the call of the gospel is directed to all men, all have the
   power to repent and believe. (4.) God foreseeing that none, if left to
   themselves, would repent, determines of his own good pleasure to give
   saving grace to some and not to others. This is the principal
   distinguishing feature between the theory of these French theologians
   and of the Semi-Pelagians and Remonstrants. The former admit the
   sovereignty of God in election; the latter do not.

   This system necessitates a thorough change in the related doctrines of
   the gospel. If fallen men have power to repent and believe, then
   original sin (subjectively considered) does not involve absolute
   spiritual death. If this be so, then mankind are not subject to the
   death threatened to Adam. Therefore, there is no immediate imputation
   of Adam's sin to his posterity. As they derive a polluted nature from
   him, which is the ground of the displeasure of God, they may so far be
   said to share in his sin. This is mediate imputation. Again, if the
   death of Christ does not render certain the salvation of his people,
   then it was not vicarious in the proper sense of that word; nor did He
   die as a substitute. His satisfaction assumes of necessity the
   character of a general display, a didactic exhibition of truth. At
   least this is the logical tendency, and the actual historical
   consequence of the theory. Moreover, if Christ did not act as the
   substitute and representativc of his people, there is no ground for the
   imputation of his righteousness to them. The French theologians,
   therefore, denied that his active obedience is thus imputed to
   believers. The merit of his death may be said to be thus imputed as it
   is the ground of the forgiveness of sin. This of course destroys the
   idea of justification by merging it into an executive act of pardon.
   Moreover, the principles on which this theory is founded, require that
   as every other provision of the gospel is general and universal, so
   also the call must be. But as it is undeniable that neither the written
   word nor the preached gospel has extended to all men, it must be
   assumed that the revelation of God made in his works, in his
   providence, and in the constitution of man, is adequate to lead men to
   all the knowledge necessary to salvation; or, that the supernatural
   teaching and guidance of the Spirit securing such knowledge must be
   granted to all men. It is too obviously inconsistent and unreasonable
   to demand that redemption must be universal, and ability universal as
   the common heritage of man, and yet admit that the knowledge of that
   redemption and of what sinners are required to do in the exercise of
   their ability, is confined to comparatively few. The "Formula Consensus
   Helvetica," therefore, includes in its protest the doctrine of those
   "qui vocationem ad salutem non sola Evangelii prædicatione, sed naturæ
   etiam ac Providentiæ operibuis, citra ullum exterius præconium expediri
   sentiunt," etc. [574] It is not wonderful, therefore, that this diluted
   form of Augustinianismn should be distasteful to the great body of the
   Reformed Churches. It was rejected universally except in France, where,
   after repeated acts of censure, it came to be tolerated.

   Supernaturalism and Rationalism.

   The departure from the doctrines of the church standards of the
   Protestant churches began early, with the decline of vital godliness.
   The only stable foundation for truth is either the external authority
   of the Church tolerating no dissent, or the inward testimony of the
   Spirit, the unction of the Holy One which both teaches and convinces.
   The former from its nature can secure only apparent conformity or the
   assent of indifference. Living faith can come only from a life-giving
   source.

   The first great change was effected by the introduction of the
   Wolf-Leibnitzian method into theology. Wolf assumed that all the truths
   of religion, even its highest mysteries, were truths of the reason, and
   capable of being demonstrated to the reason. This was a complete
   revolution. It changed the foundation of faith from the testimony of
   God in his Word and by his Spirit, to the testimony of our own feeble,
   insignificant reason. No wonder that a building resting on such a
   foundation, first tottered, and then fell. If the demonstration of the
   doctrine of the Trinity from the truths of the reason failed to
   convince, the doctrine was rejected. So of all the other great
   doctrines of revelation, and so especially of the Scriptural doctrines
   of sin and grace. A class of Rationalists was therefore soon formed;
   some rejecting everything supernatural, all prophecy, immediate
   revelation, inspiration, miracles, and divine influence other than what
   was mediate and providential; and others, while admitting a
   supernatural revelation supernaturally authenticated, still maintained
   that the truths of such revelation were only those of natural religion,
   all others being explained away or rejected as accommodations to the
   modes of thinking and speaking in past ages. This change was of course
   gradual. The Rationalists proper soon came to deny any supernatural
   influence of the Spirit of God in the conversion of men. Being Theists,
   and admitting that God exercises a providential efficiency, not only in
   the external world, but also in the support and guidance of free
   agents, -- an efficiency which is natural, as operating in accordance
   with natural laws, they referred all that the Scriptures teach and all
   that the Church teaches, of the operations of grace, to the general
   head of providence. God does no more and no less in the conversion of
   men than He does in their education, and in furthering their success in
   life, or in causing the rain to fall and the grass to grow. In denying
   the Scriptural account of the fall of man, the Rationalists rejected
   the foundation on which the whole Scriptural scheme of redemption
   rested.

   The Supernaturalists, although united against the Rationalists,
   differed very much among themselves. Some stood on the dividing line,
   admitting supernatural intervention on the part of God, in revelation
   and in grace, not because asserted in the Scriptures, but because
   consistent with reason, and because probable and desirable. Thus
   Bretschneider says in reference to grace, "Reason finds the immediate
   operation of God on the souls of men for their illumination and
   improvement, not only possible, but probable. As God stands in
   connection with the external world, and in virtue of his infinitely
   perfect life constantly operates therein; so must He also stand in
   connection with the moral world, or there could be no moral government.
   But as his working in the natural world appears as natural, so that we
   never apprehend his supernatural efficiency; thus his operation in the
   moral world is also natural conformed to psychological laws, so that we
   are never conscious of his operation." [575] This divine influence,
   therefore, he says, is simply "moral." "It can consist only in this,
   that God, through the ideas which the truth awakens in the soul, rouses
   it to decide for the good." [576]

   Morus [577] makes the reformation of men the work of God in so far that
   God sustains "nostrum in usu doctrinæ studium," so that it is
   successful. He attributes to man the ability to devote himself to this
   study, and declares that we do not need to determine, "quid et quantum
   Deus atque homo faciant, ubi aut quando Deus aut homo incipiat, seu
   desinat, Deus solus agat, seu homo aliquid conferat."

   J. L. Z. Junkheim [578] taught that the work of God in conversion as
   supernatural, not because He acts immediately, but because the means
   through which He works, his Word as a divine revelation, and the effect
   are supernatural. The modus agendi is purely natural, and the
   reformation only so far exceeds the natural power of man, as that the
   truth by which it is effected was not discovered by man, but revealed
   by God; and so far as this revealed truth has more power than the
   thoughts or speculations of men.

   Michaelis [579] and Döderlein [580] took the same ground, and denied
   any supernatural influence in the work of conversion. Others taught
   that the grace of God is universal, and that by grace is to be
   understood natural knowledge, and the helps to virtue, of which men
   have the opportunity and power to avail themselves. Eberhard, [581]
   Henke, Eckermann, and Wegscheider [582] acknowledge only a general
   agency of God in conversion, in that He has written the moral law on
   the hearts of men, given them the power of self-reformation, and is the
   author of Christianity, and in his providence gives them the occasion
   and inducements to virtuous action. Ammon [583] says grace consists in
   "procuratione institutionis salutaris, excitatione per exempla virtutis
   illustria, paupertate, calamitatibus, admonitionibus amicorum et
   inimicorum," etc. [584] There was a class of theologians during this
   period to which Storr, Flatt, and Knapp belonged, who opposed these
   open denials of the principles, not only of Protestant, but also of
   Catholic Christianity, but who were nevertheless far below the standard
   of the Reformation.

   To this state of extreme attenuation was the theology of the Reformers
   reduced, when the introduction of the speculative, transcendental, or
   pantheistic philosophy effected an entire revolution, which even such
   writers as Dorner are accustomed to call "the regeneration of
   theology." The leading principle of this philosophy, in all its phases,
   is Monism, the denial of all real dualism between God and man. If man
   is only the modus existendi of God, then of course there is an end of
   all questions about sin and grace. Sin can only be imperfect
   development, and man's activity bcing only a form of the agency of God,
   there is no place for what the Church means by grace. All resolves
   itself into the Hegelian dictum, "What God does I do, and what I do God
   does. "Der menschliche Wille eine Wirkungsform des göttlichen Willens
   . . . . ist." [585]

   The change introduced by the new philosophy was pervading. Even those
   who did not adopt it in its anti-christian or anti-theistic results,
   had all their modes of thought and expression modified by its
   influence. The views thus induced, of the nature of God, of his
   relation to the world, of the nature or constitution of man, of the
   person of Christ, and of the method of redemption, were so diverse from
   those previously adopted, that the new theology, whether designated as
   mystic or speculative, has few points of contact with the systems
   previously adopted. Its whole nomenclature is changed, so that the
   productions of the writers of this class cannot be understood without
   some previous training. Of course it is out of the question to class
   these theologians, who differ greatly among themselves, under the old
   categories. To say that they were Pelagian, Semi-Pelagian, Tridentine,
   Lutheran, Reformed, or Arminian, would be absurd. Schleiermacher,
   Ullmann, Nitzsch, Twesten, Martensen, Lange, Liebner, Dorner,
   Schoeberlein, Delitzsch, and many others, are believers in the divine
   origin of Christianity; and are able, learned, and zealous in the
   support of the truth as they apprehend it; and yet, in their
   theological discussions, their whole mode of thinking, and their method
   of presenting the doctrines of Scripture, are so controlled by their
   philosophy, that to a great degree, and to a degree much greater in
   some cases than in others, their writings have the aspect of
   philosophical disquisitions, and not of exhibitions of Scriptural
   doctrines. [586] With these writers as a class, all questions
   concerning grace, are merged into the more comprehensive questions of
   the nature of God, his relation to the world, the person of Christ, and
   the way in which his life becomes the life of his people. In many
   cases, indeed, the person, and the special work of the Spirit, are
   altogether ignored. We are redeemed because the divine and human are
   united in Christ, and we derive from Him, through the Church and the
   sacraments, the power of this divine-human life.

   All the topics connected with the great doctrines of sin and grace have
   been frequently and earnestly debated by the theological writers of our
   own country. But into these debates no new questions have entered. The
   principles involved in these controversies are the same as those
   involved in the earlier conflicts in the Church. Even the system of Dr.
   Emmons, which has most appearance of originality, is the doctrine of a
   continued creation pushed to its legitimate consequences, combined with
   certain incongruous elements derived from other sources. With Dr.
   Emmons God is the only cause; second causes (so called), whether
   material or mental, have no efficiency. God creates everything at every
   moment; all volitions or mental states, as well as all things external.
   He denied all substance out of God; identity consists in a sameness and
   continuity of phenomena or effects connected by the will or
   constitution of God. The moral and religious convictions of this
   distinguished man were too strong to allow him to draw the legitimate
   conclusions from his theory of divine efficiency. He therefore
   maintained that men's volitions are free, although created by God; and
   that they are morally good or evil, determining character and involving
   responsibility, although they are the acts of God, or the product of
   his creative power. This is very different from the Church doctrine of
   original or concreated righteousness, and of infused grace. The Bible
   does indeed teach that God created man in his own image in knowledge,
   righteousness, and true holiness. But this holiness was a permanent
   state of mind the character of a person, a suppositum, or individual
   subsistence; and not the character of an act which is good or bad
   according to the motives by which it is determined. If God creates holy
   acts, He is a Holy Being, but the acts have no moral character apart
   from their efficient cause or author. Faith and repentance are due to
   the power of God, they are his gifts; but they are truly our acts, and
   not God's. They are his gifts, because it is under his gracious
   influence we are induced to repent and believe. There can be no moral
   character pertaining to an act which does not belong to the agent.

   understand. It would be difficult to name a book more replete with
   sound Scriptural doctrine, clearly stated than Delitzsch's Commentar
   zum Briefe an die Hebräer, with its archaeological and doctrinal
   Excursus on sacrifices and atonement, and yet at other times he writes
   like a Cabalist.

       sed ut D. Lutherus loquitur, in unam personam conveniunt et
       commiscentur. Et propter hanc hypostaticam unionem et
       communicationem veteres orthodoxi ecclesiæ doctores sæpe admodum,
       non modo ante, verum etiam  : [1300]1
     * Causa hujus corruptæ dispositionis, quæ dicitur originale peccatum,
       est una tantum, scilicet privatio originalis justitiæ, per quam
       sublata est subjectio humanæ mentis ad Deum.: [1301]1
     * Censemus igitur (i.e.: [1302]1
     * Certe neminem sempiterna subire supplicia propter inobedientiam
       protoplasti, nisi mediante cognata perversitate.: [1303]1
     * Christi corpus repletive, absolute ut Deus, in omnibus creaturis
       sit.: [1304]1
     * Christum autem Dominum nostrum unigenitum Dei filium æqualem Patri,
       eundemque hominis filium quo major est Pater, et ubique totum
       præsentem esse non dubites tanquam Deum, et in eodem templo Dei
       esse tanquam inhabitantem Deum, et in loco aliquo coeli propter
       veri corporis modum.: [1305]1
     * Christus . . . . etiam secundum assumptam humanam naturam omnia
       novit et potest.: [1306]1
     * Christus Jesus, qui pro peccatis nostris satisfecit.: [1307]1
     * Christus peccata mundi in se recepit et sustulit, divinæque
       justitiæ satisfecit. Deus ergo propter solum Christum passum et
       resuscitatum, propitius est peccatis nostris, nec illa nobis
       imputat.: [1308]1
     * Christus, inquit [apostolus], quem dixi virtute vivificatum, jam
       olim in diebus Noe, quum appararetur arca, profectus sive
       adveniens, e coelo videlicet, ne nunc primum putemus illum ecclesiæ
       curam et administrationem suscepisse adveniens, inquam, non corpore
       (quod nondum assumpserat), sed ea ipsa virtute, per quam postea
       resurrexit, prædicavit spiritibus illis, qui nunc: [1309]1
     * Christus, quia sine peccato subiit poenam peccati, et victima pro
       nobis factus est, sustulit illud jus legis, ne accuset, ne damnet
       hos qui credunt in ipsum, quia ipse est propitiatio pro eis,
       propter quam nunc justi reputantur. Cum autem justi reputentur, lex
       non potest eos accusare, et damnare, etiamsi re ipsa legi non
       satisfecerint.: [1310]1
     * Concurrunt tres causæ bonæ actionis, verbum Dei, Spiritus Sanctus,
       et humana voluntas assentiens nec repugnans verbo Dei. Posset enim
       excutere, ut excutit Saul sua sponte.: [1311]1
     * Conficitur inde, veram esse philosophiam veram religionem,
       conversimque, veram religionem esse veram philosophiam.: [1312]1
     * Consensus: [1313]1
     * Constanter tenendum est, Deum nemini Spiritum vel gratiam suam
       largiri, nisi per verbum et cum verbo externo et præcedente, ut ita
       præmuniamus nos adversum enthusiastas, id est, spiritus, qui
       jactitant, se ante verbum et sine verbo Spiritum habere, et ideo
       scripturam sive vocale verbum judicant, flectunt et reflectunt pro
       libito, ut faciebat Monetarius, et multi adhuc hodie, qui acute
       discernere volunt inter Spiritum et literam, et neutrum norunt, nec
       quid statuant, sciunt.: [1314]1
     * Contra doctrinam Plactæi -- tota Gallia reformata, quin et Theologi
       reformati in Hollandiâ surrexêre.: [1315]1
     * Creator et creatura unum est. Deus est omnia, et omnia Deus.:
       [1316]1
     * Credendum est . . . . quod sit per omnia totalis carentia, defectus
       seu privatio concreatæ in Paradiso justitiæ originalis seu imaginis
       Dei, ad quam homo initio in veritate, sanctitate atque justitia
       creatus fuerat, et quod simul etiam sit impotentia et inaptitudo,
       adunamia: [1317]1
     * Credimus . . . . filium hominis ad dexteram omnipotentis majestatis
       et virtutis Dei realiter, hoc est, vere et reipsa secundum humanam
       suam naturam esse exaltatum, cum homo ille in Deum assumptus
       fuerit, quamprimum in utero matris a Spiritu Sancto est
       conceptus. . . . . Eamque majestatem, ratione unionis personalis
       semper Christus habuit: sed in statu suæ humilitationis sese
       exinanivit . . . . Quare majestatem illam non semper, sed quoties
       ipsi visum fuit, exseruit, donec formam servi, non autem naturam
       humanam post resurrectionem plene et prorsus deponeret, et in
       plenariam usurpationem manifestationem et declarationem divinæ
       majestatis collocaretur. . . . . Hanc suam potestatem ubique
       præsens exercere potest, neque quidquam illi aut impossibile est
       aut ignotum. Inde adeo, et quidem facillime, corpus suum verum et
       sanguinem suum in sacra coena præsens distribuere potest.: [1318]1
     * Credimus hoc vitium (ex propagatione manans) esse vere peccatum.:
       [1319]1
     * Credimus præterea et docemus filium Dei Dominum nostrum Jesum
       Christum ab æterno prædestinatum vel præordinatum esse, a Patre,
       salvatorem mundi: credimusque hunc esse genitum, non tantum, cum ex
       virgine Maria carnem assumsit, nec tantum ante jacta fundamenta
       mundi, sed ante omnem æternitatem, et quidem, a Patre,
       ineffabiliter. . . . . Proinde Filius est Patri juxta divinitatem
       coæqualis et consubstantialis, Deus verus non nuncupatione, aut
       adoptione, aut ulla dignatione, sed substantia atque
       natura. . . . . Abominamur ergo Arii et omnium Arianorum impiam
       contra filium Dei doctrinam. . . . . Eundem quoque æterni Dei
       æternum filium credimus et docemus hominis factum esse filium, ex
       semine Abrahæ atque Davidis, non ex viri coitu, quod Hebion dixit,
       sed conceptum purissime ex Spiritn Sancto, et natum ex Maria semper
       virgine: . . . . Caro ergo Christi, nec phantastica fuit, nec
       coelitus allata, sicuti Valentinus et Martion somniabant. Præterea
       anima fuit Domino nostro non absque sensu et ratione, ut
       Apollinaris sentiebat, neque caro absque anima, ut Eunomius
       docebat, sed anima cum ratione sua, et caro cum sensibus suis, per
       quos sensus, veros dolores tempore passionis suæ sustinuit. . . . .
       Agnoscimus ergo in uno atque eodem Domino nostro Jesu Christo, duas
       naturas [vel substantias: [1320]1
     * Credimus, Jesum Christum summum ilium sacerdotem esse, . . . . qui
       se nostro nomine coram Patre ad placandam ipsius iram cum plena
       satisfactione obtulit, sistens se ipsum super altare crucis, et
       sanguinem suum pretiosum ad purgationem peccatorum nostrorum
       profudit.: [1321]1
     * Credimus, docemus et confitemur, divinam et humanam naturas non in
       unam substantiam commixtas, nec unam in alteram mutatam esse, sed
       utramque naturam retinere suas proprietates essentiales, ut quæ
       alterius naturæ proprietates fiere nequeant.: [1322]1
     * Credimus, quantum abest, ut corpus mortuum seipsum vivificare atque
       sibi ipsi corporalem vitam restituere possit, tantum abesse, ut
       homo, qui ratione peccati spiritualiter mortuus est, seipsum in
       vitam spiritualem revocandi ullam facultatem habeat.: [1323]1
     * Culpa: [1324]1
     * Cum dixisset, quod pro omni genere humano redemptionem semetipsum
       dedisset, . . . . nunc addit aliquid sublimius et dicit, quia
       proposuit eum Deus propitiationem per fidem in sanguine ipsius:'
       quo scilicet per hostiam sui corporis propitium hominibus faceret
       Deum: [1325]1
     * Cum etiam electio nostra ad vitam æternam non virtutibus aut
       justitia nostra, sed solo Christi merito, et benigna coelestis
       Patris voluntate nitatur, qui seipsum negare non potest (cum in
       voluntate et essentia sua sit immutabilis), eam ob causam, quando
       filii ipsius obedientiam non præstant, sed in peccata labuntur, per
       verbum eos ad poenitentiam revocat, et Spiritus Sanctus per verbum
       vult in iis efficax esse, ut in viam redeant, et vitam emendent.:
       [1326]1
     * Cum omnes homines in Adamo peccaverint et rei sint facti
       maledictionis et mortis æteternæ, Deus nemini fecisset injuriam, si
       universum genus humanum in peccato et maledictione relinquere, ac
       propter peccatum damnare voluisset.: [1327]1
     * Cum relatum esset ad Synodum, scripta quædam . . . . prodisse, quæ
       totam rationem peccati originalis solâ corruptione hæreditariâ in
       omnibus hominibus inhærente definiunt, et primi peccati Adami
       imputationem negant: Damnavit Synodus doctrinam ejusmodi, quatenus
       peccati originalis naturam ad corruptionem hæreditariam posterum
       Adæ ita restringit, ut imputationem excludat primi illius peccati,
       quo lapsus est Adam: Adeoque censuris omnibus ecclesiasticis
       subjiciendos censuit pastores, professores, et quoscunque alios,
       qui in hujus quæstionis disceptatione a communi sententia
       recesserit Ecclesiarum Protestantium, quæ omnes hactenus et
       corruptionem illam, et imputationem hanc in omnes Adami posteros
       descendentem agnoverunt.: [1328]1
     * Cur autem non omnibus detur [donum fidei], fidelem movere non
       debet, qui credit ex uno omnes isse in condemnationem, sine dubio
       justissimam: ita ut nulla Dei esset justa reprehensio, etiamsi
       nullus inde liberaretur. Unde constat, magnam esse gratiam, quod
       plurimi liberantur.: [1329]1
     * Da quod jubes, et jube quod vis: [1330]1
     * De Christi essentia ita statuo illum esse hominem Rom. v. 15:
       [1331]1
     * De re obscurissima disputatur, non adjuvantibus divinarum
       scripturarum certis clarisque documentis.: [1332]1
     * Decretum vocant Remonstrantes decretum prædestinationis ad salutem,
       quia eo decernitur, qua ratione et conditione Deus peccatores
       saluti destinet. Enunciatur autem hoc decretum Dei hac formula:
       Deus decrevit salvare credentes, non quasi credentes quidam re ipsa
       jam sint, qui objiciantur Deo salvare volenti, sive prædestinanti;
       nihil minus; sed, ut quid in iis, circa quos Deus prædestinans
       versatur, requiratur, ista enunciatione clare significetur.
       Tantundem enim valet atqui si diceres, Deus decrevit homines
       salvare sub conditione fidei. . . . . Etiamsi hujusmodi
       prædestinatio non sit prædestinatio certarum personarum, est tamen
       omnium hominum prædestinatio, si modo credant et in virtute
       prædestinatio certarum personarum, quæ et quando credunt.: [1333]1
     * Dei gratia nihil aliud est quam ejus omnipotens voluntas: hæc est
       idea, quam Deus ipse nobis tradit in omnibus suis Scripturis. :
       [1334]1
     * Dei mors, Dei sanguis, Dei passio: [1335]1
     * Delictum significat, ut notet etiam sacrificium, cui delictum
       imputatum est. Vide passim, inprimis Lev. iv. 3; v. 6, 7, 16; vii.
       1: [1336]1
     * Descendam in infernum: [1337]1
     * Descensus ad Inferos: [1338]1 [1339]2
     * Deus vult justitiæ satisfieri; quocirca necesse est, vel per nos,
       vel per alium satisfaciamus.: [1340]1
     * Dextera Dei "non est certus aliquis . . . . locus, sed nihil aliud
       est, nisi omnipotens Dei virtus, quæ coelum et terram implet.":
       [1341]1
     * Dicimus Deum justo judicio nobis in Adamo maledixisse, ac voluisse
       nos ob illius peccatum corruptos nasci, ut in Christo instauremur.:
       [1342]1
     * Discrimen igitur retinendum est inter naturam nostram, qualis a Deo
       creata est, hodieque conservatur, in qua peccatum originale
       habitat, et inter ipsum peccatum originis, quod in natura habitat.
       Hæc enim duo secundum sacræ Scripturæ regulam distincte
       considerari, doceri et credi debent et possunt.: [1343]1
     * Docent quod post lapsum Adæ omnes homines, secundum naturam
       propagati, nascantur cum peccato, hoc est, sine metu Dei, sine
       fiducia erga Deum, et cum concupiscentia.": [1344]1
     * Ea est hominis post lapsum Adæ conditio, ut sese naturalibus suis
       viribus et bonis operibus ad fidem et invocationem Dei convertere
       ac præparare non possit. Quare absque gratia Dei quæ per Christum
       est nos præveniente, ut velimus et cooperante dum volumus, ad
       pietatis opera facienda, quæ Deo grata sunt ac accepta, nihil
       valemus.: [1345]1
     * Eam majestatem statim in sua conceptione, etiam in utero matris
       habuit: sed ut Apostolus loquitur se ipsum exinanivit, eamque, ut
       D. Lutherus docet, in statu suæ humiliationis secreto habuit, neque
       eam semper, sed quoties ipsi visum fuit, usurpavit.: [1346]1
     * Eamque Majestatem, ratione unionis personalis, semper Christus
       habuit: sed in statu suæ humiliationis sese exinanivit; qua de
       causa revera ætate, sapientia et gratia apud Deum atque homines
       profecit. Quare majestatem illam non semper, sed quoties ipsi visum
       fuit, exseruit, donec formam servi, non autem naturam humanam, post
       resurrectionem plene et prorsus deponeret, ut in plenariam
       usurpationem, manifestationem et declarationem divinæ majestatis
       collocaretur, et hoc modo in gloriam suam ingrederetur.: [1347]1
     * Eatenus rectam cognitionem istam prorsus necessariam esse statuo,
       quatenus quis sine illa non esset Christo Jesu divinum cultum
       exhibiturus, ob eam causam, quam antes dixi: nimirum, quod Deus ut
       id a nobis fiat, omnino requirit.: [1348]1
     * Eduxisti ab inferno animam meam: [1349]1
     * Ego autem ad hanc quidem vocem, quæ est theotokos: [1350]1
     * Electio hominum, peccato corruptorum, ad vitam æternam a Deo
       misericordissimo facta est intuitu fidei in Christum ad finem usque
       vitæ perseverantis.: [1351]1
     * Equus: [1352]1
     * Est [peccatum] . . . . non solum voluntarium atque possibile unde
       liberum est abstinere; verum etiam necessarium peccatum, unde
       abstinere liberum non est, quod jam non solum peccatum, sed etiam
       poena peccati est.: [1353]1
     * Et auferetur ab eis reatus sanguinis.: [1354]1
     * Et certum esse locum nullum esse unde appareat fidem istam sub V.
       T. præceptam fuisse, aut viguisse.: [1355]1
     * Etsi enim nonnullam habet boni et mali discretionem: affirmamus
       tamen quicquid habet lucis mox fieri tenebras, cum de quærendo Deo
       agitur, adeo ut sua intelligentia et ratione nullo modo possit ad
       eum accedere: item quamvis voluntate sit præditus, qua ad hoc vel
       illud movetur, tamen quum ea sit penitus sub peccato captiva,
       nullam prorsus habet ad bonum appetendum libertatem, nisi quam ex
       gratia et Dei dono acceperit.: [1356]1
     * Etsi humana ratio seu naturalis intellectus hominis, obscuram
       aliquam notitiæ illius scintillulam reliquam habet, quod sit Deus,
       et particulam aliquam legis tenet: tamen adeo ignorans, coeca, et
       perversa est ratio illa, ut ingeniosissimi homines in hoc mundo
       evangelium de Filio Dei et promissiones divinas de æterna salute
       legant vel audiant, tamen ea propriis viribus percipere,
       intelligere, credere et vera esse, statuere nequeant. Quin potius
       quanto diligentius in ea re elaborant, ut spirituales res istas suæ
       rationis acumine indagent et comprehendant, tanto minus intelligunt
       et credunt, et ea omnia pro stultitia et meris nugis et fabulis
       habent, priusquam a Spiritu Sancto illuminentur et doceantur.:
       [1357]1
     * Etsi rationalitas non esset in aliquo, tamen in natura remaneret.:
       [1358]1
     * Etsi vero maxima est gratiæ disparitas, pro liberrima scilicet
       voluntatis divinæ dispensatione tamen Spiritus Sanctus omnibus et
       singulis, quibus verbum fidei ordinarie prædicatur, tantum gratiæ
       confert, aut saltem conferre paratus est, quantum ad fidem
       ingenerandum, et ad promovendum suis gradibus salutarem ipsorum
       conversionem sufficit.: [1359]1
     * Etsi vero maxima est gratiæ disparitas, pro liberrima scilicet
       voluntatis divinæ dispensatione: tamen Spiritus Sanctus omnibus et
       singulis, quibus verbum fidei ordinarie prædicatur, tantum gratiæ
       confert, aut saltem conferre paratus est, quantum ad fidem
       ingenerandum, et ad promovendum suis gradibus salutarem ipsorum
       conversionem sufficit. Itaque gratia sufficiens ad fidem et
       conversionem non tantum iis obtingit, qui actu credunt et
       convertuntur: sed etiam iis, qui actu ipso non credunt, nec reipsa
       convertuntur.: [1360]1
     * Ex eodem etiam fundamento credimus, docemus et confitemur, Filium
       hominis ad dexteram omnipotentis majestatis et virtutis Dei,
       realiter, hoc est, vere et reipsa, secundum humanam suam naturam,
       esse exaltatum, cum homo ille in Deum assumptus fuerit, quamprimum
       in utero matris a Spiritu Sancto est confectus, ejusque humanitas
       jam tum cum Filio Dei altissimi personaliter fuerit unita.: [1361]1
     * Ex hac unione et naturarum communione humana natura habet illam
       exaltationem, post resurrectionem a mortuis, super omnes creaturas
       in coelo et in terra, quæ revera nihil aliud est, quam quod
       Christus formam servi prorsus deposuit; humanam vero naturam non
       deposuit, sed in omnem æternitatem retinet, et ad plenam
       possessionem et divinæ majestatis usurpationem secundam assumptam
       humanam naturam evectus est. Eam vero majestatem statim in sua
       conceptione, etiam in utero matris habuit: sed ut Apostolus Phil.
       ii. 8 [7]: [1362]1
     * Ex his facile colligere est, quid statuendum sit de quæstione illa
       famosa, An vitæ æternæ promissio etiam in Veteri foedere locum
       habuerit, vel potius in foedere ipso comprehensa fuerit. Si enim
       speciales promissiones in foedere ipso veteri expressæ videantur,
       fatendum est, nullam vitæ æternæ promissionem disertam in illis
       reperiri. Si quis contra sentiat, ejus est locum dare ubi illa
       exstat: quod puto impossibile esse. Sed vero, si promissiones Dei
       generales videantur, fatendum ex altera parte est, eas tales esse,
       ut promissio vitæ æternæ non subesse tantum videatur, sed ex Dei
       intentione eam eis subfuisse etiam credidebeat.: [1363]1
     * Ex his tot patrum testimoniis cogimur admittere, non esse omnino
       idem imaginem et similitudinem, sed imaginem ad naturam,
       similitudinem ad virtutes pertinere; proinde Adamum peccando non
       imaginem Dei, sed similitudinem perdidisse.: [1364]1
     * Foedus hoc gratiæ est pactum gratuitum inter Deum offensum et
       hominem offendentem in Christo initum, in quo Deus homini gratis
       propter Christum remissionem peccatorum et salutem pollicetur, homo
       vero eadem gratia fretus pollicetur fidem et obedientiam.: [1365]1
     * Fides Dei donum est, non eo, quod a Deo hominis arbitrio offeratur,
       sed quod homini reipsa conferatur, inspiretur, et infundatur.:
       [1366]1
     * Filius Dei assumpsit humanam naturam in utero beatæ Mariæ virginis,
       ut sint duæ naturæ, divina et humana, in unitate personæ
       inseparabiliter conjunctæ, unus Christus, vere Deus et vere homo.:
       [1367]1
     * Forma peccati est disconvenientia actus habitus, aut status hominis
       cum divina lege.: [1368]1
     * Forma vocationis consistit in seria atque ex Dei intentione semper
       sufficiente, semperque efficaci voluntatis divinæ manifestatione ac
       beneficiorum per Christum acquisitorum oblatione. . . . . Nulla
       enim vocatio Dei sive ex se et intrinseca sua qualitate, sive ex
       Dei intentione est inefficax, ut nec possit nec debeat effectum
       salutarem producere, sed omnis efficax est licet, quo minus
       effectum suum consequatur, ab hominibus obicem ponentibus,
       impediatur, atque ita inefficax fit vitio malæ obstinatæque hominum
       voluntatis.: [1369]1
     * Fuerant et ante Christum viri insignes, sed in peccatis concepti et
       nati, nec originali nec personali caruere delicto.: [1370]1
     * Generare: [1371]1
     * Gratiæ efficacis motio, nec physica nec ethica proprie dicenda est,
       sed supernaturalis et divina, quæ utramque illam schesin: [1372]1
     * Gratia Christi est gratia suprema, sine qua Christum confiiteri
       nunquam possumus, et cum qua nunquam illum abnegamus. : [1373]1
     * Gratia Jesu Christi est gratia fortis, potens, suprema,
       invincibilis, utpote quæ est operatio voluntatis omnipotentis,
       sequela et imitatio operationis Dei incarnantis et resuscitantis
       filium suum. : [1374]1
     * Gratia de se efficax vere, realiter et physice præmovens et
       prædeterminans, immutabiliter, infallibiliter insuperabiliter, et
       indeclinabiliter necessaria est: [1375]1
     * Gratia dividitur in operantem et cooperantem, secundum diversos
       effectus, ita etiam in prævenientem et subsequentem, qualitercunque
       gratia accipiatur. Sunt autem quinque effectus gratiæ in nobis,
       quorum primus est, ut anima sanetur: secundus, ut bonum velit;
       tertius est, ut bonum quod vult, efficaciter operetur: quartus est,
       ut in bono perseveret: quintus est, ut ad gloriam perveniat.:
       [1376]1
     * Gratia efficax vocatur . . . . ab eventu: [1377]1
     * Gratia efficax vocatur ex eventu. Ut statuatur gratia habere ex se
       sufficientem vim, ad producendum consensum in voluntate, sed quia
       vis illa partialis est, non posse exire in actum sive effectum
       sortiri sine coöperatione liberæ voluntatis humanæ, ac proinde ut
       effectum habeat, . . . . pendere a libera voluntate.: [1378]1
     * Gratia est manus omnipotentis Dei, jubentis et facientis quod
       jubet. : [1379]1
     * Gratiam Dei statuimus esse principium, progressum et complementum
       omnis boni: adeo ut ne ipse quidem regenitus absque præcedente
       ista, sive præveniente, excitante, prosequente et coöperante
       gratia, bonum ullum salutare cogitare, velle, aut peragere possit.:
       [1380]1
     * Hac pia doctrina et declaratione articuli de æterna et salvifica
       electorum filiorum Dei prædestinatione Deo gloria sua omnis solide
       tribuitur, quod videlicet mera et gratuita misericordia in Christo
       (absque omnibus nostris meritis aut bonis operibus) salvos nos
       faciat, secundum voluntatis suæ propositum. Eph i. 5 sq.: [1381]1
     * Heu me miserum et nimis miserum! nimis enim miserum, quem torquet
       conscientia sua quam fugere non potest! nimis enim miserum quem
       exspectat damnatio sua, quam vitare non potest! Nimis est infelix,
       qui sibi ipsi est horribilis; nimis infelicior, cui mors æeterna
       erit sensibilis. Nimis ærumnosus, quem terrent continui de sua
       infelicitate horrores.: [1382]1
     * Hoc in passione, et morte Filius Dei salvator noster spectavit, ut
       omnium ætatum peccata redimeret ac deleret, et pro eis Patri
       abunde, cumulateque satisfaceret.: [1383]1
     * Hoc ipso Deus non tantum suum adversus peccata odium testatum
       fecit, ac proinde nos hoc facto a peccatis deterruit (facilis enim
       est collectio, si Deus ne resipiscentibus quidem peccata remittere
       voluit, nisi Christo in poenas succedente, multo minus inultos
       sinet contumaces) verum insigni modo insuper patefecit summum erga
       nos amorem ac benevolentiam: quod ille scilicet nobis pepercit, cui
       non erat adiaphoron: [1384]1
     * Homo itaque salvificam fidem non habet ex seipso: neque ex arbitrii
       sui liberi viribus regeneratur, aut convertitur: quandoquidem in
       statu peccati nihil boni, quod quidem salutare bonum sit (cujusmodi
       imprimis est conversio et fides salvifica), ex seipso, vel cogitare
       potest, nedum, velle, aut facere: sed necesse est, ut a Deo, in
       Christo, per verbum, evangelii, eique adjunctam Spiritus Sancti
       virtutem regeneretur, atque totus renovetur; puta intellectu,
       affectibus, voluntate, omnibusque viribus; ut salutaria bona recte
       possit intelligere, meditari, velle, ac perficere.: [1385]1
     * Homo quædam species est, res una essentialiter, cui adveniunt formæ
       quædam et efficiunt Socratem: illam eamdem essentialiter eodem modo
       informant formæ facientes Platonem et cætera individua hominis; nec
       aliquid est in Socrate, præter illas formas informantes illam
       materiam ad faciendum Socratem, quin illud idem eodem tempore in
       Platone informatum sit formis Platonis. Et hoc intelligunt de
       singulis speciebus ad individua et de generibus ad species.:
       [1386]1
     * Homo vero rationabilis et secundum hoc similis Deo.: [1387]1
     * Humana natura . . . . inde . . . . quod cum divina natura
       personaliter unita est . . . . præter et supra naturales atque in
       ipsa permanentes humanas proprietates, etiam singulares . . . .
       supernaturales . . . . prærogativas majestatis, gloriæ, virtutis ac
       potentiæ super omne, quod nominatur, non solum in hoc seculo sed
       etiam in futuro, accepit.: [1388]1
     * Humana natura in Christo quamvis sit substantia particularis: qui
       tamen venit in unionem cujusdam completi, scilicet totius Christi,
       prout est Deus et homo, non potest dici hypostasis vel suppositum:
       Sed illum completum ad quod concurrit, dicitur esse hypostasis vel
       suppositum.: [1389]1
     * Humana voluntas habet aliquam libertatem ad efficiendam civilem
       justitiam et deligendas res rationi subjectas. Sed non habet vim
       sine Spiritu Sancto efficiendæ justitiæ Dei, seu justitiæ
       spiritualis, quia animalis homo non percepit ea quæ sunt Spiritus
       Dei (1 Cor. ii. 14: [1390]1
     * Humiliari penitus non potest homo, donec sciat, prorsus extra suas
       vires, studia, voluntatem, opera, omnino ex alterius arbitrio,
       consilio, voluntate, opere suam pendere salutem, nempe Dei solius.:
       [1391]1
     * Ideo corpus Christi non est jam in terra, nedum ubique. Etsi autem
       Christus corpore suo non sit jam in terra, tamen est etiam
       conjunctus et præsens corpori nostro secundum carnem, sed non loco;
       sicut caput uniuscujusque hominis non est eo loco quo pedes, et
       tamen est illis suo modo unitum. Proinde adest Christus ecclesiæ
       suæ non tantum secundum divinam sed etiam secundum humanam naturam,
       verum spiritualiter sicut caput membris, quibus unitum est et quæ
       vivificat.: [1392]1
     * Illa imago aliud nihil est, quam eximia, quædam qualitas et
       excellentia, qua homo Deum speciatim refert: hæc autem est potestas
       et dominium, quod Deus homini dedit in omnia a se creata. . . . .
       Hoc enim dominio Deum proprie refert, estque quasi visibilis Deus
       in terra super omnes Dei creaturas constitutus.: [1393]1
     * Ille (Pelagius) Dei gratiam non appellat nisi naturam, qua libero
       arbitrio conditi sumus.: [1394]1
     * Imaginem in natura, similitudinem in probitate et justitia sitam
       esse.: [1395]1
     * Imago Dei est "integra naturæ humanæ præstantia, quæ refulsit in
       Adam ante defectionem postea sic vitiata et prope deleta, ut nihil
       ex ruina nisi confusum, mutilum, labeque infectum supersit.":
       [1396]1
     * Imago Dei fuit partim inamissibilis, partim amissibilis;
       inamissibilis, quæ post lapsum integra permansit, veluti animæ
       substantia spiritualis, immortalis, rationalis, cum potentiis
       intelligendi et libere volendi; amissibilis, quæ partim plane
       periit, partim corrupta est, manentibus tantum exiguis ejusdem
       reliquiis; veluti in intellectu insignis sapientia, in voluntate et
       affectibus vera justitia et sanctitas, in corpore immortalitas,
       sanitas, f'ortitudo, pulchritudo, dominium in animalia, copia
       omnium bonorum et jus utendi creaturis.: [1397]1
     * Imago Dei spectavit, (1.) Animæ essentiam et conditionem
       spiritualem, intelligentem et volentem, quod contra Lutheranos
       pertendimus, quum post lapsum etiam rudera imaginis Dei adsint.
       (2.) Eluxit in accidentali animæ perfectione, mentis lumine,
       voluntatis sanctitate, sensuum et affectuum harmonia atque ad bonum
       promptitudine; (3.) conspicua fuit in dominio in omnia animalia.:
       [1398]1
     * Imputatio justitiæ Christi et culpæ Adami pari passu ambulant, et
       vel utraque ruit, vel utraque agnosci debet.: [1399]1
     * Imputationis Mediatæ a "ficulneum nuditatis indecentis
       tegumentum,": [1400]1
     * In eo errant quam maxime, quod velint redemtionis pretium per omnia
       æquivalens esse debere miseriæ illi, e qua redemtio fit,
       redemtionis pretium enim constitui solet pro libera æstimatione
       illius, qui captivum detinet, non autem pro captivi merito. Ita
       pretium, quod Christus persolvit, juxta Dei patris æstimationem
       persolutum est.: [1401]1
     * In propitiatore hæc duo concurrunt: Primum, oportet exstare verbum
       Dei, ex quo certo sciamus, quod Deus velit misereri et exaudire
       invocantes per hunc propitiatorem. Talis exstat de Christo
       promissio. . . . . Alterum est in propitiatore, quod merita ipsius
       proposita sunt, ut, quæ pro aliis satisfacerent, quæ aliis donentur
       imputatione divina, ut per ea, tanquam propriis meritis justi
       reputentur, ut si quis amicus pro amico solvit æs alienum, debitor
       alieno merito tanquam proprio liberatur. Ita Christi merita nobis
       donantur, ut justi reputemur fiducia meritorum Christi, cum in eum
       credimus, tanquam propria merita haberemus.: [1402]1
     * Infallibilitas [rei] non oriatur ex vehementia motionis divinæ, sed
       ex prævisione aptitudinis ipsius voluntatis.: [1403]1
     * Innatam arbitrii humani libertatem (i.e: [1404]1
     * Integritas illa, cum qua primus homo conditus fuit et sine qua post
       ejus lapsum homines omnes nascuntur, non fuit naturalis ejus
       conditio, sed supernaturalis evectio. . . . .: [1405]1
     * Interna vocatio . . . . quæ fit per Spiritum Dei, . . . . non est
       virtus Spiritus seorsim operans a verbo, sed per verbum, et verbo
       semper inest . . . . . Non dicimus duas esse (verbi et Spiritus)
       actiones specie distinctas: sed unam eandemque actionem; quoniam
       verbum est Spiritus, hoc est, Spiritus verbo inest.: [1406]1
     * Ipsa substantia animæ humanæ quædam theia: [1407]1
     * Ipsi gratiæ, beneficiorum quæ nobis præstare non desinit, augmenta
       reputamus.: [1408]1
     * Iste [Manes] duo principia inter se diversa atque adversa, eademque
       æterna et coæterna, hoc est semper fuisse, composuit: duasque
       naturas atque substantias, boni scilicet et mali, sequens alios
       antiquos hæreticos, opinatus est.: [1409]1
     * Ita Christus vice electorum obedientia mortis suæ Deo patri
       satisfecit, ut in censum tamen vicariæ justitiæ et obedientiæ
       illius, universa ejus, quam per totius vitæ suæ curriculum legi
       . . . . sive agendo sive patiendo præstitit, obedientia vocari
       debeat. . . . . Rotundo asserit ore Spiritus Dei, Christum
       sanctissima vita legi et justitiæ divinæ pro nobis satisfecisse, et
       pretium illud, quo empti sumus Deo, non in passionibus duntaxat,
       sed tota ejus vita legi conformata collocat.: [1410]1
     * Itaque non tantum ut Deus, verum etiam ut homo, omnia novit, omnia
       potest, omnibus creaturis præsens est, et omnia, quæ in coelis, in
       terris et sub terra sunt, sub pedibus suis et in manu sua habet.:
       [1411]1
     * Item, quod D. Lutherus scripsit, hominis voluntatem in conversione
       pure passive se habere: id recte et dextere est accipiendum,
       videlicet respectu divinæ gratiæ in accendendis novis motibus, hoc
       est, de eo intelligi oportet, quando Spiritus Dei per verbum
       auditum, aut per usum sacramentorum hominis voluntatem aggreditur,
       et conversionem atque regenerationem in homine operatur. Postquam
       enim Spiritus Sanctus hoc ipsum jam operatus est atque effecit,
       hominisque voluntatem sola sua divina virtute et operatione
       immutavit atque renovavit: tunc revera hominis nova illa voluntas
       instrumentum est et organon Dei Spiritus Sancti, ut ea non modo
       gratiam apprehendat, verum etiam in operibus sequentibus Spiritui
       Sancto cooperetur.: [1412]1
     * Iterum quærendum est, peccatum voluntatis an necessitatis est? Si
       necessitatis est, peccatum non est; si voluntatis, vitari potest.
       Iterum quærendum est, utrumne debeat homo sine peccato esse? Procul
       dubio debet. Si debet potest; si non potest, ergo non debet. Et si
       non debet homo esse sine peccato, debet ergo cum peccato esse, et
       jam peccatum non erit, si illud deberi constiterit.: [1413]1
     * Jesus Christus, cum essemus inimici, propter nimiam caritatem qua
       dilexit nos, sua sanctissima passione in ligno crucis nobis
       justificationem meruit, et pro nobis Deo patri satisfecit.: [1414]1
     * Judicium: [1415]1
     * Justa idea, quam centurio habet de omnipotentia Dei et Jesu Christi
       in sanandis corporibus solo motu suæ voluntatis, est imago ideæ,
       quæ haberi debet de omnipotentia suæ gratiæ in sanandis animabus a
       cupiditate. : [1416]1
     * Justitiæ rectoris pars est servare leges etiam positivas et a se
       latas, quod verum esse tam in universitate libera quam in rege
       summo probant jurisconsulti: cui illud est consequens, ut rectori
       relaxare legem non liceat, nisi causa aliqua accedat, si non
       necessaria, certe sufficiens: quæ itidem recepta est a
       jurisconsultis sententia. Ratio utriusque est, quod actus ferendi
       aut relaxandi legem non sit actus absoluti dominii, sed actus
       imperii, qui tendere debeat ad boni ordinis conversationem.:
       [1417]1
     * Justitia illa, quæ coram Deo fidei, aut credentibus, ex mera gratia
       imputatur, est obedientia, passio et resurrectio Christi, quibus
       ille legi nostra causa satisfecit, et peccata nostra expiavit. Cum
       enim Christus non tantum homo, verum Deus et homo sit, in una
       persona indivisa, tam non fuit legi subjectus, quam non fuit
       passioni et morti (ratione suæ personæ), obnoxius, quia Dominus
       legis erat. Eam ob causam ipsius obedientia (non ea tantum, qua
       patri paruit in tota sua passione et morte, verum etiam, qua nostra
       causa sponte sese legi subjecit, eamque obedientia illa sua
       implevit) nobis ad justitiam imputatur, ita, ut Deus propter totam
       obedientiam (quam Christus agendo et patiendo, in vita et morte
       sua, nostra causa Patri suo coelesti præstitit) peccata nobis
       remittat, pro bonis et justis nos reputet, et salute æterna donet.:

     * Liberi arbitrii cum gratiæ donis, divina præscientia, providentia,
       prædestinatione et reprobatione concordia," says, "Una et eadem est
       natura gratiæ sufficientis et efficacis; a nostro arbitrio et
       libero consensu pendet, ut efficax fiat nobis consentientibus, aut
       inefficax, nobis dissentientibus. Dens infallibiliter operatur ope
       scientiæ mediæ: [1419]1
     * Licet desperatio et fremitus conjungantur cum poenis damnatorum;
       non sequitur Christum ferendo poenas peccato debitas debuisse illis
       exponi, quia non sunt de essentia poenæ, prout a judice infligitur,
       vel a sponsore sanctissimo fertur; sed habent rationem adjuncti,
       quod eam comitatur, propter vitium subjecti patientis.: [1420]1

     * Lubentia Rationalis: [1422]1
     * Manifestum itaque in Adam omnes peccasse quasi in massa: ipse enim

     * Minime docemus naturam in Christo divinam passam esse.: [1426]1
     * Mors Christi non est solum satisfactio pro culpa, sed etiam pro
       æterna morte.: [1427]1
     * Nam spatia locorum tolle corporibus, nusquam erunt, et quia nusquam
       erunt, nec erunt. Tolle ipsa corpora qualitatibus corporum, non
       erit ubi sint, et ideo necesse est ut non sint: [1428]1
     * Nam," he adds, "si duo sint, qui eandem concionatorem audiant, et
       eandem interius inspirationem habeant, et unus credat, alter non
       credat, nonne dicere poterit is qui crediderit, se discerni ab
       infideli, per liberum arbitrium quia ipse inspirationem acceperit,
       quam alter rejecit? nonne gloriari poterit contra infidelem, quod
       ipse Dei gratiæ coöperatus sit, quam ille contempsit? et tamen
       Apostolus hoc omnino prohibet?: [1429]1

     * Natura divina est essentia divina, qua Christus Patri et Spiritui
       Sancto coessentialis est. Natura humana est essentia seu substantia
       humana, qua Christus nobis hominibus coessentialis est.: [1432]1

       voluntatis: non ego, sed ratio concludit; nihil igitur in eis esse
       peccati.: [1437]1
     * Nihil iniquitatis in eo est quod Deus, cujus est summa potestas ad
       omnia per se non injusta, nulli ipse legi obnoxius, cruciatibus et
       morte Christi uti voluit, ad statuendum exemplum grave adversus

     * Non Ens: [1441]1
     * Non ergo, ut vulgo putant, satisfecit [Christus] patiendo omnes
       poenas, quas peccatis nostris merueramus. Nam primo, istud ad
       sacrificii rationem non pertinet. . . . . Sacrificia enim non sunt
       solutiones debitorum. . . . . Secundo, Christus non est passus
       mortem æternam quæ erat poena peccato debita, nam paucis tantum
       horis in cruce prependit, et tertia die resurrexit ex mortuis. Imo
       etiamsi mortem æternam pertulisset, non videtur satisfacere
       potuisse pro omnibus totius mundi peccatis. Hæc enim fuisset tantum
       una mors, quæ omnibus mortibus, quas singuli pro suis peccatis
       meruerant, non æquivaluisset.: [1442]1
     * Non feram, at Spiritus meus, per prophetas admonens homines, ab his

     * Non fuisse quoddam donum, quod ab extra accederet, separatum a
       natura hominis. Sed fuisse vere naturalem, ita ut natura Adæ esset,
       diligere Deum, credere Deo, agnoscere Deum, etc. Hæc tam naturalia
       fuere in Adamo, quam naturale est, quod oculi lumen recipiunt.:
       [1444]1
     * Non in Christo sunt duæ separatæ personæ, sed unica tantum est
       persona. Ubicunque ea est, ibi est unica tantum et indivisa
       persona. Et ubicunque recte dixeris: hic est Deus, ibi fateri
       oportet, et dicere, ergo etiam Christus homo adest.: [1445]1
     * Non lege atque doctrina insonante forinsecus, sed interna et

     * Non magis differt status hominis post lapsum Adæ a statu ejusdem in
       puris naturalibus, quam differat spoliatus a nudo, neque deterior
       est humana natura, si culpam originalem detrahas, neque magis
       ignorantia et infirmitate laborat, quam esset et laboraret in puris
       naturalibus condita. Proinde corruptio naturæ non ex alicujus doni
       naturalis carentia, neque ex alicujus malæ qualitatis accessu, sed
       ex sola doni supernaturalis ob Adæ peccatum amissione profluxit.:

       passionum, profectarum; id quod sæpenumero sine expresso
       intellectus judicio contingit.: [1451]1
     * Non sublatus est quidem homini intellectus, non erepta ei voluntas,

       sunt immutata et inminuta in homine, ut non possint amplius, quod
       potuerunt ante lapsum. Intellectus enim obscuratus est: voluntas
       vero ex libera, facta est voluntas serva. Nam servit peccato, non
       nolens, sed volens. Etenim voluntas, non noluntas dicitur. . . . .:

       rei, non pleni nascimur, et ut sine virtute, ita et sine vitio
       procreamur: atque ante actionem propriæ voluntatis, id solum in
       homine est, quod Deus condidit.: [1458]1
     * Omne esse bonum est.: [1459]1
     * Omne peccatum est injustitia, et originale peccatum est absolute
       peccatum, unde sequitur quod est injustitia. Item si Deus non
       damnat nisi propter injustitiam; damnat autem aliquem propter
       originale peccatum, ergo non est aliud originale peccatum quam
       injustitia. Quod si ita est, originale peccatum non est aliud quam
       injustitia, i.e.: [1460]1
     * Omne quod est, in quantum aliqua substantia est, et bonum [est]:
       [1461]1
     * Omnes homines in peccato concipiuntur . . . . inepti ad omne bonum
       salutare . . . . et absque Spiritus Sancti regenerantis gratia, ad
       Deum redire, naturam depravatam corrigere, vel ad ejus correctionem
       se disponere nec volunt, nec possunt.: [1462]1
     * Omnes homines in peccato concipiuntur, et filii iræ nascuntur,
       inepti ad omne bonum salutare, propensi ad malum, in peccatis
       mortui, et peccati servi; et absque Spiritus Sancti regenerantis
       gratia, ad Deum redire, naturam depravatam corrigere, vel ad ejus
       correctionem se disponere nec volunt, nec possunt.: [1463]1
     * Omnino hic Deum considerandum, ut rectorem. Nam poenas infligere,
       aut a poenis aliquem liberare, quam punire possis, quod justificare
       vocat Scriptura, non est nisi rectoris qua talis primo et per se:
       ut, puta, in familia patris; in republica regis, in universo Dei.:
       [1464]1
     * Opera quæ fiunt ante gratiam Christi, et Spiritus ejus afflatum,
       cum ex fide Christi non prodeant minime Deo grata sunt. . . . .
       Immo, cum non sint facta ut Deus illa fieri voluit et præcepit,
       peccati rationem habere non dubitamus.: [1465]1
     * Operatio gratiæ in prima conversione indifferens est et
       resistibilis, ut per eam possit homo converti vel non converti: nec
       sequatur ejus conversio nisi libero assensu ad eam se determinet,
       et converti velit.: [1466]1
     * Operationes gratiæ immediatas et supernaturales jam olim nonnulli
       recte monuerunt, nec diserte promissas esse in libris sacris nec
       necessarias, quum, quæ ad animum emendandum valeant, omnia legibus
       naturæ a Deo optime efficiantur, nec denique ita conspicuas ut
       cognosci certo et intelligi possint. Accedit, quod libertatem et
       studium hominum impediunt, mysticorum somnia fovent et Deum ipsum
       auctorem arguunt peccatorum ab hominibus non emendatis
       commissorum. . . . . Omnis igitur de gratia disputatio rectius ad
       doctrinam de providentia Dei singulari et concursu refertur.:
       [1467]1
     * Originale peccatum concupiscentia dicitur.: [1468]1
     * Poena omnis propositum habet bonum commune, ordinis nimirum
       conservationem et exemplum.: [1469]1
     * Poena quam peccatum Adami in nos accersit, vel est privativa, vel
       positiva. Prior est carentia et privatio justitiæ originalis;
       posterior est mors tum temporalis, tum æterna, et in genere mala
       omnia, quæ peccatoribus immittuntur. Etsi secunda necessario
       sequitur primam ex natura rei, nisi intercedat Dei misericordia,
       non debet tamen cum ea confundi. Quoad primam dicimus Adami
       peccatum nobis imputari immediate ad poenam privativam, quia est
       causa privationis justitiæ originalis, et sic corruptionem
       antecedere debet saltem ordine naturæ; sed quoad posteriorem potest
       dici imputari mediate quoad poenam positivam, quia isti poenæ
       obnoxii non sumus, nisi postquam nati et corrupti sumus.: [1470]1
     * Palæotherium: [1471]1
     * Pater neminem trahere vult, absque mediis, sed utitur tanquam
       ordinariis mediis et instrumentis, verbo suo et sacramentis.:
       [1472]1
     * Peccatum hæreditarium tam profunda et tetra est corruptio naturæ,
       ut nullius hominis ratione intelligi possit, sed ex Scripturæ
       patefactione agnoscenda, et credenda sit.: [1473]1
     * Peccatum in Adamo actuale et personale in nobis originaliter
       dicitur. Solus enim ipse actuali voluntate illud commisit, nobis
       vero communicatur per generationem eo modo, quo communicari potest
       id, quod transiit, nimirum per imputationem. Omnibus enim
       imputatur, qui ex Adamo nascuntur, quoniam omnes in lumbis Adami
       existentes in eo et per eum peccavimus, cum ipse peccavit.: [1474]1
     * Peccatum originale aliud intelligere nequeo, nisi ipsam--factam per
       inobedientiam Adæ justitiæ debitæ nuditatem.: [1475]1
     * Peccatum originale nec habent (Remonstrantes) pro peccato proprie
       dicto . . . . nec pro malo, quod per modum proprie dictæ poenæ ab
       Adamo in posteros dimanet, sed pro malo infirmitate.: [1476]1
     * Peccatum originis . . . est vitium et depravatio naturæ cujuslibet
       hominis ex Adamo naturaliter propagati, qua fit ut ab originali
       justitia quam longissime distet; ad malum sua natura propendeat et
       caro semper adversus spiritum concupiscat, unde in unoquoque
       nascentium iram Dei atque damnationem meretur.: [1477]1
     * Peccatum originis est corruptio totius naturæ et vitium
       hæreditarium, quo et ipsi infantes in matris utero polluti sunt:
       quodque veluti noxia quædam radix genus omne peccatorum in homine
       producit, estque tam foedum atque execrabile coram Deo, ut ad
       universi generis humani condemnationem sufficiat.: [1478]1
     * Peccavit unus, omnes ad poenam trahuntur, neque id modo, sed ex
       unius vitio, contagionem omnes contrahunt.: [1479]1
     * Per imaginem ejus, qui creavit ipsum: [1480]1
     * Plenissima (caritas) quæ jam non possit augeri, quamdiu hic homo
       vivit, est in nemine; quamdiu autem augeri potest, profecto illud,
       quod minus est quam debet, ex vitio est.: [1481]1
     * Posuit ergo et manum suam super caput vituli: hoc est peccata
       generis humani imposuit super caput suum. Ipse est enim caput
       corporis ecclesiæ suæ.: [1482]1
     * Prædestinati: [1483]1
     * Prædestinatio, seu æterna Dei electio, tantum ad bonos et dilectos
       filios Dei pertinet; et hæc est causa ipsorum salutis. Etenim eorum
       salutem procurat, et ea, quæ ad ipsam pertinent, disponit. Super
       hanc Dei prædestinationem salus nostra ita fundata est, ut
       inferorum portæ eam evertere nequeant.: [1484]1
     * Prima satisfactio et præstantissima illa est, qua pro scelerum
       nostrorum ratione, etiam si Deus summo jure nobiscum velit agere,
       quidquid a nobis debeatur, cumulate persolutum est. Hæc vero
       ejusmodi esse dicitur, quæ nobis Deum propitium et placatum
       reddidit, eamque uni Christo domino acceptam ferimus, qui in cruce,
       pretio pro peccatis nostris soluto, plenissime Deo satisfecit.:
       [1485]1
     * Proprietates divinæ naturæ sunt: esse omnipotentem, æternam,
       infinitam, et secundum naturæ naturalisque suæ essentiæ
       proprietatem, per se, ubique presentem esse, omnis novices, etc.
       Hæc omnia neque sunt neque unquam fiunt humanæ naturæ
       proprietates.: [1486]1
     * Propter id quod jam dictum est, nempe quod hoc potestatem
       complectitur plenissimam et absolutissimam in verum Dei populum,
       hinc necessario sequitur, eodem divino imperio contineri potestatem
       et dominationem in omnes angelos et spiritus tam malos, quam
       bonos.: [1487]1
     * Propterea quod justitiæ et veritati Dei nullo alio pacto pro
       nostris peccatis potuit satisfieri, quam ipsa morte filii Dei.:
       [1488]1
     * Qualis (homo Adam) factus est a lapsu, tales sunt omnes, qui ex
       ipso prognati sunt, peccato inquam, morti, variisque obnoxii
       calamitatibus. Peccatum autem intelligimus esse nativam illam
       hominis corruptionem ex primis illis nostris parentibus in nos
       omnes derivatam vel propagatam, qua concupiscentiis pravis immersi
       et a bono aversi, ad omne vero malum propensi, pleni omni nequitia,
       diffidentia, contemptu et odio Dei, nihil boni ex nobis ipsis
       facere, imo ne cogitare quidem possumus.: [1489]1
     * Qualis est Dei dextra, taliter quoque sessio ad dextram Dei
       intelligenda. Jam vero dextra Dei non est locus aliquis corporeus,
       circumscriptus, limitatus, definitus, sed est infinita Dei potestas
       ac præsentissima ejus majestas in coelo et terra, est
       præsentissiinum illud dominium, quo Deus omnia conservat et
       gubernat.: [1490]1
     * Quamvis renati etiam in hac vita eousque progrediantur, ut bonum
       velint eoque delectentur, et bene agere atque in pietate proficere
       studeant: tamen hoc ipsum non a nostra voluntate aut a viribus
       nostris proficiscitur, sed Spiritus Sanctus operatur in nobis illud
       velle et perficere.: [1491]1
     * Quando Deus . . . . veram in electis conversionem operatur, non
       tantum evangelium illis externe prædicari curat et mentem eorum per
       Spiritum Sanctum potenter illuminat, . . . . sed ejusdem etiam
       Spiritus regenerantis efficacia ad intima hominis penetrat, cor
       clausum aperit, durum emollit, . . . . voluntati novas qualitates
       infundit, facitque eam ex mortua vivam, ex mala bonam, ex nolente
       volentem.: [1492]1
     * Quando Deus vult animam salvam facere, et eam tangit interiori
       gratiæ suæ manu, nulla voluntas humana ei resistit. -- Dei gratia
       nihil aliud est, quam ejus omnipotens voluntas.: [1493]1
     * Quantum ad bonum et ad virtutes, intellectus hominis, non recte
       judicat de divinis ex semetipso. . . . . Constat vero mentem vel
       intellectum, ducem esse voluntatis, cum autem coecus sit dux,
       claret, quousque et voluntas pertingat. Proinde nullum est ad bonum
       homini arbitrium liberum nondum renato, vires nullæ ad perficiendum
       bonum. . . . . In regeneratione . . . . voluntas non tantum mutatur
       per Spiritum, sed etiam instruitur facultatibus, ut sponte velit et
       possit bonum. . . . . Observandum est -- regeneratos in boni
       electione et operatione, non tantum agere passive, sed active.
       Aguntur enim a Deo, ut agant ipsi, quod agunt.: [1494]1
     * Quantum vero ad bonum et ad virtutes, intellectus hominis, non
       recte judicat de divinis ex semetipso. . . . Constat vero mentem
       vel intellectum ducem esse voluntatis, cum autem coecus sit dux,
       claret quousque et voluntas pertingat. Proinde nullum est ad bonum
       homini arbitrium liberum, nondum renato; vires nullæ ad
       perficiendum bonum. . . . .Niemeyer, p. 481.: [1495]1
     * Quia (Deus) prævidit ac præscivit maximam mundi partem mediis
       salutis locum minime relicturam ac proinde in Christum non
       credituram, ideo Deus de illis tantum salvandis fecit decretum,
       quos actu in Christum credituros prævidit.: [1496]1
     * Quia congruum est, ut dum homo bene utitur sua virtute, Deus
       secundum superexcellentem virtutem excellentius operetur.: [1497]1
     * Quia mors in hominibus poena est, Christus oblatus est moriendo, ut
       morte sua portaret omnium hominum peccata h. e. omnes peccatorum
       poenas exæquaret satisfaciendo.: [1498]1
     * Quid est attrahere nisi prædicare, nisi scripturarum
       consolationibus excitare, increpationibus deterrere, desideranda
       proponere, intentare metuenda, judicium comminari, præmium
       polliceri?: [1499]1
     * Quid tamen istud ejus divinum imperium nominatim complectitur?:
       [1500]1
     * Quidquid a norma justitiæ in Deo dissidet, et cum ea pugnat, habet
       rationem peccati.: [1501]1
     * Quo magis unusquisque, suum utile quærere, hoc est suum esse
       conservare conatur et potest, eo magis virtute præditus est; contra
       quatenus unusquisque suum utile, hoc est suum esse conservare
       negligit, eatenus est impotens.: [1502]1
     * Quod ad animam pertinet, eum ad imaginem et similitudinem suam
       formavit, liberumque ei arbitrium tribuit: omnes præterea motus
       animi atque appetitiones ita in eo temperavit, ut rationis imperio
       nunquam non parerent. Tum originalis justitiæ admirabile donum
       addidit, ac deinde cæteris animantibus præesse voluit.: [1503]1
     * Quod ex damnata Adæ sobole Deus quos visum est eligit, quos vult
       reprobat, sicuti ad fidem exercendam longe aptior est, ita majore
       fructu tractatur.: [1504]1
     * Quod in illis non est justitia, quam debent habere, non hoc fecit
       illorum, voluntas personalis, sicut in Adam, sed egestas naturalis,
       quam ipsa natura accepit ab Adam -- facit natura personas infantium
       peccatrices. Nullam infantibus injustitiam super prædictam
       nuditatem justitiæ.: [1505]1
     * Quod nec carentia justitiæ originalis, nec concupiscentia habeat
       rationem peccati, sive in parvulis, sive adultis, sive ante, sive
       post baptismum. Has enim affectiones non esse vitia, sed naturæ
       conditiones in nobis. Peccatum igitur originis non esse defectum,
       non vitium aliquod non depravationem aliquam, non habitum
       corruptum, non qualitatem vitiosam hærentem in nostra substantia,
       ut quæ sit sine omni vitio et depravatione, sed hoc tantum esse
       peccatum originis, quod actualis transgressio Adæ reatu, tantum et
       poena transmissa et propagata sit ad posteros sine vitio aliquo et
       pravitate hærente in ipsorum substantia: et reatum hunc esse; quod
       propter Adæ peccatum extorres facti sumus regni coelorum, subjecti
       regno mortis et æternæ damnationi, et omnibus humanæ naturæ
       miseriis involuti. Sicut ex servis, qui proprio vitio libertatem
       amiserunt, nascuntur servi: non suo, sed parentum vitio. Et sicut
       filius scorti, sustinet infamiam matris, sine proprio aliquo in se
       hærente vitio.: [1506]1
     * Quod nihil habeat rationem peccati nisi fiat a volente et sciente.:
       [1507]1
     * Quomodo et justitia Christi electis imputatur, non mediate per
       renovationem et obedientiam horum propriam, sed immediate, ad quam
       hæc ipsa propria eorum obedientia demum subsequitur.: [1508]1
     * Quotiam Deus invictus et magnanimis est, magnanimem quidem se
       exhibuit ad correptionem hominis, et probationem omnium. . . . . ;
       per secundum autem hominem alligavit fortem et diripuit ejus vasa
       et evacuavit mortem, vivificans eum hominem, qui fuerit
       mortificatus.: [1509]1
     * Reatus est omnino inseparabilis ab eo, quod natura sua est dignum
       æterna damnatione, qualem esse volunt concupiscentiam adversarii.:
       [1510]1
     * Remonstrantes asserunt necessitatem sive servitutem istam peccati,
       cui homines, per naturæ conditionem subjecti sunt, locum non habere
       sub statu gratiæ. Nam statuunt, vocatis omnibus gratiam
       sufficientem a Deo concedi, ita ut possint a servitute illa
       liberari, et simul manere in iis voluntatis libertatem, ut possint
       eidem servituti mander subjecti, si velint.: [1511]1
     * Residuum quidem est post lapsum in homine lumen aliquod naturæ,
       cujus beneficio ille notitias quasdam de Deo, de rebus naturalibus,
       de discrimine honestorum et turpium retinet, et aliquod virtutis ac
       disciplinæ externæ studium ostendit: sed tantum abest, ut hoc
       naturæ lumine ad salutarem Dei cognitionem pervenire, et ad eum se
       convertere possit, ut ne quidem eo in naturalibus ac civilibus
       recte utatur, quinimo qualecumque id demum sit, id totum variis
       modis contaminet atque in injustitia detineat, quod dum facit,
       coram Deo inexcusabilis redditur.: [1512]1
     * Sacræ literæ hominis non renati cor duro lapidi, qui ad tactum non
       cedat, sed resistat, idem rudi trunco, interdum etiam feræ in
       domitæ comparant, non quod homo post lapsum non amplius sit
       rationalis creatura, aut quod absque auditu et meditatione verbi
       divini ad Deum convertatur, aut quod in rebus externis et civilibus
       nihil boni aut mali intelligere possit, aut libere aliquid agere
       vel omittere queat.: [1513]1
     * Salvator Hominum: [1514]1 [1515]2
     * Salvator hominum.: [1516]1
     * Sanguis anima, quæ sibi inest, expiat.: [1517]1
     * Satisfactio Christi dicitur, qua pro nobis poenas omnes luit
       peccatis nostris debitas, easque perferendo et exhauriendo divinæ
       justitiæ satisfecit. Verum illa sententia nullum habet in Scriptura
       fundamentum. Mors Christi vocatur sacrificium pro peccato; atqui
       sacrificia non sunt solutiones debitorum, neque plenariæ pro
       peccatis satisfactiones; sed illis peractis conceditur gratuita
       peccati remissio. In eo errant quam maxime, quod velint redemtionis
       pretium per omnia æquivalens esse debere miseriæ illi, e qua
       redemtio fit. Redemtionis pretium enim constitui solet pro libera
       æstimatione illius qui captivum detinet, non autem solvi pro
       captivi merito.: [1518]1
     * Sciendum est primo, hominem naturaliter constare ex carne, et
       spiritu, et ideo partim cum bestiis, partim cum angelis communicare
       naturam, et quidem ratione carnis, et communionis cum bestiis,
       habere propensionem quandam ad bonum corporale, et sensibile, in
       quod fertur per sensum et appetitum: ratione spiritus et
       communionis cum angelis, habere propensionem ad bonum spirituale et
       intelligibile, in quod fertur per intelligentiam, et voluntatem. Ex
       his autem diversis, vel contrariis propensionibus existere in uno
       eodemque homine pugnam quandam, et ex ea pugna ingentem bene agendi
       difficultatem, dum una propensio alteram impedit. Sciendum secundo,
       divinam providentiam initio creationis, ut remedium adhiberet huic
       morbo seu languori naturæ humanæ, qui ex conditione materiæ
       oriebatur, addidisse homini donum quoddam insigne, justitiam
       videlicet originalem, qua veluti aureo quodam fræno pars inferior
       parti superiori, et pars superior Deo facile subjecta
       contineretur.: [1519]1
     * Scriptura vero, etsi moralem (quam vocant) suasionem non removet ab
       hoc negotio (quid enim est totum ministerium reconciliationis, quam
       ejusmodi commendatio ac suasio? 2 Cor. v. 18-20: [1520]1
     * Sed demus, in his et similibus exemplis specialibus non posse nos
       exacte causas divinorum consiliorum exquirere vel proponere; non
       tamen ad absolutum aliquod reprobationis decretum erit confugiendum
       sed adhæreamus firmiter pronunciatis istis universalibus. : [1521]1
     * Sed salvis potius et permanentibus naturarum proprietatibus in una
       persona unitæ vel conjunctæ.: [1522]1
     * Si . . . . baptismo atque a gratia nemo prohibetur; quanto magis
       prohiberi non debet infans, qui recens natus nihil peccavit, nisi
       quod secundum Adam carnaliter natus, contagium mortis antiquæ prima
       nativitate contraxit? qui ad remissam peccatorum accipiendam hoc
       ipso facilius accedit, quod illi remittuntur non propria, sed
       aliena peccata.: [1523]1
     * Si Christus mortem æternam non tulit sed temporalem tantum et
       triduanam, non minus tamen solvit quod a nobis debebatur quoad
       infinitatem poenæ. Quia si non fuit infinita quoad durationem, fuit
       tamen talis æquivalenter quoad valorem, propter personæ patientis
       infinitam dignitatem, quia non fuit passio meri hominis, sed veri
       Dei, qui suo sanguine Ecclesiam acquisivit, Act. xx. 28: [1524]1
     * Si Christus non assumpsisset animam ab anima Mariæ, animam humanam
       non redemisset.: [1525]1
     * Si Levi . . . . in lumbis Abrahæ fuisse perhibetur, multo magis
       omnes homines qui in hoc mundo nascuntur et nati sunt, in lumbis
       erant Adæ, cum adhuc esset in Paradiso; et omnes homines cum ipso
       vel in ipso expulsi sunt de Paradiso.: [1526]1
     * Si privationem justitiæ originalis ita velit esse effectum peccati,
       ut non sit etiam ipsa vere proprieque peccatum, Concilio Tridentino
       manifeste repugnat, neque distingui potest a sententia Catharini:
       [1527]1
     * Si quæratur causa maledictionis, quæ incumbit omnibus posteris Adæ,
       dicitur esse alienum peccatum, et cujusque proprium.: [1528]1
     * Si quis dixerit hominem suis operibus, quæ vel per humanæ naturæ
       vires, vel per legis doctrinam fiant, absque divina per Jesum
       Christum gratia posse justificari (become holy) coram Deo; anathema
       sit.: [1529]1
     * Si quis dixerit, ad hoc solum gratiam per Jesum Christum dari, ut
       facilius homo justi vivere, ac vitam æternam promereni possit;
       quasi per liberum arbitrium sine gratia utrumque, sed ægre tamen,
       et difficiliter possit; anathema sit.: [1530]1
     * Si quis dixerit, liberum hominis arbitrium a Deo motum, et
       excitatum nihil cooperari assentiendo Deo excitanti atque vocanti,
       quo ad obtinendam justificationis gratiam se disponat, ac præparet,
       neque posse dissentire, si velit, sed velut inanime quoddam nihil
       omnino agere, mereque passive se habere, anathema sit.: [1531]1
     * Si quis dixerit, liberum hominis arbitrium a Deo motum, et
       excitatum nihil cooperari assentiendo Deo excitanti, atque vocanti,
       quo ad obtinendam justificationis gratiam se disponat, ac præparet;
       neque posse dissentire si velit; sed velut inanime quoddam nihil
       omnino agere, mereque passive se habere; anathema sit.: [1532]1
     * Si quis dixerit, sine prævenienti Spiritus Sancti inspiratione,
       atque ejus adjutorio, hominem credere, sperare, diligere aut
       poenitere posse, sicut oportet, ut ei justificationis
       (regeneration) gratia conferatur; anathema sit.: [1533]1
     * Si quis liberum homninis arbitrium [by which is meant, potestas ad
       utramque partem: [1534]1
     * Siccine ergo electi non possunt excidere gratia Dei? Immo vero
       possunt; sed ita, ut per veram poenitentiam et fidem sese rursus
       virtute Spiritus Sancti ad Deum convertant et ad vitam redeant.
       Nisi enim redirent, non essent in numero electorum.: [1535]1
     * Sicuti sub lege peccator, ut reatu solveretur, victimam
       substituebat suo loco: ita Christus maledictionem peccatis nostris
       debitam in se suscepit, ut ea coram Deo expiaret. Hoc beneficium
       sophistæ in suis scholis, quantum possunt, obscurant.: [1536]1
     * Simpliciter credimus, quod tota persona (Christi), Deus et homo,
       post sepulturam, ad inferos descendent, Satanam devicerit,
       potestatem inferorum everterit, et Diabolo omnem vim et potentiam
       eripuerit. Quomodo vero Christus id effecerit, non est ut argutis
       et sublimibus imaginationibus scrutemur.: [1537]1
     * Simpliciter quippe et categorice decrevit Deus hunc, ilium, istum
       hominem salvare, quia perseverantem ipsius in Christum fidem certo
       prævidit.: [1538]1
     * Singuli nascuntur originali peccato infecti . . . et a Deo damnati,
       non propter alienum delictum duntaxat, sed propter improbitatem,
       quæ intra eos est.: [1539]1
     * Sufficiens vocatio, quando per coöperationem liberi arbitrii
       sortitur suum effectum, vocatur efficax.: [1540]1 [1541]2
     * Tantum valet omne creatum oblatum, pro quanto Deus acceptat.:
       [1542]1
     * Tenendum, passionem hanc Christi, licet poenarum nostrarum vim
       omnem quoad intensionem quasi exhauserit, non tamen æternitatem
       earum tulisse: temporis enim infinitatem, infinita personæ dignitas
       recompensavit.: [1543]1
     * Traxit carnem nostram in plenitudinem Deitatis: [1544]1
     * Tria sunt quæ hominem reum constitunut coram Deo, (1.) Culpa
       promanans ex eo quod omnes peccavimus in proto lapso (Rom. v. 12:
       [1545]1
     * Ubiquitas absoluta figmentum Sathanæ: [1546]1
     * Unde patet, conformitatem, quæ in substantia animæ reperitur aut
       corporis, ad imaginem Dei, stylo biblico descriptam, non pertinere,
       quia substantia animæ aut corporis per lapsum non est perdita, nec
       per renovationem restauratur.: [1547]1
     * Universalia: [1548]1 [1549]2
     * Ut Foederis gratiæ natura penitius perspecta sit, duo imprimis
       distincte consideranda sunt. (1.) Pactum, quod inter Deum Patrem et
       mediatorem Christum intercedit. (2.) Testamentaria illa dispositio,
       qua Deus electis salutem æternam, et omnia eo pertinentia,
       immutabili foedere addicit. Prior conventio Dei cum mediatore est:
       posterior Dei cum electis. Hæc illam supponit, et in illa
       fundatur.: [1550]1
     * Ut efficacia proveniat non tam ex vehementia persuasionis, quam ex
       dispositione voluntatis, quam Deus prævidet. Nimirum cum Deus ita
       proponit aliquid interna persuasione, ut videt voluntatem aptam
       esse ad consentiendum.: [1551]1
     * Ut statuatur gratia habere ex se sufficientem vim, ad producendum
       consensum in voluntate, sed, quia vis illa partialis est, non posse
       exire in actum sine coöperante liberæ voluntatis humanæ, ac
       proinde, ut effectum habeat, pendere a libera voluntate.: [1552]1
     * Ut super altare in eo expietis pro animabus vestris.: [1553]1
     * Ut, qui per peccata a Deo aversi erant, per ejus excitantem atque
       adjuvantem gratiam ad convertendum se ad suam ipsorum
       justificationem eidem gratia libere assentiendo, et cooperando,
       disponantur: ita ut tangente Deo cor hominis per Spiritus Sancti
       illuminationem, neque homo ipse nihil omnino agat, inspirationem
       illam recipiens, quippe qui illam et abjicere potest, neque tamen
       sine gratia Dei movere se ad justitiam coram illo libera sua
       voluntate possit.: [1554]1
     * Verbum Dei, qua tale, non potest fingi sine divina virtute aut sine
       Spiritu Sancto, qui a verbo suo inseparabilis est. Nam si a verbo
       Dei separetur Spiritus Sanctus, non esset id Dei verbum vel verbum
       Spiritus, sed esset verbum humanum.: [1555]1
     * Vere tulit poenas quas damnati tulissemus, non quidam tamdiu, non
       omnes, non in eo loco, non cum illis effectis; sed tamen sensit
       justam Dei iram.: [1556]1
     * Via divinitus proposita et patefacta perveniendi ad immortalitatem,
       seu æternam vitam: [1557]1
     * Vitium itaque est, quo ad peccandum proni efficimur, hoc est
       inclinamur ad consentiendum ei, quod non convenit, ut illud
       scilicet faciamus aut dimittamus. Hunc vero consensum proprie
       peccatum nominamus, hoc est culpam animæ, qua damnationem meretur.:
       [1558]1
     * Vocatio est actus gratiæ applicatricis Spiritus Sancti, quo is
       benignissimam Dei erga universum genus humanum lapsum voluntatem
       per externam Verbi prædicationem, in se semper sufficientem ac
       efficacem, manifestat, et bona per Redemtoris meritum parta,
       omnibus in universum hominibus offert, ea seria intentione, ut
       omnes per Christum salvi fiant et æterna vita donentur.: [1559]1
     * Volens namque Deus rationabilem creaturam voluntarii boni munere et
       liberi arbitrii potestate donare, utriusque partis possibilitatem
       homini inserendo proprium ejus fecit, esse quod velit; ut boni ac
       mali capax, natural iter utrumque posset, et ad alterumque
       voluntatem deflecteret.: [1560]1
     * Vult (Socinus) partem omnem offensam esse poenæ creditorem: atque
       in ea tale habere jus, quale alii creditores in rebus sibi debitis,
       quod jus sæpe etiam dominii voce appellat: ideoque sæpissime
       repitit Deum hic spectandum, ut partem offensam, ut creditorem, ut
       dominum tria hæc ponens tanquam tantundem valentia. Hic error
       Socini . . . . per totam ipsius tractationem diffusus . . . .

     * "Der Mittelpunkt," says Schwarz, "christlicher Wahrheit, der
       christologische Kern der ganzen Dogmatik ist die
       Göschel-Dorner'sche monströse Vorstellung von der Allpersönlichkeit
       Christi, die ihm als dem Urmenschen zukommt. Es ist die
       Zusammenfassung des ganzen gegliederten Systems der natürlichen
       Gaben der Menschheit.": [1861]1
     * Apriorische Speculationen: [1862]1
     * Behält man die Verdammnisswürdigkeit unserer Schuld recht im Auge
       und lässt man ohne Deuteln die drel grossen von der Schrift
       bezeugten Heilswahrheiten stehen: 1. dass Gott den der von keiner
       Sünde wüsste für uns zur Sünde gemacht d. i. ihm unsere Sünden
       imputirt hat; 2. dass Christus der Schuldlose, aber mit unserer
       Schuld Beladene für uns ein Fluch geworden d. i. den Blitz des
       Zorns, der uns treffen sollte, für uns erlitten, oder, wie die
       Schrift such sagt, dass Gott an seinem Sohne, der unser Fleisch und
       Blut angenommen und sich uns zum Sündopfer, zur Sündenühne begeben,
       das Gericht über die Sünde vollzogen; 3. dass uns nun im Glauben
       seine Gerechtigkeit ebenso zugerechnet wird, um vor Gott bestehen
       zu können, wie er sich hat unsere Sünden zurechnen lassen, um sie
       zu büssen --: so ist es auch, so lange diese Vordersätze
       ungeschmälert bleiben, sonnenklar, das er stellvertretend: [1863]1
     * Das ist Gottes Bild, das eben also wie Gott gesinnet ist und sich
       immer nach ihm ahmet.: [1864]1
     * Der Begriff der poena vicaria: [1865]1
     * Der Mensch an sich ist das Erkennen der Erde in Seinem ewigen Seyn
       und in seinem immer wechselnden Werden: oder der Geist, der nach
       Art und Weise unserer Erde zum Selbstbewusstseyn sich gestaltet.:

       eine ideale; . . . . eine Präexistenz . . . . vermöge welcher
       Mensch und Menschheit nicht blos ein fernzukünftiges Object
       göttlicher Voraussicht, sondern ein gegenwärtiges Object göttlicher
       Anschauung sind im Spiegel der Weisheit. . . . . Nicht bloss
       Philosophie und falchberühmte Gnosis, sondern auch die Schrift
       weiss und spricht von einer göttlichen Idealwelt, zu welcher sich
       die Zeitwelt wie die geschichtliche Verwirklichung eines ewigen
       Grundrisses verhält.: [1875]1
     * Für spätere Sünden der Christen gilt das Opfer Christi nicht,
       sondern es geht dem Sünder nur einmal, bei der Taufe, zu Gute.:

     * Schleiermacher steht in seiner Ontologie und Kosmologie, in Dem,
       was er über das Verhältniss Gottes zur Welt in seiner Dialektik
       feststellt, ganz und gar auf dem Boden einer einheitlichen und
       zusammenhängenden Weltanschauung. Ebenso in der Lehre von der
       Schöpfung und Erhaltung der Welt, wie sie die Dogmatik ausführt.
       Gott und die Welt sind untrennbare Correlata; das Verhältniss
       Gottes zur Welt ist ein nothwendiges, stetiges, zusammenhängendes.
       Für ausserordentliche Actionen, für ein vereinzeltes Handeln Gottes
       auf die Welt ausserhalb des Naturgesetzes oder gegen dasselbe ist
       nirgends ein Ort. . . . . Aber -- es ist zuzugeben, -- diese die
       philosophische Grundanschauung bildende Immanenz wird von dem
       Theologen Schleiermacher nicht streng innegehalten, das aus der
       Ontologie und Kosmologie verbannte Wunder dringt durch die
       Christologie wieder ein. Die Person Christi in ihrer
       religiössittlichen Absolutheit ist ein Wunder, eine Ausnahme vom
       Naturgesetz, sie stehet einzig da. Ihr Eintreten in die Menschheit
       erfodert trotz aller Anschliessungen nach rückwärtz wie nach
       vorwärtz einen besondern göttlichen Anstoss, sie ist aus der
       geschichtlichen Entwickelung nicht hervorgegangen und nicht zu
       begreifen. Und dieser übernaturliche Anstoss ist es, welcher, so
       sehr er auch wieder in die Natürlichkeit einlenkt, doch mit dem
       religiös-moralischen Wunder auch die Möglichkeit der damit
       zusammenhängenden physischen Wunder offen lässt und so den ganzen
       Weltzusammenhang durchbricht.: [1893]1

     * Schuldbrief: [1897]1
     * Sendbrief: [1898]1
     * Seyn: [1899]1
     * So ist nun hier so viel gesagt, dass der Mensch am Anfang
       geschaffen ist ein Bild, das Gott ähnlich war, voll Weisheit,
       Tugend, Liebe and kurzum gleich wie Gott, also dass er voll Gottes
       war.: [1900]1

     * Vergieb uns unsere Schulden: [1909]1
     * Vermittelungstheologie: [1910]1
     * Wie der Mensch das Haupt und die Krone der natürlichen Schöpfung
       sei, so sei auch die Menscheit als die auseinandergetretene
       Vielheit eines höhern Ganzen, einer höhern Idee, zu betrachten,
       nämlich Christi. Und wie die Natur sich nicht blos in der Idee
       eines Menschen zur Einheit versammle, sondern im wirklichen
       Menschen, so fasse sich auch die Menschheit nicht zusammen in einer
       blossen Idee, einem idealen Christus, sondern in dem wirklichen
       Gottmenschen, der ihre Totalität persönlich darstelle, und aller
       einzelnen Individualitäten Urbilder oder ideale Persönlichkeiten in
       sich versammle. Und wenn die erste Zusammenfassung zerstreuter
       Momente in Adam, wenn auch selbst noch ein Naturwesen, doch eine
       unendlich höhere Gestalt dargestellt habe, als jedes der einzelnen
       Naturwesen, so stehe auch der zweite Adam, obwohl in sich eine
       Zusammenfassung der Menschheit und selbst noch ein Mensch, doch als
       eine unendlich höhere Gestalt da, denn alle einzelnen Darstellungen
       unserer Gattung. Sei Adam das Haupt der natürlichen Schöpfung
       gewesen, als solches aber bereits hinüberreichend mit seinem Wesen
       in das Reich des Geistes und hinübergreifend über die natürliche
       Welt, so sei Christus das Haupt der geistigen Schöpfung, als
       solches aber schon hinüberweisend von der Menschheit auf eine

       ausfindig machen lassen, welches die Schuld zu übernehmen, die
       Strafe zu tragen und alsdann die dadurch erworbene Schuldfreiheit
