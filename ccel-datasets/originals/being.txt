THE PREFACE.

   THERE being already published many and good books to prove the Being
   and Attributes of God, I have chosen to contract what was requisite for
   me to say upon this subject, into as narrow a compass, and to express
   what I had to offer, in as few words as I could with perspicuity. For
   which reason I have also confined myself to one only method or
   continued thread of arguing, which I have endeavoured should be as near
   to mathematical as the nature of such a discourse would allow; omitting
   some other arguments which I could not discern to be so evidently
   conclusive; because it seems not to be at any time for the real
   advantage of truth to use arguments in its behalf founded only on such
   hypotheses as the adversaries apprehend they cannot be compelled to
   grant: Yet I have not made it my business to oppose any of those
   arguments, because I think it is not the best way for any one to
   recommend his own performance by endeavouring to discover the
   imperfections of others who are engaged in the same design with
   himself, of promoting the interest of true religion and virtue. But
   every man ought to use such arguments only as appear to him to be clear
   and strong, and the readers must judge whether they truly prove the
   conclusion.

Introduction

   ALL those who either are or pretend to be atheists; The introduction.
   who either disbelieve the being of God, or would be thought to do so;
   or, (which is all one,) who deny the principal attributes of the divine
   nature, and suppose God to be an unintelligent being, which acts merely
   by necessity; that is, which, in any tolerable propriety of speech,
   acts not at all, but is only acted upon: all men that are atheists, I
   say, in this sense, must be so upon one or other of these three
   accounts.

   Either, first, Because being extremely ignorant Atheism arises from
   stupid ignorance. and stupid, they have never duly considered any thing
   at all; nor made any just use of their natural reason, to discover even
   the plainest and most obvious truths; but have spent their time in a
   manner of life very little superior to that of beasts.

   Or from gross corruption of manners: Or, secondly, Because being
   totally debauched and corrupted in their practice, they have, by a
   vicious and degenerate life, corrupted the principles of their nature,
   and defaced the reason of their own minds; and, instead of fairly and
   impartially inquiring into the rules and obligations of nature, and the
   reason and fitness of things, have accustomed themselves only to mock
   and scoff at religion; and, being under the power of evil habits, and
   the slavery of unreasonable and indulged lusts, are resolved not to
   hearken to any reasoning which would oblige them to forsake their
   beloved vices.

   Or from false philosophy. Or, thirdly, Because in the way of
   speculative reasoning, and upon the principles of philosophy, they
   pretend that the arguments used against the being or attributes of God,
   seem to them, after the strictest and fullest inquiry, to be more
   strong and conclusive than those by which we endeavour to prove these
   great truths.

   These seem the only causes that can be imagined, of any man's
   disbelieving the being or attributes of God; and no man can be supposed
   to be an atheist but upon one or other of these three accounts. Now, to
   the two former of these three sorts of men; namely, to such as are
   wholly ignorant and stupid, or to such as through habitual debauchery
   have brought themselves to a custom of mocking and scoffing at all
   religion, and will not hearken to any fair reasoning; it is not my
   present business to apply myself. The one of these wants to be
   instructed in the first principles of reason as well as of religion.
   The other disbelieves only for a present false interest, and because he
   is desirous that the thing should not be true. The one has not yet
   arrived to the use of his natural faculties: the other has renounced
   them; and declares he will not be argued with, as a rational creature.
   It is therefore the third sort of atheists only (namely those who in
   the way of speculative reasoning, and upon the principles of
   philosophy, pretend that the arguments brought against the being or
   attributes of God, do, upon the strictest and fullest examination,
   appear to them to be more strong and conclusive, than those by which
   these great truths are attempted to be proved;) these, I say, are the
   only atheistical persons to whom my present discourse can be supposed
   to be directed, or indeed who are capable of being reasoned with at
   all.

   Now, before I enter upon the main argument, I shall premise several
   concessions, which these men, upon their own principles, are
   unavoidably obliged to make.

   And first, They must of necessity own, that, supposing The being of God
   very desirable. it cannot be proved to be true, yet at least it is a
   thing very desirable, and which any wise man would wish to be true, for
   the great benefit and happiness of men; that there was a God, an
   intelligent and wise, a just and good Being, to govern the world.
   Whatever hypothesis these men can possibly frame; whatever argument
   they can invent, by which they would exclude God and providence out of
   the world; that very argument or hypothesis will of necessity lead them
   to this concession. If they argue, that our notion of God arises not
   from nature and reason, but from the art and contrivance of
   politicians; that argument itself forces them to confess, that it is
   manifestly for the interest of human society that it should be believed
   there is a God. If they suppose that the world was made by chance, and
   is every moment subject to be destroyed by chance again; no man can be
   so absurd as to contend that it is as comfortable and desirable to live
   in such an uncertain state of things, and so continually liable to
   ruin, [1] without any hope of renovation; as in a world that were under
   the preservation and conduct of a powerful, wise, and good God. If they
   argue against the being of God, from the faults and defects which they
   imagine they can find in the frame and constitution of the visible and
   material world; this supposition obliges them to acknowledge, that it
   would have been better the world had been made by an intelligent and
   wise Being, who might have prevented all faults and imperfections. If
   they argue against providence, from the faultiness and inequality which
   they think they discover in the management of the moral world, this is
   a plain confession that it is a thing more fit and desirable in itself,
   that the world should be governed by a just and good Being, than by
   mere chance or unintelligent necessity. Lastly, if they suppose the
   world to be eternally and necessarily self-existent, and consequently
   that every thing in it is established by a blind and eternal fatality,
   no rational man can at the same time deny, but that liberty and choice,
   or a free power of acting, is a more eligible state, than to be
   determined thus in all our actions, as a stone is to move downward, by
   an absolute and inevitable fate. In a word, which way soever they turn
   themselves, and whatever hypothesis they make, concerning the origin
   and frame of things, nothing is so certain and undeniable, as that man,
   considered without the protection and conduct of a superior being, is
   in a far worse case, than upon supposition of the being and government
   of God, and of men's being under his peculiar conduct, protection, and
   favour. Man, of himself, is infinitely insufficient for his own
   happiness: [2] he is liable to many evils and miseries, which he can
   neither prevent nor redress: he is full of wants which he cannot
   supply, and compassed about with infirmities which he cannot remove,
   and obnoxious to dangers which he can never sufficiently provide
   against: he is secure of nothing that he enjoys in this world, and
   uncertain of every thing he hopes for: he is apt to grieve for what he
   cannot help, and eagerly to desire what he is never able to obtain, &c.
   Under which evil circumstances it is evident there can be no sufficient
   support, but in the belief of a wise and good God, and in the hopes
   which true religion affords. Whether therefore the being and attributes
   of God can be demonstrated or not, it must at least be confessed, by
   all rational and wise men, to be a thing very desirable, and which they
   would heartily wish to be true, that there was a God, an intelligent
   and wise, a just and good Being, to govern the world.

   Now, the use I desire to make of this concession is only this: that
   since the men I am arguing with are unavoidably obliged to confess that
   it is a thing very desirable at least, that there should be a God, they
   must of necessity, upon their own principles, be very willing, nay,
   desirous, above all things, to be convinced that their present opinion
   is an error, and sincerely hope that the contrary may be demonstrated
   to them to be true; and consequently they are bound with all
   seriousness, attention, and impartiality, to consider the weight of the
   arguments by which the being and attributes of God may be proved to
   them.

   Secondly, All such persons as I am speaking of, Scoffing at religion,
   inexcusable. who profess themselves to be atheists, not upon any
   present interest or lust, but purely upon the principles of reason and
   philosophy, are bound by these principles to acknowledge, that all
   mocking and scoffing at religion, all jesting and turning arguments of
   reason into drollery and ridicule, is the most unmanly and unreasonable
   thing in the world. And consequently, they are obliged to exclude out
   of their number, as irrational and self-condemned persons, and unworthy
   to be argued with, all such scoffers at religion, who deride at all
   adventures without hearing reason; and who will not use the means of
   being convinced and satisfied. Hearing the reason of the case, with
   patience and unprejudicedness, is an equity which men owe to every
   truth that can in any manner concern them; and which is necessary to
   the discovery of every kind of error. How much more in things of the
   utmost importance!

   Virtue and good manners absolutely necessary. Thirdly, Since the
   persons I am discoursing to cannot but own, that the supposition of the
   being of God is in itself most desirable, and for the benefit of the
   world, that it should be true; they must of necessity grant further,
   that, supposing the being and attributes of God to be things not indeed
   demonstrable to be true, but only possible, and such as cannot be
   demonstrated to be false, as most certainly they cannot; and much more,
   supposing them once made to appear probable, and but more likely to be
   true than the contrary opinion: nothing is more evident, even upon
   these suppositions only, than that men ought in all reason to live
   piously and virtuously in the world; and that vice and immorality are,
   upon all accounts, and under all hypotheses, the most absurd and
   inexcusable things in nature.

   This much being premised, which no atheist, who pretends to be a
   rational and fair inquirer into things, can possibly avoid granting;
   (and other atheists, I have before said, are not to be disputed with at
   all; as being enemies to reason, no less than to religion, and
   therefore absolutely self-condemned;) I proceed now to the main thing I
   at first proposed; namely, to endeavour to show, to such considering
   persons as I have already described, that the being and attributes of
   God are not only possible, or barely probable in themselves, but also
   strictly demonstrable to any unprejudiced mind, from the most
   incontestable principles of right reason.

   And here, because the persons I am at present dealing with, must be
   supposed not to believe any revelation, nor acknowledge any authority
   which they will submit to, but only the bare force of reasoning; I
   shall not, at this time, draw any testimony from Scripture, nor make
   use of any sort of authority, nor lay any stress upon any popular
   arguments in the matter before us; but confine myself to the rules of
   strict and demonstrative argumentation.

   Now, many arguments there are, by which the being and attributes of God
   have been undertaken to be demonstrated. And perhaps most of those
   arguments, if thoroughly understood, rightly stated, fully pursued, and
   duly separated from the false or uncertain reasonings which have
   sometimes been intermixed with them; would at length appear to be
   substantial and conclusive. But because I would endeavour, as far as
   possible, to avoid all manner of perplexity and confusion; therefore I
   shall not at this time use any variety of arguments, but endeavour, by
   one clear and plain series of propositions necessarily connected and
   following one from another, to demonstrate the certainty of the being
   of God, and to deduce in order the necessary attributes of his nature,
   so far as by our finite reason we are enabled to discover and apprehend
   them. And because it is not to my present purpose to explain or
   illustrate things to them that believe, but only to convince
   unbelievers, and settle them that doubt, by strict and undeniable
   reasoning; therefore I shall not allege any thing, which, however
   really true and useful, may yet be liable to contradiction or dispute;
   but shall endeavour to urge such propositions only as cannot be denied,
   without departing from that reason, which all atheists pretend to be
   the foundation of their unbelief. Only it is absolutely necessary,
   before all things, that they consent to lay aside all manner of
   prejudices; and especially such as have been apt to arise from the too
   frequent use of terms of art, which have no ideas belonging to them;
   and from the common receiving certain maxims of philosophy as true,
   which at the bottom seem to be only propositions without any meaning or
   signification at all.

Proposition I.

   I. Proposition I. First then, it is absolutely and undeniably certain,
   that Something must have existed from eternity. something has existed
   from all eternity.--This is so evident and undeniable a proposition,
   that no atheist in any age has ever presumed to assert the contrary;
   and therefore there is little need of being particular in the proof of
   it. For since something now is, it is evident that something always
   was; otherwise the things that now are must have been produced out of
   nothing, absolutely and without cause, which is a plain contradiction
   in terms. For to say a thing is produced, and yet that there is no
   cause at all of that production, is to say that something is effected,
   when it is effected by nothing; that is, at the same time when it is
   not effected at all.--Whatever exists, has a cause, a reason, a ground
   of its existence; (a foundation, on which its existence relies; a
   ground or reason why it doth exist rather than not exist;) either in
   the necessity of its own nature, and then it must have been of itself
   eternal; or in the will of some other being, and then that other being
   must, at least in the order of nature and causality, have existed
   before it.

   Of the difficulty of conceiving eternity. That something therefore has
   really existed from eternity, is one of the certainest and most evident
   truths in the world; acknowledged by all men, and disputed by none. Yet
   as to the manner how it can be; there is nothing in nature more
   difficult for the mind of man to conceive, than this very first plain
   and self-evident truth. For, how any thing can have existed eternally;
   that is, how an eternal duration can be now actually past, is a thing
   utterly as impossible for our narrow understandings to comprehend, as
   any thing that is not an express contradiction can be imagined to be:
   and yet to deny the truth of the proposition, that an eternal duration
   is now actually past, would be to assert something still far more
   unintelligible, even a real and express contradiction.

   Difficulties arising merely from the nature of eternity, not to be
   regarded, because equal in all suppositions. The use I would make of
   this observation, is this: That since in all questions concerning the
   nature and perfections of God, or concerning any thing to which the
   idea of eternity or infinity is joined; though we can indeed
   demonstrate certain propositions to be true, yet it is impossible for
   us to comprehend or frame any adequate or complete ideas of the manner
   how the things so demonstrated can be: therefore, when once any
   proposition is clearly demonstrated to be true, it ought not to disturb
   us that there be perhaps perplexing difficulties on the other side,
   which merely for want of adequate ideas of the manner of the existence
   of the things demonstrated, are not easy to be cleared. Indeed, were it
   possible there should be any proposition which could equally be
   demonstrated on both sides of the question, or which could on both
   sides be reduced to imply a contradiction; (as some have very
   inconsiderately asserted;) this, it must be confessed, would alter the
   case. Upon this absurd supposition, all difference of true and false,
   all thinking and reasoning, and the use of all our faculties, would be
   entirely at an end. But when to demonstration on the one side, there
   are opposed on the other, only difficulties raised from our want of
   having adequate ideas of the things themselves; this ought not to be
   esteemed an objection of any real weight. It is directly and clearly
   demonstrable, (and acknowledged to be so, even by all atheists that
   ever lived,) that something has been from eternity: All the objections
   therefore raised against the eternity of any thing, grounded merely on
   our want of having an adequate idea of eternity, ought to be looked
   upon as of no real solidity. Thus in other the like instances: It is
   demonstrable, for example, that something must be actually infinite:
   All the metaphysical difficulties, therefore, which arise usually from
   applying the measures and relations of things finite, to what is
   infinite; and from supposing finites to be [aliquot] parts of infinite,
   when indeed they are not properly so, but only as mathematical points
   to quantity, which have no proportion at all: (and from imagining all
   infinites to be equal, when in things disparate they manifestly are not
   so; an infinite line, being not only not equal to, but infinitely less
   than an infinite surface, and an infinite surface than space infinite
   in all dimensions:) All metaphysical difficulties, I say, arising from
   false suppositions of this kind, ought to be esteemed vain and of no
   force. Again: it is in like manner demonstrable, that quantity is
   infinitely divisible: All the objections therefore raised, by supposing
   the sums total of all infinities to be equal, when in disparate parts
   they manifestly are not so; and by comparing the imaginary equality or
   inequality of the number of the parts of unequal quantities, whose
   parts have really no number at all, they all having parts without
   number; ought to be looked upon as weak and altogether inconclusive: To
   ask whether the parts of unequal quantities be equal in number or not,
   when they have no number at all, being the same thing as to ask whether
   two lines drawn from differently distant points, and each of them
   continued infinitely, be equal in length or not, that is, whether they
   end together, when neither of them have any end at all.
     __________________________________________________________________

Proposition II. There must have existed from eternity one independent being.

   II. Proposition II: There must have existed from eternity one
   independent being. There has existed from eternity, [3] some one
   unchangeable and independent being. For since something must needs have
   been from eternity, as has been already proved, and is granted on all
   hands, either there has always existed some one unchangeable and
   independent being, from which all other beings that are or ever were in
   the universe have received their original; or else there has been an
   infinite succession of changeable and dependent beings, produced one
   from another, in an endless progression, without any original cause at
   all. Now this latter supposition is so very absurd, that though all
   atheism must in its account of most things (as shall be shown
   hereafter,) terminate in it, yet I think very few atheists ever were so
   weak as openly and directly to defend it; for it is plainly impossible,
   and contradictory to itself. I shall not argue against it from the
   supposed impossibility of infinite succession, barely and absolutely
   considered in itself; for a reason which shall be mentioned hereafter.
   But, if we consider such an infinite progression, as one entire endless
   series of dependent beings, it is plain this whole series of beings can
   have no cause from without, of its existence; because in it are
   supposed to be included all things that are or ever were in the
   universe: And it is plain it can have no reason within itself, of its
   existence; because no one being in this infinite succession is supposed
   to be self-existent or necessary, (which is the only ground or reason
   of existence of any thing that can be imagined within the thing itself,
   as will presently more fully appear,) but every one dependent on the
   foregoing: and where no part is necessary, it is manifest the whole
   cannot be necessary: absolute necessity of existence, not being an
   extrinsic, relative, and accidental denomination, but an inward and
   essential property of the nature of the thing which so exists. An
   infinite succession, therefore, of merely dependent beings, without any
   original independent cause, is a series of beings that has neither
   necessity, nor cause, nor any reason or ground at all of its existence,
   either within itself or from without; that is, it is an express
   contradiction and impossibility; it is a supposing something to be
   caused, (because it is granted in every one of its stages of
   succession, not to be necessarily and of itself;) and yet that, in the
   whole, it is caused absolutely by nothing; which every man knows is a
   contradiction to imagine done in time; and, because duration in this
   case makes no difference, it is equally a contradiction to suppose it
   done from eternity; and, consequently, there must, on the contrary, of
   necessity, have existed from eternity some one immutable and
   independent being.

   To suppose an infinite succession of changeable and dependent beings
   produced one from another in an endless progression, without any
   original cause at all, is only [4] a driving back from one step to
   another, and (as it were) removing out of sight, the question
   concerning the ground or reason of the existence of things. It is in
   reality, and in point of argument, the very same supposition, as it
   would be to suppose one continued being, of beginningless and endless
   duration, neither self-existent and necessary in itself, nor having its
   existence founded in any self-existent cause; which is directly absurd
   and contradictory.

   Otherwise, thus: Either there has always existed some one unchangeable
   and independent being, from which all other beings have received their
   original; or else there has been an infinite succession of changeable
   and dependent beings, produced one from another, in an endless
   progression, without any original cause at all. According to this
   latter supposition, there is nothing in the universe self-existent or
   necessarily-existing: and, if so, then it was originally equally
   possible, that from eternity there should never have existed any thing
   at all, as that there should from eternity have existed a succession of
   changeable and dependent beings: which being supposed, then, what is it
   that has from eternity determined such a succession of beings to exist,
   rather than that from eternity there should never have existed any
   thing at all? Necessity it was not; because it was equally possible, in
   this supposition, that they should not have existed at all. Chance is
   nothing but a mere word, without any signification: And other being it
   is supposed there was none, to determine the existence of these. Their
   existence, therefore, was determined by nothing; neither by any
   necessity in the nature of the things themselves, because it is
   supposed that none of them are self-existent; nor by any other being,
   because no other is supposed to exist. That is to say; of two equally
   possible things, (viz. whether any thing or nothing should from
   eternity have existed,) the one is determined, rather than the other,
   absolutely by nothing; which is an express contradiction. And,
   consequently, as before, there must on the contrary, of necessity, have
   existed, from eternity, some one immutable and independent being,
   which, what it is, remains in the next place to be inquired.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] The meaning of this proposition, (and all that the argument here
   requires,) is, that there must needs have always been some independent
   being, some one at least. To show that there can be no more than one,
   is not the design of this proposition, but of the seventh.

   [4] This matter has been well illustrated by a late able
   writer.--"Suppose a chain hung down out of the heavens, from an unknown
   height; and, though every link of it gravitated toward the earth, and
   what it hung upon was not visible, yet it did not descend, but kept its
   situation: And, upon this, a question should arise, What supported or
   kept up this chain? Would it be a sufficient answer to say, that the
   first or lowest link hung upon the second, or that next above it; the
   second, or rather the first and second together, upon the third; and so
   on in infinitum? For, what holds up the whole? A chain of ten links,
   would fall down, unless something able to bear it hindered: One of
   twenty, if not stayed by something of a yet greater strength, in
   proportion to the increase of weight. And therefore one of infinite
   links, certainly; if not sustained by something infinitely strong, and
   capable to bear up an infinite weight: And thus it is in a chain of
   causes and effects, tending, or (as it were) gravitating, towards some
   end. The last, or lowest, depends, or, (as one may say) is suspended
   upon the cause above it. This, again, if it be not the first cause, is
   suspended, as an effect, upon something above it, &c. And if they
   should be infinite, unless (agreeably to what has been said) there is
   some cause, upon which all hang or depend, they would be but an
   infinite effect without an efficient: and to assert there is any such
   thing, would be as great an absurdity as to say, that a finite or

   the greatest) does not."--Religion of Nature Delineated, page 67.

Proposition III. The one independent Being must be necessarily existing.

   Proposition III: The one independent Being must be necessarily
   existing. III. That unchangeable and independent Being, which has
   existed from eternity, without any external cause of its existence,
   must be self-existent, that is, necessarily existing. For whatever
   exists, must either have come into being out of nothing, absolutely
   without cause; or it must have been produced by some external cause; or
   it must be self-existent. Now, to arise out of nothing, absolutely
   without any cause, has been already shown to be a plain contradiction.
   To have been produced by some external cause, cannot possibly be true
   of every thing; but something must have existed eternally and
   independently, as has likewise been shown already. It remains,
   therefore, that that being which has existed independently from
   eternity must of necessity be self-existent. Now, to be self-existent
   is not to be produced by itself; for that is an express contradiction.
   But it is, (which is the only idea we can frame of self-existence; and
   without which, the word seems to have no signification at all;) it is,
   I say, to exist by an absolute necessity originally in the nature of
   the thing itself: And this necessity must be antecedent; not, indeed,
   in time, to the existence of the being itself, because that is eternal;
   but it must be antecedent in the natural order of our ideas, to our
   supposition of its being; that is, this necessity must not barely be
   consequent upon our supposition of the existence of such a being; (for
   then it would not be a necessity absolutely such in itself, nor be the
   ground or foundation of the existence of any thing, being on the
   contrary only a consequent of it;) but it must antecedently force
   itself upon us, whether we will or no, even when we are endeavouring to
   suppose that no such being exists. For example: when we are
   endeavouring to suppose, that there is no being in the universe that
   exists necessarily, we always find in our minds, Page 10, &c. (besides
   the foregoing demonstration of something being self-existent, from the
   impossibility of every thing's being dependent;) we always find in our
   minds, I say, some ideas, as of infinity and eternity; which to remove,
   that is, to suppose that there is no being, no substance in the
   universe, to which these attributes or modes of existence are
   necessarily inherent, is a contradiction in the very terms. For modes
   and attributes exist only by the existence of the substance to which
   they belong. Now, he that can suppose eternity and immensity (and
   consequently the substance by whose existence these modes or attributes
   exist,) removed out of the universe, may, if he please, as easily
   remove the relation of equality between twice two and four.

   That to suppose immensity removed out of the universe, or not
   necessarily eternal, is an express contradiction; is intuitively
   evident to every one who attends to his own ideas, and considers the
   essential nature of things. To suppose [5] any part of space removed,
   is to suppose it removed from and out of itself: and to suppose the
   whole to be taken away, is supposing it to be taken away from itself,
   that is, to be taken away while it still remains; which is a
   contradiction in terms. There is no obscurity in this argument but what
   arises to those who think immense space to be absolutely nothing: which
   notion is itself likewise an express contradiction; for nothing is that
   which has no properties or modes whatsoever; that is to say, it is that
   of which nothing can truly be affirmed, and of which every thing can
   truly be denied; which is not the case of immensity or space.

   From this third proposition it follows,

   1st, That the only true idea of a self-existent or The true notion of
   self existence. Pages 10 and 14. necessarily-existing being, is the
   idea of a being, the supposition of whose not-existing is an express
   contradiction. For since it is absolutely impossible but there must be
   somewhat self-existent; that is, which exists by the necessity of its
   own nature; it is plain that that necessity cannot be a necessity
   consequent upon any foregoing supposition, (because nothing can be
   antecedent to that which is self-existent, no not its own will, so as
   to be the cause or ground of its own existence,) but it must be a
   necessity absolutely such in its own nature. Now, a necessity, not
   relatively or consequentially, but absolutely such in its own nature,
   is nothing else but its being a plain impossibility or implying a
   contradiction to suppose the contrary. For instance; the relation of
   equality between twice two and four is an absolute necessity only
   because it is an immediate contradiction in terms to suppose them
   unequal. This is the only idea we can frame of an absolute necessity;
   and to use the word in any other sense seems to be using it without any
   signification at all.

   If any one now asks, what sort of idea the idea of that being is, the
   supposition of whose not-existing is thus an express contradiction; I
   answer, it is the first and simplest idea we can possibly frame; an
   idea necessarily and essentially included or presupposed, as a sine qua
   non, in every other idea whatsoever; an idea, which (unless we forbear
   thinking at all) we cannot possibly extirpate or remove out of our
   minds; of a most simple being, absolutely eternal and infinite,
   original and independent. For, that he who supposes there is no
   original independent being in the universe, supposes a contradiction,
   has been shown already. And that he who supposes there may possibly be
   no eternal and infinite being in the universe supposes likewise a
   contradiction, is evident from hence; (besides that these two
   attributes do necessarily follow from self-originate independent
   existence, as shall be shown hereafter;) that when he has done his
   utmost, in endeavouring to imagine that no such being exists, he cannot
   avoid imagining an eternal and infinite [6] nothing; that is, he will
   imagine eternity and immensity removed out of the universe, and yet
   that at the same time they still continue there; as has been above [7]
   distinctly explained.

   This The error of the Cartesians. argument the Cartesians, who supposed
   the idea of immensity to be the idea of matter, have been greatly
   perplexed with. For, (however in words they have contradicted
   themselves, yet in reality) they have more easily been driven to that
   most intolerable absurdity of asserting matter [8] to be a necessary
   being; than being able to remove out of their minds the idea of
   immensity, as existing necessarily and inseparably from eternity. Which
   absurdity and inextricable perplexity of theirs, in respect of the idea
   of immensity, shows that they found that indeed to be necessary and
   impossible to be removed; but, in respect of matter, it was only a
   perverse applying an idea to an object, whereto it noways belongs; for,
   that it is indeed absolutely impossible and contradictory to suppose
   matter necessarily-existing, shall be demonstrated presently.

   2dly. Nothing so certain as the existence of a supreme independent
   cause. From hence it follows, that there is no man whatsoever, who
   makes any use of his reason, but may easily become more certain of the
   being of a supreme independent cause, than he can be of any thing else
   besides his own existence; for how much thought soever it may require
   to demonstrate the other attributes of such a being, as it may do to
   demonstrate the greatest mathematical certainties, (of which more
   hereafter,) yet, as to its existence, that there is somewhat eternal,
   infinite, and self-existing, which must be the cause and origin of all
   other things; this is one of the first and most natural conclusions
   that any man, who thinks at all, can frame in his mind: and no man can
   any more doubt of this, than he can doubt whether twice two be equal to
   four.--It is impossible, indeed, a man may in some sense be ignorant of
   this first and plain truth, by being utterly stupid, and not thinking
   at all; (for though it is absolutely impossible for him to imagine the
   contrary, yet he may possibly neglect to conceive this: though no man
   can possibly think that twice two is not four, yet he may possibly be
   stupid, and never have thought at all whether it be so or not.) But
   this I say: there is no man, who thinks or reasons at all, but may
   easily become more certain, that there is something eternal, infinite,
   and self-existing, than he can be certain of any thing else.

   3dly. Of the idea of God, including self-existence. Hence we may
   observe, that our first certainty of the existence of God does not
   arise from this, that in the idea our minds frame of him, (or rather in
   the definition that we make of the word God, as signifying a being of
   all possible perfections,) we include self-existence; but from hence,
   that it is demonstrable both negatively, that neither can all things
   possibly have arisen out of nothing, nor can they have depended one on
   another in an endless succession; and also positively, that there is
   something in the universe, actually existing without us, the
   supposition of whose not-existing plainly implies a contradiction. The
   argument which has by some been drawn from our including self-existence
   in the idea of God, or our comprehending it in the definition or notion
   we frame of him, has this obscurity and defect in it: that it seems to
   extend only to the nominal idea or mere definition of a self-existent
   being, and does not with a sufficiently evident connexion refer and
   apply that general nominal idea, definition, or notion which we frame
   in our own mind, to any real particular being actually existing without
   us. For it is not satisfactory, that I have in my mind an idea of the
   proposition; there exists a being indued with all possible perfections;
   or, there is a self-existent being. But I must also have some idea of
   the thing. I must have an idea of something actually existing without
   me. And I must see wherein consists the absolute impossibility of
   removing that idea, and consequently of supposing the non-existence of
   the thing, before I can be satisfied, from that idea, that the thing
   actually exists. The bare having an idea of the proposition there is a
   self-existent being, proves indeed the thing not to be impossible; (for
   of an impossible proposition there can be no idea;) but that it
   actually is, cannot be proved from the idea; unless the certainty of
   the actual existence of a necessarily-existing being follows from the
   possibility of the existence of such a being; which that it does in
   this particular case, many learned men have indeed thought; and their
   subtile arguings upon this head are sufficient to raise a cloud not
   very easy to be seen through. But it is a much clearer and more
   convincing way of arguing, to demonstrate that there does actually
   exist without us a being, whose existence is necessary and of itself;
   by shewing the evident contradiction contained in the contrary
   supposition, (as I have before done,) and at the same time the absolute
   impossibility of destroying or removing some ideas, as of eternity and
   immensity, which therefore must needs be modes or attributes of a
   necessary being actually existing. For if I have in my mind an idea of
   a thing, and cannot possibly in my imagination take away the idea of
   that thing as actually existing, any more than I can change or take
   away the idea of the equality of twice two to four; the certainty of
   the existence of that thing is the same, and stands on the same
   foundation as the certainty of the other relation. For the relation of
   equality between twice two and four has no other certainty but this;
   that I cannot, without a contradiction, change or take away the idea of
   that relation. We are certain, therefore, of the being of a supreme
   independent cause; because it is strictly demonstrable, that there is
   something in the universe actually existing without us, the supposition
   of whose not-existing plainly implies a contradiction.

   Some writers have contended, [9] that it is preposterous to inquire in
   this manner at all into the ground or reason of the existence of the
   first cause: because evidently the first cause can have nothing prior
   to it, and consequently must needs (they think) exist absolutely
   without any cause at all. That the first cause can have no other being
   prior to it, to be the cause of its existence, is indeed self-evident.
   But if originally, absolutely, and antecedently to all supposition of
   existence, there be no necessary ground or reason why the first cause
   does exist, rather than not exist; if the first cause can rightly and
   truly be affirmed to exist, absolutely without any ground or reason of
   existence at all, it will unavoidably follow, by the same argument,
   that it may as well cease likewise to exist, without any ground or
   reason of ceasing to exist: which is absurd. The truth therefore
   plainly is: Whatever is the true reason, why the first cause can never
   possibly cease to exist, the same is, and originally and always was,
   the true reason why it always did and cannot but exist: that is, it is
   the true ground and reason of its existence.

   4thly. From hence it follows, that the material That the material world
   cannot possibly be the self-existent being. world cannot possibly be
   the first and original being, uncreated, independent, and of itself
   eternal. For since it hath been already demonstrated, that whatever
   being hath existed from eternity, independent, and without any external
   cause of its existence, must be self-existent; and that whatever is
   self-existent, must exist necessarily by an absolute necessity in the
   nature of the thing itself. It follows evidently, that unless the
   material world exists necessarily by an absolute necessity in its own
   nature, so as that it must be an express contradiction to suppose it
   not to exist, it cannot be independent, and of itself eternal. Now that
   the material world does not exist thus necessarily, is very evident.
   For absolute necessity of existing, and a possibility of not existing,
   being contradictory ideas, it is manifest the material world cannot
   exist necessarily, if without a contradiction we can conceive it either
   not to be, or to be in any respect otherwise than it now is; than
   which, nothing is more easy. For whether we consider the form of the
   world, with the disposition and motion of its parts, or whether we
   consider the matter of it, as such, without respect to its present
   form, every thing in it,--both the whole and every one of its parts,
   their situation and motion, the form and also the matter, are the most
   arbitrary and dependent things, and the farthest removed from
   necessity, that can possibly be imagined. A necessity indeed of
   fitness, that is, a necessity that things should be as they are, in
   order to the well-being of the whole, there may be in all these things:
   but an absolute necessity of nature in any of them, (which is what the
   atheist must maintain,) there is not the least appearance of. If any
   man will say in this sense, (as every atheist must do,) either that the
   form of the world, or at least the matter and motion of it, is
   necessary, nothing can possibly be invented more absurd.

   If he says, that the particular form is necessary; that is, The form of
   the world not necessary. that the world, and all things that are
   therein, exist by necessity of nature, he must affirm it to be a
   contradiction to suppose that any part of the world can be in any
   respect otherwise than it now is. It must be a contradiction in terms,
   to suppose more or fewer stars, more or fewer planets, or to suppose
   their size, figure, or motion different from what it now is; or to
   suppose more or fewer plants and animals upon earth, or the present
   ones of different shape and bigness from what they now are. In all
   which things there is the greatest arbitrariness, in respect of power
   and possibility, that can be imagined; however necessary any of them
   may be, in respect of wisdom, and preservation of the beauty and order
   of the whole.

   If Nor its motion. the atheist will say, that the motion in general of
   all matter is necessary, it follows that it must be a contradiction in
   terms to suppose any matter to be at rest; which is so absurd and
   ridiculous, that I think hardly any atheists, either ancient or modern,
   have presumed directly to suppose it.

   One late author [10] indeed has ventured to assert, and pretended to
   prove, that motion (that is, the conatusto motion, the tendency to
   move, the power or force that produces actual motion,) is essential to
   all matter. But how philosophically, may appear from this one
   consideration: The essential tendency to motion, of every one, or of
   any one particle of matter in this author's imaginary infinite plenum,
   must be either a tendency to move some one determinate way at once, or
   to move every way at once. A tendency to move some one determinate way
   cannot be essential to any particle of matter, but must arise from some
   external cause; because there is nothing in the pretended necessary
   nature of any particle to determine its motion necessarily and
   essentially one way rather than another. And a tendency or conatus
   equally to move every way at once, is either an absolute contradiction,
   or at least could produce nothing in matter but an eternal rest of all
   and every one of its parts.

   If the atheist will suppose motion necessary and essential to some
   matter, but not to all, the same absurdity, as to the determination of
   motion, still follows; and now he moreover supposes an absolute
   necessity not universal; that is, that it shall be a contradiction to
   suppose some certain matter at rest though at the same time some other
   matter actually be at rest.

   If Nor the bare matter. he only affirms bare matter to be necessary
   then, besides the extreme folly of attributing motion and the form of
   the world to chance, (which senseless opinion I think all atheists have
   now given up; and therefore I shall not think myself obliged to take
   any notice of it in the sequel of this discourse;) it may be
   demonstrated, by many arguments drawn from the nature and affections of
   the thing itself, that matter is not a necessary being. For instance,
   thus: Tangibility, or resistance, (which is what mathematicians very
   properly call vis inertiæ, is essential to matter; otherwise the word
   matter will have no determinate signification. Tangibility, therefore,
   or resistance, belonging to all matter, it follows evidently, that, if
   all space were filled with matter, the resistance of all fluids (for
   the resistance of the parts of hard bodies arises from another cause,)
   would necessarily be equal. For greater or less degrees of fineness or
   subtilty can in this case make no difference; because the smaller or
   finer the parts of the fluid are, wherewith any particular space is
   filled, the greater in proportion is the number of the parts; and
   consequently the resistance still always equal. But experience shows,
   on the contrary, that the resistance of all fluids is not equal; there
   being large spaces in which no sensible resistance at all is made to
   the swiftest and most lasting motion of the solidest bodies. Therefore
   all space is not filled with matter; but, of necessary consequence,
   there must be a vacuum.

   Or thus. It appears from experiments of falling bodies, and from
   experiments of pendulums, which (being of equal lengths and unequal
   gravities,) vibrate in equal times; that all bodies whatsoever, in
   spaces void of sensible resistance, fall from the same height with
   equal velocities. Now, it is evident, that whatever force causes
   unequal bodies to move with equal velocities, must be proportional to
   the quantities of the bodies moved. The power of gravity therefore in
   all bodies, is, (at equal distances, suppose from the centre of the
   earth,) proportional to the quantity of matter contained in each body.
   For if, in a pendulum, there were any matter that did not gravitate
   proportionally to its quantity, the vis inertiæ of that matter would
   retard the motion of the rest, so as soon to be discovered in pendulums
   of equal lengths and unequal gravities in spaces void of sensible
   resistance. Gravity, therefore, is in all bodies [11] proportional to
   the quantity of their matter. And consequently, all bodies not being
   equally heavy, it follows again necessarily, that there must be a
   vacuum. [12]

   Now, if there be a vacuum, it follows plainly, that matter is not a
   necessary being. For if a vacuum actually be, then it is evidently more
   than possible for matter not to be. If an atheist will yet assert, that
   matter may be necessary, though not necessary to be everywhere, I
   answer, this is an express contradiction: for absolute necessity is
   absolute necessity everywhere alike. And if it be no impossibility for
   matter to be absent from one place, it is no impossibility (absolutely
   in the nature of the thing; for no relative or consequential necessity
   can have any room in this argument,) it is no absolute impossibility, I
   say, in the nature of the thing, that matter should be absent from any
   other place, or from every place.

   Spinoza, Spinoza's opinion confuted. the most celebrated patron of
   atheism in our time, who taught that there is no difference of
   substances, [13] but that the whole and every part of the material
   world is a necessarily-existing being, and that there is no other God
   but the universe; [14] that he might seemingly avoid the manifold
   absurdities of that opinion, endeavours by an ambiguity of expression,
   in the progress of his discourse, to elude the arguments by which he
   foresaw his assertion would be confuted. For, having first plainly
   asserted, that all substance is necessarily-existing, [15] he would
   afterward seem to explain it away, by asserting, that the reason why
   every thing exists necessarily, [16] and could not possibly have been
   in any respect different from what it now is, is because every thing
   flows from the necessity of the divine nature. By which, if the unwary
   reader understands, that he means things are therefore necessarily such
   as they are, because infinite wisdom and goodness could not possibly
   make things but in that order which is fittest and wisest in the whole,
   he is very much mistaken: for such a necessity is not a natural, but
   only a moral and consequential necessity, and directly contrary to the
   author's true intention. Further, if the reader hereby understands,
   that God was determined, not by a necessity of wisdom and goodness, but
   by a mere natural necessity, exclusive of will and choice, to make all
   things just as they now are; neither is this the whole of Spinoza's
   meaning: for this, as absurd as it is, is still supposing God as a
   substance distinct from the material world; which he expressly denies.
   [17] Nay, further, if any one thinks his meaning to be, that all
   substances in the world are only modifications of the divine essence,
   neither is this all; for thus God may still be supposed as an agent,
   acting upon himself at least, and manifesting himself in different
   manners, according to his own will; which Spinoza expressly denies.
   [18] But his true meaning, therefore, however darkly and ambiguously he
   sometimes speaks, must be this; and if he means any thing at all
   consistent with himself, can be no other than this: that, since it is
   absolutely [19] impossible for any thing to be created or produced by
   another; and [20] also absolutely impossible for God to have caused any
   thing to be in any respect different from what it now is; every thing
   that exists, must needs be so a part [21] of the divine substance, not
   as a modification caused in it by any [22] will or good-pleasure, or
   wisdom in the whole, but as of absolute necessity in itself, with
   respect to the manner [23] of the existence of each part, no less than
   with respect to the self-existence of the whole. Thus the opinion of
   Spinoza, when expressed plainly and consistently, comes evidently to
   this; that the material world, and every part of it, with the order and
   manner of being of each part, is the only self-existent, or
   necessarily-existing being. And now, consequently, he must of necessity
   affirm all the conclusions which I have before shown to follow
   demonstrably from that opinion. He cannot possibly avoid affirming,
   that it is a contradiction, (not to the perfections of God, for that is
   mere senseless cant and amusement in him who maintains that there is
   but one substance in the universe; but he must affirm that it is in
   itself and in terms a contradiction,) for any thing to be, or to be
   imagined, in any respect otherwise than it now is. He must say it is a
   contradiction, to suppose the number, or figure, or order of the
   several parts of the world, could possibly have been different from
   what they now are. He must say, motion is necessarily of itself, and
   consequently that it is a contradiction in terms to suppose any matter
   to be at rest; or else he must affirm, (which is rather the more absurd
   of the two, as may appear from what has been already said in proof of
   the second general head of this discourse; [24] and yet he has chosen
   to affirm it;) that motion, as a dependent being, has been eternally
   communicated from one piece of matter to another, without having at all
   any original cause of its being, either within itself or from without,
   which, with other the like consequences touching the necessity of the
   existence of things, (the very mention of which is a sufficient
   confutation of any opinion they follow from,) do, as I have said,
   unavoidably follow from the fore-mentioned opinion of Spinoza. And
   consequently, that opinion, viz. that the universe, or whole world, is
   the self-existent or necessarily-existing being, is demonstrated to be
   false.

   I have, in this attempt to show that the material world cannot possibly
   be the first and original being, uncreated, independent, and
   self-existent, designedly omitted the argument usually drawn from the
   supposed absolute impossibility, in the nature of the thing itself, of
   the world's being eternal, or having existed through an infinite
   succession of time; and this I have done for the two following reasons.

   1st. Of the opinion concerning the eternity of the world. Because the
   question between us and the atheists is not whether the world can
   possibly have been eternal, but whether it can possibly be the
   original, independent self-existing being?--which is a very different
   question. For many, who have affirmed the one, have still utterly
   denied the other. And almost all the ancient philosophers, that held
   the eternity of the world, in whose authority and reasons our modern
   atheists do so greatly boast and triumph, defended that their opinion
   by such arguments as show plainly that they did by no means thereby
   intend to assert that the material world was the original, independent,
   self-existing being, in opposition to the belief of the existence of a
   supreme all-governing mind, which is the notion of God. So that the
   deniers of the being of God have no manner of advantage from that
   opinion of the eternity of the world, even supposing it could not be
   disproved. Almost all the old philosophers, I say, who held the
   eternity of the world, did not thereby mean (at least their arguments
   do not tend to prove) that it was independent and self-existent; but
   their arguments are wholly levelled, either to prove barely that
   something must needs be eternal, and that the universe could not
   possibly arise out of nothing absolutely and without cause; which is
   all that Ocellus Lucanus's arguments amount to: or else that the world
   is an eternal and necessary effect, flowing from the essential and
   immutable energy of the divine nature; which seems to have been
   Aristotle's opinion: or else that the world is an eternal voluntary
   emanation from the all-wise and supreme cause; which was the opinion of
   many of Plato's followers. None of which opinions or arguments will in
   the least help out our modern atheists; who would exclude supreme mind
   and intelligence out of the universe. For, however the opinion of the
   eternity of the world is really inconsistent with the belief of its
   being created in time, yet so long as the defenders of that opinion
   either did not think it inconsistent with the belief of the world's
   being the effect and work of an eternal, all-wise, and all-powerful
   mind; or at least could defend that opinion by such arguments only as
   did not in the least prove the self-existence or independency of the
   world, but most of them rather quite the contrary; it is with the
   greatest injustice and unreasonableness in the world, that modern
   atheists (to whose purpose the eternity or non-eternity of the world
   would signify nothing, unless at the same time the existence and
   sovereignty of eternal intelligence or mind were likewise disproved,)
   pretend either the authority or the reasons of these men to be on their
   side.

   Ocellus Lucanus, one of the ancientest asserters of the eternity of the
   world, (whose antiquity and authority [25] Mr Blunt opposes to that of
   Moses,) in delivering his opinion, speaks, indeed, like one that
   believed the material world to be self-existent; asserting, [26] that
   it is utterly incapable either of generation or corruption, of
   beginning or end; that it is of itself eternal and perfect, and
   permanent for ever, and that the frame and parts of the world must
   needs be eternal as well as the substance and matter of the whole. But
   when he comes to produce his arguments or reasons for his opinion, they
   are either so very absurd and ridiculous, that even any atheist in this
   age ought to be ashamed to repeat them; as when he attempts to prove
   [27] that the world must needs be eternal, without beginning or end,
   because both its figure and motion are a circle, which has neither
   beginning nor end: or else they are such arguments as prove only, what
   no man ever really denied, viz. that something must needs be eternal,
   because it is impossible for every thing to arise out of nothing, or to
   fall into nothing; as when he says [28] that the world must have been
   eternal, because it is a contradiction for the universe to have had a
   beginning, since, if it had a beginning, it must have been caused by
   some other thing, and then it is not the universe. To which one
   argument all that he says in his whole book is plainly reducible. So
   that it is evident all that he really proves, is only this: that there
   must needs be an eternal being in the universe; and not, that matter is
   self-existent, in opposition to intelligence and mind. For, all that he
   asserts about the absolute necessity of the order and parts of the
   world, is confessedly most ridiculous; not at all proved by the
   arguments he alleges; and in some passages of this very book, as well
   as in other fragments, he himself supposes, and is forced expressly to
   confess, that, however eternal and necessary every thing in the world
   be imagined to be, yet even that necessity must flow from an eternal
   and intelligent mind, [29] the necessary perfections of whose nature
   are the cause [30] ) of the harmony and beauty of the world, and
   particularly of men's having [31] faculties, organs of sense,
   appetites, &c. fitted even to final causes.

   Aristotle, likewise, was a great asserter indeed of the eternity of the
   world; but not in opposition to the belief of the being, or of the
   power, wisdom, or goodness of God. On the contrary, he for no other
   reason asserted the world to be eternal, but because he fancied that
   such an effect must needs eternally proceed from such an eternal cause.
   And so far was he from teaching that matter is the first and original
   cause of all things, that, on the contrary, he everywhere expressly
   describes God to be an intelligent being; [32] incorporeal; [33] the
   first mover of all things, [34] himself immoveable; and affirms, that
   [35] if there were nothing but matter in the world, there would be no
   original cause, but an infinite progression of causes, which is absurd.

   As to those philosophers who taught plainly and expressly that matter
   was not only eternal, but also self-existent and entirely independent,
   co-existing from eternity with God, independently, as a second
   principle, I have already shown the impossibility of this opinion, at
   the entrance upon the present head of discourse, where I proved that
   matter could not possibly be self-existent: and I shall further
   demonstrate it to be false, when I come to prove the unity of the
   self-existent being.

   Plato, whatever his opinion was about the original matter, very largely
   and fully declares his sentiments about the formation of the world,
   viz. that it was composed and framed by an intelligent and wise God.
   And there is no one of all the ancient philosophers, who does in all
   his writings speak so excellently and worthily [36] as he, concerning
   the nature and attributes of God. Yet as to the time of the world's
   beginning to be formed, he seems to make it indefinite, when he says
   [37] the world must needs be an eternal resemblance of the eternal
   idea. At least his followers afterward so understood and explained it,
   as if, by the creation of the world, was not to be understood a
   creation in time; [38] but only an order of nature, causality and
   dependence, that is, that the will of God, and his power of acting,
   being necessarily as eternal as his essence, [39] the effects of that
   will and power might be supposed coeval to the will and power
   themselves; in the same manner as light would eternally proceed from
   the sun, or a shadow from the interposed body, or an impression from an
   imposed seal, if the respective causes of these effects were supposed
   eternal.

   From all which, it plainly appears how little reason modern atheists
   have to boast either of the authority or reasons of those ancient
   philosophers who held the eternity of the world. For since these men
   neither proved, nor attempted to prove, that the material world was
   original to itself, independent or self-existing, but only that it was
   an eternal effect of an eternal cause, which is God, it is evident that
   this their opinion, even supposing it could by no means be refuted,
   could afford no manner of advantage to the cause of atheists in our
   days, who, excluding supreme mind and intelligence out of the universe,
   would make mere matter and necessity the original and eternal cause of
   all things.

   2dly. The other reason why (in this attempt to prove that the material
   world cannot possibly be the first and original being, uncreated,
   independent and self-existent,) I have omitted the argument usually
   drawn from the supposed absolute impossibility of the world's being
   eternal, or having existed through an infinite succession of time,--is,
   because that argument can never be so stated as to be of any use in
   convincing or affecting the mind of an atheist, who must not be
   supposed to come prepared beforehand with any transcendent idea of the
   eternity of God. For since an atheist cannot be supposed to believe the
   nice and subtile (and indeed unintelligible) distinctions of the
   schools, it is impossible by this argument so to disprove the
   possibility of the eternity of the world, but that an atheist will
   understand it to prove equally against the possibility of any thing's
   being eternal; and, consequently, that it proves nothing at all, but is
   only a difficulty arising from our not being able to comprehend
   adequately the notion of eternity. That the material world is not
   self-existent or necessarily-existing, but the product of some distinct
   superior agent, may (as I have already shown) be strictly demonstrated
   by bare reason against the most obstinate atheist in the world. But the
   time when the world was created, or whether its creation was, properly
   speaking, in time, is not so easy to demonstrate strictly by bare
   reason, (as appears from the opinions of many of the ancient
   philosophers concerning that matter;) but the proof of it can be taken
   only from revelation. To endeavour to prove, that there cannot possibly
   be any such thing as infinite time or space, from the impossibility of
   an addition [40] of finite parts ever composing or exhausting an
   infinite; or from the imaginary inequality of the number of years,
   days, and hours, that would be contained in the one; or of the miles,
   yards, and feet, that would be contained in the other; is supposing
   infinites to be made up of numbers of finites; that is, it is supposing
   finite quantities to be aliquot or constituent parts of infinite; when
   indeed they are not so, but do all equally, whether great or small,
   whether many or few, bear the very same proportion to an infinite, as
   mathematical points do to a line, or lines to a superficies, or as
   moments do to time; that is, none at all. So that, to argue absolutely
   against the possibility of infinite space or time, merely from the
   imaginary inequality of the numbers of their finite parts, which are
   not properly constituent parts, but mere nothings in proportion,--is
   the very same thing as it would be to argue against the possibility of
   the existence of any determinate finite quantity, from the imaginary
   equality or inequality of the number of the mathematical lines and
   points contained therein; when indeed neither the one nor the other
   have (in propriety of speech) any number at all, but they are
   absolutely without number: neither can any given number or quantity be
   any aliquot or constituent part of infinite, or be compared at all with
   it, or bear any kind of proportion to it; or be the foundation of any
   argument in any question concerning it.

   Epist. 69. primæ partis. And his follower Mr. Regis, Mais peutê tre
   (saith he) que je raisonne mal, &c. i. e. But perhaps I argue ill, when
   I conclude that the property my idea hath to represent extension, [that
   is, in the sense of the Cartesians, matter,] comes from extension
   itself as its cause. For, what hinders me from believing that if this
   property comes not from myself, yet at least it may come from some
   spirit [or being] superior to me, which produces in me the idea of
   extension, though extension does not actually exist? Yet when I
   consider the thing attentively, I find that my conclusion is good; and
   that no spirit [or being] how excellent soever, can cause the idea
   which I have of extension to represent to me extension rather than any
   thing else, if extension does not actually exist; because if he should
   do so, the idea which I should then have of extension would not be a
   representation of extension, but a representation of nothing; which is
   impossible. But it may be I still deceive myself, when I say that the
   idea I have of extension supposes an object actually existing. For it
   seems that I have ideas, which do not suppose any object: I have, for
   example, the idea of an enchanted castle; though no such thing really
   exists. Yet when I consider the difficulty still more attentively, I
   find there is this difference between the idea of extension, and that
   of an enchanted castle, that the first, being natural, that is,
   independent on my will, supposes an object which is necessarily such as
   it represents, whereas the other, being artificial, supposes indeed an
   object, but it is not necessary that that object be absolutely such as
   the idea represents, because my will can add to that object, or
   diminish from it, as it pleases, as I have before said, and as shall be
   proved hereafter, when I come to treat of the origin of ideas.--Regis

Proposition IV: The essence of the self-existent Being [is] incomprehensible.

   IV. Proposition IV. The essence of the self-existent Being
   incomprehensible. What the substance or essence of that being, which is
   self-existent, or necessarily-existing, is, we have no idea; neither is
   it at all possible for us to comprehend it. That there is such a being
   actually existing without us, we are sure (as I have already shown) by
   strict and undeniable demonstration. Also what it is not, that is, that
   the material world is not it, as modern atheists would have it, has
   been already demonstrated. But what it is, I mean as to its substance
   and essence, this we are infinitely unable to comprehend. Yet this does
   not in the least diminish the certainty of the demonstration of its
   existence. For it is one thing to know certainly that a being exists;
   and another, to know what the essence of that being is. And the one may
   be capable of the strictest demonstration, when the other is absolutely
   beyond the reach of all our faculties to understand. A blind or deaf
   man has infinitely more reason to deny the being, or the possibility of
   the being, of light or sounds, than any atheist can have to deny, or
   doubt of the existence of God: For the one can, at the utmost, have no
   other proof but credible testimony, of the existence of certain things,
   whereof it is absolutely impossible that he himself should frame any
   manner of idea, not only of their essence, but even of their effects or
   properties; but the other may, with the least use of his reason, be
   assured of the existence of a Supreme Being, by undeniable
   demonstration; and may also certainly know abundance of its attributes,
   (as shall be made appear in the following propositions,) though its
   substance or essence be entirely incomprehensible. Wherefore nothing
   can be more unreasonable and weak, than for an atheist upon this
   account to deny the being of God, merely because his weak and finite
   understanding cannot frame to itself any adequate notion of the
   substance or essence of that first and supreme cause. We are utterly
   ignorant of the substance or essence of all other things; even of those
   things which we converse most familiarly with, and think we understand
   best. There is not so mean and contemptible a plant or animal, that
   does not confound the most enlarged understanding upon earth; nay, even
   the simplest and plainest of all inanimate beings have their essence or
   substance hidden from us in the deepest and most impenetrable
   obscurity. How weak then and foolish is it, to raise objections against
   the being of God from the incomprehensibleness of his essence! And to
   represent it as a strange and incredible thing, that there should exist
   any incorporeal substance, the essence of which we are not able to
   comprehend! As if it were not far more strange, that there should exist
   numberless objects of our senses, things subject to our daily inquiry,
   search, and examination, and yet we not be able, no not in any measure,
   to find out the real essence of any one even of the least of these
   things.

   Nevertheless, it is very necessary to observe here, by the way, that it
   does not at all from hence follow, that there can possibly be, in the
   unknown substance or essence of God, any thing contradictory to our
   clear ideas. For, as a blind man, though he has no idea of light and
   colours, yet knows certainly and infallibly that there cannot possibly
   be any kind of light which is not light, or any sort of colour which is
   not a colour; so, though we have no idea of the substance of God, nor
   indeed of the substance of any other being; yet we are as infallibly
   certain that there cannot possibly be, either in the one or the other,
   any contradictory modes or properties as if we had the clearest and
   most distinct idea of them.

   From what has been said upon this head, we may observe,

   1st. Of infinite space. The weakness of such as have presumed to
   imagine infinite space to be a just representation or adequate idea of
   the essence of the supreme cause. This is a weak imagination, arising
   from hence, that men, using themselves to judge of all things by their
   senses only, fancy spiritual or immaterial substances, because they are
   not objects of their corporeal senses, to be, as it were, mere
   nothings; just as children imagine air, because they cannot see it, to
   be mere emptiness and nothing. But the fallacy is too gross to deserve
   being insisted upon. There are perhaps numberless substances in the
   world, whose essences are as entirely unknown and impossible to be
   represented to our imaginations, as colours are to a man that was born
   blind, or sounds to one that has been always deaf. Nay, there is no
   substance in the world, of which we know any thing further than only a
   certain number of its properties or attributes; of which we know fewer
   in some things, and in others more. Infinite space is nothing else but
   abstract immensity or infinity, even as infinite duration is abstract
   eternity. And it would be just as proper, to say that eternity is the
   essence of the supreme cause, as to say, that immensity is so. Indeed,
   they seem both to be but modes of an essence or substance
   incomprehensible to us; and when we endeavour to represent the real
   substance of any being whatsoever in our weak imaginations, we shall
   find ourselves in like manner deceived.

   2dly. From hence appears the vanity of the schoolmen, The vanity of the
   schoolmen. who, as in other matters, so in their disputes about the
   self-existent being, when they come at what they are by no means able
   to comprehend or explain, lest they should seem ignorant of any thing,
   they give us terms of art, and words of amusement, mere empty sounds,
   which, under pretence of explaining the matter before them, have really
   no manner of idea or signification at all. Thus, when they tell us
   concerning the essence of God, that he is purus actus, mera forma, and
   the like, either the words have no meaning, and signify nothing; or
   else they express only the perfection of his power and other
   attributes; which is not what these men intend to express by them.
     __________________________________________________________________

Proposition V. That the self-existent being must be eternal.

   V. Proposition V. That the self-existent being must be eternal. Though
   the substance or essence of the self-existent being is in itself
   absolutely incomprehensible to us; yet many of the essential attributes
   of his nature are strictly demonstrable, as well as his existence.
   Thus, in the first place, the self-existent being must of necessity be
   eternal. The ideas of eternity and self-existence are so closely
   connected, that, because something must of necessity be eternal
   independently and without any outward cause of its being, therefore it
   must necessarily be self-existent; and, because it is impossible but
   something must be self-existent, therefore it is necessary that it must
   likewise be eternal. To be self-existent, is (as has been already
   shown,) to exist by an absolute necessity in the nature of the thing
   itself. Now this necessity being absolute, and not depending upon any
   thing external, must be always unalterably the same; nothing being
   alterable but what is capable of being affected by somewhat without
   itself. That being, therefore, which has no other cause of its
   existence but the absolute necessity of its own nature, must of
   necessity have existed from everlasting, without beginning; and must of
   necessity exist to everlasting without end.

   As Of the manner of our conceiving the eternity of God. to the manner
   of this eternal existence: it is manifest, it herein infinitely
   transcends the manner of the existence of all created beings, even of
   such as shall exist for ever; that whereas it is not possible for their
   finite minds to comprehend all that is past, or to understand perfectly
   all things that are at present, much less to know all that is future,
   or to have entirely in their power any thing that is to come; but their
   thoughts, and knowledge, and power must of necessity have degrees and
   periods, and be successive and transient as the things themselves. The
   eternal supreme cause, on the contrary, (supposing him to be an
   intelligent being, which will hereafter be proved in the sequel of this
   discourse,) must of necessity have such a perfect, independent, and
   unchangeable comprehension of all things, that there can be no one
   point or instant of his eternal duration, wherein all things that are
   past, present, or to come, will not be as entirely known and
   represented to him in one single thought or view; and all things
   present and future be equally entirely in his power and direction as if
   there was really no succession at all, but all things were actually
   present at once. Thus far we can speak intelligibly concerning the
   eternal duration of the self-existent being; and no atheist can say
   this is an impossible, absurd, or insufficient account. It is, in the
   most proper and intelligible sense of the words, to all the purposes of
   excellency and perfection, interminabilis vitæ tota simul et perfecta
   possessio; the entire and perfect possession of an endless life.

   Others With respect to succession. have supposed that the difference
   between the manner of the eternal existence of the supreme cause, and
   that of the existence of created beings, is this: that, whereas the
   latter is a continual transient succession of duration, the former is
   one point or instant comprehending eternity, and wherein all things are
   really co-existent. But this distinction I shall not now insist upon,
   as being of no use in the present dispute, because it is impossible to
   prove and explain it in such a manner as ever to convince an atheist
   that there is any thing in it; and besides, as, on the one hand, the
   schoolmen have indeed generally chosen to defend it, so, on the other
   hand, [41] there are many learned men, of far better understanding and
   judgment, who have rejected and opposed it.

   trouble you with the inconsistent and unintelligible notions of the
   schoolmen; that it [the eternity of God] is duratio tota simul, in
   which we are not to conceive any succession, but to imagine it an
   instant. We may as well conceive the immensity of God to be a point, as
   his eternity to be an instant.--And how that can be together, which
   must necessarily be imagined to be co-existent to successions, let them

   say, God sees and knows future things, by the presentiality and

   jargon and canting language. I envy no man the understanding these
   phrases; but to me they seem to signify nothing, but to have been words
   invented by idle and conceited men, which a great many ever since, lest
   they should seem to be ignorant, would seem to understand. But I wonder
   most, that men, when they have amused and puzzled themselves and others
   with hard words, should call this explaining things.--Archbishop

Proposition VI. That the self-existent being must be infinite and omnipresent.

   VI. Proposition VI. That the self-existent being must be infinite and
   omnipresent. The self-existent Being must of necessity be infinite and
   omnipresent. The idea of infinity or immensity, as well as of eternity,
   is so closely connected with that of self-existence, that, because it
   is impossible but something must be infinite independently and of
   itself, (for else it would be impossible there should be any infinite
   at all, unless an effect could be perfecter than its cause,) therefore
   it must of necessity be self-existent: and because something must of
   necessity be self-existent, therefore it is necessary that it must
   likewise be infinite. To be self-existent (as has been already shown,)
   is to exist by an absolute necessity in the nature of the thing itself.
   Now, this necessity being absolute in itself, and not depending on any
   outward cause, it is evident it must be everywhere as well as always,
   unalterbly the same. For a necessity, which is not everywhere the same,
   is plainly a consequential necessity only, depending upon some external
   cause, and not an absolute one in its own nature; for a necessity
   absolutely such in itself, has no relation to time or place, or any
   thing else. Whatever therefore exists by an absolute necessity in its
   own nature, must needs be infinite as well as eternal. To suppose a
   finite being to be self-existent, is to say that it is a contradiction
   for that being not to exist, the absence of which may yet be conceived
   without a contradiction; which is the greatest absurdity in the world.
   For if a being can, without a contradiction, be absent from one place,
   it may, without a contradiction, be absent likewise from another place,
   and from all places: and whatever necessity it may have of existing,
   must arise from some external cause, and not absolutely from itself;
   and, consequently, the being cannot be self-existent.

   From hence it follows,

   1st. That the infinity of the self-existent being must be an infinity
   of fulness as well as of immensity; that is, it must not only be
   without limits, but also without diversity, defect, or interruption:
   For instance; could matter be supposed boundless, it would not
   therefore follow that it was in this complete sense infinite; because,
   though it had no limits, yet it might have within itself many
   assignable vacuities. But whatever is self-existent, must of necessity
   exist absolutely in every place alike, and be equally present
   everywhere; and consequently must have a true and absolute infinity,
   both of immensity and fulness.

   2dly. From hence it follows, that the self-existent being must be a
   most simple, unchangeable, incorruptible being; without parts, figure,
   motion, divisibility, or any other such properties as we find in
   matter. For all these things do plainly and necessarily imply
   finiteness in their very notion, and are utterly inconsistent with
   complete infinity. Divisibility is a separation of parts, real or
   mental: meaning, by mental separation, not barely a partial
   apprehending, (for space, for instance, which is absolutely indivisible
   and inseparable, either really or mentally, may yet be partially
   apprehended; [42] but a removing, disjoining or separating of parts one
   from another, even so much as in the imagination. And any such
   separation or removing of parts, one from another, is really or
   mentally a setting of bounds; either of which destroys infinity.
   Motion, for the same reason, implies finiteness; and to have parts,
   properly speaking, signifies either difference and diversity of
   existence, which is inconsistent with necessity; or else it signifies
   divisibility, real or mental as before, which is inconsistent with
   complete infinity. Corruption, change, or any alteration whatsoever,
   implies motion, separation of parts, and finiteness. And any manner of
   composition, in opposition to the most perfect simplicity, signifies
   difference and diversity in the manner of existence, which is
   inconsistent with necessity.

   It is evident, Of the manner of our conceiving the immensity of God.
   therefore, that the self-existent being must be infinite in the
   strictest and most complete sense. But as to the particular manner of
   his being infinite or everywhere present, in opposition to the manner
   of created things being present in such or such finite places; this is
   as impossible for our finite understandings to comprehend or explain,
   as it is for us to form an adequate idea of infinity. Yet that the
   thing is true, that he is actually omnipresent, we are as certain as we
   are that there must something be infinite, which no man who has thought
   upon these things at all ever denied. The schoolmen, indeed, have
   presumed to assert that the immensity of God is a point, as his
   eternity (they think) is an instant. But this being altogether
   unintelligible, that which we can more safely affirm, and which no
   atheist can say is absurd, and which nevertheless is sufficient to all
   wise and good purposes, is this: that whereas all finite and created
   beings can be present but in one definite place at once, and corporeal
   beings even in that one place very imperfectly and unequally, to any
   purpose of power or activity, only by the successive motion of
   different members and organs; the Supreme Cause, on the contrary, being
   an infinite and most simple essence, and comprehending all things
   perfectly in himself, is at all times equally present, both in his
   simple essence, and by the immediate and perfect exercise of all his
   attributes, to every point of the boundless immensity, as if it were
   really all but one single point.

Proposition VII. That the self-existent being can be but one.

   VII. Proposition VII. That the self-existent being can be but one. The
   self-existent being must of necessity be but one. This evidently
   follows from his being necessarily-existent: for necessity absolute, in
   itself, is simple and uniform and universal, without any possible
   difference, difformity, or variety whatsoever: and all variety or
   difference of existence must needs arise from some external cause, and
   be dependent upon it, and proportionable to the efficiency of that
   cause, whatsoever it be. Absolute necessity, in which there can be no
   variation in any kind or degree, cannot be the ground of existence of a
   number of beings, however similar and agreeing: because, without any
   other difference, even number is itself a manifest difformity or
   inequality (if I may so speak) of efficiency or causality.

   Again: To suppose two (or more) distinct beings existing of themselves,
   necessarily, and independent from each other, implies this plain
   contradiction; that each of them being independent from the other, they
   may either of them be supposed to exist alone, so that it will be no
   contradiction to imagine the other not to exist; and consequently
   neither of them [43] will be necessarily-existing. Whatsoever therefore
   exists necessarily, is the one simple essence of the self-existent
   being; and whatsoever differs from that, is not necessarily-existing;
   because in absolute necessity there can be no difference or diversity
   of existence. Other beings there may be innumerable, besides the one
   infinite self-existent: but no other being can be self-existent,
   because so it would be individually the same, at the same time that it
   is supposed to be different.

   From hence it follows,

   1st. Of the Trinity. That the unity of God is a true and real, not
   figurative unity. With which prime foundation of natural religion, how
   the scripture-doctrine of the Trinity perfectly agrees I have elsewhere
   endeavoured to show particularly, in its proper place.

   2dly. The impossibility of two independent principles. From hence it
   follows, that it is impossible there should be two different
   self-existent independent principles, as some philosophers have
   imagined; such as God and matter. For, since self-existence is
   necessary-existence, and since it is an express contradiction, (as has
   already been shown,) that two different beings should each be
   necessarily-existing; it evidently follows, that it is absolutely
   impossible there should be two independent self-existent principles,
   such as God and matter.

   3dly. The error of Spinoza. From hence we may observe the vanity,
   folly, and weakness of Spinoza; who, because the self-existent being
   must necessarily be but one, concludes from thence, [44] that the whole
   world, and every thing contained therein, is one uniform substance,
   eternal, uncreated, and necessary: whereas, just on the contrary, he
   ought to have concluded, that, because all things in the world are very
   different one from another, and have all manner of variety, and all the
   marks of will and arbitrariness and changeableness, (and none of
   necessity) in them, being plainly fitted with very different powers to
   very different ends, and distinguished one from another by a diversity,
   not only of modes, but also of essential attributes, and consequently
   (so far as it is possible for us, by the use of our present faculties,
   to attain any knowledge at all of them) of their substances themselves
   also; therefore none of these things are necessary or self-existent,
   but must needs depend all upon some external cause, that is, on the one
   supreme, unchangeable, self-existent being. That which led Spinoza into
   his foolish and destructive opinion, and on which alone all his
   argumentation is entirely built, is that absurd definition of
   substance, [45] that it is something, the idea of which does not depend
   on, or presuppose the idea of any other thing, from which it might
   proceed; but includes in itself necessary-existence. Which definition
   is either false, and signifies nothing; and then his whole doctrine
   built upon it falls at once to the ground: Or, if it be true, then
   neither matter nor spirit, nor any finite being whatsoever, (as has
   been before shown,) is in that sense properly a substance, but (the ho
   on) the self-existent being alone: and so it will prove nothing
   (notwithstanding all his show and form of demonstration,) to his main
   purpose, which was to make us believe that there is no such thing as
   power or liberty in the universe, but that every particular thing [46]
   in the world is by an absolute necessity just what it is, and could not
   possibly have been in any respect otherwise. Supposing, I say, his
   definition of substance to be true, yet even that would really conclude
   nothing to his main purpose concerning the necessity of all things. For
   since, according to that definition, neither matter nor spirit, nor any
   finite beings whatsoever, are substances, but only modes; how will it
   follow, that, because substance is self-existent, therefore all these
   modes are so too? Why, because, [47] from an infinite cause infinite
   effects must needs follow. Very true, supposing that infinite
   self-existent cause not to be a voluntary, but a mere necessary agent,
   that is, no agent at all: and supposing also, that in mere necessity
   there could and must be all or any variety. Both which suppositions (in
   the present argument) are the question begged: and what he afterwards
   attempts to allege in proof of them, shall afterwards be considered in
   its proper place.

Proposition VIII. That the self-existent being must be intelligent.

   VIII. Proposition VIII. That the self-existent being must be
   intelligent. The self-existent and original cause of all things must be
   an intelligent being. In this proposition lies the main question
   between us and the atheists. For, that something must be self-existent,
   and that that which is self-existent must necessarily be eternal and
   infinite, and the original cause of all things, will not bear much
   dispute.--But all atheists, whether they hold the world to be of itself
   eternal both as to the matter and form, or whether they hold the matter
   only to be necessary and the form contingent, or whatever hypothesis
   they frame, have always asserted, and must maintain, either directly or
   indirectly, that the self-existent being is not an intelligent being,
   but either pure unactive matter, or (which in other words is the very
   same thing) a mere necessary agent. For a mere necessary agent must of
   necessity either be plainly and directly in the grossest sense
   unintelligent; which was the ancient atheist's notion of the
   self-existent being: or else its intelligence (which is the assertion
   of Spinoza and some moderns,) must be wholly separate from any power of
   will and choice; which, in respect of any excellency and perfection, or
   indeed to any common sense, is the very same thing as no intelligence
   at all.

   Now, that the self-existent being is not such a blind and unintelligent
   necessity, but in the most proper sense an understanding and really
   active being, does not indeed so obviously and directly appear to us by
   considerations a priori; because (through the imperfection of our
   faculties) we know not wherein intelligence consists, nor can see the
   immediate and necessary connexion of it with self-existence, as we can
   that of eternity, infinity, unity, &c. But, a posteriori, almost every
   thing in the world demonstrates to us this great truth, and affords
   undeniable arguments to prove that the world, and all things therein,
   are the effects of an intelligent and knowing cause.

   And 1st. Proved from the degrees of perfection in things, and the order
   of causes and effects. Since in general there are manifestly in things
   various kinds of powers, and very different excellencies and degrees of
   perfection, it must needs be, that, in the order of causes and effects,
   the cause must always be more excellent than the effect: and
   consequently the self-existent being, whatever that be supposed to be,
   must of necessity (being the original of all things) contain in itself
   the sum and highest degree of all the perfections of all things: not
   because that which is self-existent must therefore have all possible
   perfections; (for this, though most certainly true in itself, yet
   cannot be so easily demonstrated a priori;) but because it is
   impossible that any effect should have any perfection, which was not in
   the cause. For, if it had, then that perfection would be caused by
   nothing; which is a plain contradiction. Now an unintelligent being, it
   is evident, cannot be indued with all the perfections of all things in
   the world; because intelligence is one of those perfections. All
   things, therefore, cannot arise from an unintelligent original; and
   consequently the self-existent being, must, of necessity, be
   intelligent.

   There is no possibility for an atheist to avoid the force of this
   argument any other way than by asserting one of these two things:
   either that there is no intelligent being at all in the universe; or
   that intelligence is no distinct perfection, but merely a composition
   of figure and motion, as colour and sounds are vulgarly supposed to be.
   Of the former of these assertions, every man's own consciousness is an
   abundant confutation. For they who contend that beasts are mere
   machines, have yet never presumed to conjecture that men are so too.
   And that the latter assertion (in which the main strength of atheism
   lies,) is most absurd and impossible, shall be shown presently; though
   if that assertion could be supposed to be true, yet even still it would
   unavoidably follow, that the self-existent being must needs be
   intelligent; as shall be proved in my fourth argument upon this present
   head. In the meantime, that the assertion itself, viz. that
   intelligence is not any distinct perfection, properly speaking, but
   merely a composition of unintelligent figure and motion; that this
   assertion, I say, is most absurd and impossible, will appear from what
   shall be said in the ensuing argument.

   2dly. From the intelligence that is in created beings. Since in men in
   particular there is undeniably that power, which we call thought,
   intelligence, consciousness, perception or knowledge; there must of
   necessity either have been from eternity, without any original cause at
   all, an infinite succession of men, whereof no one has had a necessary,
   but every one a dependent and communicated being; or else these beings,
   indued with perception and consciousness, must at some time or other
   have arisen purely out of that which had no such quality as sense,
   perception, or consciousness; or else they must have been produced by
   some intelligent superior being. There never was nor can be any atheist
   whatsoever, that can deny but one of these three suppositions must be
   the truth. If, therefore, the two former can be proved to be false and
   impossible, the latter must be owned to be demonstrably true. Now, that
   the first is impossible, is evident from what has been already said in
   proof of the second general head of this discourse; and that the second
   is likewise impossible, may be thus demonstrated: If perception, or
   intelligence, be a distinct quality or perfection, and not a mere
   effect or composition of unintelligent figure and motion, then beings
   indued with perception or consciousness can never have arisen purely
   out of that which had no such quality as perception or consciousness;
   because nothing can ever give to another any perfection, which it hath
   not either actually in itself, or at least in a higher degree. But
   perception or intelligence is a distinct quality or perfection, and not
   a mere effect or composition of unintelligent figure and motion.

   First: If perception or intelligence be any real distinct quality, or
   perfection, and not a mere effect or composition of unintelligent
   figure and motion, then beings indued with perception or consciousness
   can never possibly have arisen purely out of that which itself had no
   such quality as perception or consciousness; because nothing can ever
   give to another any perfection which it hath not either actually in
   itself, or at least in a higher degree. This is very evident; because,
   if any thing could give to another any perfection which it has not
   itself, that perfection would be caused absolutely by nothing; which is
   a plain contradiction. If any one here replies, (as Mr Gildon has done
   [48] in a letter to Mr Blount,) that colours, sounds, tastes, and the
   like, arise from figure and motion, which have no such qualities in
   themselves; or that figure, divisibility, mobility, and other qualities
   of matter, are confessed to be given from God, who yet cannot, without
   extreme blasphemy, be said to have any such qualities himself; and that
   therefore, in like manner, perception [49] or intelligence may arise
   out of that which has no intelligence itself; the answer is very
   easy,--first, that colours, sounds, tastes, and the like, are by no
   means effects arising from mere figure and motion; there being nothing
   in the bodies themselves, the objects of the senses, that has any
   manner of similitude to any of these qualities; but they are plainly
   thoughts or modifications of the mind itself, which is an intelligent
   being; and are not properly caused, but only occasioned, by the
   impressions of figure and motion. Nor will it at all help an atheist,
   (as to the present question) though we should here make for him, (that
   we may allow him the greatest possible advantage,) even that most
   absurd supposition, that the mind itself is nothing but mere matter and
   not at all an immaterial substance. For, even supposing it to be mere
   matter, yet he must needs confess it to be such matter as is indued not
   only with figure and motion, but also with the quality of intelligence
   and perception; and consequently, as to the present question, it will
   still come to the same thing, that colours, sounds, and the like, which
   are not qualities of unintelligent bodies, but perceptions of mind, can
   no more be caused by, or arise from mere unintelligent figure and
   motion, than colour can be a triangle, or sound a square, or something
   be caused by nothing. Secondly, as to the other part of the objection;
   that figure, divisibility, mobility, and other qualities of matter, are
   (as we ourselves acknowledge) given it from God, who yet cannot,
   without extreme blasphemy, be said to have any such qualities himself;
   and that therefore, in like manner, perception or intelligence may
   arise out of that which has no intelligence itself; the answer is still
   easier: That figure, divisibility, mobility, and other such like
   qualities of matter, are not real, proper, distinct, and positive
   powers, but only negative qualities, deficiencies, or imperfections.
   And though no cause can communicate to its effect any real perfection
   which it has not itself, yet the effect may easily have many
   imperfections, deficiencies, or negative qualities, which are not in
   the cause. Though, therefore, figure, divisibility, mobility, and the
   like, (which are mere negations, as all limitations and all defects of
   powers are,) may be in the effect, and not in the cause; yet
   intelligence, (which I now suppose, and shall prove immediately, to be
   a distinct quality, and which no man can say is a mere negation,)
   cannot possibly be so.

   Having therefore thus demonstrated, that if perception or intelligence
   be supposed to be a distinct quality or perfection, (though even but of
   matter only, if the atheist pleases,) and not a mere effect or
   composition of unintelligent figure and motion; then beings indued with
   perception or consciousness can never have arisen purely out of that
   which had no such quality as perception or consciousness; because
   nothing can ever give to another any perfection which it has not
   itself. It will easily appear, secondly, that perception or
   intelligence is really such a distinct quality or perfection, and not
   possibly a mere effect or composition of unintelligent figure and
   motion; and that for this plain reason, because intelligence is not
   figure, and consciousness is not motion: For whatever can arise from,
   or be compounded of any things, is still only those very things of
   which it was compounded. And if infinite compositions or divisions be
   made eternally, the things will still be but eternally the same; and
   all their possible effects can never be any thing but repetitions of
   the same. For instance, all possible changes, compositions, or
   divisions of figure, are still nothing but figure; and all possible
   compositions or effects of motion can eternally be nothing but mere
   motion. If, therefore, there ever was a time when there was nothing in
   the universe but matter and motion, there never could have been any
   thing else therein but matter and motion. And it would have been as
   impossible there should ever have existed any such thing as
   intelligence or consciousness, or even any such thing as light, or
   heat, or sound, or colour, or any of those we call secondary qualities
   of matter, as it is now impossible for motion to be blue or red, or for
   a triangle to be transformed into a sound. That which has been apt to
   deceive men in this matter is this; that they imagine compounds to be
   somewhat really different from that of which they are compounded: which
   is a very great mistake. For all the things of which men so judge,
   either, if they be really different, are not compounds nor effects of
   what men judge them to be, but are something totally distinct; as, when
   the vulgar think colours and sounds to be properties inherent in
   bodies, when indeed they are purely thoughts of the mind: or else, if
   they be really compounds and effects, then they are not different, but
   exactly the same that ever they were; as, when two triangles put
   together make a square, that square is still nothing but two triangles;
   or when a square cut in halves makes two triangles, those two triangles
   are still only the two halves of a square; or when the mixture of a
   blue and yellow powder makes a green, that green is still nothing but
   blue and yellow intermixed, as is plainly visible by the help of
   microscopes. See my letter to Mr. Dodwell, with the four defences of
   it. And in short, every thing, by composition, division, or motion, is
   nothing else but the very same it was before, taken either in whole or
   in parts, or in different place or order. He therefore that will affirm
   intelligence to be the effect of a system of unintelligent matter in
   motion, must either affirm intelligence to be a mere name or external
   denomination of certain figures and motions, and that it differs from
   unintelligent figures and motions, no otherwise than as a circle or
   triangle differs from a square; which is evidently absurd: or else he
   must suppose it to be a real distinct quality, arising from certain
   motions of a system of matter not in itself intelligent; and then this
   no less evidently absurd consequence would follow, that one quality
   inherred in another; for, in that case, not the substance itself, the
   particles of which the system consists, but the mere mode, the
   particular mode of motion and figure, would be intelligent. Mr. Hobbes
   seems to have been aware of this: and therefore, though he is very
   sparing, and as it were ashamed to speak out, yet finding himself
   pressed, in his own mind, with the difficulty arising from the
   impossibility of sense or consciousness being merely the effect of
   figure and motion, and it not serving his purpose at all, (were the
   thing never so possible,) to suppose that God, by an immediate and
   voluntary act of his almighty power indues certain systems of matter
   with consciousness and thought, (of which opinion I shall have occasion
   to speak something more hereafter,) he is forced [50] to have recourse
   to that prodigiously absurd supposition that all matter, as matter, is
   indued not only with figure and a capacity of motion, but also with an
   actual sense of perception; and wants only the organs and memory of
   animals to express its sensation.

   3dly. From the beauty, order, and final causes of things. See Mr.
   Boyle, of Final Causes; & Mr Ray, of the Wisdom of God in the Creation;
   and Mr. Derham's Physico-Theology. That the self-existent and original
   cause of all things is an intelligent being, appears abundantly from
   the excellent variety, order, beauty, and wonderful contrivance and
   fitness of all things in the world to their proper and respective ends.
   This argument has been so learnedly and fully handled both by ancient
   and modern writers, that I do but just mention it, without enlarging at
   all upon it. I shall only at this time make this one observation; That,
   whereas Des Cartes and others have endeavoured to give a possible
   account, (possible, did I say? nay, indeed, a most impossible and
   ridiculous account,) how the world might be formed by the necessary
   laws of motion alone; [51] they have, by so seemingly vast an
   undertaking, really meant no more than to explain philosophically how
   the inanimate part, that is, infinitely the least considerable part of
   the world, might possibly have been framed. For as to plants and
   animals, in which the wisdom of the Creator principally appears, they
   have never, in any tolerable manner, or with any the least appearance
   of success, pretended to give an account how they were originally
   formed. In these things, matter and the laws of motion are able to do
   nothing at all. And how ridiculous the Epicurean hypothesis is, of the
   earth producing them all at first by chance, (besides that, I think, it
   is now given up even by all atheists;) appears from the late discovery
   made in philosophy, that there is no such thing as equivocal generation
   of any the meanest animal or plant; the sun, and earth and water, and
   all the powers of nature in conjunction, being able to do nothing at
   all towards the producing any thing indued with so much as even a
   vegetable life. (From which most excellent discovery we may, by the
   way, observe the usefulness of natural and experimental philosophy,
   sometimes even in matters of religion.) Since therefore things are
   thus, it must unavoidably be granted (even by the most obstinate
   atheist,) either that all plants and animals are originally the work of
   an intelligent being, and created by him in time; or that, having been
   from eternity in the same order and method they are now in, they are an
   eternal effect of an eternal intelligent cause, continually exerting
   his infinite power and wisdom; or else, that, without any self-existent
   original at all, they have been derived one from another in an eternal
   succession, by an infinite progress of dependent causes. The first of
   these three ways is the conclusion we assert: the second, (so far as
   the cause of atheism is concerned,) comes to the very same thing: and
   the third I have already shown, (in my proof of the second general head
   of this discourse,) to be absolutely impossible, and a contradiction.

   4thly. From the original of motion. Supposing it was possible that the
   form of the world, and all the visible things contained therein, with
   the order, beauty, and exquisite fitness of their parts; nay, supposing
   that even intelligence itself, with consciousness and thought, in all
   the beings we know, could possibly be the result or effect of mere
   unintelligent matter, figure, and motion; (which is the most
   unreasonable and impossible supposition in the world;) yet even still
   there would remain an undeniable demonstration, that the self-existent
   being, (whatever it be supposed to be,) must be intelligent. For even
   these principles themselves [unintelligent figure and motion] could
   never have possibly existed without there had been before them an
   intelligent cause. I instance in motion:--It is evident there is now
   such a thing as motion in the world; which either began at some time or
   other, or was eternal. If it began at any time, then the question is
   granted, that the first cause is an intelligent being; for mere
   unintelligent matter, and that at rest, it is manifest could never of
   itself begin to move. On the contrary, if motion was eternal, it was
   either eternally caused by some eternal intelligent being, or it must
   of itself be necessary and self-existent; or else, without any
   necessity in its own nature, and without any external necessary cause,
   it must have existed from eternity by an endless successive
   communication. If motion was eternally caused by some eternal
   intelligent being, this also is granting the question, as to the
   present dispute. If it was of itself necessary and self-existent, then
   it follows, that it must be a contradiction in terms to suppose any
   matter to be at rest: and yet at the same time, because the
   determination of this self-existent motion must be every way at once,
   the effect of it could be nothing else but a perpetual rest. Besides,
   (as there is no end of absurdities, when they once begin,) it must also
   imply a contradiction, to suppose that there might possibly have been
   originally more or less motion in the universe than there actually was:
   which is so very absurd a consequence, that Spinoza himself, though he
   expressly asserts all things to be necessary, yet seems ashamed here
   [52] to speak out his opinion, or rather plainly contradicts himself in
   the question about the original of motion. But if it be said, lastly,
   that motion, without any necessity in its own nature, and without any
   external necessary cause, has existed from eternity, merely by an
   endless successive communication, as [53] Spinoza, inconsistently
   enough, seems to assert: This I have before shown, (in my proof of the
   second general proposition of this discourse,) to be a plain
   contradiction. It remains, therefore, that motion must of necessity be
   originally caused by something that is intelligent, or else there never
   could have been any such thing as motion in the world; and consequently
   the self-existent being, the original cause of all things, (whatever it
   be supposed to be,) must of necessity be an intelligent being.

   From hence it follows again, that the material world cannot possibly be
   the original self-existent being: For, since the self-existent being is
   demonstrated to be intelligent, and the material world plainly is not
   so, it follows that the material world cannot possibly be
   self-existent. What some have fondly imagined concerning a soul of the
   world, if thereby they mean a created, dependent being, signifies
   nothing in the present argument: But if they understand thereby
   something necessary and self-existent, then it is nothing else but a
   false, corrupt, and imperfect notion of God.

Proposition IX. That the self-existent being must be a free agent.

   IX. Proposition IX. That the self-existent being must be a free agent.
   The self-existent and original cause of all things, is not a necessary
   agent but a being indued with liberty and choice. The contrary to this
   proposition is the foundation and the sum of what Spinoza and his
   followers have asserted concerning the nature of God. What reasons or
   arguments they have offered for their opinion I shall have occasion to
   consider briefly in my proof of the proposition itself. The truth of
   which appears--

   1st. This a necessary consequent of the foregoing proposition. In that
   it is a necessary consequence of the foregoing proposition. For
   intelligence without liberty (as I there hinted) is really (in respect
   of any power, excellence, or perfection,) no intelligence at all: It is
   indeed a consciousness, but it is merely a passive one; a
   consciousness, not of acting, but purely of being acted upon. Without
   liberty, nothing can, in any tolerable propriety of speech, be said to
   be an agent, or cause of any thing. For to act necessarily, is really
   and properly not to act at all, but only to be acted upon. What
   therefore Spinoza and his followers assert, concerning the production
   of all things [54] from the necessity of the divine nature, is mere
   jargon and words, without any meaning at all. For if, by the necessity
   of the divine nature, they understand not the perfection and rectitude
   of his will, whereby God is unalterably determined to do always what is
   best in the whole, (as confessedly they do not, because this is
   consistent with the most perfect liberty and choice,) but, on the
   contrary, mean an absolute and strictly natural necessity; it follows
   evidently, that when they say God, by the necessity of his nature, is
   the cause and author of all things, they understand him to be a cause
   or agent in no other sense than as if a man should say, that a stone,
   by the necessity of its nature, is the cause of its own falling and
   striking the ground, which is really not to be an agent or cause at
   all; but their opinion amounts to this, that all things are equally
   self-existent, and consequently that the material world is God; which I
   have before proved to be a contradiction. In like manner, when they
   speak of the intelligence and knowledge of God, they mean to attribute
   these powers to him in no other sense than the ancient Hylozoicks
   attributed them to all matter; See a very remarkable passage of Mr
   Hobbes, cited above page 53. that is, that a stone, when it falls, has
   a sensation and consciousness, but that that consciousness is no cause
   at all, or power of acting; which kind of intelligence, in any
   tolerable propriety of speech, is no intelligence at all: And,
   consequently, the arguments that proved the supreme cause to be
   properly an intelligent and active being do also undeniably prove that
   he is likewise indued with liberty and choice, which alone is the power
   of acting.

   2dly. Proved farther from the arbitrary disposition of things in the
   world; with an answer to Spinoza's arguments for the necessity of all
   things. If the supreme cause is not a being indued with liberty and
   choice, but a mere necessary agent, whose actions are all as absolutely
   and naturally necessary as his existence, then, it will follow, that
   nothing which is not, could possibly have been; and that nothing which
   is, could possibly not have been; and that no mode or circumstance of
   the existence of any thing could possibly have been in any respect
   otherwise than it now actually is: All which being evidently most false
   and absurd, it follows, on the contrary, that the supreme cause is not
   a mere necessary agent, but a being indued with liberty and choice.

   The consequence, [55] viz. that if the supreme cause be a necessary
   agent, then nothing which is not, could possibly have been; and nothing
   which is, could possibly either not have been, or have been different
   from what it is: This, I say, is expressly owned by Spinoza to be the
   unavoidable consequence of his own opinion. And, accordingly, he
   endeavours to maintain, that no thing, or mode of existence of any
   thing, could possibly have been in any respect different from what it
   now actually is. His reasons are; (1) because [56] from an infinitely
   perfect nature, infinite things in infinite manners, must needs
   proceed; and (2.) [57] because, if any thing could possibly be
   otherwise than it is, the will and nature of God must be supposed
   capable of change; and (3.) [58] because if all possible things in all
   possible manners do not always and necessarily exist, they never can
   all exist; but some things, that do not exist, will still always be
   possible only, and never can actually exist; and so the actual
   omnipotence of God is taken away. The first of these arguments is a
   plain begging of the question; For, that an infinitely perfect nature
   is able indeed to produce infinite things in infinite manners, is
   certainly true; but that it must always actually do so, by an absolute
   necessity of nature, without any power of choice, either as to time or
   manner or circumstances, does by no means follow from the perfection of
   its nature, unless it be first supposed to be a necessary agent; and
   also, that in mere necessity there must be all (or can be any) variety.
   Both which suppositions are the very question begged that was to be
   proved. The second argument, is (if possible) still weaker: for how
   does it follow, if God, according to his eternal unerring purpose and
   infinite wisdom, produces different things at different times, and in
   different manners, that, therefore, the will and nature of God is
   changeable? It might exactly as well be argued, that if God (according
   to Spinoza's supposition, does always necessarily produce all possible
   differences and varieties of things, therefore his will and nature is
   always necessarily infinitely various, unequal, and dissimilar to
   itself. And as to the third argument, (which is mere metaphysical
   trifling,) it is just such reasoning as if a man should argue, that if
   all possible [eternal] duration be not always actually exhausted, it
   never can be all exhausted; and that therefore so the eternity of God
   is taken away; which sort of arguing every one at first sight discerns
   the weakness of.

   But whatever the arguments were, and if they were never so much more
   plausible than they really are, yet the assertion itself, viz. that no
   thing, or mode of existence of any thing, could possibly have been made
   in any respect different from what it actually is; is so palpably
   absurd and false, so contradictory to experience and the nature of
   things, and to the most obvious and common reason of mankind; that of
   itself it immediately, and upon the first hearing, sufficiently
   confutes any principle of which it is a consequence. For all things in
   the world appear plainly to be the most arbitrary that can be imagined;
   and to be wholly the effects not of necessity, but of wisdom and
   choice. A necessity indeed of fitness; that is, that things could not
   have been otherwise than they are, without diminishing the beauty,
   order, and well-being of the whole; there may be, and (as far as we can
   apprehend) there certainly is. But this is so far from serving our
   adversaries' purpose, that, on the contrary, it is a direct
   demonstration that all things were made and ordered by a free and wise
   agent. That, therefore, which I affirm, contradictory to Spinoza's
   assertion, is, that there is not the least appearance of an absolute
   necessity of nature, (so as that any variation would imply a
   contradiction,) in any of these things. Motion itself, and all its
   quantities and directions, with the laws of gravitation, are entirely
   arbitrary; and might possibly have been altogether different from what
   they now are. The number and motion of the heavenly bodies have no
   manner of necessity in the nature of the things themselves. The number
   of the planets might have been greater or less. Their motion upon their
   own axes might have been in any proportion swifter or slower then it
   now is. And the direction of all their progressive motions, both of the
   primary and secondary planets, uniformly from west to east, (when by
   the motion of comets [59] it appears there was no necessity but that
   they might as easily have moved in all imaginable transverse
   directions,) is an evident proof that these things are solely the
   effect of wisdom and choice. There is not the least appearance of
   necessity, but that all these things might possibly have been
   infinitely varied from their present constitution: and (as the late
   improvements in astronomy discover) they are actually liable to very
   great changes. Every thing upon earth is still more evidently
   arbitrary; and plainly the product, not of necessity, but will. What
   absolute necessity for just such a number of species of animals or
   plants? or who, without blushing, dare affirm, [60] that neither the
   form, nor order, nor any the minutest circumstance or mode of existence
   of any of these things could possibly have been in the least
   diversified by the supreme cause?

   To give but one instance. In all the greater species of animals, where
   was the necessity for that conformity [61] we observe in the number and
   likeness of all their principal members? and how would it have been a
   contradiction to suppose any or all of them varied from what they now
   are? To suppose indeed the continuance of such monsters, as Lucretius
   imagines to have perished for want of their principal organs of life,
   is really a contradiction. But how would it have been a contradiction
   for a whole species of horses or oxen to have subsisted with six legs
   or four eyes? But it is a shame to insist longer upon so plain an
   argument.

   It might have been objected with much more plausibleness, that the
   supreme cause cannot be free, because he must needs do always what is
   best in the whole. But this would not at all serve Spinoza's purpose.
   For this is a necessity, not of nature and fate, but of fitness and
   wisdom; a necessity, consistent with the greatest freedom and most
   perfect choice. For the only foundation of this necessity is such an
   unalterable rectitude of will, and perfection of wisdom, as makes it
   impossible for a wise being to resolve to act foolishly; or for a
   nature infinitely good, to choose to do what is evil: Of which I shall
   have occasion to speak more hereafter, when I come to deduce the moral
   attributes of God.

   3dly. The same proved also from final causes. If there be any final
   cause, of any thing in the universe, then the supreme cause is not a
   necessary but a free agent. This consequence also, Spinoza acknowledges
   to be unvoidable: And therefore he has no other way left, but, with a
   strange confidence, to expose all final causes, [62] as the fictions of
   ignorant and superstitious men: and to laugh [63] at those who are so
   foolish and childish as to fancy that eyes were designed and fitted to
   see with, teeth to chew with, food to be eaten for nourishment, the sun
   to give light, &c. I suppose it will not be thought, that when once a
   man comes to this, he is to be disputed with any longer. Whoever
   pleases, may, for satisfaction on this head, consult Galen de Usu
   Partium, Tully de Natura Deorum, Mr Boyle of Final Causes, and Mr Ray
   of the Wisdom of God in the Creation. I shall only observe this one
   thing; that the larger the improvements and discoveries are, which are
   daily made in astronomy and natural philosophy, the more clearly is
   this question continually determined, to the shame and confusion of
   atheists.

   4thly. From the finiteness of created beings. If the supreme cause be a
   mere necessary agent, it is impossible any effect or product of that
   cause should be finite. For since that which acts necessarily, cannot
   govern or direct its own actions, but must necessarily produce whatever
   can be the effect or product of its nature, it is plain, every effect
   of such an infinite uniform nature acting everywhere necessarily alike,
   must of necessity be immense, or infinite in extension: and so no
   creature in the universe could possibly be finite; which is infinitely
   absurd and contrary to experience. Spinoza, to shuffle off this
   absurdity, expresses the consequence of his doctrine thus: [64] that,
   from the necessity of the divine nature, infinite things (meaning
   infinite in number,) in infinite manners must needs follow. But whoever
   reads his demonstration of this proposition, can hardly fail to
   observe, (if he be at all used to such speculations,) that if it proved
   any thing at all, it would equally prove, that from the necessity of
   the divine nature, only infinite things (meaning infinite in extension)
   can possibly arise; which demonstration alone is a sufficient
   confutation of the opinion it was designed to establish.

   5thly. And from the impossibility of an infinite succession of causes.
   If the supreme cause be not a free and voluntary agent, then in every
   effect, (for instance, in motion,) there must have been a progression
   of causes in infinitum, without any original cause at all. For if there
   be no liberty anywhere, then there is no agent; no cause, mover,
   principle, or beginning of motion anywhere. Every thing in the universe
   must be passive, and nothing active; every thing moved, and no mover:
   every thing effect, and nothing cause. Spinoza indeed, (as has been
   already observed,) refers all things to the necessity of the divine
   nature, as their real cause and original; but this is mere jargon, and
   words without any signification; and will not at all help him over the
   present difficulty. For, if by things existing through the necessity of
   the divine nature, he means absolutely a necessity of existence, so as
   to make the world and every thing in it self-existent, then it follows
   (as I have before shown) that it must be a contradiction in terms, to
   suppose motion, &c. not to exist, which Spinoza himself is ashamed to
   assert. But if, therefore, by the necessity of the divine nature, he
   means only the necessary following of an effect from its cause, or the
   cause necessarily producing its effect; this necessity must still
   always be determined by something antecedent, and so on infinitely. And
   this, Spinoza (though sometimes he seems to mean the other and equally
   absurd sense) expressly owns in some places to be his meaning. [65]
   There can be no volition, saith he, but from some cause, which cause
   must likewise be caused by some other cause, and so on infinitely.
   Again; will, [66] saith he, belongs to the nature of God no otherwise
   than motion and rest do; so that God can no more properly be said to
   act by the liberty of his will than by the liberty of motion and rest.
   And what the original of motion and rest is, he tells us in these
   words: [67] every body in motion, or at rest, must have been determined
   to that motion or rest by some other body, which must itself likewise
   have been determined by a third; and so on in infinitum. And thus,
   since motion is not, in any one of its stages of communication, a
   necessary self-existent being, (because the body moved may always,
   without a contradiction, have been imagined to be at rest, and is
   supposed not to have motion from itself, but from another;) the opinion
   of Spinoza plainly recurs to an infinite succession of dependent beings
   produced one from another, in an endless progression, without any
   original cause at all; which notion I have already (in the proof of the
   second general head of this discourse) demonstrated to imply a
   contradiction. And since, therefore, there is no other possible way to
   avoid this absurdity, but by granting that there must be somewhere a
   principle of motion and action, which is liberty, I suppose it by this
   time sufficiently proved that the supreme cause must be a being indued
   with liberty and choice.

   From That liberty is not in itself an impossible and contradictory
   notion. what has been said upon this head, it sufficiently appears,
   that liberty is not in itself, and in the very notion of the thing, an
   absolute contradiction and impossibility, as the pleaders for necessity
   and fate contend that it is, and place the chief strength of their
   argument in that supposition. For, that which actually is, is certainly
   not impossible. And it has already been proved, that liberty actually
   is, nay that it is impossible for it not to be, in the first and
   supreme cause. The principal argument used by the maintainers of fate
   against the possibility of liberty, is this: That since every thing
   must have a cause, [68] every volition or determination of the will of
   an intelligent being must, as all other things, arise from some cause,
   and that cause from some other cause, and so on infinitely. But now,
   (besides that in this sort of reasoning, these men always ignorantly
   confound moral motives with physical efficients, between which two
   things there is no manner of relation; besides this, I say) this very
   argument really proves the direct contrary to what they intend. For
   since every thing must indeed have a cause of its being, either from
   without, or in the necessity of its own nature; and it is a plain
   contradiction (as has already been demonstrated) to suppose an infinite
   series of dependent effects, none of which are necessary in themselves
   or self-existent; therefore it is impossible but there must be in the
   universe some being whose existence is founded in the necessity of its
   own nature; and which, being acted upon by nothing beyond itself, must
   of necessity have in itself a principle of acting, or power of
   beginning motion, which is the idea of liberty. It is true, this
   argument proves only the liberty of the first and supreme cause, and
   extends not indeed to any created being; but it evinces in general
   (which is sufficient to my present purpose) that liberty is so far from
   being impossible and contradictory in itself, that on the contrary it
   is impossible but that it must really be somewhere; and this being once
   established, it will be easy to show hereafter, that it is a power
   capable of being communicated to created beings. Of which, in its
   proper place.

Proposition X. That the self-existent being must be all-powerful.

   X. Proposition X. That the self-existent being must be all-powerful.
   The self-existent being, the supreme cause of all things, must of
   necessity have infinite power.--This proposition is evident, and
   undeniable. For since nothing (as has been already proved,) can
   possibly be self-existent, besides himself; and consequently all things
   in the universe were made by him, and are entirely dependent upon him;
   and all the powers of all things are derived from him, and must
   therefore be perfectly subject and subordinate to him; it is manifest
   that nothing can make any difficulty or resistance to the execution of
   his will, but he must of necessity have absolute power to do every
   thing he pleases, with the perfectest ease, and in the perfectest
   manner, at once, and in a moment, whenever he wills it. The
   descriptions the scripture gives of this power, are so lively and
   emphatical, that I cannot forbear mentioning one or two passages. Thus,
   Job ix. 4:--"He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength;--which
   removeth the mountains, and they know it not; which overturneth them in
   his anger. Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars
   thereof tremble. Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and
   sealeth up the stars. Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and
   treadeth upon the waters of the sea. Which doth great things past
   finding out, yea and wonders without number." Again: "Hell is naked
   before him, and destruction hath no covering. He stretcheth out the
   north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. He
   bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent
   under them. The pillars of Heaven tremble, and are astonished at his
   reproof. He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding
   he smiteth through the proud. Lo, these are part of his ways, but how
   little a portion is heard of him? But the thunder of his power, who can
   understand?" Job xxvi. 6. So likewise, Isaiah xl. 12:--"Who has
   measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out Heaven
   with the span; and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure; and
   weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance. Behold,
   the nations are as a drop of the bucket, and are counted as the small
   dust of the balance; behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little
   thing. All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to
   him less than nothing, and vanity. To whom then will ye liken God, or
   what likeness will ye compare unto him?" But I do not urge authority to
   the persons I am at present speaking to. It is sufficiently evident,
   from reason, that the supreme cause must of necessity be infinitely
   powerful. The only question is, what the true meaning of what we call
   infinite power is; and to what things it must be understood to extend,
   or not to extend.

   Now, in determining this question, there are some propositions about
   which there is no dispute; which therefore, I shall but just mention.
   As,

   1st, Of working contradictions. That infinite power reaches to all
   possible things, but cannot be said to extend to the working any thing
   which implies a contradiction: As, that a thing should be and not be at
   the same time; that the same thing should be made and not be made, or
   have been and not have been; that twice two should not make four, or
   that that which is necessarily false should be true: The reason whereof
   is plain; because the power of making a thing to be, at the same time
   that it is not, is only a power of doing that which is nothing, that
   is, no power at all.

   2dly. Or natural and moral evils. Infinite power cannot be said to
   extend to those things which imply natural imperfection in the being to
   whom such power is ascribed; as, that it should destroy its own being,
   weaken itself, or the like. These things imply natural imperfection,
   and are by all men confessed to be such as cannot possibly belong to
   the necessary self-existent being. There are also other things which
   imply imperfection in another kind, viz. moral imperfection; concerning
   which, atheism takes away the subject of the question, by denying
   wholly the difference of moral good and evil; and therefore I shall
   omit the consideration of them until I come to deduce the moral
   attributes of God.

   But some other instances there are, in the question about the extent of
   infinite power, wherein the principal difference between us and the
   atheists, (next to the question, whether the supreme cause be an
   intelligent being, or not,) does in great measure consist. As,

   1st. Of the power of creating matter. That infinite power includes a
   power of creating matter. This has been constantly denied by all
   atheists, both ancient and modern, and as constantly affirmed by all
   who believe the being, and have just notions of the attributes of God.
   The only reason which the atheists have, or can pretend to allege, for
   their opinion, is, that the thing is in its own nature absolutely
   impossible. But how does it appear to be impossible? Why, only because
   they are not able to comprehend how it can be: For, to reduce it to a
   contradiction, (which is the alone real impossibility,) this they are
   by no means able to do. For, to say that something which once was not,
   may since have begun to exist, is neither directly, nor by any
   consequence whatsoever, to assert that that which is not, can be, while
   it is not; or that that which is, can not be, while it is. It is true,
   we who have been used to converse only with generations and
   corruptions, and never saw any thing made or created, but only formed
   or framed, are apt to endeavour to conform our idea of creation to that
   of formation, and to imagine, that as in all formations there is some
   pre-existing matter, out of which a thing is formed, so in creation
   there must be considered a pre-existing nothing, out of which, as out
   of a real material cause, a thing is created; which looks, indeed, very
   like a contradiction. But this is only a confusion of ideas, just like
   children's imagining that darkness is some real thing, which in the
   morning is driven away by the light, or transformed into it; whereas
   the true notion of creation is not a forming something out of nothing,
   as out of a material cause, but only a bringing something into being
   that before had no being at all, or a causing something to exist now
   that did not exist before, or which, without this cause, would not have
   existed; which no man can ever reduce to a contradiction, any more than
   the formation of any thing into a shape which it had not before, can be
   reduced to a contradiction.

   But further: The creation of matter is a thing not only not impossible
   in itself, but what, moreover, even by bare reason, is demonstrated to
   be true. For it is a contradiction (as I have shown above) to suppose
   matter necessarily existing.

   2dly. Of the power of creating immaterial cogitative substances. It is
   possible to infinite power to create any immaterial cogitative
   substance, indued with a power of beginning motion, and with a liberty
   of will or choice. This also has been always denied by all atheists;
   and, because it is a proposition of the greatest consequence to
   religion and morality, therefore I shall be particular in endeavouring
   the proof of the several parts of it.

   First, It is possible to infinite power to create any immaterial
   cogitative substance. That there can be such a thing as a cogitative
   substance, that is, a substance indued with consciousness and thought,
   is granted by all, because every man's own experience convinces him
   that he himself is such a substance. Further: That if there be, or can
   be, any such thing as immaterial substances, then it is most reasonable
   to believe that such substances as are indued with consciousness and
   thought [properties the farthest distant from the known properties of
   matter, and the most unlike them that can possibly be imagined,] are
   those immaterial substances; this also will, I think, be granted by all
   men. The only point, therefore, that remains to be proved, is, that
   immaterial substances are not impossible, or, that a substance
   immaterial is not a contradictory notion. Now, whoever asserts that it
   is contradictory, must affirm, that whatever is not matter is nothing,
   and that to say any thing exists which is not matter, is saying that
   there exists something which is nothing; which, in other words, is
   plainly this: That whatever we have not an idea of, is nothing, and
   impossible to be; for there is no other way to reduce immaterial
   substance to a contradiction, but by supposing immaterial to signify
   the same as having no existence; and there is no possible way to prove
   that, but by saying we have no idea of it; and, therefore, it neither
   has nor can have any existence. By which same argument, material
   substance will in like manner be a contradiction; for of that also,
   (viz. of the substance to which solidity belongs,) we have no idea. But
   supposing it were true (as it is indeed most false,) that we had a
   clearer idea of the substance of matter, than we have of immaterial
   substance, still by the same argument, wherewith an atheist will prove
   immaterial substance to be impossible, a man born blind may demonstrate
   irrefragably that light or colour is an impossible and contradictory
   notion, because it is not a sound or a smell; for the power of seeing
   light or colour is, to a man born blind, altogether as incomprehensible
   and absolutely beyond the reach of all his ideas, as either the
   operations and perceptions, or even the simple essence of a pure
   immaterial substance of spirit, can be to any of us. If, therefore, the
   blind man's want of ideas be not a sufficient proof of the
   impossibility of light or colour, how comes our bare want of ideas to
   be a demonstration of the impossibility of the being of immaterial
   substances? A blind man, they will say, has testimony of the existence
   of light: Very true; so also have we of the existence of immaterial
   substances. But there is this further advantage on our side in the
   comparison, that a blind man, excepting the testimony of others, finds
   not, by any reasoning within himself, the least likelihood or
   probability, no not in the lowest possible degree, that there can be
   any such thing as light or colour; but we, besides testimony, have
   great and strong arguments, both from experience and reason, that there
   are such things as immaterial substances, though we have no knowledge
   of their simple essence; as indeed of the substance even of matter
   itself (its simple substance, considered as abstract from, and as the
   foundation of that essential property of solidity,) we have no idea,
   (for to say that extension is the substance of matter, is the same way
   of thinking, as to say that existence, or that duration, is the
   substance of matter.) We have, I say, great and strong arguments both
   from experience and reason, that there are such things as immaterial
   substances, though we have no idea of their simple essence; even the
   very first and most universal principle of gravitation itself, in all
   matter, since it is ever proportional, not at all to the surfaces of
   bodies, or of their particles in any possible supposition, but exactly
   to the solid content of bodies, it is evident it cannot be caused by
   matter acting upon the surfaces of matter, which is all it can do, but
   must (either immediately or mediately) be caused by something which
   continually penetrates its solid substance. But in animals, which have
   a power of self-motion, and in the perfecter sorts of them, which have
   still higher faculties, the thing is yet more evident; for we see and
   feel, and observe daily in ourselves and others, such powers and
   operations and perceptions, as undeniably evince themselves either to
   be the properties of immaterial substances; or else it will follow,
   that matter is something, of whose essential powers (as well as of its
   substance itself,) we have altogether as little idea as we have of
   immaterial beings; and then how are immaterial substances more
   impossible than material? But of this, more hereafter.

   From Of the immateriality of human souls. what has been said on this
   head, it will be easy to answer all the objections, that have been
   brought by any atheists against the notion of human souls being
   immaterial substances, and distinct from body. See my letter to Mr
   Dodwell, with the four defences of it. For since it is possible there
   may be such things as immaterial substances; and since, if any such
   substance can be, there is all the reason in the world to believe that
   conscious and thinking substance is such, these properties being the
   most remote from the known properties of matter, that are possible to
   be conceived; the foundation of all the objections against the
   immateriality of the soul is entirely taken away. I shall not here
   tarry to consider the objections in particular, which have been often
   and fully answered by learned pens, but shall only mention one, on
   which all the rest depend, and to which they may all be reduced; and it
   is this: [69] That seeing the only means we have of perception, are the
   five senses; and these all plainly depend upon the organs of the body,
   therefore the soul, without the body, can have no perception, and
   consequently is nothing. Now (besides that these very senses or
   perceptions, however they may be obstructed by bodily indisposision,
   and so do indeed depend upon the organs of the body as to their present
   excercise, yet in their nature are really entirely distinct powers, and
   cannot possibly, as has been* before shown, be absolutely founded in,
   or arise from, any of the known properties or qualities of matter;
   besides this, I say;) of him that thus argues, I would only ask this
   one question: are our five senses, by an absolute necessity in the
   nature of the thing, all and the only possible ways of perception? and
   is it impossible and contradictory that there should be any being in
   the universe, indued with ways of perception different from these that
   are the result of our present composition? or are these things, on the
   contrary, purely arbitrary; and the same power that gave us these, may
   have given others to other beings, and might (if he had pleased) have
   given to us others in this present state, and may yet have made us
   capable of different ones in another state? If they be purely
   arbitrary, then the want of these does by no means infer a total want
   of perception: but the same soul, which in the present state has the
   powers of reflection, reason and judgment; which are faculties entirely
   different from sense; may as easily in another state have different
   ways even of perception also. But if any one will contend, that these
   senses of ours are necessarily the only ways of perception; still the
   soul may be capable of having these very same ways of perception at any
   time restored to it. For as that which sees, does not cease to exist,
   when, in the dark, all objects are removed; so, that which perceives,
   does not necessarily cease to exist, when, by death, all organs of
   perception are removed. But what reason can any man allege, why he
   should imagine these present senses of ours to be necessarily the only
   ways of perception? Is it not infinitely more reasonable to suppose,
   that this is a mere prejudice arising from custom, [70] and an
   attending to bare sense in opposition to reason? For, supposing men had
   been created only with four senses, and had never known the use of
   sight, would they not then have had the very same reason to conclude
   there were but four possible ways of perception, as they have now to
   fancy that there are but five? and would they not then have thought
   sight to have been an impossible, chimerical, and merely imaginary
   power; with absolutely the same reason as they now presume the
   faculties of immaterial beings to be so? that is, with no reason at
   all. One would think, men should be ashamed therefore to be so vain,
   as, from their own mere negative ignorance, without any appearance or
   pretence of any positive argument, to dispute against the possibility
   of the being of things, which (excepting only that they cannot frame to
   themselves an image or notion of them,) there is a concurrence of all
   the reasons in the world to persuade them that such things really are.
   And then, as to the difficulty of conceiving the nature and manner of
   the union between soul and body, we know altogether as much of that as
   we do of the nature of the union or cohesion of the infinitely
   divisible parts of body, which yet no man doubts of. And therefore our
   ignorance can be no more an argument against the truth of the one, than
   it is a bar to our belief of the other.

   Secondly. Of induing creatures with the power of beginning motion. It
   is possible to infinite power to indue a creature with the power of
   beginning motion. This is constantly denied by all atheists; because
   the consequence of it is a liberty of will, of which I shall have
   occasion to speak presently. But that the proposition is true, I thus
   prove. If the power of beginning motion be in itself a possible thing,
   and also possible to be communicated; then a creature may be indued
   with that power. Now, that the power of beginning motion is in itself a
   possible thing, I have already proved, by showing there must
   necessarily be somewhere a power of beginning motion; because otherwise
   motion must have been from eternity, without any external cause of its
   being; and yet it is a thing that has no necessity of existence in its
   own nature. So that, if there be not somewhere a principle or power of
   beginning motion, motion must exist, without any cause or reason at all
   of its existence either within itself, or from without, which, as I
   have before shown, is an express contradiction. Wherefore, a principle
   or power of beginning motion there must of necessity be somewhere or
   other; and consequently it is not in itself an impossible thing. I add;
   as a power of beginning motion is not in itself an impossible thing,
   because it must of necessity be in the supreme cause; so neither is it
   impossible to be communicated to created beings. The reason is plain;
   because no powers are impossible to be communicated, but only those
   which imply self-existence and absolute independency.--That a
   subordinate being should be self-existent or absolutely independent, is
   indeed a contradiction; but it is no contradiction; to suppose it
   indued with any other power whatsoever, separate from these. I know,
   the maintainers of fate are very confident that a power of beginning
   motion is nothing less than being really independent, or being able to
   act independently, from any superior cause. But this is only a childish
   trifling with words. For a power of acting independently in this sense,
   communicated at the pleasure of the supreme cause, and continued only
   during the same good pleasure, is no more a real and absolute
   independency, than the power of existing, (which I suppose the
   defenders of fate are not so fond to make a continual creation, as they
   are to make the power of self-motion a continual external impulse;) or
   than the power of being conscious, or any other power whatsoever, can
   be said to imply independency. In reality, it is altogether as hard to
   conceive how consciousness, or the power of perception, should be
   communicated to a created being, as how the power of self-motion should
   be so, unless perception be nothing else but a mere passive reception
   of impulse, which I suppose is as clear that it is not, as that a
   triangle is not a sound, or that a globe is not a colour. Yet no man
   doubts, but that he himself, and all others, have truly a power of
   perception. And therefore in like manner, (however hard it may be to
   conceive, as to the manner of it, yet since, as has been now proved, it
   can never be shown to be impossible and expressly contradictory, that a
   power of self-motion should be communicated,) I suppose no considering
   man can doubt but that he actually has also a power of self-motion. For
   the arguments drawn from continual experience and observation, to prove
   that we have such a power, are so strong that nothing less than a
   strict demonstration that the thing is absolutely impossible, and that
   it implies an express contradiction, can make us in the least doubt
   that we have it not. We have all the same experience, the same marks
   and evidence exactly, of our having really a power of self-motion, as
   the most rigid fatalist could possibly contrive to require, if he was
   to make the supposition of a man's being indued with that power. There
   is no one thing that such a man can imagine ought to follow from the
   supposition of self-motion, which every man does not now as much feel
   and actually experience in himself, as it can possibly be imagined any
   man would do, supposing the thing were true. Wherefore to affirm, not
   withstanding all this, that the spirits, by which a man moves the
   members of his body, and ranges the thoughts of his mind, are
   themselves moved wholly by air, or subtler matter inspired into the
   body, and that again by other external matter, and so on, as the wheels
   of a clock are moved by the weights, and those weights by gravitation,
   and so on, without a man's having the least power, by any principle
   within himself, to think any one thought, or impel his own spirits, in
   order to move any member of his body. All this is so contrary to
   experience and the reason of things, that, unless the idea of
   self-motion were in itself as evidently and clearly a contradiction, as
   that two and two should make five, a man ought to be ashamed to talk at
   that rate. Nay, a man of any considerable degree of modesty would even
   in that case be almost tempted rather to doubt the truth of his
   faculties, than take upon him to assert one such intolerable absurdity,
   merely for the avoiding of another. There are some, indeed, who,
   denying men the power of beginning motion, would yet seem in some
   manner to account for their actions, by allowing them a power of
   determining motion. But this also is a mere ludicrous trifling with
   words; for if that power of determining motion be no other in a man
   than that which is in a stone to reflect a ball one certain way, this
   is just nothing at all. But if he has a power of determining the motion
   of his spirits any way, as he himself pleases, this is in all respects
   the very same as the power of beginning motion.

   Thirdly, Of the possibility of induing a creature with freedom or
   liberty of will. It is possible to infinite power to indue a creature
   with freedom or liberty of will. It might suffice that this is at once
   proved by the same arguments, and in the same method, as I just now
   proved self-motion, or a power of beginning motion, to be possible,
   viz. because liberty must of necessity be in the supreme cause; (as is
   at large proved in the ninth general head of this discourse;) and
   therefore cannot be impossible and contradictory in the nature of the
   thing itself, and because it implies no contradiction to suppose it
   communicated, as being no harder to conceive than the fore-mentioned
   power of beginning motion; and because the arguments drawn from
   experience and observation are stronger on the one side of the question
   than those arising merely from the difficulty of our apprehending the
   thing, can be on the other. But forasmuch as this is the question of
   the greatest concern of all in matters both of religion and human life,
   and both Spinoza and Mr Hobbes, and their followers, have with great
   noise and confidence denied it; I shall therefore (not contenting
   myself with this,) endeavour to show, moreover, in particular, the
   weakness of the principal arguments by which these men have pretended
   to demonstrate, that there cannot possibly be any such power in man as
   a liberty of will. As to the propriety of the terms, whether the will
   be properly the seat of liberty or not?--is not now to the purpose to
   inquire; the question being, not where the seat of liberty is, but
   whether there be at all in man any such power, as a liberty of choice
   and of determining his own actions, or on the contrary, his actions be
   all as necessary as the motions of a clock? The arguments by which
   Spinoza and Mr Hobbes have attempted to maintain this latter side of
   the question, are all plainly reducible to these two.

   1st. That, since every effect must needs be produced by some cause,
   therefore, as every motion in a body must have been caused by the
   impulse of some other body, and the motion of that by the impulse of a
   third; so every volition, or determination of the will of man, must
   needs be produced by some external cause, and that in like manner be
   the effect of some third; and consequently, that there cannot possibly
   be any such thing in nature as liberty or freedom of will.

   2dly. That thinking, and all its modes, as willing and the like, are
   qualities or affections of matter; and, consequently, since it is
   manifest that matter has not in itself a power of beginning motion, or
   giving itself any manner of determination whatsoever, therefore it is
   evident likewise, that it is impossible there should be any such thing
   as freedom of will.

   Now, An answer to Mr. Hobbes's and Spinoza's arguments against the
   possibility of liberty. to these arguments I oppose, and shall
   endeavour briefly to demonstrate, the three following propositions.

   1st. That every effect cannot possibly be the product of external
   causes; but there must of necessity be somewhere a beginning of
   operation, or a power of acting, without being antecedently acted upon;
   and that this power may be, and is, in man.

   2dly. That thinking and willing neither are, nor can be, qualities and
   affections of matter, and consequently are not included under the laws
   thereof.

   3dly. That even supposing the soul not to be a distinct substance from
   body, but that thinking and willing could be, and were indeed, only
   qualities or affections of matter, yet even this would not at all
   affect the present question, nor prove freedom of will to be
   impossible.

   1st. That there must be somewhere a beginning of operation. Every
   effect cannot possibly be the product of external causes, but there
   must of necessity be somewhere a beginning of operation, or a power of
   acting without being antecedently acted upon; and this power may be,
   and is, in man. The several parts of this proposition have been already
   proved in the second and ninth general head of this discourse, and in
   that part of this tenth head which is concerning the possibility of the
   power of self-motion being communicated to created beings. I shall not
   therefore here repeat the proofs; but only apply them to Spinoza's and
   Mr. Hobbes's arguments, so far as is necessary to show the weakness of
   what they have said upon this head, in opposition to the possibility of
   liberty or freedom of will. Now, the manner of their arguing upon this
   head, is this. That every effect must needs be owing to some cause; and
   that cause must produce the effect [71] necessarily, because, if it be
   a sufficient cause, the effect cannot but follow; and if it be not a
   sufficient cause it will not be at all a cause of that thing. Thus, for
   instance, [72] whatever body is moved, must be moved by some other
   body, which itself likewise must be moved by some third, and so on
   without end. That the will, [73] in like manner, of any voluntary
   agent, must of necessity be determined to some external cause, and not
   by any power of determining itself, inherent in itself; and that
   external cause must be determined necessarily by some other cause,
   external to it; and so on without end. From all which it evidently
   appears, that all that these men urge against the possibility of
   freedom extends equally to all other beings (not excepting the Supreme)
   as well as to men; and Spinoza in express words confesses it. [74] )
   Wherefore, consequently, whatever noise they make of the strength and
   demonstrative force of their arguments, all that they say amounts at
   last to no more but this one most absurd conclusion; that there neither
   is anywhere, nor can possibly be, any principle of motion, or beginning
   of operation at all; but every thing is caused necessarily, by an
   eternal chain of dependent causes and effects, without any independent
   original. All their arguments, therefore, on this head are already
   answered in the second and ninth general heads of this discourse;
   (where I proved that there must of necessity be an original,
   independent, and free principle of motion or action; and that, to
   suppose an endless succession of dependent causes and effects, without
   any original or first and self-actuating principle, is supposing a
   series of dependent things to be from eternity produced by nothing,
   which is the very same absurdity and contradiction as to suppose things
   produced by nothing at any definite time; the ability of nothing to
   produce any thing being plainly the same in time or in eternity.) And I
   have moreover proved, ex abundanti, in the foregoing part of this tenth
   head, that the power of beginning motion is not only possible and
   certain in itself, but also possible to be communicated to finite
   beings, and that it actually is in man.

   2dly. That thinking and willing neither are nor can be affections of
   matter. Thinking and willing neither are, nor can be, qualities or
   affections of matter; and consequently are not concluded under the laws
   thereof. That it is possible there* may be immaterial substances, the
   notion not implying a contradiction in itself, hath already been shown
   under the present general proposition. Further, that thinking and
   willing are powers entirely different from solidity, figure, and
   motion, and if they be different, that then they cannot possibly arise
   from them, or be compounded of them, hath likewise been already proved
   under the eighth general head of this discourse. It follows, therefore,
   that thinking and willing may possibly be, nay, that they certainly and
   necessarily are, faculties or powers of immaterial substances; seeing
   they cannot possibly be qualities or affections of matter, unless we
   will confound (as some have done,) the ideas of things; and mean by
   matter, not what that word in all other cases signifies, a solid
   substance capable of division, figure, and motion, and of whatever
   properties can arise from the modifications of these, but substance in
   general, capable of unknown powers or properties entirely different
   from these, and from whatever can possibly result from these. In which
   confused sense of the word, could matter be supposed never so capable
   of thinking and willing, yet, in that sense, (as I shall show
   presently,) it would signify nothing at all to the purpose or advantage
   of our adversaries. In the meantime, how great an absurdity it is to
   suppose thinking and willing to be qualities or affections of matter,
   in the proper and usual sense of the word, may sufficiently appear,
   without any foreign argument, from the senselessness of Mr. Hobbes's
   own explication of the nature and original of sensation and
   consciousness. The immediate cause of sensation, [75] saith he, is
   this; the object, or something flowing from it, presseth the outermost
   part of the organ, and that pressure is communicated to the innermost
   parts of the organ, where, by the resistance or reaction of the organ,
   causing a pressure outwards contrary to the pressure of the object
   inwards, there is made up a phantasm, or image; which phantasm, [76]
   saith he, is the sensation itself, Again; the cause of sensation, [77]
   saith he, is an object pressing the organ, which pressure is by means
   of the nerves conveyed to the brain, and so to the heart, where, by the
   resistance or counterpressure of the heart, outwards, is made an image
   or phantasm which is sensation. Now, what is there in all this, that
   does in any the least measure tend to explain or make intelligible the
   real and inward nature of sense or consciousness? The object, by
   communicating a pressure through the organ to the sensory, does indeed
   raise a phantasm or image, that is, make a certain impression on the
   brain; but wherein consists the power of perceiving this impression,
   and of being sensible of it? or what similitude hath this impression to
   the sense itself, that is, to the thought excited in the mind? why,
   exactly the very same that a square has to blueness, or a triangle to
   sound, or a needle to the sense of pain; or the reflecting of a tennis
   ball to the reason and understanding of a man. So that Mr. Hobbes's
   definition of sensation,--that it is itself, the inmost and formal
   nature of it, nothing but the phantasm or image made in the brain by
   the pressure communicated from the object,--is, in other words,
   defining blueness to be the image of a square, or sound the picture of
   a triangle, or pain the similitude of a sharp-pointed needle. I do not
   here misrepresent him in the least. For he himself expressly confesses,
   [78] that all sensible qualities, such as colour, sound, and the like,
   are in the objects themselves nothing but motion; and, [79] because
   motion can produce nothing but motion, (as likewise it is evident that
   figure and all its possible compositions can produce nothing but
   figure,) therefore in us also the perceptions of these sensible
   qualities are nothing but different motions. If, then, the phantasm,
   that is, the image of the object made in the brain by figure and
   motion, be (as he says,) the sensation itself, is not sensation bare
   figure and motion? and are not all the forementioned absurdities
   unavoidable consequences of his opinion?

   Mr Hobbes (as I have elsewhere observed,) seems, indeed, not to have
   been altogether unaware of this insuperable difficulty, but he
   industriously endeavours to conceal it from his readers, and to impose
   upon them by the ambiguity of the word phantasm. Yet for a reserve, in
   case he should be too hard pressed, [80] he gives us a hint, that
   possibly sensation may be something more, viz. a power of perception or
   consciousness naturally and essentially inherent in all matter, only
   that it wants the organs and memory of animals to express its
   sensation; [81] and that, as a man, if he were supposed to have no
   other sense but seeing, and that so ordered as that his eyes were
   always immoveably fixed upon one and the same object, and that also
   unchangeable and without any the least variety, such a man could not
   properly be said to see, but only to be under an unintelligible kind of
   amazement: So all unorganized bodies may possibly have sensation or
   perception; but, because for want of organs there is no variety in it,
   neither any memory or means of expressing that sensation, therefore to
   us it seems as if they had no such thing at all. This opinion, I say,
   Mr Hobbes mentions as possible, but he does it with such hesitancy,
   diffidence, and sparingness, as shows plainly that he meant it only as
   a last subterfuge to recur to, when he should be pressed with the
   fore-mentioned absurdities, unavoidably consequent upon the supposition
   of sensation being only figure and motion. And, indeed, well might he
   be sparing, and, as it were, ashamed of this subterfuge. For it is a
   thing altogether as absurd as even the other opinion itself, of thought
   being mere motion; for what can be more ridiculous than to imagine that
   matter is as essentially conscious as it is extended? Will it not
   follow from that supposition, that every piece of matter being made up
   of endlessly separable parts, (that is, of parts which are as really
   distinct beings, notwithstanding their contiguity, as if they had been
   at never so great a distance one from another,) is made up also of
   innumerable consciousnesses and infinite confusion? But it is a shame
   to trouble the reader with so much as the mention of any of the
   numberless absurdities following from that monstrous supposition.
   Others, therefore, who would make thinking to be an affection of
   matter, and yet are ashamed to use either of the fore-mentioned ways,
   contend that God, by his almighty and supreme power, indues certain
   systems of matter with a faculty of thinking, according to his own good
   pleasure. But this also amounts to nothing; for (besides the absurdity
   of supposing God to make an innumerable company of distinct beings,
   such as the particles of every system of matter necessarily are, to be
   at the same time one individual conscious being; besides this, I say,)
   either our idea of matter is a true and distinct idea, or it is not: If
   it be a true and distinct idea, that is, if our idea (not of the
   substance of matter, for of simple substance we have no idea, but if
   our idea of the properties which essentially distinguish and denominate
   the substance,) be a right idea, viz. that matter is nothing but a
   solid substance, capable only of division, figure, and motion, with all
   the possible effects of their several compositions, as to us it appears
   to be, upon the best examination we are able to make of it, and the
   greatest part of our adversaries themselves readily allow; then it is
   absolutely impossible for thinking to belong to matter, because
   thinking, as has been before shown, cannot possibly arise from any
   modification or composition of any or all of these qualities. But if
   any man will say that our idea of matter is wrong, and that by matter
   he will not here mean, as in all other cases, a solid substance,
   capable only of division, figure, and motion, with all the possible
   effects of their several compositions, but that he means substance in
   general, capable of thinking and of numberless unknown properties
   besides; then he trifles only in putting an ambiguous signification
   upon the word matter, where he ought to use the word substance. And, in
   that sense, to suppose thinking, or any other active property, possible
   to be in matter, as signifying only substance in general, of whose
   powers and capacities we have no certain idea, would make nothing at
   all to the present purpose, in our adversaries' advantage, and is at
   least not a clearer and more intelligible way of talking than to
   attribute the same properties to an immaterial substance, and keep the
   idea of matter and its properties clear and distinct. For I affirm,

   3dly. That if thinking and willing were qualities of matter, yet
   nevertheless liberty might be possible. That even supposing (in these
   men's confused way,) that the soul was really not a distinct substance
   from body, but that thinking and willing could be, and were indeed only
   qualities or affections of matter; yet even this would not at all
   affect the present question about liberty, nor prove freedom of will to
   be an impossible thing. For, since it has been already demonstrated,
   that thinking and willing cannot possibly be effects or compositions of
   figure and motion, whosoever will make thinking and willing to be
   qualities or affections of matter must suppose matter capable of
   certain properties entirely different from figure and motion. And if it
   be capable of properties entirely different from figure and motion,
   then it can never be proved, from the effects of figure and motion
   being all necessary, that the effects of other and totally distinct
   properties must likewise be necessary.

   Mr Hobbes, A shameful fallacy of Mr. Hobbes and his followers.
   therefore, and his followers, are guilty of a most shameful fallacy in
   that very argument, wherein they place their main and chief strength:
   for, supposing matter to be capable of thinking and willing, they
   contend that the soul is mere matter; and, knowing that the effects of
   figure and motion must needs be all necessary, they conclude that the
   operations of the mind must all therefore be necessary; that is, when
   they would prove the soul to be mere matter, then they suppose matter
   capable not only of figure and motion, but also of other unknown
   properties: and, when they would prove the will, and all other
   operations of the soul to be necessary, then they divest matter again
   of all its unknown properties, and make it mere solidity, indued only
   with figure and motion again. Wherefore, distinguishing their ambiguous
   and confused use of the word matter, they are unavoidably reduced to
   one of these two concessions: If, by matter, they mean a solid
   substance indued only with figure and motion, and all the possible
   effects of the variations and compositions of these qualities, then the
   soul cannot be mere matter, because, (as Mr. Hobbes himself confesses)
   figure and motion can never produce any thing but figure and motion;
   [82] and consequently (as hath been before demonstrated,) they can
   never produce so much as any secondary quality,--sound, colour, and the
   like,--much less thinking and reasoning; from whence it follows, that
   the soul being unavoidably a substance immaterial, they have no
   argument left to prove that it cannot have a power of beginning motion,
   which is a plain instance of liberty: But if, on the other hand, they
   will by matter mean substance in general, capable of unknown
   properties, totally different from figure and motion, then they must no
   longer argue against the possibility of liberty, from the effects of
   figure and motion being all unavoidably necessary, because liberty will
   not consist in the effects of figure and motion, but in those other
   unknown properties of matter, which these men can no more explain or
   argue about than about immaterial substances. The truth therefore is,
   they must needs suppose thinking to be merely an effect or composition
   of figure and motion, if they will give any strength to their arguments
   against liberty; and then the question will be, not whether God can
   make matter think or no, (for in that question they only trifle with a
   word, abusing the word matter, to signify substance in general,) but
   the question will be, Whether figure and motion, in any composition or
   division, can possibly be perception and thought; which (as has been
   before said) is just such a question as if a man should ask, Whether it
   be possible that a triangle should be a sound, or a globe a colour. The
   sum is this, if the soul be an immaterial substance, (as it must needs
   be, if we have any true idea of the nature and properties of matter;)
   then Mr Hobbes' arguments against the possibility of liberty, drawn all
   from the properties of matter, are vain, and nothing to the purpose;
   but if our adversaries will be so absurd as to contend that the soul is
   nothing but mere matter, then, either by matter they must understand
   substance in general,--substance indued with unknown powers, with
   active as well as passive properties, which is confounding and taking
   away our idea of matter, and at the same time destroying all their own
   arguments against liberty, which they have founded wholly on the known
   properties of matter, or else they must speak out, (as they really
   mean,) that thinking and willing are nothing but effects and
   compositions of figure and motion, which I have already shown to be a
   contradiction in terms.

   There are some other arguments against the possibility of liberty,
   which men, by attempting to answer, have made to appear considerable;
   when in reality they are altogether beside the question. As for
   instance, those drawn from the necessity of the will's being determined
   by the last judgment of the understanding; and from the certainty of
   the divine prescience.

   As to the Of the will being necessarily determined by the last judgment
   of the understanding. former, viz. the necessity of the will's being
   determined by the last judgment of the understanding: This is only a
   necessity upon supposition; that is to say, a necessity that a man
   should will a thing, when it is supposed that he does will it; just as
   if one should affirm, that every thing which is, is therefore necessary
   to be, because, when it is, it cannot but be. It is exactly the same
   kind of argument, as that by which the true church is proved to be
   infallible, because truth cannot err; and they who are in the right
   cannot possibly, while they are so, be in the wrong. Thus, whatever a
   man at any time freely wills or does, it is evident (even upon
   supposition of the most perfect liberty,) that he cannot (at that time)
   but will or do it, because it is impossible any thing should be willed
   and not willed, (whether it be freely or necessarily,) or that it
   should be done and not done, at the same time. The necessity therefore
   of the will's being determined by the last judgment of the
   understanding, is (I say) only a necessity upon supposition,--a
   necessity that a man should will a thing, when it is supposed that he
   does will it. For the last judgment of the understanding is nothing
   else but a man's final determining, (after more or less consideration,)
   either to choose or not to choose a thing; that is, it is the very same
   with the act of volition. Or else, if the act of volition be
   distinguished from the last judgment of the understanding, then the act
   of volition, or rather the beginning of action, consequent upon the
   last judgment of the understanding, is not determined or caused by that
   last judgment, as by the physical efficient, but only as the moral
   motive. For the true, proper, immediate, physical efficient cause of
   action is the power of self-motion in men, which exerts itself freely
   in consequence of the last judgment of the understanding. But the last
   judgment of the understanding is not itself a physical efficient, but
   merely a moral motive, upon which the physical efficient or motive
   power begins to act. The necessity, therefore, by which the power of
   acting follows the judgment of the understanding, is only a moral
   necessity, that is, no necessity at all, in the sense wherein the
   opposers of liberty understand necessity, for moral necessity is
   evidently consistent with the most perfect natural liberty. For
   instance, a man entirely free from all pain of body and disorder of
   mind, judges it unreasonable for him to hurt or destroy himself; and,
   being under no temptation or external violence, he cannot possibly act
   contrary to this judgment, not because he wants a natural or physical
   power so to do, but because it is absurd and mischievous, and morally
   impossible for him to choose to do it; which also is the very reason
   why the most perfect rational creatures, superior to men, cannot do
   evil, not because they want a natural power to perform the material
   action, but because it is morally impossible, that, with a perfect
   knowledge of what is best, and without any temptation to evil, their
   will should determine itself to choose to act foolishly and
   unreasonably. Here, therefore, seems at last really to lie the
   fundamental error both of those who argue against the liberty of the
   will, and of those who but too confusedly defend it; they do not make a
   clear distinction between moral motives and causes physically
   efficient, which two things have no similitude at all. Lastly, if the
   maintainers of fate shall allege, that, after all, they think a man,
   free from all pain of body and disorder of mind, is under not only a
   moral but also a natural impossibility of hurting or destroying
   himself, because neither his judgment nor his will, without some
   impulse external to both, can any more possibly be determined to any
   action, than one body can begin to move, without being impelled by
   another: I answer, this is forsaking the argument drawn from the
   necessity of the will's following the understanding, and recurs to the
   former argument of the absolute impossibility of there being anywhere a
   first principle of motion at all, which has been abundantly answered
   already.

   Some ingenious and able writers have spoken with much confusedness upon
   this head, by mistaking (as it seems to me) the subject of the
   question, and wherein the nature of liberty consists.

   For it being evident, that a free agent cannot choose whether he shall
   have a will or no will,--that is, whether he shall be what he is, or
   no; but (the two contradictories of acting or not acting, being always
   necessarily before him,) he must of necessity, and essentially to his
   being a free agent, perpetually will one of these two things, either to
   act or to forbear acting: this has raised in the minds, even of some
   considerate persons, great doubts concerning the possibility of
   liberty.

   But this difficulty (if it be any difficulty,) arises merely from not
   apprehending rightly what liberty is. For the essence of liberty
   consists--not in the agent's choosing whether he shall have a will or
   no will; that is, whether he shall be at all an agent, or no; whether
   he shall be what he is, or no; but it consists in his being an agent,
   that is, in his having a continual power of choosing, whether he shall
   act, or whether he shall forbear acting: Which power of agency or free
   choice, (for these are precisely identical terms and a necessary agent
   is an express contradiction,) is not at all prevented by chains or
   prisons; for a man who chooses to endeavour to move out of his place is
   therein as much a free agent as he that actually moves out of his
   place. Nor is this free agency at all diminished by the impossibility
   of his choosing two contradictories at once; or by the necessity that
   one of two contradictories must always be done. A man that sits,
   whether he be or be not a free agent, cannot possibly both sit and rise
   up at the same time; nor can he possibly choose both to act and not to
   act at the same time. Not, for want of freedom, but because the
   exercise of that very freedom, his freely choosing the one, does itself
   necessarily make the contrary to be at that time impossible. Nor does
   freedom of will in any manner suppose a power, in the agent, of
   choosing whether he shall will at all, or no. For a free agent may be,
   and indeed essentially every free agent must be, necessarily free; that
   is, has it not in his power not to be free.

   God is, by necessity of nature, a free agent; and he can no more
   possibly cease to be so, than he can cease to exist. He must of
   necessity, every moment, either choose to act or choose to forbear
   acting; because two contradictories cannot possibly be true at once:
   But which of these two he shall choose, in this he is at perfect
   liberty; and to suppose him not to be so, is contradictorily supposing
   him not to be the first cause, but to be acted by some superior power,
   so as to be himself no agent at all.

   Man also is, by necessity, (not in the nature of things, but through
   God's appointment) a free agent: And it is no otherwise in his power to
   cease to be such than by depriving himself of life.

   The necessity therefore of continually choosing one of the two, either
   to act or to forbear acting; (which necessity, nothing but a free agent
   can possibly be capable of; for necessary agents, as they are called,
   can neither chose to act, nor to forbear acting; they being indeed no
   agents at all:) the necessity, I say, of continually choosing one of
   the two, either to act or to forbear acting, is not inconsistent with,
   or an argument against, liberty; but is itself the very essence of
   liberty.

   The other argument The certainty of divine fore-knowledge not
   inconsistent with the liberty of men's actions. which I said has also
   frequently been urged against the possibility of liberty, is the
   certainty of the divine prescience. But this also is entirely besides
   the question. For if there be no other arguments, by which it can be
   proved antecedently, that all actions are necessary, it is certain it
   can never be made to appear to follow, from prescience alone, that they
   must be so. That is, if upon other accounts there be no impossibility,
   but that the actions of men may be free; the bare certainty of the
   divine fore-knowledge can never be proved to destroy that freedom, or
   make any alteration in the nature of men's actions: and consequently
   the certainty of prescience, separated from other arguments, is
   altogether besides the question concerning liberty. As to the other
   arguments usually intermingled with this question, they have all, I
   think, been answered already. And now, that the bare certainty of the
   divine fore-knowledge (if upon other accounts there be no impossibility
   for the actions of men to be free,) can never be proved to destroy that
   freedom, is very evident. For bare fore-knowledge has no influence at
   all in any respect; nor affects, in any measure, the manner of the
   existence of any thing. All that the greatest opposers of liberty have
   ever urged, or can urge, upon this head, amounts only to this; that
   fore-knowledge implies certainty, and certainty implies necessity. But
   neither is it true, that certainty implies necessity; neither does
   fore-knowledge imply any other certainty, than such a certainty only as
   would be equally in things, though there was no fore-knowledge.

   For (1st.) The certainty of fore-knowledge does not cause the certainty
   of things, but is itself founded on the reality of their existence.
   Whatever now is, it is certain that it is; and it was yesterday and
   from eternity as certainly true, that the thing would be to-day as it
   is now certain that it is. And this certainty of event is equally the
   same, whether it be supposed that the thing could be fore-known or not.
   For whatever at any time is, it was certainly true from eternity, as to
   the event, that that thing would be: and this certain truth of every
   future event would not at all have been the less, though there had been
   no such thing as fore-knowledge. Bare prescience, therefore, has no
   influence at all upon any thing; nor contributes, in the least, towards
   the making it necessary. We may illustrate this in some measure by the
   comparison of our own knowledge. We know certainly that some things
   are; and when we know that they are, they cannot but be: yet it is
   evident our knowledge does not at all affect the things, to make them
   more necessary or more certain. Now fore-knowledge in God is the very
   same as knowledge. All things are to him-as if they were equally
   present, to all the purposes of knowledge and power. He knows perfectly
   every thing that is: and he knows whatever shall be, in the same manner
   as he knows what is. As, therefore, knowledge has no influence on
   things that are; so neither has fore-knowledge on things that shall be.
   It is true, the manner how God can foresee future things, without a
   chain of necessary causes, is impossible for us to explain distinctly:
   though some sort of general notion we may conceive of it. For, as a man
   who has no influence over another person's actions, can yet often
   perceive before-hand what that other will do; and a wiser and more
   experienced man, still with greater probability foresee what another,
   whose disposition he is perfectly acquainted with, will in certain
   circumstances do; and an angel, with still much less degrees of error,
   may have a further prospect into men's future actions; so it is very
   reasonable to apprehend that God, without influencing men's wills by
   his power, yet by his foresight cannot but have as much certainer a
   knowledge of future free events, than either men or angels can possibly
   have, as the perfection of his nature is greater than that of theirs.
   The distinct manner how he foresees these things is indeed impossible
   for us to explain: But so also are numberless other things, which yet
   no man doubts the truth of. And if there were any strength in this
   argument, it would prove, not against liberty, but against prescience
   itself. For if these two things were really inconsistent, and one of
   them must be destroyed, the introducing an absolute and universal
   fatality, which evidently destroys all religion and morality, would
   tend more of the two to the dishonour of God, than the denying him a
   fore knowledge, which upon this supposition would be impossible, and
   imply a contradiction to conceive him to have; and the denying of which
   would in such case be no more a diminution of his omniscience, than the
   denying him the power of working contradictions, is taking away his
   omnipotence. But the case is not thus. For though we cannot indeed
   clearly and distinctly explain the manner of God's foreseeing the
   actions of free agents, yet thus much we know, that the bare
   fore-knowledge of any action that would upon all other accounts be
   free, cannot alter or diminish that freedom, it being evident that
   fore-knowledge adds no other certainty to any thing, than what it would
   equally have though there was no fore-knowledge. Unless therefore we be
   antecedently certain that nothing can possibly be free; and that
   liberty is in itself absolutely an inconsistent and contradictory
   notion, (as I have above shown that it is not,) bare fore-knowledge,
   which makes no alteration at all in any thing, will not be any way
   inconsistent with liberty; how great difficulty soever there may be in
   comprehending the manner of such fore-knowledge. For if liberty be in
   itself possible, the bare foresight of a free action before it be done,
   is nothing different (to any purpose in the present question,) from a
   simple knowledge of it, when it is done: both these kinds of knowledge,
   implying plainly a certainty only of the event, (which would be the
   same though there was no such knowledge;) and not at all any necessity
   of the thing.

   For (2dly,) as fore-knowledge implies not any other certainty than such
   as would be equally in things, though there was no fore-knowledge; so
   neither does this certainty of event in any sort imply necessity. For
   let a fatalist suppose, (what he does not yet grant,) that there was in
   man, (as we assert,) a power of beginning motion, that is, of acting
   freely; and let him suppose further, if he please, that those actions
   could not possibly be fore-known; will there not yet, notwithstanding
   this supposition, be in the nature of things the same certainty of
   event in every one of the man's actions, as if they were never so fatal
   and necessary? For instance; suppose the man, by an internal principle
   of motion, and an absolute freedom of will, without any external cause
   or impulse at all, does some particular action to-day; and suppose it
   was not possible that this action should have been foreseen yesterday;
   was there not nevertheless the same certainty of event as if it had
   been foreseen? That is; would it not, notwithstanding the supposed
   freedom, have been as certain a truth yesterday and from eternity, that
   this action was an event to be performed to-day, (though supposed never
   so impossible to have been fore-known,) as it is now a certain and
   infallible truth that it is performed? Mere certainty of event,
   therefore, does not in any measure imply necessity: and consequently
   fore-knowledge, however difficult to be explained as to the manner of
   it, yet, (since it is manifest it implies no other certainty but only
   that certainty of event which the thing would equally have without
   being fore-known,) it is evident that it also implies no necessity.

   And now having, as I hope, sufficiently proved both the possibility and
   the real existence of liberty, I shall, from what has been said on this
   head, draw only this one inference, that hereby we are enabled to
   answer that ancient and great question, [Pothen to kakon:] What is the
   cause and original of evil? For liberty implying a natural power of
   doing evil, as well as good; and the imperfect nature of finite beings
   making it possible for them to abuse this their liberty to an actual
   commission of evil; and it being necessary to the order and beauty of
   the whole, and for displaying the infinite wisdom of the Creator, that
   there should be different and various degrees of creatures, whereof
   consequently some must be less perfect than others; hence there
   necessarily arises a possibility of evil, notwithstanding that the
   Creator is infinitely good. In short, thus: All that we call evil is
   either an evil of imperfection, as the want of certain faculties and
   excellencies which other creatures have; or natural evil, as pain,
   death, and the like; or moral evil, as all kinds of vice. The first of
   these is not properly an evil; for every power, faculty, or perfection,
   which any creature enjoys, being the free gift of God, which he was no
   more obliged to bestow than he was to confer being or existence itself,
   it is plain the want of any certain faculty or perfection in any kind
   of creatures, which never belonged to their nature, is no more an evil
   to them than their never having been created or brought into being at
   all, could properly have been called an evil. The second kind of evil,
   which we call natural evil, is either a necessary consequence of the
   former, as death to a creature on whose nature immortality was never
   conferred, and then it is no more properly an evil than the former; or
   else it is counterpoised in the whole, with as great or greater good as
   the afflictions and sufferings of good men, and then also it is not
   properly an evil; or else, lastly,--it is a punishment, and then it is
   a necessary consequent of the third and last sort of evil, viz. moral
   evil. And this arises wholly from the abuse of liberty, which God gave
   to his creatures for other purposes, and which it was reasonable and
   fit to give them for the perfection and order of the whole creation;
   only they, contrary to God's intention and command, have abused what
   was necessary for the perfection of the whole, to the corruption and
   depravation of themselves. And thus all sorts of evils have entered
   into the world, without any diminution to the infinite goodness of the
   creator and governor thereof.

Proposition XI. That the supreme cause and author of all things must of
necessity be infinitely wise.

   XI. Proposition XI. That the supreme cause and author of all things
   must of necessity be infinitely wise. The supreme cause and author of
   all things must of necessity be infinitely wise. This proposition is
   evidently consequent upon those that have already been proved; and
   those being established, this, as admitting no further dispute, needs
   not to be largely insisted upon. For nothing is more evident than that
   an infinite, omnipresent, intelligent being, must know perfectly all
   things that are; and that he who alone is self-existent and eternal,
   the sole cause and author of all things, from whom alone all the powers
   of all things are derived, and on whom they continually depend, must
   also know perfectly all the consequences of those powers, that is, all
   possibilities of things to come, and what in every respect is best and
   wisest to be done: And that, having infinite power, he can never be
   controlled or prevented from doing what he so knows to be fittest. From
   all which, it manifestly follows, that every effect of the supreme
   cause must be the product of infinite wisdom: More particularly; the
   supreme being, because he is infinite, must be everywhere present; and
   because he is an infinite mind or intelligence, therefore wherever he
   is, his knowledge is, which is inseparable from his being, and must
   therefore be infinite likewise; and wherever his infinite knowledge is,
   it must necessarily have a full and perfect prospect of all things, and
   nothing can be concealed from its inspection: he includes and surrounds
   every thing with his boundless presence, and penetrates every part of
   their substance with his all-seeing eye: so that the inmost nature and
   essence of all things are perfectly naked and open to his view, and
   even the deepest thoughts of intelligent beings themselves manifest in
   his sight. Further, all things being not only present to him, but also
   entirely depending upon him, and having received both their being
   itself and all their powers and faculties from him; it is manifest
   that, as he knows all things that are, so he must likewise know all
   possibilities of things, that is, all effects that can be. For, being
   himself alone self-existent, and having alone given to all things all
   the powers and faculties they are indued with; it is evident he must of
   necessity know perfectly what all and each of those powers and
   faculties, which are derived wholly from himself, can possibly produce:
   and seeing, at one boundless view, all the possible compositions and
   divisions, variations and changes, circumstances and dependences of
   things; all their possible relations one to another, and their
   dispositions or fitnesses to certain and respective ends,--he must,
   without possibility of error, know exactly what is best and properest
   in every one of the infinite possible cases or methods of disposing
   things; and understand perfectly how to order and direct the respective
   means, to bring about what he so knows to be, in its kind, or in the
   whole, the best and fittest in the end. This is what we mean by
   infinite wisdom. And having before shown, (which indeed is also evident
   of itself,) that the supreme cause is moreover all-powerful; so that he
   can no more be prevented by force or opposition, than he can be
   hindered by error or mistake, from effecting always what is absolutely
   fittest and wisest to be done: it follows undeniably, that he is
   actually and effectually, in the highest and most complete sense,
   infinitely wise; and that the world, and all things therein, must be
   and are effects of infinite wisdom. This is demonstration à priori. The
   proof à posteriori, of the infinite wisdom of God, from the
   consideration of the exquisite perfection and consummate excellency of
   his works, is no less strong and undeniable. But I shall not enlarge
   upon this argument; because it has often already been accurately and
   strongly urged, to the everlasting shame and confusion of the atheists,
   by the ablest and learnedest writers both of ancient and modern times.
   See Galen de Usu Partium; Tully de Natura Deorum; Boyle, of Final
   Causes; MrRay, of the Wisdom of God in the Creation; Mr Derham's
   Physico-Theology. &c. I shall here observe only this one thing; that
   the older the world grows, and the deeper men inquire into things, and
   the more accurate observations they make, and the more and greater
   discoveries they find out, the stronger this argument continually
   grows; which is a certain evidence of its being founded in truth. [83]
   If Galen, so many ages since, could find, in the construction and
   constitution of the parts of a human body, such undeniable marks of
   contrivance and design as forced him then to acknowledge and admire the
   wisdom of its author; what would he have said, if he had known the late
   discoveries in anatomy and physic, the circulation of the blood, the
   exact structure of the heart and brain, the uses of numberless glands
   and valves for the secretion and motion of the juices in the body,
   besides several veins and other vessels and receptacles not at all
   known, or so much as imagined to have any existence in his days; but
   which now are discovered to serve the wisest and most exquisite ends
   imaginable! If the arguments against the belief of the being of an
   all-wise creator and governor of the world, which Epicurus, and his
   follower Lucretius, drew from the faults which they imagined they could
   find in the frame and constitution of the earth, were so poor and
   inconsiderable, that, even in that in fancy of natural philosophy, the
   generality of men contemned and despised them as of no force; how would
   they have been ashamed if they had lived in these days, when those very
   things which they thought to be faults and blunders in the constitution
   of nature, are discovered to be very useful, and of exceeding benefit
   to the preservation and well-being of the whole? And to mention no
   more: If Tully, from the partial and very imperfect knowledge in
   astronomy, which his times afforded, could be so confident of the
   heavenly bodies being disposed and moved by a wise and understanding
   mind, as to declare that, in his opinion, whoever asserted the
   contrary, was himself [84] void of all understanding; what would he
   have said if he had known the modern discoveries in astronomy?--the
   immense greatness of the world, (I mean that part of it which falls
   under our observation,) which is now known to be as much greater than
   what in his time they imagined it to be, as the world itself, according
   to their system, was greater than Archimedes's sphere?--the exquisite
   regularity of all the planets' motions, without epicycles, stations,
   retrogradations, or any other deviation or confusion whatsoever?--the
   inexpressible nicety of the adjustment of the primary velocity and
   original direction of the annual motion of the planets, with their
   distance from the central body and their force of gravitation towards
   it?--the wonderful proportion of the diurnal motion of the earth and
   other planets about their own centres, for the distinction of light and
   darkness, without that monstrously disproportionate whirling of the
   whole heavens which the ancient astronomers were forced to
   suppose?--the exact accommodating of the densities of the planets [85]
   to their distances from the sun, and consequently to the proportion of
   heat which each of them is to bear respectively; so that neither those
   which are nearest the sun are destroyed by the heat, nor those which
   are farthest off, by the cold; but each one enjoys a temperature suited
   to its proper uses, as the earth to ours?--the admirable order, number,
   and usefulness of the several moons, (as I may very properly call
   them,) never dreamt of by antiquity, but now by the help of telescopes
   clearly and distinctly seen to move about their respective planets, and
   whose motions are so exactly known, that their very eclipses are as
   certainly calculated and foretold as those of our own moon?--the
   strange adjustment of our moon's motion about its own centre once in a
   month, with its motion about the earth in the same period of time, to
   such a degree of exactness, that by that means the same face is always
   obverted to the earth without any sensible variation?--the wonderful
   motions of the comets, which are now known to be as exact, regular, and
   periodical, as the motions of other planets?--lastly,--the preservation
   of the several systems, and of the several planets and comets in the
   same system, from falling upon each other, which, in infinite past
   time, (had there been no intelligent governor of the whole,) could not
   but have been the effect of the smallest possible resistance made by
   the finest æther, and even by the rays of light themselves, to the
   motions (supposing it possible there ever could have been any motions)
   of those bodies?--what (I say,) would Tully, that great master of
   reason, have thought and said, if these and other newly discovered
   instances of the inexpressible accuracy and wisdom of the works of God,
   had been found out and known in his time? Certainly atheism, which then
   was altogether unable to withstand the arguments drawn from this topic,
   must now, upon the additional strength of these later observations,
   (which are every one an unanswerable proof of the incomprehensible
   wisdom of the Creator,) be utterly ashamed to show its head. We now
   see, with how great reason the author of the Book of Ecclesiasticus,
   after he had described the beauty of the sun and stars, and all the
   then visible works of God in heaven and earth, concluded, chap. xliii,
   v. 32, (as we, after all the discoveries of later ages, may, no doubt,
   still truly say,) "There are yet hid greater things than these, and we
   have seen but a few of his works."

Proposition XII. The supreme author of all things must be infinitely good, just,
and true.

   XII. Proposition XII. The supreme author of all things must be
   infinitely good, just, and true. Lastly; the supreme cause and author
   of all things must of necessity be a being of infinite goodness,
   justice, and truth, and all other moral perfections, such as become the
   supreme governor and judge of the world. That there are different
   relations of things one towards another, is as certain as that there
   are different things in the world. That from these different relations
   of different things there necessarily arises an agreement or
   disagreement of some things to others, or a fitness or unfitness of the
   application of different things or different relations, one to another,
   is likewise as certain as that there is any difference in the nature of
   things, or that different things do exist. Further, that there is a
   fitness or suitableness of certain circumstances to certain persons,
   and an unsuitableness of others, founded in the nature of things and in
   the qualifications of persons, antecedent to will and to all arbitrary
   or positive appointment whatsoever, must unavoidably be acknowledged by
   every one who will not affirm that it is equally fit and suitable, in
   the nature and reason of things, that an innocent being should be
   extremely and eternally miserable as that it should be free from such
   misery. There is, therefore, such a thing as fitness and unfitness,
   eternally, necessarily, and unchangeably in the nature and reason of
   things. Now, what these relations of things, absolutely and necessarily
   are in themselves; that also they appear to be, to the understanding of
   all intelligent beings except those only who understand things to be
   what they are not, that is, whose understandings are either very
   imperfect or very much depraved; and by this understanding or knowledge
   of the natural and necessary relations of things, the actions likewise
   of all intelligent beings are constantly directed, (which, by the way,
   is the true ground and foundation of all morality,) unless their will
   be corrupted by particular interest or affection, or swayed by some
   unreasonable and prevailing lust. The supreme cause, therefore, and
   author of all things, since (as has already been proved,) he must of
   necessity have infinite knowledge, and the perfection of wisdom, so
   that it is absolutely impossible he should err, or be in any respect
   ignorant of the true relations and fitness or unfitness of things, or
   be by any means deceived or imposed upon herein; and since he is
   likewise self-existent, absolutely independent and all-powerful; so
   that, having no want of any thing, it is impossible his will should be
   influenced by any wrong affection, and having no dependence, it is
   impossible his power should be limited by any superior strength,--it is
   evident he must of necessity, (meaning, not a necessity of fate, but
   such a moral necessity as I before said was consistent with the most
   perfect liberty,) do always what he knows to be fittest to be done;
   that is, he must act always according to the strictest rules of
   infinite goodness, justice, and truth, and all other moral perfections.
   In particular, the supreme cause must, in the first place, be
   infinitely good; that is, he must have an unalterable disposition to do
   and to communicate good or happiness; because, being himself
   necessarily happy in the eternal enjoyment of his own infinite
   perfections, he cannot possibly have any other motives to make any
   creatures at all, but only that he may communicate to them his own
   perfections, according to their different capacities, arising from that
   variety of natures which it was fit for infinite wisdom to produce; and
   according to their different improvements, arising from that liberty
   which is essentially necessary to the constitution of intelligent and
   active beings. That he must be infinitely good, appears likewise
   further from hence; that, being necessarily all-sufficient, he must
   consequently be infinitely removed from all malice and envy, and from
   all other possible causes or temptations of doing evil, which, it is
   evident, can only be effects of want and weakness, of imperfection or
   depravation. Again, the supreme cause and author of all things, must in
   like manner be infinitely just; because, the rule of equity being
   nothing else but the very nature of things, and their necessary
   relations one to another; and the execution of justice being nothing
   else but a suiting the circumstances of things to the qualifications of
   persons, according to the original fitness and agreeableness which I
   have before shown to be necessarily in nature, antecedent to will and
   to all positive appointment, it is manifest that he who knows perfectly
   this rule of equity, and necessarily judges of things as they are; who
   has complete power to execute justice according to that knowledge, and
   no possible temptation to deviate in the least therefrom; who can
   neither be imposed upon by any deceit, nor swayed by any bias, nor awed
   by any power,--must, of necessity, do always that which is right,
   without iniquity, and without partiality; without prejudice, and
   without respect of persons. Lastly, that the supreme cause and author
   of all things must be true and faithful, in all his declarations and
   all his promises, is most evident. For the only possible reason of
   falsifying, is either rashness or forgetfulness, inconstancy or
   impotency, fear of evil, or hope of gain; from all which [86] an
   infinitely wise, all-sufficient, and good being must of necessity be
   infinitely removed; and consequently, as it is impossible for him to be
   deceived himself, so neither is it possible for him in anywise to
   deceive others. In a word, all evil and all imperfections whatsoever
   arise plainly either from shortness of understanding, defect of power,
   or faultiness of will; and this last, evidently from some impotency,
   corruption, or depravation; being nothing else but a direct choosing to
   act contrary to the known reason and nature of things. From all which,
   it being manifest that the supreme cause and author of all things
   cannot but be infinitely removed, it follows undeniably that he must of
   necessity be a being of infinite goodness, justice, and truth, and all
   other moral perfections.

   To this argumentation a priori, there can be opposed but one objection
   that I know of drawn on the contrary, a posteriori, from experience and
   observation of the unequal distributions of providence in the world.
   But (besides the just vindication of the wisdom and goodness of
   providence in its dispensations, even with respect to this present
   world only, which Plutarch and other heathen writers have judiciously
   made,) the objection itself is entirely wide of the question. For,
   concerning the justice and goodness of God, (as of any governor
   whatsoever,) no judgment is to be made from a partial view of a few
   small portions of his dispensations, but from an entire consideration
   of the whole; and, consequently, not only the short duration of this
   present state, but moreover all that is past and that is still to come,
   must be taken into the account; and then every thing will clearly
   appear just and right.

   From this account of the moral attributes of God, it follows:

   1st. The necessity of God's moral attributes consistent with perfect
   liberty. That though all the actions of God are entirely free, and
   consequently the exercise of his moral attributes cannot be said to be
   necessary, in the same sense of necessity as his existence and eternity
   are necessary; yet these moral attributes are really and truly
   necessary, by such a necessity, as, though it be not at all
   inconsistent with liberty, yet is equally certain, infallible, and to
   be depended upon, as even the existence itself, or the eternity of God.
   For though nothing is more certain (as has been already proved in the
   ninth proposition of this discourse,) than that God acts, not
   necessarily, but voluntarily, with particular intention and design,
   knowing that he does good, and intending to do so, freely and out of
   choice, and when he has no other constraint upon him but this, that his
   goodness inclines his will to communicate himself and to do good; so
   that the divine nature is under no necessity but such as is consistent
   with the most perfect liberty and freest choice; (which is the ground
   of all our prayers and thanksgivings,--the reason, why we pray to him
   to be good to us and gracious, and thank him for being just and
   merciful; whereas no man prays to him to be omnipresent, or thanks him
   for being omnipotent, or for knowing all things:) though nothing, I
   say, is more certain than that God acts, not necessarily, but
   voluntarily; yet it is nevertheless as truly and absolutely impossible
   for God not to do (or to do any thing contrary to) what his moral
   attributes require him to do; as if he was really not a free but a
   necessary agent. And the reason hereof is plain: because infinite
   knowledge, power, and goodness in conjunction, may, notwithstanding the
   most perfect freedom and choice, act with altogether as much certainty
   and unalterable steadiness, as even the necessity of fate can be
   supposed to do. Nay, these perfections cannot possibly but so act;
   because free choice, in a being of infinite knowledge, power, and
   goodness, can no more choose to act contrary to these perfections, than
   knowledge can be ignorance, power be weakness, or goodness malice; so
   that free choice, in such a being, may be as certain and steady a
   principle of action as the necessity of fate. We may, therefore, as
   certainly and infallibly rely upon the moral as upon the natural
   attributes of God; it being as absolutely impossible for him to act
   contrary to the one as to divest himself of the other; and as much a
   contradiction to suppose him choosing to do any thing inconsistent with
   his justice, goodness, and truth, as to suppose him divested of
   infinity, power, or existence. The one is contrary to the immediate and
   absolute necessity of his nature, the other to the unalterable
   rectitude of his will: The one is in itself an immediate contradiction
   in the terms, the other is an express contradiction to the necessary
   perfections of the divine nature. To suppose the one, is saying
   absolutely that something is, at the same time that it is not; to
   suppose the other, is to say that infinite knowledge can act
   ignorantly, infinite power weakly, or that infinite wisdom and goodness
   can do things not good or wise to be done: All which are equally great
   and equally manifest absurdities. This, I conceive, is a very
   intelligible account of the moral attributes of God, satisfactory to
   the mind, and without perplexity and confusion of ideas: I might have
   said it at once, (as the truth most certainly is,) that justice,
   goodness, and all the other moral attributes of God, are as essential
   to the divine nature as the natural attributes of eternity, infinity,
   and the like. But because all atheistical persons, after they are fully
   convinced that there must needs be in the universe some one eternal,
   necessary, infinite, and all-powerful being, will still, with
   unreasonable obstinacy, contend that they can by no means see any
   necessary connexion of goodness, justice, or any other moral attribute,
   with these natural perfections; therefore, I chose to endeavour to
   demonstrate the moral attributes by a particular deduction, in the
   manner I have now done.

   2dly. Of the necessity of God's doing always what is best and fittest
   in the whole. From hence it follows, that though God is a most
   perfectly free agent, yet he cannot but do always what is best and
   wisest in the whole. The reason is evident; because perfect wisdom and
   goodness are as steady and certain principles of action as necessity
   itself. And an infinitely wise and good being, indued with the most
   perfect liberty, can no more choose to act in contradiction to wisdom
   and goodness than a necessary agent can act contrary to the necessity
   by which it is acted: it being as great an absurdity and impossibility
   in choice, for infinite wisdom to choose to act unwisely, or infinite
   goodness to choose what is not good; as it would be in nature for
   absolute necessity to fail of producing its necessary effect. There was
   indeed no necessity in nature, that God should at first create such
   beings as he has created, or indeed any beings at all; because he is in
   himself infinitely happy and all-sufficient. There was also no
   necessity in nature that he should preserve and continue things in
   being after they were created; because he would be as self-sufficient
   without their continuance, as he was before their creation. But it was
   fit, and wise, and good, that infinite wisdom should manifest, and
   infinite goodness communicate itself. And therefore it was necessary
   (in the sense of necessity I am now speaking of,) that things should be
   made at such time, and continued so long, and indued with various
   perfections in such degrees, as infinite wisdom and goodness saw it
   wisest and best that they should. And when and whilst things are in
   being, the same moral perfections make it necessary that they should be
   disposed and governed according to the exactest and most unchangeable
   laws of eternal justice, goodness, and truth; because, while things and
   their several relations are, they cannot but be what they are; and an
   infinitely wise being cannot but know them to be what they are, and
   judge always rightly concerning the several fitnesses or unfitnesses of
   them; and an infinitely good being cannot but choose to act always
   according to this knowledge of the respective fitness of things; it
   being as truly impossible for such a free agent, who is absolutely
   incapable of being deceived or depraved, to choose by acting contrary
   to these laws, to destroy its own perfections, as for necessary
   existence to be able to destroy its own being.

   3dly. Of the impossibility of his doing evil. From hence it follows,
   that, though God is both perfectly free, and also infinitely powerful,
   yet he cannot possibly do any thing that is evil. The reason of this
   also is evident. Because, as it is manifest infinite power cannot
   extend to natural contradictions, which imply a destruction of that
   very power by which they must be supposed to be effected; so neither
   can it extend to moral contradictions, which imply a destruction of
   some other attributes as necessarily belonging to the divine nature as
   power. I have already shown that justice, goodness, and truth, are
   necessarily in God; even as necessarily as power, and understanding,
   and knowledge of the nature of things. It is therefore as impossible
   and contradictory to suppose his will should choose to do any thing
   contrary to justice, goodness, or truth, as that his power should be
   able to do any thing inconsistent with power. It is no diminution of
   power not to be able to do things which are no object of power: and it
   is in like manner no diminution either of power or liberty to have such
   a perfect and unalterable rectitude of will as never possibly to choose
   to do any thing inconsistent with that rectitude.

   4thly. That liberty is not in itself an imperfection, but a perfection.
   From hence it follows, that liberty, properly speaking, is not in
   itself an imperfection but a perfection. For it is, in the highest and
   completest degree, in God himself: every act, wherein he exercises any
   moral attribute, as goodness, justice, or truth, proceeding from the
   most perfect liberty and freest choice; without which, goodness would
   not be goodness, nor justice and truth any excellencies; these things,
   in the very idea and formal notion of them, utterly excluding all
   necessity. It has indeed been sometimes taught, that liberty is a great
   imperfection; because it is the occasion of all sin and misery: But, if
   we will speak properly, it is not liberty that exposes us to misery,
   but only the abuse of liberty. It is true, liberty makes men capable of
   sin, and consequently liable to misery; neither of which they could
   possibly be, without liberty. But he that will say every thing is an
   imperfection, by the abuse whereof a creature may become more unhappy
   than if God had never given it that power at all, must say that a stone
   is a more excellent and perfect creature than man, because it is not
   capable of making itself miserable, as man is. And, by the same
   argument, reason and knowledge, and every other perfection, nay even
   existence itself, will be proved to be an imperfection; because it is
   that without which a creature could not be miserable. The truth
   therefore is; the abuse of liberty, that is, the corruption and
   depravation of that without which no creatures could be happy, is the
   alone cause of their misery: but as for liberty itself, it is a great
   perfection; and the more perfect any creature is, the more perfect is
   its liberty; and the perfectest liberty of all is such liberty as can
   never, by any ignorance, deceit, or corruption, be biassed or diverted
   from choosing what is the proper object of free choice, the greatest
   good.

   5thly. That the highest moral perfections of rational creatures do not
   exclude natural liberty. From hence it follows, that though probably no
   rational creature can be, in a strict philosophical sense, impeccable,
   yet we may easily conceive how God can place such creatures, as he
   judges worthy of so excellent a gift, in such a state of knowledge and
   near communion with himself, where goodness and holiness shall appear
   so amiable, and where they shall be exempt from all means of temptation
   and corruption; that it shall never be possible for them,
   notwithstanding the natural liberty of their will, to be seduced from
   their unchangeable happiness in the everlasting choice and enjoyment of
   their greatest good: Which is the state of good angels and of the
   saints in heaven.

   Lastly; That the grounds of all moral obligations are eternal and
   necessary, and depend not on any laws. From what hath been said upon
   this head, it follows that the true ground and foundation of all
   eternal moral obligations, is this; that the same reasons, (viz. the
   fore-mentioned necessary and eternal different relations which
   different things bear one to another: and the consequent fitness or
   unfitness of the application of different things, or different
   relations, one to another, unavoidably arising from that difference of
   the things themselves;) these very same reasons, I say, which always
   and necessarily do determine the will of God, as hath been before
   shown, ought also constantly to determine the will of all subordinate
   intelligent beings. And when they do not, then such beings, setting up
   their own unreasonable self-will in opposition to the nature and reason
   of things, endeavour (as much as in them lies) to make things be what
   they are not, and cannot be; which is the highest presumption and
   greatest insolence imaginable: It is acting contrary to their own
   reason and knowledge; it is an attempting to destroy that order by
   which the universe subsists, and it is also, by consequence, offering
   the highest affront imaginable to the creator of all things, who
   himself governs all his actions by these rules, and cannot but require
   the same of all his reasonable creatures. They who found all moral
   obligations ultimately in the will of God must recur at length to the
   same thing; only with this difference, that they do not clearly explain
   how the nature and will of God himself must be necessarily good and
   just, as I have endeavoured to do. They who found all moral obligations
   only upon laws made for the good of societies, hold an opinion which,
   (besides that it is fully confuted by what has been already said
   concerning the eternal and necessary difference of things,) is moreover
   so directly and manifestly contradictory and inconsistent with itself,
   that it seems strange it should not have been more commonly taken
   notice of. For, if there be no difference between good and evil,
   antecedent to all laws, there can be no reason why any laws should be
   made at all, when all things are naturally indifferent. To say that
   laws are necessary to be made for the good of mankind, is confessing
   that certain things tend to the good of mankind, that is, to the
   preserving and perfecting of their nature; which wise men therefore
   think necessary to be established by laws. And if the reason why
   certain things are established by wise and good laws is, because those
   things tend to the good of mankind, it is manifest they were good
   antecedent to their being confirmed by laws: Otherwise, if they were
   not good antecedent to all laws, it is evident there could be no reason
   why such laws should be made, rather than the contrary; which is the
   greatest absurdity in the world.

   AND The conclusion. now from what has been said upon this argument, I
   hope it is in the whole sufficiently clear that the being and
   attributes of God are, to attentive and considering minds, abundantly
   capable of just proof and demonstration, and that the adversaries of
   God and religion have no reason on their side, (to which they would
   pretend to be strict adherers,) but merely vain confidence, and great
   blindness and prejudice, when they desire it should be thought, that,
   in the fabric of the world, God has left himself wholly without
   witness, and that all the arguments of nature are on the side of
   atheism and irreligion. Some men, I know, there are, who, having never
   turned their thoughts to matters of this nature, think that these
   things are all absolutely above our comprehension; and that we talk
   about we know not what, when we dispute about these questions. But
   since the most considerable atheists that ever appeared in the world,
   and the pleaders for universal fatality, have all thought fit to argue
   in this way, in their attempts to remove the first foundations of
   religion, it is reasonable and necessary that they should be opposed in
   their own way, it being most certain, that no argumentation, of what
   kind soever, can possibly be made use of on the side of error, but may
   also be used with much greater advantage on the behalf of truth.

   2. From what has been said upon this argument, we may see how it comes
   to pass, that though nothing is so certain and undeniable as the
   necessary existence of God, and the consequent deduction of all his
   attributes, yet men, who have never attended to the evidence of reason,
   and to the notices that God hath given us of himself, may easily be in
   great measure ignorant of both. That the three angles of a triangle are
   equal to two right ones is so certain and evident, that whoever affirms
   the contrary affirms what may very easily be reduced to an express
   contradiction; yet whoever turns not his mind to consider it at all,
   may easily be ignorant of this and numberless other the like
   mathematical and most infallible truths.

   3. Yet the notices that God has been pleased to give us of himself are
   so many and so obvious,--in the constitution, order, beauty, and
   harmony of the several parts of the world,--in the frame and structure
   of our own bodies, and the wonderful powers and faculties of our
   souls,--in the unavoidable apprehensions of our own minds, and the
   common consent of all other men,--in every thing within us, and every
   thing without us; that no man of the meanest capacity and greatest
   disadvantages whatsoever, with the slightest and most superficial
   observation of the works of God, and the lowest and most obvious
   attendance to the reason of things, can be ignorant of Him, but he must
   be utterly without excuse. Possibly he may not, indeed, be able to
   understand or be affected by nice and metaphysical demonstrations of
   the being and attributes of God, but then for the same reason he is
   obliged also not to suffer himself to be shaken and unsettled by the
   subtile sophistries of sceptical and atheistical men, which he cannot
   perhaps answer, because he cannot understand; but he is bound to adhere
   to those things which he knows, and those reasonings he is capable to
   judge of, which are abundantly sufficient to determine and to guide the
   practice of sober and considering men.

   4. But this is not all: God has, moreover, finally,--by a clear and
   express revelation of himself, brought down from heaven by his own Son,
   our blessed Lord and Redeemer, and suited to every capacity and
   understanding,--put to silence the ignorance of foolish, and the vanity
   of sceptical and profane men; and, by declaring to us himself, his own
   nature and attributes, he has effectually prevented all mistakes which
   the weakness of our reason, the negligence of our application, the
   corruption of our nature, or the false philosophy of wicked and profane
   men, might have led us into;--and so has infallibly furnished us with
   sufficient knowledge to enable us to perform our duty in this life, and
   to obtain our happiness in that which is to come. But this exceeds the
   bounds of my present subject, and deserves to be handled in a
   particular discourse.

THE PREFACE.

   I SHOULD not have presumed to publish these papers in vindication of
   natural and revealed religion, after so many excellent discourses
   already written upon that subject, had I not thought myself obliged to
   it, in order to pursue more fully the design of the honourable founder
   of this lecture, and to answer the expectation of the most reverend and
   the honourable trustees appointed by him. The honourable Robert Boyle,
   Esq. was a person no less zealously solicitous for the propagation of
   true religion, and the practice of piety and virtue, than diligent and
   successful in improving experimental philosophy, and enlarging our
   knowledge of nature; and it was his settled opinion, that the
   advancement and increase of natural knowledge would always be of
   service to the cause and interest of true religion, in opposition to
   atheists and unbelievers of all sorts. Accordingly he, in his
   life-time, made excellent use of his own observations to this purpose
   in all his writings, and made provision after his death for carrying on
   the same design perpetually. In pursuance of which end I endeavoured,
   in my former discourse, to strengthen and confirm the arguments which
   prove to us the being and attributes of God, partly by metaphysical
   reasoning, and partly from the discoveries (principally those that have
   been lately made,) in natural philosophy. And in the present treatise I
   have attempted, in a plainer and easier method, to establish the
   unalterable obligations of natural religion, and the truth and
   certainty of the Christian revelation. If what I have said, may, in any
   measure, promote the interest of true religion in this sceptical and
   profane age, and answer the design for which this lecture was founded,
   I have my end.

   It may perhaps be expected, that I should take some notice of certain
   remarks which have been published upon my former sermons. Had the
   author of those remarks entered into the merits of the cause, or
   offered any considerable reasons in opposition to what I had laid down,
   I should have thought myself obliged to give him a particular answer;
   but since his book is made up chiefly of railing and gross
   misconstructions, and all that he pretends to say, by way of argument,
   depends entirely upon supposition of the truth of the Cartesian
   hypothesis, which the best mathematicians in the world have
   demonstrated to be false, I presume it may be sufficient to show here
   the insincerity of that author, and the weakness of his reasoning, by a
   few brief observations.

   The only argument he alleges against me, in his whole book, is this:
   that if we know not distinctly what the essence of God, [87] and what
   the essence of matter is, wé cannot possibly demonstrate them at all to
   be two different essences.

   To which I answer: It is plain we know not the essences of things by
   intuition, but can only reason about them from what we know of their
   different properties or attributes. Now, from the demonstrable
   attributes of God, and from the known properties of matter, we have as
   unanswerable reasons to convince and satisfy us that their essences are
   entirely different, though we know not distinctly what those essences
   are, as our faculties can afford us, in judging of any the certainest
   things whatsoever. For instance: the demonstrable attributes of God
   are, that he is self-existent, independent, eternal, infinite,
   unchangeable, incorruptible, intelligent, free, all-powerful, wise,
   just, and good: The known properties of matter are, that it is not
   necessary or self-existent, but dependent, finite; (nay, that it fills
   but a few very small and inconsiderable portions of space,) that it is
   divisible, passive, unintelligent, and consequently incapable of any
   active powers. Now nothing can be more certain and evident, than that
   the substances to which these incompatible attributes or properties
   belong, or the essences from which they flow, are entirely different
   one from the other, though we do not distinctly know what the inmost
   substances or essences themselves are. If any man will think a mere
   hypothesis (the Cartesian or any other,) concerning the inmost nature
   of substances to be a more satisfactory discovery of the different
   essences of things than we can attain by reasoning thus from their
   demonstrable properties, and will choose rather to draw fond
   consequences from such hypotheses and fictions founded upon no proof at
   all, than to make use of such philosophy as is grounded only upon clear
   reason or good experiments,--I know no help for it, but he must be
   permitted to enjoy his opinion quietly.

   The rest of the book is all either an indecent and unreasonable
   reviling of the learned Mr Locke, from whom I neither cited any one
   passage, nor (that I know of) borrowed any argument from him; and
   therefore is altogether impertinent: or else it consists of gross
   misrepresentations of my sense, and very unfair constructions and false
   citations of my words, of which I shall presently give some instances.

   The first 8, and the 35th and 36th pages of the remarks, are spent in
   attempting to prove, that, if we do not first know what the essence of
   God, and what the essence of matter is, (that is, if the Cartesian
   hypothesis or fiction concerning the essences of spiritual and material
   substance be not granted to be true,)--there is no way left by which it
   can be proved at all that the essence of God and matter is not one and
   the same: To which I have already given an answer, viz. that, from the
   demonstrable attributes of God, and from the known properties of matter
   (being incompatible with each other,) we have as absolute certainty of
   their essences or substances being different, though we do not
   distinctly know what those essences are, as our faculties enable us to
   attain in any metaphysical question; for incompatible properties can no
   more possibly be in any unknown than in any known subject.

   Page 12.--The author of the Remarks asserts, that Des Cartes and his
   followers have mathematically proved that the essence of matter
   consists in length, breadth, and depth: And upon this confident
   assertion, his whole book depends in every part. To this, therefore, I
   answer, that that hypothesis is really so far from being mathematically
   proved to be true, that, on the contrary, he cannot but know (if he
   knows any thing of these matters,) that the greatest mathematicians of
   the present age, men confessedly greater in that science than any that
   ever lived before them, have clearly proved (as I before said) that it
   is absolutely false. [88] And not to take the least notice of this
   throughout his whole book argues either great insincerity or great
   ignorance.

   I had affirmed, that to imagine an eternal and infinite nothing was
   being reduced to the necessity of imagining a contradiction or
   impossibility: For this he argues against me (Remark. pag. 14,) as if I
   had asserted, that it was possible to imagine an eternal and infinite
   nothing, whereas I asserted that it was impossible, and an express
   contradiction so to do: This is great insincerity.

   I had charged the Cartesians with being unavoidably reduced to the
   absurdity of making matter a necessarily-existing being. In citing this
   passage, (Remark, pages 14 and 15,) he ridiculously represents me as
   saying that this absurdity consisted in making extension necessary;
   though he knew that in that very passage I supposed matter and
   extension to be entirely different things: This likewise is great
   insincerity.

   I have said, that the idea of immensity was an idea that no way
   belonged to matter. Instead of this, he cites me asserting,
   senselessly, (Remark, page 15,) that extension no way belongs to
   matter; as if that which is not immense or infinite, is, therefore, not
   extended at all: This is the greatest disingenuity in the world.

   Remark, page 15.--He says, I am sure this author cannot produce one, no
   not one Cartesian, that ever made matter a necessarily-existing
   being,--that ever contradicted himself in words upon this
   subject,--that ever was mightily, or not mightily, or at all perplexed
   with what Mr Clarke calls his argument;--nay, that ever heard of that
   thing he calls his argument. Why are they thus misrepresented and
   imposed upon? To this I answer: it had been sufficient to make good my
   charge, to have shown, that, from the Cartesian hypothesis, it
   followed, by unavoidable consequence, that matter must be a
   necessarily-existing being, though the Cartesians themselves had not
   seen that consequence. Yet I cited, moreover, a passage out of Regis,
   wherein it is plain he perceived and owned that consequence. But,
   because the Remarker seems not satisfied with this, and pretends to
   triumph here with great pleasure and assurance, I will for once comply
   with his challenge, and produce him another, and that an
   unexceptionable Cartesian, even Des Cartes himself, who was greatly
   perplexed with the argument I mentioned, and was unavoidably reduced to
   make matter a necessarily-existing being, and at the same time did
   contradict himself in words upon this subject. It was objected to Des
   Cartes by some very learned men, that [89] if extension and matter were
   the same thing, it seemed to them to follow, that God could neither
   possibly make the world finite, nor annihilate any part of matter,
   without creating, at the same time, just as much more to supply its
   place. To this he answers; [90] that, according to his hypothesis, it
   does indeed imply a contradiction to suppose the world to be finite, or
   to suppose God annihilating any part of matter; but yet he will not say
   God cannot do it, or that God cannot cause that two and three shall not
   make five, or any other contradiction whatsoever: Is not this making
   matter a necessarily-existing being, to own that it is a contradiction
   to suppose God annihilating it, or setting bounds to it? Is not this
   contradicting himself, for a man to affirm (as Cartes does in all his
   writings,) that the world was created by God, and depends upon him, and
   yet at the same time to declare that it implies as plain a
   contradiction to suppose any part of matter annihilable by the power of
   God, as to suppose that two and three should not make five? Is not this
   really a ridiculing of the power of God? And was not Des Cartes,
   therefore, greatly perplexed with the argument I mentioned? And is not
   an hypothesis, from which such consequences unavoidably and confessedly
   follow, a fine land-mark of distinction between spiritual and material
   substances? and whatever opposes this hypothesis, [91] a depriving us
   of the means of proving the existence of the one only true God?

   The Remarker humbly desires his reader (page 16,) to be persuaded that
   he is of no particular sect in matters of philosophy, but only of the
   party of truth wherever he meets with it. Yet the same man had declared
   before, (page 12,) that he believed Des Cartes had mathematically
   proved his hypothesis; and takes not the least notice of its having
   since been fully confuted by mathematicians confessedly far more
   eminent in that science than Des Cartes was. This is a very singular
   mark of impartiality, and of being addicted to no party in matters of
   philosophy.

   Speaking of the Cartesian argument drawn from the idea of God, I had
   used these words:--Our first certainty of the existence of God arises
   not from this, that, in the idea we frame of him in our minds, or
   rather in the definition that we make of the word [God,] as signifying
   a being of all possible perfections, we include self-existence: but,
   &c.--meaning, that, according to that argument, self-existence was
   rather made only a part of the definition of the word than proved to be
   a real attribute of the being itself. Instead of this the Remarker,
   (pages 17 and 19,) by a childish misunderstanding of the syntax of the
   sentence, and referring the particle [or] to a wrong member of the
   period, cites my words in a quite different manner: as if I had said,
   in the idea we frame of God in our own minds, or rather in the idea we
   frame of him in the definition that we make of the word, &c. and he is
   very facetious (pages 17 and 19,) in ridiculing this framing of an idea
   in a definition, which he calls, as it truly is, a real piece of
   nonsense. But when, upon the review, he finds himself the true and only
   author of it, for want of understanding grammar, I suppose it will make
   him more modest and careful.

   He accuses me (Remark, pages 18, 20, &c.) of not understanding the
   Cartesian argument drawn from the idea of God. I confess myself very
   ready to submit to this charge; and I can show him much more learned
   writers than either of us, who have likewise [92] not understood that
   argument. If he does understand it, he will do the world a very
   acceptable piece of service to make it out.

   What he says in his 21st, 22d, 23d, and 24th pages, is such a heap of
   misconstructions, and so entirely void of sense, that I confess I
   cannot at all tell what he means.

   From my using the word mere matter, he concludes (page 29,) that I
   imagine there is another sort of matter which is not a mere bare, pure,
   incogitative matter; and that these terms necessarily import this
   sense. Whereas, in every one of the places he cites, it is as express
   and evident as words can make it, that by mere matter I understand the
   matter of which the world consists, not as opposed to another sort of
   matter, but either as opposed to motion and to the form of the world,
   or as considered by itself, and without the government and direction of
   a supreme intelligent mind. This, therefore, is the highest degree of
   insincerity.

   He charges me, (pages 4 and 29, and 30,) with making a translation
   quite different from Spinoza's sense and words. How I could
   mistranslate what I did not translate at all, I understand not: but
   whether I have misrepresented Spinoza's sense, or no, (as I think I
   have not,) this I can only leave to the learned world to judge.

   I reduced Spinoza's opinion to this, that the material world, and every
   part of it, with the order and manner of being of each part, is the
   only self-existing or necessarily-existing being; and this I think is
   as clearly contained in the words I cited from him [93] as any thing
   can be. Here the Remarker asserts (page 30,) that Spinoza never taught
   this doctrine; nay, that he taught the quite contrary. To prove which,
   he cites a passage, where Spinoza affirms, that [94] all who have in
   any degree considered the divine nature, deny that God is corporeal.
   Now, this also is extremely insincere; for, had this author cited here
   the whole sentence of Spinoza, as he had cited it before in his 26th
   page, it would have appeared evidently, that Spinoza, by denying God to
   be corporeal, meant only fallaciously to deny his being any particular
   piece of matter, any [95] finite body, and of a certain figure. For,
   that he believed infinite corporeal substance, that is, the whole
   material universe, to be God, (besides the places I had cited from
   him,) he in express words acknowledges, [96] in a passage which this
   very author cites in the 4th page of his remarks; and he maintains it
   at large through the whole of that very scholium [97] from whence the
   remarker has with the greatest insincerity taken the present objection.
   But, besides; suppose Spinoza had not explained himself in this place,
   and had in this single passage contradicted what he had plainly taught
   throughout the rest of his book, would this have been any just reason
   to say that Spinoza never taught the doctrine I imputed to him? nay,
   that he taught the quite contrary?

   He charges me (page 32,) with arguing only against the accessories of
   atheism, and leaving the essential hypothesis in its full force; nay,
   with confirming and establishing (page 11,) Spinoza's atheism. It
   seems, in the opinion of this author, that proving the material world
   to be, not a necessary but a dependent being, made, preserved, and
   governed, by a self-existent, independent, eternal, infinite mind, of
   perfect knowledge, wisdom, power, justice, goodness and truth--is
   arguing only against the accessories of atheism, and that the essential
   hypothesis of atheism is left untouched, nay, confirmed and
   established, by all who will not presume to define the essence of that
   supreme mind according to the unintelligible language of the schools
   and the groundless imagination of Des Cartes concerning the substance
   or essence of matter and spirit. I confess it appears to me, on the
   contrary, that the essence of atheism lies in making God either an
   unintelligent being, [such as is the material world,] or at least a
   necessary agent, [such as Spinoza makes his one substance to be,] void
   of all freedom, wisdom, power, and goodness; and that other
   metaphysical disputes are only about the accessories; and that there is
   much more ground, on the other side, to suspect that very hypothesis,
   of which this writer is so fond, to be favourable to the atheist's main
   purpose. For if, from Des Cartes's notion of the essence of matter, it
   follows (as he himself, in the places now cited, confesses in express
   words,) that it implies a contradiction to suppose the material world
   finite, or to suppose any part of matter can be annihilated by the
   power of God, I appeal to this author, whether this does not naturally
   tend to make men think matter a necessary and self-existent being?

   He charges me (page 33,) with falsely accusing Spinoza of making God a
   mere necessary agent; and cites a passage or two out of Spinoza,
   wherein that author seems to assert the contrary. The words which I
   cited from Spinoza do as clearly express what I charged him with, as it
   is possible for any thing to be expressed; for he asserts plainly, [98]
   that from the power of God all things proceed necessarily; that all
   things are determined by the necessity of the divine nature; that
   whatever is in the power of God must necessarily exist; that things
   could not have been produced by God in any other manner or order than
   they now are; and that God does not act by a liberty of will. All this
   the Remarker very insincerely passes over, without the least notice.
   And the words which he cites out of Spinoza do not at all prove the
   contrary to what I asserted. For when Spinoza says, [99] that God alone
   is a free cause, and that God acts by the laws of his own nature,
   without being forced by any; it is evident he does not there mean a
   freedom of will, but only fallaciously signifies, that the necessity by
   which all things exist in the manner they do, is an inward necessity in
   the nature of the things themselves, in opposition to any force put
   upon them from without; which external force, it is plain indeed that
   [the to pan] the whole universe (the God of Spinoza) cannot be subject
   to; because it is supposed to contain all things within itself. But,
   besides, supposing (as I said before) that Spinoza had directly
   contradicted himself in this one passage, how would that have proved my
   charge against him to have been false?

   He says (page 34,) that I am guilty myself of what I groundlessly
   imputed to Spinoza, viz. of making God a mere necessary agent; namely,
   by affirming that there is a necessary difference between good and
   evil, and that there is such a thing as fitness and unfitness,
   eternally, necessarily, and unchangeably in the nature and reason of
   things, antecedently to will and to all positive or arbitrary
   appointment whatsoever. This, he says, is a groundless and positive
   assertion, and plainly imports the eternal necessary co-existence of
   all things as much as Spinoza's hypothesis does. Is not this an
   admirable consequence? because I affirm the proportions of things, and
   the differences of good and evil, to be eternal and necessary, that
   therefore I affirm the existence of the things themselves to be also
   eternal and necessary? because I affirm the proportion, suppose between
   a sphere and a cylinder, to be eternal and necessary, that therefore I
   affirm the existence of material spheres and cylinders to be likewise
   eternal and necessary? because I affirm the difference between virtue
   and vice to be eternal and necessary, that therefore I affirm men, who
   practise virtue or vice, to have existed eternally? This accusation
   shows both extreme ignorance, and great malice, in the author of the
   remarks.

   I had used these words, (Demonstrat, page 8:)--"How an eternal duration
   can now be actually past, is a thing utterly as impossible for our
   narrow understandings to comprehend, as any thing that is not an
   express contradiction can be imagined to be; and yet, to deny the truth
   of the proposition, that an eternal duration is now actually past, is
   to assert something still far more unintelligible, even a real and
   express contradiction." Instead of this, the Remarker, (page 39,)
   citing my words, with extreme disingenuity leaves out one half of the
   sentence and makes me to say, absolutely, that something is still far
   more unintelligible than that which is utterly impossible to be
   understood. Such gross misrepresentations as these, in leaving out one
   part of a sentence, to make the rest nonsense, can very hardly proceed
   but from want of honesty.

   Lastly, (page 41,) he says, that in my Sermons there is not one
   argument offered to prove, against Spinoza, that God is a spirit. I
   persuaded myself, that the proving God to be a being absolutely
   distinct from the material world, self-existent, intelligent, free,
   all-powerful, wise, and good, had been proving him to be a spirit. But
   it seems no proof is of any force with this author, if it be not
   agreeable to the Cartesian philosophy, in which alone he seems to have
   any knowledge. To this, therefore, I am not obliged to trouble either
   myself or the reader with giving any further answer.

   HAVING, The introduction. in a former discourse, endeavoured to lay
   firmly the first foundations of religion, in the certainty of the
   existence and of the attributes of God, by proving, severally and
   distinctly:--

   That something must needs have existed from eternity, and how great
   soever the difficulties are, which perplex the conceptions and
   apprehensions we attempt to frame of an eternal duration, yet they
   neither ought nor can raise in any man's mind any doubt or scruple
   concerning the truth of the assertion itself that something has really
   been eternal:

   That there must have existed from eternity some one unchangeable and
   independent being, because, to suppose an eternal succession of merely
   dependent beings, proceeding one from another in an endless
   progression, without any original independent cause at all, is
   supposing things that have in their own nature no necessity of
   existing, to be from eternity caused or produced by nothing; which is
   the very same absurdity and express contradiction as to suppose them
   produced by nothing at any determinate time:

   That that unchangeable and independent being, which has existed from
   eternity, without any external cause of its existence, must be
   self-existent, that is, necessarily-existing:

   That it must of necessity be infinite or everywhere present; a being
   most simple, uniform, invariable, indivisible, incorruptible, and
   infinitely removed from all such imperfections as are the known
   qualities and inseparable properties of the material world:

   That it must of necessity be but one; because, to suppose two, or more,
   different self-existent independent principles may be reduced to a
   direct contradiction:

   That it must necessarily be an intelligent being:

   That it must be a free and voluntary, not a necessary agent:

   That this being must of necessity have infinite power, and that in this
   attribute is included, particularly, a possibility of creating or
   producing things, and also a possibility of communicating to creatures
   the power of beginning motion, and a possibility of induing them with
   liberty or freedom of will; which freedom of will is not inconsistent
   with any of the divine attributes:

   That he must of necessity be infinitely wise:

   And lastly, that he must necessarily be a being of infinite goodness,
   justice, and truth, and all other moral perfections; such as become the
   supreme governor and judge of the world.

   It remains now, in order to complete my design of proving and
   establishing the truth and excellency of the whole superstructure of
   our most holy religion, that I proceed, upon this foundation of the
   certainty of the being and attributes of God, to demonstrate in the
   next place the unalterable obligations of natural religion, and the
   certainty of divine revelation, in opposition to the vain arguings of
   certain vicious and profane men, who, merely upon account of their
   incredulity, would be thought to be strict adherers to reason, and
   sincere and diligent inquirers into truth; when, indeed, on the
   contrary, there is but too much cause to fear that they are not at all
   sincerely and really desirous to be satisfied in the true state of
   things, but only seek, under the pretence and cover of infidelity, to
   excuse their vices and debaucheries which they are so strongly inslaved
   to that they cannot prevail with themselves upon any account to forsake
   them: And yet a rational submitting to such truths, as just evidence
   and unanswerable reason would induce them to believe, must necessarily
   make them uneasy under those vices, and self condemned in the practice
   of them. It remains therefore, (I say) in order to finish the design I
   proposed to myself, of establishing the truth and excellency of our
   holy religion, in opposition to all such vain pretenders to reason as
   these, that I proceed at this time, by a continuation of the same
   method of arguing, by which I before demonstrated the being and
   attributes of God, to prove distinctly the following propositions:--

   I. That the same necessary and eternal different relations that
   different things bear one to another, and the same consequent fitness
   or unfitness of the application of different things or different
   relations one to another, with regard to which the will of God always
   and necessarily does determine itself to choose to act only what is
   agreeable to justice, equity, goodness, and truth, in order to the
   welfare of the whole universe, ought likewise constantly to determine
   the wills of all subordinate rational beings, to govern all their
   actions by the same rules, for the good of the public in their
   respective stations: That is, these eternal and necessary differences
   of things make it fit and reasonable for creatures so to act: they
   cause it to be their duty, or lay an obligation upon them, so to do,
   even separate from the consideration of these rules being the positive
   will or command of God, and also antecedent to any respect or regard,
   expectation or apprehension, of any particular private and personal
   advantage or disadvantage, reward or punishment, either present or
   future, annexed, either by natural consequence, or by positive
   appointments, to the practising or neglecting those rules.

   II. That though these eternal moral obligations are, indeed, of
   themselves incumbent on all rational beings, even antecedent to the
   consideration of their being the positive will and command of God, yet
   that which most strongly confirms, and in practice most effectually and
   indispensably enforces them upon us, is this, that both from the nature
   of things, and the perfections of God, and from several other
   collateral considerations, it appears, that as God is himself
   necessarily just and good in the exercise of his infinite power in the
   government of the whole world, so he cannot but likewise positively
   require that all his rational creatures should in their proportion be
   so too, in the exercise of each of their powers in their respective
   spheres: That is, as these eternal moral obligations are really in
   perpetual force merely from their own nature and the abstract reason of
   things, so also they are moreover the express and unalterable will,
   command, and law of God to his creatures, which he cannot but expect
   should, in obedience to his supreme authority, as well as in compliance
   with the natural reason of things, be regularly and constantly observed
   through the whole creation.

   III. That, therefore, though these eternal moral obligations are also
   incumbent, indeed, on all rational creatures, antecedent to any respect
   of particular reward or punishment, yet they must certainly and
   necessarily be attended with rewards and punishments; because the same
   reasons which prove God himself to be necessarily just and good, and
   the rules of justice, equity, and goodness, to be his unalterable will,
   law, and command, to all created beings, prove also that he cannot but
   be pleased with and approve such creatures as imitate and obey him by
   observing those rules, and be displeased with such as act contrary
   thereto; and, consequently, that he cannot but some way or other make a
   suitable difference in his dealings with them, and manifest his supreme
   power and absolute authority, in finally supporting, maintaining, and
   vindicating effectually the honour of these his divine laws, as becomes
   the just and righteous governor and disposer of all things.

   IV. That consequently, though, in order to establish this suitable
   difference between the fruits or effects of virtue and vice, so
   reasonable in itself, and so absolutely necessary for the vindication
   of the honour of God, the nature of things and the constitution and
   order of God's creation was originally such, that the observance of the
   eternal rules of justice, equity, and goodness does indeed of itself
   tend, by direct and natural consequence, to make all creatures happy,
   and the contrary practice to make them miserable; yet since, through
   some great and general corruption and depravation, (whencesoever that
   may have arisen, the particular original whereof could hardly have been
   known now without revelation;) since, I say, the condition of men in
   this present state is such, that the natural order of things in this
   world is an event manifestly perverted, and virtue and goodness are
   visibly prevented, in great measure, from obtaining their proper and
   due effects in establishing men's happiness proportionable to their
   behaviour and practice; therefore it is absolutely impossible, that the
   whole view and intention, the original and the final design, of God's
   creating such rational beings as men are, and placing them in this
   globe of earth, as the chief and principal, or indeed (may we not say)
   the only inhabitants, for whose sake alone this part at least of the
   creation is evidently fitted up and accommodated; it is absolutely
   impossible (I say) that the whole of God's design in all this should be
   nothing more than to keep up eternally a succession of such short-lived
   generations of men as at present are, and those in such a corrupt,
   confused, and disorderly state of things as we see the world is now in,
   without any due observation of the eternal rules of good and evil,
   without any clear and remarkable effect of the great and most necessary
   differences of things, and without any final vindication of the honour
   and laws of God in the proportionable reward of the best, or punishment
   of the worst of men. And consequently it is certain and necessary,
   (even as certain as the moral attributes of God before demonstrated,)
   that, instead of continuing an eternal succession of new generations in
   the present form and state of things, there must at some time or other
   be such a revolution and renovation of things, such a future state of
   existence of the same persons, as that, by an exact distribution of
   rewards or punishments therein, all the present disorders and
   inequalities may be set right, and that the whole scheme of providence,
   which to us who judge of it by only one small portion of it, seems now
   so inexplicable and much confused, may appear at its consummation to be
   a design worthy of infinite wisdom, justice, and goodness.

   V. That, though the indispensable necessity of all the great and moral
   obligations of natural religion, and also the certainty of a future
   state of rewards and punishments, be thus in general deducible even
   demonstrably, by a chain of clear and undeniable reasoning, (yet in the
   present state of the world, by what means soever it came originally to
   be so corrupted, of which more hereafter,) such is the carelessness,
   inconsiderateness, and want of attention of the greater part of
   mankind; so many the prejudices and false notions imbibed by evil
   education; so strong and violent the unreasonable lusts, appetites, and
   desires of sense; and so great the blindness, introduced by
   superstitious opinions, vicious customs, and debauched practices,
   through the world,--that very few are able, in reality and effect, to
   discover these things clearly and plainly for themselves; but men have
   great need of particular teaching, and much instruction, to convince
   them of the truth and certainty, and importance of these things; to
   give them a due sense, and clear and just apprehensions concerning
   them; and to bring them effectually to the practice of the plainest and
   most necessary duties.

   VI. That, though in almost every age there have indeed been in the
   heathen world some wise, and brave, and good men, who have made it
   their business to study and practice these things themselves, and to
   teach and exhort others to do the like, who seem therefore to have been
   raised up by providence as instruments to reprove in some measure, and
   put some kind of check to the extreme superstition and wickedness of
   the nations wherein they lived: Yet none of these have ever been able
   to reform the world with any considerably great and universal success;
   because they have been but very few that have in earnest set themselves
   about this excellent work; and they that have indeed sincerely done it
   have themselves been entirely ignorant of some doctrines, and very
   doubtful and uncertain of others, absolutely necessary for the bringing
   about that great end; and those things which they have been certain of
   and in good measure understood, they have not been able to prove and
   explain clearly enough, and those that they have been able both to
   prove and explain by sufficiently clear reasoning, they have not yet
   had authority enough to enforce and inculcate upon men's minds with so
   strong an impression as to influence and govern the general practice of
   the world.

   VII. That therefore there was plainly wanting a divine revelation to
   recover mankind out of their universally degenerate estate, into a
   state suitable to the original excellency of their nature; which divine
   revelation, both the necessities of men and their natural notions of
   God gave them reasonable ground to expect and hope for, as appears from
   the acknowledgments which the best and wisest of the heathen
   philosophers themselves have made, of their sense of the necessity and
   want of such a revelation, and from their expressions of the hopes they
   had entertained that God would some time or other vouchsafe it unto
   them.

   VIII. That there is no other religion now in the world, but the
   Christian, that has any just pretence or tolerable appearance of reason
   to be esteemed such a divine revelation; and therefore if Christianity
   be not true, there is no revelation of the will of God at all made to
   mankind.

   IX. That the Christian religion, considered in its primitive
   simplicity, and as taught in the Holy Scriptures, has all the marks and
   proofs of its being actually and truly a divine revelation that any
   divine revelation, supposing it was true, could reasonably be imagined
   or desired to have.

   X. That the practical duties which the Christian religion enjoins, are
   all such as are most agreeable to our natural notions of God, and most
   perfective of the nature, and conducive to the happiness and well-being
   of men: That is, Christianity,--even in this single respect, as
   containing alone, and in one consistent system, all the wise and good
   precepts (and those improved, augmented, and exalted to the highest
   degree of perfection,) that ever were taught singly and scatteredly,
   and many times but very corruptly, by the several schools of the
   philosophers; and this without any mixture of the fond, absurd, and
   superstitious practices of any of those philosophers,--ought to be
   embraced and practised by all rational and considering deists, who will
   act consistently, and steadily pursue the consequences of their own
   principles; as at least the best scheme and sect of philosophy that
   ever was set up in the world, and highly probable, even though it had
   no external evidence, to be of divine original.

   XI. That the motives, by which the Christian religion enforces the
   practice of these duties, are such as are must suitable to the
   excellent wisdom of God, and most answerable to the natural
   expectations of men.

   XII. That the peculiar manner and circumstances with which it enjoins
   these duties and urges these motives, are exactly consonant to the
   dictates of sound reason, or the unprejudiced light of nature, and most
   wisely perfective of it.

   XIII. That all the [credenda, or] doctrines, which the true, simple,
   and uncorrupted Christian religion teaches,--(that is, not only those
   plain doctrines which it requires to be believed as fundamental and of
   necessity to eternal salvation, but even all the doctrines which it
   teaches as matters of truths,)--are, though indeed many of them not
   discoverable by bare reason unassisted with revelation, yet, when
   discovered by revelation, apparently most agreeable to sound
   unprejudiced reason, have every one of them a natural tendency, and a
   direct and powerful influence, to reform men's lives and correct their
   manners, and do together make up an infinitely more consistent and
   rational scheme of belief than any that the wisest of the ancient
   philosophers ever did, or the cunningest of modern unbelievers can
   invent or contrive.

   XIV. That as this revelation, to the judgment of right and sober
   reason, appears even of itself highly credible and probable, and
   abundantly recommends itself in its native simplicity, merely by its
   own intrinsic goodness and excellency, to the practice of the most
   rational and considering men, who are desirous in all their actions to
   have satisfaction, and comfort, and good hope within themselves, from
   the conscience of what they do; so it is moreover positively and
   directly proved to be actually and immediately sent to us from God, by
   the many infallible signs and miracles which the Author of it worked
   publicly as the evidence of his divine commission, by the exact
   completion both of the prophecies that went before concerning him, and
   of those that he himself delivered concerning things that were to
   happen after, and by the testimony of his followers, which in all its
   circumstances was the most credible, certain, and convincing evidence,
   that was ever given to any matter of fact in the world.

   XV. And lastly, that they who will not, by such arguments and proofs as
   these, be convinced of the truth and certainty of the Christian
   religion, and be persuaded to make it the rule and guide of all their
   actions, would not be convinced, (so far as to influence their hearts,
   and reform their lives,) by any other evidence whatsoever; no, not
   though one should rise on purpose from the dead to endeavour to
   convince them.

   I might here, Of the several sorts of deists. before I enter upon the
   particular proof of these several propositions, justly be allowed to
   premise, that, having now to deal with another sort of men than those
   against whom my former discourse was directed, and being consequently
   in some parts of this treatise to make use of some other kinds of
   arguments than those which the nature of that discourse permitted and
   required, the same demonstrative force of reasoning, and even
   mathematical certainty, which in the main argument was there easy to be
   obtained, ought not here to be expected; but that such moral evidence,
   or mixed proofs, from circumstances and testimony, as most matters of
   fact are only capable of, and wise and honest men are always satisfied
   with, ought to be accounted sufficient in the present case: Because all
   the principles indeed upon which atheists attempt to build their
   schemes, are such as may, by plain force of reason, and undeniably
   demonstrative argumentations, be reduced to express and direct
   contradictions. But deists pretend to own all the principles of reason,
   and would be thought to deny nothing but what depends entirely on
   testimony and evidence of matter of fact, which they think they can
   easily evade.

   But, if we examine things to the bottom, we shall find that the matter
   does not in reality lie here. For I believe there are in the world, at
   least in any part of the world where the Christian religion is in any
   tolerable purity professed, very few such deists as will truly stand to
   all the principles of unprejudiced reason, and sincerely, both in
   profession and practice, own all the obligations of natural religion,
   and yet oppose Christianity merely upon account of their not being
   satisfied with the strength of the evidence of matter of fact. A
   constant and sincere observance of all the laws of reason and
   obligations of natural religion, will unavoidably lead a man to
   Christianity, if Christianity be fairly proposed to him in its natural
   simplicity and he has due opportunities of examining things and will
   steadily pursue the consequences of his own principles. And all others,
   who pretend to be deists without coming up to this, can have no fixed
   and settled principles at all, upon which they can either argue or act
   consistently, but must of necessity sink into downright atheism, (and
   consequently fall under the force of the former arguments,) as may
   appear by considering the several sorts of them.

   1. Of the first sort of deists: And of Providence. Some men would be
   thought to be deists, because they pretend to believe the existence of
   an eternal, infinite, independent, intelligent being; and, to avoid the
   name of Epicurean atheists, teach also that this supreme being made the
   world: though [100] at the same time they agree with the Epicureans in
   this, that they fancy God does not at all concern himself in the
   government of the world, nor has any regard to, or care of, what is
   done therein. But if we examine things duly, this opinion must
   unavoidably terminate in absolute atheism. For though to imagine that
   God, at the creation of the world, or at the formation of any
   particular part of it, could (if he had pleased,) by his infinite
   wisdom, foresight, and unerring design, have originally so ordered,
   disposed, and adapted all the springs and series of future necessary
   and unintelligent causes, that, without the immediate interposition of
   his almighty power upon every particular occasion, they should
   regularly, by virtue of that original disposition, have produced
   effects worthy to proceed from the direction and government of infinite
   wisdom: though this, I say, may possibly by very nice and abstract
   reasoning be reconcileable with a firm belief both of the being and
   attributes of God, and also with a consistent notion even of providence
   itself; yet to fancy that God originally created a certain quantity of
   matter and motion, and left them to frame a world at adventures,
   without any determinate and particular view, design, or direction; this
   can no way be defended consistently, but must of necessity recur to
   downright atheism, as I shall show presently, after I have made only
   this one observation, that as that opinion is impious in itself, so the
   late improvements in mathematics and natural philosophy have discovered
   that, as things now are, that scheme is plainly false and impossible in
   fact. For, not to say, that, seeing matter is utterly incapable of
   obeying any laws, the very original laws of motion themselves cannot
   continue to take place but by something superior to matter, continually
   exerting on it a certain force of power according to such certain and
   determinate laws; it is now evident, beyond question, that the bodies
   of all plants and animals, much the most considerable parts of the
   world, could not possibly have been formed by mere matter, according to
   any general laws of motion. And not only so, but that most universal
   principle of gravitation itself, the spring of almost all the great and
   regular inanimate motions in the world, answering (as I hinted in my
   former discourse,) not at all to the surfaces of bodies, (by which
   alone they can act one upon another,) but entirely to their solid
   content; cannot possibly be the result of any motion originally
   impressed on matter, but must of necessity be caused (either
   immediately or mediately) by something which penetrates the very solid
   substance of all bodies, and continually puts forth in them a force or
   power entirely different from that by which matter acts on matter:
   Which is, by the way, an evident demonstration, not only of the world's
   being made originally by a supreme intelligent cause, but moreover that
   it depends every moment on some superior being, for the preservation of
   its frame; and that all the great motions in it are caused by some
   immaterial power, not having originally impressed a certain quantity of
   motion upon matter, but perpetually and actually exerting itself every
   moment in every part of the world. Which preserving and governing
   power, whether it be immediately the power and action of the same
   supreme cause that created the world, of him without whom not a sparrow
   falls to the ground, and with whom the very hairs of our head are all
   numbered; or whether it be the action of some subordinate instruments
   appointed by him to direct and preside respectively over certain parts
   thereof; does either way equally give us a very noble idea of
   providence. Those men, indeed, who, merely through a certain vanity of
   philosophising, have been tempted to embrace that other opinion, of all
   things being produced and continued only by a certain quantity of
   motion, originally impressed on matter without any determinate design
   or direction, and left to itself to form a world at adventures; those
   men, I say, who, merely through a vanity of philosophising, have been
   tempted to embrace that opinion, without attending whither it would
   lead them, ought not, indeed, to be directly charged with all the
   consequences of it. But it is certain, that many, under that cover,
   have really been atheists; and the opinion itself (as I before said)
   leads necessarily, and by unavoidable consequence, to plain atheism.
   For if God be an all-powerful, omnipresent, intelligent, wise, and free
   being, (as it hath been before demonstrated that he necessarily is), he
   cannot possibly but know, at all times and in all places, every thing
   that is; and foreknow what at all times and in all places it is fittest
   and wisest should be; and have perfect power, without the least labour,
   difficulty, or opposition, to order and bring to pass what he so judges
   fit to be accomplished: and consequently it is impossible but he must
   actually direct and appoint [101] every particular thing and
   circumstance that is in the world, or ever shall be, excepting only
   what by his own pleasure he puts under the power and choice of
   subordinate free agents. If, therefore, God does not concern himself in
   the government of the world, nor has any regard to what is done
   therein, it will follow that he is not an omnipresent, all-powerful,
   intelligent and wise being; and, consequently, that he is not at all.
   Wherefore the opinion of this sort of deists stands not upon any
   certain consistent principles, but leads unavoidably to downright
   atheism; and, however in words they may confess a God, [102] yet in
   reality and in truth they deny him.

   If, Human affairs not beneath the regard of Providence. to avoid this,
   they will own God's government and providence over the greater and more
   considerable parts of the world, but deny his inspection and regard to
   human affairs here upon earth, as being too minute and small for the
   supreme governor of all things to concern himself in; [103] this still
   amounts to the same. For if God be omnipresent, all-knowing, and
   all-powerful, he cannot but equally know, and with equal ease be able
   to direct and govern, [104] all things as any, and the minutest things
   [105] as the greatest. So that if he has no regard nor concern for
   these things, his attributes must, as before, be denied, and
   consequently his being. But, besides, human affairs are by no means the
   minutest and most inconsiderable part of the creation: For, (not to
   consider now, that excellency of human nature which Christianity
   discovers to us,) let a deist suppose the universe as large as the
   widest hypothesis of astronomy will give him leave to imagine, or let
   him suppose it as immense as he himself pleases, and filled with as
   great numbers of rational creatures as his own fancy can suggest; yet
   the system wherein we are placed will at least, for ought he can
   reasonably suppose, be as considerable as any other single system; and
   the earth whereon we dwell as considerable as most of the other planets
   in this system, and mankind manifestly the only considerable
   inhabitants on this globe of earth. Man, therefore, has evidently a
   better claim to the particular regard and concern of providence than
   any thing else in this globe of ours; and this our globe of earth as
   just a pretence to it as most other planets in the system; and this
   system as just a one, as far as we can judge, as any system in the
   universe. If therefore there be any providence at all, and God has any
   concern for any part of the world, mankind, even separate from the
   consideration of that excellency of human nature which the Christian
   doctrine discovers to us, may as reasonably be supposed to be under its
   particular care and government as any other part of the universe.

   2. Of the second sort of deists. Some others there are that call
   themselves deists, because they believe, not only the being, but also
   the providence of God; that is, that every natural thing that is done
   in the world is produced by the power, appointed by the wisdom, and
   directed by the government of God. Though not allowing any difference
   between moral good and evil, they suppose that God takes no notice of
   the morally good or evil actions of men; these things depending, as
   they imagine, merely on the arbitrary constitution of human laws. But
   how handsomely soever these men may seem to speak of the natural
   attributes of God, of his knowledge, wisdom, and power, yet neither can
   this opinion be settled on any certain principles, nor defended by any
   consistent reasoning; nor can the natural attributes of God be so
   separated from the moral but that he who denies the latter may be
   reduced to a necessity of denying the former likewise. For since (as I
   have formerly proved,) there cannot but be eternal and necessary
   differences of different things, one from another, and, from these
   necessary differences of things, there cannot but arise a fitness or
   unfitness of the application of different things or different relations
   one to another; and infinite knowledge can no more fail to know, or
   infinite wisdom to choose, or infinite power to act, according to these
   eternal reasons and proportions of things, than knowledge can be
   ignorance, wisdom be folly, or power weakness; and consequently the
   justice and goodness of God are as certain and necessary as his wisdom
   and power;--it follows unavoidably, that he who denies the justice or
   goodness of God, or, which is all one, denies his exercise of these
   attributes in inspecting and regarding the moral actions of men, must
   also deny, either his wisdom, or his power, or both; and, consequently,
   must needs be driven into absolute atheism: For though in some moral
   matters men are not indeed to be judged of by the consequences of their
   opinions, but by their profession and practice, yet in the present
   case( [106] it matters not at all what men affirm, or how honourably
   they may seem to speak of some particular attributes of God; but what,
   notwithstanding such profession, must needs in all reason be supposed
   to be their true opinion; and their practice generally appears
   answerable to it.

   For, Profane and debauched deists not capable of being argued with.
   concerning these two sorts of deists, it is observable, that as their
   opinions can terminate consistently in nothing but downright atheism,
   so their practice and behaviour is generally agreeable to that of the
   most openly professed atheists. They not only oppose the revelation of
   Christianity, and reject all the moral obligations of natural religion,
   as such, but generally they despise also the wisdom of all human
   constitutions made for the order and benefit of mankind, and are as
   much contemners of common decency as they are of religion. They
   endeavour to ridicule and banter all human as well as divine
   accomplishments; all virtue and government of a man's self, all
   learning and knowledge, all wisdom and honour, and every thing for
   which a man can justly be commended or be esteemed more excellent than
   a beast. They pretend commonly, in their discourse and writings, to
   expose the abuses and corruptions of religion; but (as is too manifest
   in some of their books as well as in their talk, they aim really
   against all virtue in general, and all good manners, and against
   whatsoever is truly valuable and commendable in men. They pretend to
   ridicule certain vices and follies of ignorant or superstitious men;
   but the many very profane and very lewd images, with which they
   industriously affect to dress up their discourse, show plainly that
   they really do not so much intend to expose and deride any vice or
   folly, as on the contrary to foment and please the debauched and
   vicious inclinations of others as void of shame as themselves. They
   discover clearly, that they have no sense at all of the dignity of
   human nature, nor of the superiority and excellency of their reason
   above even the meanest of the brutes. They will sometimes in words seem
   to magnify the wisdom, and other natural attributes of God, but in
   reality, by ridiculing whatever bears any resemblance to it in men,
   they show undeniably that they do not indeed believe there is any real
   difference in things, or any true excellency in one thing more than in
   another. By turning every thing alike, and without exception, into
   ridicule and mockery, they declare plainly that they do not believe any
   thing to be wise, any thing decent, any thing comely or praiseworthy at
   all. They seem not to have any esteem or value for those distinguishing
   powers and faculties; by induing them wherewith God has "taught them
   more than the beasts of the field, and made them wiser than the fowls
   of heaven." [107] In a word; "Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
   things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are
   pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good
   report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise;" [108] these
   things they make the constant subject of their mockery and abuse,
   ridicule and raillery. On the contrary, whatsoever things are profane,
   impure, filthy, dishonourable, and absurd; these things they make it
   their business to represent as harmless and indifferent, and to laugh
   men out of their natural shame and abhorrence of them; nay, even to
   recommend them with their utmost wit. Such men as these are not to be
   argued with, till they can be persuaded to use arguments instead of
   drollery: For banter is not capable of being answered by reason; not
   because it has any strength in it, but because it runs out of all the
   bounds of reason and good sense, by extravagantly joining together such
   images as have not in themselves any manner of similitude or connexion;
   by which means all things are alike easy to be rendered ridiculous, by
   being represented only in an absurd dress. These men, therefore, are
   first to be convinced of the true principles of reason before they can
   be disputed with; and then they must of necessity either retreat into
   downright atheism, or be led by undeniable reasoning to acknowledge and
   submit to the obligations of morality, and heartily repent of their
   profane abuse of God and religion.

   3. Of the third sort of deists. Another sort of deists there are, who,
   having right apprehensions concerning the natural attributes of God,
   and his all-governing providence, seem also to have some notion of his
   moral perfections also. That is, as they believe him to be a being
   infinitely knowing, powerful, and wise, so they believe him to be also
   in some sense a being of infinite justice, goodness, and truth, and
   that he governs the universe by these perfections, and expects suitable
   obedience from all his rational creatures. But then, having a prejudice
   against the notion of the immortality of human souls, they believe that
   men perish entirely at death, and that one generation shall perpetually
   succeed another, without any thing remaining of men after their
   departure out of this life, and without any future restoration or
   renovation of things. And imagining that justice, and goodness in God,
   are not the same as in the ideas we frame of these perfections, when we
   consider them in men, or when we reason about them abstractly in
   themselves, but that in the supreme governor of the world they are
   something transcendent, and of which we cannot make any true judgment,
   nor argue with any certainty about them: they fancy, though there does
   not indeed seem to us to be any equity or proportion in the
   distributions of rewards and punishments in this present life, yet that
   we are not sufficient judges concerning the attributes of God, to argue
   from thence with any assurance for the certainty of a future state. But
   neither does this opinion stand on any consistent principles. For if
   justice and goodness be not [109] the same in God, as in our ideas,
   then we mean nothing, when we say that God is necessarily just and
   good; and for the same reason it may as well be said that we know not
   what we mean, when we affirm that he is an intelligent and wise being,
   and there will be no foundation at all left on which we can fix any
   thing. Thus the moral attributes of God, however they be acknowledged
   in words, yet in reality they are by these men entirely taken away; and
   upon the same grounds the natural attributes may also be denied. And so
   upon the whole, this opinion likewise, if we argue upon it
   consistently, must finally recur to absolute atheism.

   4. Of the fourth sort of deists. The last sort of deists are those who,
   if they did indeed believe what they pretend, have just and right
   notions of God, and of all the divine attributes in every respect; who
   declare they believe that there is one eternal, infinite, intelligent,
   all-powerful, and wise being, the creator, preserver, and governor of
   all things; that this supreme cause is a being of infinite justice,
   goodness, and truth, and all other moral as well as natural
   perfections; that he made the world for the manifestation of his power
   and wisdom, and to communicate his goodness and happiness to his
   creatures; that he preserves it by his continual all-wise providence,
   and governs it according to the eternal rules of infinite justice,
   equity, goodness, mercy, and truth; that all created rational beings,
   depending continually upon him, are bound to adore, worship, and obey
   him, to praise him for all things they enjoy, and to pray to him for
   every thing they want; that they are all obliged to promote, in their
   proportion, and according to the extent of their several powers and
   abilities, the general good and welfare of those parts of the world
   wherein they are placed, in like manner as the divine goodness is
   continually promoting the universal benefit of the whole; that men, in
   particular, are every one obliged to make it their business, by an
   universal benevolence, to promote the happiness of all others; that, in
   order to this, every man is bound always to behave himself so towards
   others, as in reason he would desire they should in like circumstances
   deal with him; that, therefore, he is obliged to obey and submit to his
   superiors in all just and right things, for the preservation of society
   and the peace and benefit of the public; to be just and honest,
   equitable and sincere, in all his dealings with his equals, for the
   keeping inviolable the everlasting rule of righteousness, and
   maintaining an universal trust and confidence, friendship and
   affection, amongst men; and, towards his inferiors, to be gentle, and
   easy, and affable,--charitable, and willing to assist as many as stand
   in need of his help, for the preservation of universal love and
   benevolence amongst mankind, and in imitation of the goodness of God,
   who preserves and does good to all creatures, which depend entirely
   upon him for their very being and all that they enjoy; that, in respect
   of himself, every man is bound to preserve, as much as in him lies, his
   own being, and the right use of all his faculties, so long as it shall
   please God, who appointed him his station in this world, to continue
   him therein; that, therefore, he is bound to have an exact government
   of his passions, and carefully to abstain from all debaucheries or
   abuses of himself, which tend either to the destruction of his own
   being, or to the disordering of his faculties, and disabling him from
   performing his duty, or hurrying him into the practice of unreasonable
   and unjust things: Lastly, that accordingly as men regard or neglect
   these obligations, so they are proportionably acceptable or displeasing
   unto God, who, being supreme governor of the world, cannot but testify
   his favour or displeasure at some time or other; and, consequently,
   since this is not done in the present state, therefore there must be a
   future state of rewards and punishments in a life to come. But all
   this, the men we are now speaking of profess to believe only so far as
   it is discoverable by the light of nature alone, without believing any
   divine revelation. These, I say, are the only true deists, and indeed
   the only persons who ought in reason to be argued with, in order to
   convince them of the reasonableness, truth, and certainty of the
   Christian revelation. But, alas! there is, as I before said, too much
   reason to believe, that there are very few such deists as these, among
   modern deniers of revelation. For such men as I have now described, if
   they would at all attend to the consequences of their own principles,
   could not fail of being quickly persuaded to embrace Christianity. For,
   being fully convinced of the obligations of natural religion, and the
   certainty of a future state of rewards and punishments; and yet
   observing, at the same time, how little use men generally are able to
   make of the light of reason, to discover the one, or to convince
   themselves effectually of the certainty and importance of the other; it
   is impossible but they must be sensible of the want of a revelation; it
   is impossible but they must earnestly desire God would be pleased, by
   some direct discovery of his will, to make these things more clear and
   plain, more easy and obvious, more certain and evident to all
   capacities; it is impossible but they must wish God would be pleased
   particularly to signify expressly the acceptableness of repentance, and
   his willingness to forgive returning sinners; it is impossible but they
   must be very solicitous to have some more particular and certain
   information concerning the nature of that future state, which reason
   teaches them in general to expect. The consequence of this, is; that
   they must needs be possessed beforehand with a strong hope that the
   Christian revelation may, upon a due examination, appear to be true.
   They must be infinitely far from ridiculing and despising any thing
   that claims to be a divine revelation, before they have sincerely and
   thoroughly examined it to the bottom. They must needs be before-hand
   very much disposed in its favour; and be very willing to be convinced
   that what tends to the advancing and perfecting the obligation of
   natural religion, to the securing their great hopes, and ascertaining
   the truth of a future state of rewards and punishments, and can any way
   be made appear to be worthy of God, and consistent with his attributes,
   and has any reasonable proof of the matters of fact it depends upon--
   is, really and truly, what it pretends to be, a divine revelation. And
   now, is it possible that any man, with these opinions and these
   dispositions, should continue to reject Christianity, when proposed to
   him in its original and genuine simplicity, without the mixture of any
   corruptions or inventions of men? Let him read the sermons and
   exhortations of our Saviour as delivered in the gospels, and the
   discourses of the apostles, preserved in their acts and their epistles,
   and try if he can withstand the evidence of such a doctrine, and reject
   the hopes of such a glorious immortality so discovered to him. That
   there is now no consistent scheme of deism in the world. The heathen
   philosophers, those few of them who taught and lived up to the
   obligations of natural religion, had indeed a consistent scheme of
   deism so far as it went; and they were very brave and wise men, if any
   of them could keep steady and firm to it. But the case is not so now.
   The same scheme of deism is not any longer consistent with its own
   principles, if it does not now lead men to embrace and believe
   revelation, as it then taught them to hope for it. Deists, in our days,
   who obstinately reject revelation when offered to them, are not such
   men as Socrates and Tully were; but, under pretence of deism, it is
   plain they are generally ridiculers of all that is truly excellent even
   in natural religion itself. Could we see a deist, whose mind was
   heartily possessed with worthy and just apprehensions of all the
   attributes of God, and a deep sense of his duty towards that supreme
   author and preserver of his being,--could we see a deist who lived in
   an exact performance of all the duties of natural religion, and by the
   practice of righteousness, justice, equity, sobriety, and temperance,
   expressed in his actions, as well as words, a firm belief and
   expectation of a future state of rewards and punishments; in a word,
   could we see a deist, who, with reverence and modesty, with sincerity
   and impartiality, with a true and hearty desire of finding out and
   submitting to reason and truth, would inquire into the foundations of
   our belief, and examine thoroughly the pretensions which pure and
   uncorrupt Christianity has to be received as a divine revelation,--I
   think we could not doubt to affirm, of such a person, as our Saviour
   did of the young man in the Gospel, that he was not far from the
   kingdom of God; and that, being willing to do his will, he should know
   of the doctrine whether it was of God. But, as I have said, there is
   great reason to doubt there are few or none such deists as these among
   the infidels of our days. This, indeed, is what they sometimes pretend,
   and seem to desire should be thought to be their case. But, alas, their
   trivial and vain cavils; their mocking and ridiculing, without and
   before examination; their directing the whole stress of their
   objections against particular customs, or particular and perhaps
   uncertain opinions, or explications of opinions, without at all
   considering the main body of religion; their loose, vain, and frothy
   discourses; and, above all, their vicious and immoral lives,--show
   plainly and undeniably, that they are not really deists, but mere
   atheists; and consequently not capable to judge of the truth of
   Christianity. If they were truly and in earnest such deists as they
   pretend, and would sometimes be thought to be, those principles (as has
   been already shown in part, and will more fully appear in the following
   discourse,) would unavoidably lead them to Christianity; but, being
   such as they really are, they cannot possibly avoid recurring to
   downright atheism.

   The sum is this: There is now [110] no such thing as a consistent
   scheme of deism. That which alone was once such, namely, the scheme of
   the best heathen philosophers, ceases now to be so, after the
   appearance of revelation; because (as I have already shown, and shall
   more largely prove in the sequel of this discourse,) it directly
   conducts men to the belief of Christianity. All other pretences to
   deism may, by unavoidable consequence, be forced to terminate in
   absolute atheism. He that cannot prevail with himself to obey the
   Christian doctrine, and embrace those hopes of life and immortality
   which our Saviour has brought to light through the Gospel, cannot now
   be imagined to maintain with any firmness, steadiness, and certainty,
   the belief of the immortality of the soul and a future state of rewards
   and punishments after death; because all the main difficulties and
   objections lie equally against both. For the same reason, he who
   disbelieves the immortality of the soul, and a future state of rewards
   and punishments, cannot defend, to any effectual purpose, or enforce
   with any sufficient strength, the obligations of morality and natural
   religion, notwithstanding that they are indeed incumbent upon men, from
   the very nature and reason of the things themselves. Then, he who gives
   up the obligations of morality and natural religion, cannot possibly
   have any just and worthy notion of the moral attributes of God, or any
   true sense of the nature and necessary difference of things; and he
   that once goes thus far has no foundation left upon which he can be
   sure of the natural attributes or even of the existence of God;
   because, to deny what unavoidably follows from the supposition of his
   existence and natural attributes, is in reality denying those natural
   attributes and that existence itself. On the contrary, he who believes
   the being and natural attributes of God, must of necessity (as has been
   shown in my former discourse) confess his moral attributes also. Next,
   he who owns, and has just notions of the moral attributes of God,
   cannot avoid acknowledging the obligations of morality and natural
   religion. In like manner, he who owns the obligations of morality and
   natural religion must needs, to support those obligations, and make
   them effectual in practice, believe a future state of rewards and
   punishments. And, finally, he who believes both the obligations of
   natural religion and the certainty of a future state of rewards and
   punishments, has no manner of reason left why he should reject the
   Christian revelation, when proposed to him in its original and genuine
   simplicity. Wherefore, since those arguments which demonstrate to us
   the being and attributes of God are so closely connected with those
   which prove the reasonableness and certainty of the Christian
   revelation, that there is now no consistent scheme of deism left,--all
   modern deists being forced to shift from one cavil to another, and
   having no fixed and certain set of principles to adhere to;--I thought
   I could no way better prevent their ill designs, and obviate all their
   different shifts and objections, than by endeavouring, in the same
   method of reasoning by which I before demonstrated the being and
   attributes of God, to prove, in like manner, by one direct and
   continued thread of arguing, the reasonableness and certainty of the
   Christian revelation also.

   To proceed therefore to the proof of the propositions themselves.

Proposition I.

   I. Proposition I. The same necessary and eternal different relations
   that different things bear one to another, and the same consequent
   fitness or unfitness of the application of different things or
   different relations one to another, with regard to which the will of
   God always and necessarily does determine itself, to choose to act only
   what is agreeable to justice, equity, goodness, and truth, in order to
   the welfare of the whole universe, ought likewise constantly to
   determine the wills of all subordinate rational beings, to govern all
   their actions by the same rules, for the good of the public, in their
   respective stations; that is, these eternal and necessary differences
   of things make it fit and reasonable for creatures so to act; They
   cause it to be their duty, or lay an obligation upon them so to do,
   even separate from the consideration of these rules being the positive
   will or command of God, and also antecedent to any respect or regard,
   expectation or apprehension, of any particular private and personal
   advantage or disadvantage, reward or punishment, either present or
   future, annexed either by natural consequence, or by positive
   appointment, to the practising or neglecting of those rules.

   The several parts of this proposition may be proved distinctly, in the
   following manner.

   I. That there are eternal and necessary differences of things. That
   there are differences of things, and different relations, respects, or
   proportions, of some things towards others, is as evident and
   undeniable as that one magnitude or number is greater, equal to, or
   smaller than another. That from these different relations of different
   things there necessarily arises an agreement or disagreement of some
   things with others, or a fitness or unfitness of the application of
   different things or different relations one to another, is likewise as
   plain as that there is any such thing as proportion or disproportion in
   geometry and arithmetic, or uniformity or difformity in comparing
   together the respective figures of bodies. Further, that there is a
   fitness or suitableness of certain circumstances to certain persons,
   and an unsuitableness of others, founded in the nature of things and
   the qualifications of persons antecedent to all positive appointment
   whatsoever; also, that, from the different relations of different
   persons one to another, there necessarily arises a fitness or unfitness
   of certain manners of behaviour of some persons towards others; is as
   manifest as that the properties which flow from the essences of
   different mathematical figures have different congruities or
   incongruities between themselves, or that, in mechanics, certain
   weights or powers have very different forces, and different effects one
   upon another, according to their different distances, or different
   positions and situations in respect of each other: For instance; that
   God is infinitely superior to men is as clear as that infinity is
   larger than a point, or eternity longer than a moment; and it is as
   certainly fit that men should honour and worship, obey and imitate God,
   than on the contrary in all their actions endeavour to dishonour and
   disobey him, as it is certainly true that they have an entire
   dependence on him, and he, on the contrary, can in no respect receive
   any advantage from them; and not only so, but also that his will is as
   certainly and unalterably just and equitable in giving his commands as
   his power is irresistible in requiring submission to it. Again: It is a
   thing absolutely and necessarily fitter in itself, that the supreme
   author and creator of the universe should govern, order, and direct all
   things to certain and constant regular ends, than that every thing
   should be permitted to go on at adventures, and produce uncertain
   effects merely by chance and in the utmost confusion, without any
   determinate view or design at all. It is a thing manifestly fitter in
   itself, that the all-powerful governor of the world should do always
   what is best in the whole, and what tends most to the universal good of
   the whole creation, than that he should make the whole continually
   miserable, or that, to satisfy the unreasonable desires of any
   particular depraved natures, he should at any time suffer the order of
   the whole to be altered and perverted. Lastly, it is a thing evidently
   and infinitely more fit, that any one particular innocent and good
   being should, by the supreme ruler and disposer of all things, be
   placed and preserved in an easy and happy estate, than that, without
   any fault or demerit of its own, it should be made extremely,
   remedilessly, and endlessly miserable. In like manner, in men's dealing
   and conversing one with another, it is undeniably more fit, absolutely
   and in the nature of the thing itself, that all men should endeavour to
   promote the universal good and welfare of all, than that all men should
   be continually contriving the ruin and destruction of all. It is
   evidently more fit, even before all positive bargains and compacts,
   that men should deal one with another according to the known rules of
   justice and equity, than that every man, for his own present advantage,
   should, without scruple, disappoint the most reasonable and equitable
   expectations of his neighbours, and cheat and defraud, or spoil by
   violence, all others, without restraint. Lastly, it is, without
   dispute, more fit and reasonable in itself, that I should preserve the
   life of an innocent man, that happens at any time to be in my power, or
   deliver him from any imminent danger, though I have never made him any
   promise so to do, than that I should suffer him to perish, or take away
   his life, without any reason or provocation at all.

   These The absurdity of those who deny the eternal and necessary
   differences of things. things are so notoriously plain and self-evident
   that nothing but the extremest stupidity of mind, corruption of
   manners, or perverseness of spirit, can possibly make any man entertain
   the least doubt concerning them. For a man indued with reason, to deny
   the truth of these things, is the very same thing as if a man that has
   the use of his sight should, at the same time that he beholds the sun,
   deny that there is any such thing as light in the world; or as if a man
   that understands geometry or arithmetic, should deny the most obvious
   and known proportions of lines or numbers, and perversely contend that
   the whole is not equal to all its parts, or that a square is not double
   to a triangle of equal base and height. Any man of ordinary capacity,
   and unbiassed judgment, plainness, and simplicity, who had never read,
   and had never been told, that there were men and philosophers who had
   in earnest asserted, and attempted to prove, that there is no natural
   and unalterable difference between good and evil, would, at the first
   hearing, be as hardly persuaded to believe that it could ever really
   enter into the heart of any intelligent man to deny all natural
   difference between right and wrong, as he would be to believe that ever
   there could be any geometer who would seriously and in good earnest lay
   it down, as a first principle, that a crooked line is as straight as a
   right one. So that indeed it might justly seem altogether a needless
   undertaking to attempt to prove and establish the eternal difference of
   good and evil, had there not appeared certain men, as Mr. Hobbes and
   some few others, who have presumed, contrary to the plainest and most
   obvious reason of mankind, to assert, and not without some subtilty
   endeavoured to prove, that there is no such real difference originally,
   necessarily, and absolutely in the nature of things; but that all
   obligation of duty to God arises merely from his absolute irresistible
   power, and all duty towards men merely from positive compact; and have
   founded their whole scheme of politics upon that opinion: Wherein, as
   they have contradicted the judgment of all the wisest and soberest part
   of mankind, so they have not been able to avoid contradicting
   themselves also; for, not to mention now, that they have no way to show
   how compacts themselves come to be obligatory, but by inconsistently
   owning an eternal original fitness in the thing itself, which I shall
   have occasion to observe hereafter: Besides, this, I say, if there be
   naturally and absolutely in things themselves no difference between
   good and evil, just and, unjust, then, in the state of nature, before
   any compact be made, it is equally as good, just, and reasonable, for
   one man to destroy the life of another, not only when it is necessary
   for his own preservation, but also arbitrarily and without any
   provocation at all, [111] or any appearance of advantage to himself, as
   to preserve or save another man's life, when he may do it without any
   hazard of his own: The consequence of which is, that not only the first
   and most obvious way for every particular man to secure himself
   effectually, would be, (as Mr Hobbes teaches) to endeavour to prevent
   and cut off all others, but also that men might destroy one another
   upon every foolish and peevish, or arbitrary humour, even when they did
   not think any such thing necessary for their own preservation: And the
   effect of this practice must needs be, that it would terminate in the
   destruction of all mankind; which being undeniably a great and
   insufferable evil, Mr Hobbes himself confesses it reasonable that, to
   prevent this evil, men should enter into certain compacts to preserve
   one another. Now, if the destruction of mankind by each other's hands
   be such an evil, that, to prevent it, it was fit and reasonable that
   men should enter into compacts to preserve each other, then, before any
   such compacts, it was manifestly a thing unfit and unreasonable in
   itself that mankind should all destroy one another. And if so, then for
   the same reason it was also unfit and unreasonable, antecedent to all
   compacts, that any one man should destroy another arbitrarily and
   without any provocation, or at any time when it was not absolutely and
   immediately necessary for the preservation of himself; which is
   directly contradictory to Mr. Hobbes's first supposition, [112] of
   there being no natural and absolute difference between good and evil,
   just and unjust, antecedent to positive compact. And in like manner,
   all others, who, upon any pretence whatsoever, teach that good and evil
   depend originally on the constitution of positive laws, whether divine
   or human, must unavoidably run into the same absurdity: For, if there
   be no such thing as good and evil in the nature of things, antecedent
   to all laws, then neither can any one law be better than another, nor
   any one thing whatever be more justly established and enforced by laws,
   than the contrary; nor can [113] any reason be given why any laws
   should ever be made at all: But all laws equally will be either
   arbitrary and tyrannical, [114] or frivolous and needless, because the
   contrary might with equal reason have been established, if, before the
   making of the laws, all things had been alike indifferent in their own
   nature. There is no possible way to avoid this absurdity, but by
   saying, that, out of things in their own nature absolutely indifferent,
   those are chosen by wise governors to be made obligatory by law, the
   practice of which they judge will tend to the public benefit of the
   community. But this is an express contradiction in the very terms. For,
   if the practice of certain things tends to the public benefit of the
   world, and the contrary would tend to the public disadvantage, then
   those things are not in their own nature indifferent, but were good and
   reasonable to be practised before any law was made, and can only for
   that very reason be wisely enforced by the authority of laws. Only here
   it is to be observed, that, by the public benefit, must [115] not be
   understood the interest of any one particular nation, to the plain
   injury or prejudice of the rest of mankind, any more than the interest
   of one city or family, in opposition to their neighbours of the same
   country. But those things only are truly good in their own nature which
   either tend to the universal benefit and welfare of all men, or at
   least are not destructive of it. The true state, therefore, of this
   case, is plainly this: Some things are in their own nature good and
   reasonable, and fit to be done; such as keeping faith, and performing
   equitable compacts, and the like; and these receive not their
   obligatory power from any law or authority, but are only declared,
   confirmed, and enforced by penalties upon such as would not perhaps be
   governed by right reason only. Other things are in their own nature
   absolutely evil; such as breaking faith, refusing to perform equitable
   compacts, cruelly destroying those who have neither directly nor
   indirectly given any occasion for any such treatment, and the like: And
   these cannot, by any law or authority whatsoever, be made fit and
   reasonable, or excusable to be practised. Lastly, other things are in
   their own nature indifferent; that is, (not absolutely and strictly so;
   as such trivial actions, which have no way any tendency at all either
   to the public welfare or damage; for, concerning such things, it would
   be childish and trifling to suppose any laws to be made at all; but
   they are) such things, whose tendency to the public benefit or
   disadvantage is either so small or so remote, or so obscure and
   involved, that the generality of people are not able of themselves to
   discern on which side they ought to act; and these things are made
   obligatory by the authority of laws, though perhaps every one cannot
   distinctly perceive the reason and fitness of their being enjoined; of
   which sort are many particular penal laws in several countries and
   nations. But to proceed:

   The An answer to the objection drawn from the variety of the opinions
   of learned men, and the laws of different nations concerning right and
   wrong. principal thing that can, with any colour of reason, seem to
   countenance the opinion of those who deny the natural and eternal
   difference of good and evil, (for Mr. Hobbes's false reasonings I shall
   hereafter consider by themselves,) is the difficulty there may
   sometimes be, to define exactly the bounds of right and wrong, the
   variety [116] of opinions that have obtained even among understanding
   and learned men concerning certain questions of just and unjust,
   especially in political matters, and the many contrary laws that have
   been made in divers ages and in different countries concerning these
   matters. But as, in painting, two very different colours, by diluting
   each other very slowly and gradually, may, from the highest intenseness
   in either extreme, terminate in the midst insensibly, and so run one
   into the other, that it shall not be possible even for a skilful eye to
   determine exactly where the one ends and the other begins; and yet the
   colours may really differ as much as can be, not in degree only, but
   entirely in kind, as red and blue, or white and black; so, though it
   may perhaps be very difficult, in some nice and perplexed cases, (which
   yet are very far from occurring frequently,) to define exactly the
   bounds of right and wrong, just and unjust, and there may be some
   latitude in the judgment of different men and the laws of divers
   nations; yet right and wrong are nevertheless in themselves totally and
   essentially different; even altogether as much as white and black,
   light and darkness. The Spartan law, perhaps, which [117] permitted
   their youth to steal, may, as absurd as it was, bear much dispute
   whether it was absolutely unjust or no, because every man having an
   absolute right in his own goods, it may seem that the members of any
   society may agree to transfer or alter their own properties upon what
   conditions they shall think fit; but if it could be supposed that a law
   had been made at Sparta, or at Rome, or in India, or in any other part
   of the world, whereby it had been commanded or allowed, that every man
   might rob by violence, and murder whomsoever he met with, or that no
   faith should be kept with any man, nor any equitable compacts
   performed, no man, with any tolerable use of his reason, whatever
   diversity of judgment might be among them in other matters, would have
   thought that such a law could have authorised or excused, much less
   have justified such actions, and have made them become good; because,
   it is plainly not in men's power to make falsehood be truth, though
   they may alter the property of their goods as they please. Now, if, in
   flagrant cases, the natural and essential difference between good and
   evil, right and wrong, cannot but be confessed to be plainly and
   undeniably evident, the difference between them must be also essential
   and unalterable in all, even the smallest, and nicest, and most
   intricate cases, though it be not so easy to be discerned and
   accurately distinguished; for, if, from the difficulty of determining
   exactly the bounds of right and wrong in many perplexed cases, it could
   truly be concluded that just and unjust were not essentially different
   by nature, but only by positive constitution and custom, it would
   follow equally, that they were not really, essentially, and unalterably
   different, even in the most flagrant cases that can be supposed; which
   is an assertion so very absurd, that Mr. Hobbes himself could hardly
   vent it without blushing, and discovering plainly, by his shifting
   expressions, his secret self-condemnation. There are, therefore,
   certain necessary and eternal differences of things, and certain
   consequent fitnesses or unfitnesses of the application of different
   things, or different relations one to another, not depending on any
   positive constitutions, but founded unchangeably in the nature and
   reason of things, and unavoidably arising from the differences of the
   things themselves; which is the first branch of the general proposition
   I proposed to prove.

   2. That the will of God always determines itself to act according to
   the eternal reason of things. Now, what these eternal and unalterable
   relations, respects, or proportions of things, with their consequent
   agreements or disagreements, fitnesses, or unfitnesses, absolutely and
   necessarily are in themselves, that also they appear to be, to the
   understandings of all intelligent beings, except those only who
   understand things to be what they are not, that is, whose
   understandings are either very imperfect or very much depraved. And by
   this understanding or knowledge of the natural and necessary relations,
   fitnesses, and proportions of things, the wills likewise of all
   intelligent beings are constantly directed, and must needs be
   determined to act accordingly, excepting those only who will things to
   be what they are not and cannot be; that is, whose wills are corrupted
   by particular interest or affection, or swayed by some unreasonable and
   prevailing passion. Wherefore, since the natural attributes of God, his
   infinite knowledge, wisdom, and power, set him infinitely above all
   possibility of being deceived by any error, or of being influenced by
   any wrong affection, it is manifest his divine will cannot but always
   and necessarily determine itself to choose to do what in the whole is
   absolutely best and fittest to be done; that is, to act constantly
   according to the eternal rules of infinite goodness, justice, and
   truth; as I have endeavoured to show distinctly in my former discourse,
   in deducing severally the moral attributes of God.

   3. That all rational creatures are obliged to govern themselves in all
   their actions, by the same eternal rule of reason. And now that the
   same reason of things, with regard to which the will of God always and
   necessarily does determine itself to act in constant conformity to the
   eternal rules of justice, equity, goodness, and truth, ought also
   constantly to determine the wills of all subordinate rational beings,
   to govern all their actions by the same rules, is very evident. For, as
   it is absolutely impossible in nature that God should be deceived by
   any error, or influenced by any wrong affection, so it is very
   unreasonable and blame-worthy in practice, that any intelligent
   creatures, whom God has made so far like unto himself, as to indue them
   with those excellent faculties of reason and will, whereby they are
   enabled to distinguish good from evil, and to choose the one and refuse
   the other, should either negligently suffer themselves to be imposed
   upon and deceived in matters of good and evil, right and wrong, or
   wilfully and perversely allow themselves to be over-ruled by absurd
   passions, and corrupt or partial affections, to act contrary to what
   they know is fit to be done. Which two things, viz. negligent
   misunderstanding, and wilful passions or lusts, are, as I said, the
   only causes which can make a reasonable creature act contrary to
   reason, that is, contrary to the eternal rules of justice, equity,
   righteousness, and truth: For, was it not for these inexcusable
   corruptions and depravations, it is impossible but the same proportions
   and fitnesses of things, which have so much weight, and so much
   excellency, and beauty in them, that the all-powerful creator and
   governor of the universe, (who has the absolute and uncontrollable
   dominion of all things in his own hands, and is accountable to none for
   what he does, yet) thinks it no diminution of his power to make this
   reason of things the unalterable rule and law of his own actions in the
   government of the world, and does nothing by mere will and
   arbitrariness; it is impossible, (I say,) if it was not for inexcusable
   corruption and depravation, but the same eternal reason of things must
   much more have weight enough to determine constantly the wills and
   actions of all subordinate, finite, dependent, and accountable beings.
   Proved from the original nature of things. For originally, and in
   reality, it is as natural and (morally speaking) necessary, that the
   will should be determined in every action by the reason of the thing,
   and the right of the case, as it is natural and (absolutely speaking)
   necessary, that the understanding should submit to a demonstrated
   truth; and it is as absurd and blame-worthy, to mistake negligently
   plain right and wrong, that is, to understand the proportions of things
   in morality to be what they are not, or wilfully to act contrary to
   known justice and equity, that is, to will things to be what they are
   not and cannot be, as it would be absurd and ridiculous for a man, in
   arithmetical matters, ignorantly to believe that twice two is not equal
   to four, or wilfully and obstinately to contend, against his own clear
   knowledge, that the whole is not equal to all its parts. The only
   difference is, that assent to a plain speculative truth is not in a
   man's power to withhold; but to act according to the plain right and
   reason of things, this he may, by the natural liberty of his will,
   forbear; but the one he ought to do, and it is as much his plain and
   indispensable duty, as the other he cannot but do, and it is the
   necessity of his nature to do it: He that will-fully refuses to honour
   and obey God, from whom he received his being, and to whom he
   continually owes his preservation, is really guilty of an equal
   absurdity and inconsistency in practice, as he that in speculation
   denies the effect to owe any thing to its cause, or the whole to be
   bigger than its part. He that refuses to deal with all men equitably,
   and with every man as he desires they should deal with him, is guilty
   of the very same unreasonableness and contradiction in one case, as he
   that in another case should affirm one number or quantity to be equal
   to another, and yet that other at the same time not to be equal to the
   first: Lastly, he that acknowledges himself obliged to the practice of
   certain duties both towards God and towards men, and yet takes no care
   either to preserve his own being, or at least not to preserve himself
   in such a state and temper of mind and body, as may best enable him to
   perform those duties, is altogether as inexcusable and ridiculous as he
   that in any other matter should affirm one thing at the same time that
   he denies another, without which the former could not possibly be true;
   or undertake one thing at the same time that he obstinately omits
   another, without which the former is by no means practicable: Wherefore
   all rational creatures, whose wills are not constantly and regularly
   determined, and their actions governed by right reason and the
   necessary differences of good and evil, according to the eternal and
   invariable rules of justice, equity, goodness, and truth, but suffer
   themselves to be swayed by unaccountable arbitrary humours and rash
   passions, by lusts, vanity, and pride, by private interest, or present
   sensual pleasures; these, setting up their own unreasonable self-will
   in opposition to the nature and reason of things, endeavour (as much as
   in them lies) to make things be what they are not, and cannot be; which
   is the highest presumption and greatest insolence, as well as the
   greatest absurdity imaginable: It is acting contrary to that
   understanding, reason, and judgment, which God has implanted in their
   natures, on purpose to enable them to discern the difference between
   good and evil;--it is attempting to destroy that order by which the
   universe subsists;--it is offering the highest affront imaginable to
   the creator of all things, who made things to be what they are, and
   governs every thing himself according to the laws of their several
   natures;--in a word, all wilful wickedness and perversion of right is
   the very same insolence and absurdity in moral matters, as it would be
   in natural things for a man to pretend to alter the certain proportions
   of numbers,--to take away the demonstrable relations and properties of
   mathematical figures,--to make light darkness, and darkness light,--or
   to call sweet bitter, and bitter sweet.

   Further: And from the sense that all, even wicked men, unavoidably have
   of their being under such an obligation. As it appears thus, from the
   abstract and absolute reason and nature of things, that all rational
   creatures ought, that is, are obliged to take care that their wills and
   actions be constantly determined and governed by the eternal rule of
   right and equity: so the certainty and universality of that obligation
   is plainly confirmed, and the force of it particularly discovered and
   applied to every man by this; that, in like manner as no one who is
   instructed in mathematics can forbear giving his assent to every
   geometrical demonstration, of which he understands the terms, either by
   his own study, or by having had them explained to him by others; so no
   man, who either has patience and opportunities to examine and consider
   things himself, or has the means of being taught and instructed in any
   tolerable manner by others, concerning the necessary relations and
   dependencies of things, can avoid giving his assent to the fitness and
   reasonableness of his governing all his actions by the law or rule
   before mentioned, even though his practice, through the prevalence of
   brutish lusts, be most absurdly contradictory to that assent. That is
   to say, by the reason of his mind, he cannot but be compelled to own
   and acknowledge that there is really such an obligation indispensably
   incumbent upon him; even at the same time that in the actions of his
   life he is endeavouring to throw it off and despise it: For the
   judgment and conscience of a man's own mind, concerning the
   reasonableness and fitness of the thing, that his actions should be
   conformed to such or such a rule or law, is the truest and formallest
   obligation, even more properly and strictly so than any opinion
   whatsoever of the authority of the giver of a law, or any regard he may
   have to its sanction by rewards and punishments. For whoever acts
   contrary to this sense and conscience of his own mind, is necessarily
   self-condemned; and the greatest and strongest of all obligations is
   that which a man cannot break through without condemning himself. The
   dread of superior power and authority, and the sanction of rewards and
   punishments, however, indeed, absolutely necessary to the government of
   frail and fallible creatures, and truly the most effectual means of
   keeping them in their duty, is yet really in itself only a secondary
   and additional obligation or enforcement of the first. The original
   obligation of all (the ambiguous use of which word, as a term of art,
   has caused some perplexity and confusion in this matter,) is the
   eternal reason of things; that reason, which God himself, who has no
   superior to direct him, and to whose happiness nothing can be added nor
   any thing diminished from it, yet constantly obliges himself to govern
   the world by: And the more excellent and perfect (or the freer from
   corruption and depravation) any creatures are, the more cheerfully and
   steadily are their wills always determined by this supreme obligation,
   in conformity to the nature, and in imitation of the most perfect will
   of God: So far, therefore, as men are conscious of what is right and
   wrong, so far they are under an obligation to act accordingly; and,
   consequently, that eternal rule of right which I have been hereto
   describing, it is evident ought as indispensably to govern men's
   actions, as it cannot but necessarily determine their assent.

   Now that the case is truly thus; that the eternal And from the judgment
   of mens' consciences upon their own past actions. differences of good
   and evil, the unalterable rule of right and equity, do necessarily and
   unavoidably determine the judgment, and force the assent of all men
   that use any consideration, is undeniably manifest from the universal
   experience of mankind; for no man willingly and deliberately
   transgresses this rule in any great and considerable instance, but he
   acts contrary to the judgment and reason of his own mind, and secretly
   reproaches himself for so doing: And no man observes and obeys it
   steadily, especially in cases of difficulty and temptation, when it
   interferes with any present interest, pleasure, or passion, but his own
   mind commends and applauds him for his resolution in executing what his
   conscience could not forbear giving its assent to, as just and right:
   And this is what St. Paul means, when he says, (Rom. ii. 14, 15,) that
   when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things
   contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
   themselves; which show the work of the law written in their hearts,
   their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile
   accusing, or else excusing one another.

   It Of that natural knowledge which Plato thought to be reminiscence.
   was a very wise observation of Plato, which he received from Socrates,
   that if you take a young man, impartial and unprejudiced, one that
   never had any learning, nor any experience in the world, and examine
   him about the natural relations and proportions of things, [or the
   moral differences of good and evil,] you may, only by asking him
   questions, without teaching him any thing at all directly, cause him to
   express in his answers just and adequate notions of geometrical truths,
   [and true and exact determinations concerning matters of right and
   wrong.] From whence he thought it was to be concluded, that all
   knowledge and learning is nothing but memory, or only a recollecting,
   upon every new occasion, what had been before known in a state of
   pre-existence. And some others, both ancients and moderns, have
   concluded that the ideas of all first and simple truths, either natural
   or moral, are innate and originally impressed or stamped upon the mind.
   In their inference from the observation, the authors of both these
   opinions seem to be mistaken; but thus much it proves
   unavoidably,--that the differences, relations, and proportions of
   things, both natural and moral, in which all unprejudiced minds thus
   naturally agree, are certain, unalterable, and real in the things
   themselves, and do not at all depend on the variable opinions, fancies,
   or imaginations of men prejudiced by education, laws, customs, or evil
   practices: And also that the mind of man naturally and unavoidably
   gives its assent, as to natural and geometrical truth, so also to the
   moral differences of things, and to the fitness and reasonableness of
   the obligation of the everlasting law of righteousness, whenever fairly
   and plainly proposed.

   Some men, The most profligate men not utterly insensible of the
   difference of good and evil. indeed, who, by means of a very evil and
   vicious education, or through a long habit of wickedness and
   debauchery, have extremely corrupted the principles of their nature,
   and have long accustomed themselves to bear down their own reason by
   the force of prejudice, lust, and passion, that they may not be forced
   to confess themselves self-condemned, will confidently and absolutely
   contend that they do not really see any natural and necessary
   difference between what we call right and wrong, just and unjust; that
   the reason and judgment of their own mind does not tell them they are
   under any such indispensable obligations as we would endeavour to
   persuade them; and that they are not sensible they ought to be governed
   by any other rule than their own will and pleasure. But even these men,
   the most abandoned of all mankind, however industriously they endeavour
   to conceal and deny their self-condemnation, yet they cannot avoid
   making a discovery of it sometimes when they are not aware of it. For
   example, there is no man so vile and desperate who commits at any time
   a murder and robbery, with the most unrelenting mind, but would choose,
   [118] if such a thing could be proposed to him to obtain all the same
   profit or advantage, whatsoever it be that he aims at, without
   committing the crime, rather than with it, even though he was sure to
   go unpunished for committing the crime. Nay, I believe there is no man
   even in Mr Hobbes's state of nature, and of Mr Hobbes's own principles,
   but if he was equally assured of securing his main end, his
   self-preservation, by either way, would choose to preserve himself
   rather without destroying all his fellow-creatures, than with it, even
   supposing all impunity, and all other future conveniences of life,
   equal in either case. Mr. Hobbes's own scheme, of men's agreeing by
   compact to preserve one another, can hardly be supposed without this.
   And this plainly evinces, that the mind of man unavoidably acknowledges
   a natural and necessary difference between good and evil, antecedent to
   all arbitrary and positive constitution whatsoever.

   But Men's natural sense of eternal moral obligations, proved from the
   judgment they all pass upon the actions of others. the truth of this,
   that the mind of man naturally and necessarily assents to the eternal
   law of righteousness, may still better, and more clearly, and more
   universally appear, from the judgment that men pass upon each other's
   actions, than from what we can discern concerning their consciousness
   of their own. For men may dissemble and conceal from the world the
   judgment of their own conscience; nay, by a strange partiality, they
   may even impose upon and deceive themselves, (for who is there that
   does not sometimes allow himself, nay, and even justify himself in that
   wherein he condemns another?) But men's judgments concerning the
   actions of others, especially where they have no relation to
   themselves, or repugnance to their interest, are commonly impartial;
   and from this we may judge what sense men naturally have of the
   unalterable difference of right and wrong. Now the observation which
   every one cannot but make in this matter is this; that virtue and true
   goodness, righteousness and equity, are things so truly noble and
   excellent, so lovely and venerable in themselves, and do so necessarily
   approve themselves to the reason and consciences of men, that even
   those very persons who, by the prevailing power of some interest or
   lust, are themselves drawn aside out of the paths of virtue, [119] can
   yet hardly ever forbear to give it its true character and commendation
   in others. And this observation holds true, not only in the generality
   of vicious men, but very frequently even in the worst sort of them,
   viz. those who persecute others for being better than themselves. Thus
   the officers who were sent by the Pharisees to apprehend our Saviour,
   could not forbear declaring [120] that he spake as never man spake; and
   the Roman governor, when he gave sentence that he should be crucified,
   could not at the same instant forbear openly declaring that he found no
   fault in him. [121] Even in this case men cannot choose but think well
   of those persons whom the dominion of their lusts will not suffer them
   to imitate, or whom their present interest and the necessity of their
   worldly affairs compels them to discourage. They cannot but desire,
   that they themselves were the men they are not, and wish, with Balaam,
   that though they imitate not the life, yet at least they might die the
   death of the righteous, and that their last end might be like theirs.
   And hence it is that Plato judiciously observes, [122] that even the
   worst of men seldom or never make so wrong judgment concerning persons
   as they do concerning things, there being in virtue an unaccountable
   and as it were divine force, which, whatever confusion men endeavour to
   introduce in things by their vicious discourses and debauched
   practices, yet almost always compels them to distinguish right
   concerning persons, and makes them admire and praise just and
   equitable, and honest men. On the contrary, vice and injustice,
   profaneness and debauchery, are things so absolutely odious in their
   own nature, that however they insinuate themselves into the practice,
   yet they can never gain over to themselves the judgment of mankind.
   They who do evil, yet see and approve what is good, and condemn in
   others what they blindly allow in themselves; nay, and very frequently
   condemn even themselves also, not without great disorder and uneasiness
   of mind, in those very things wherein they allow themselves. At least,
   there is hardly any wicked man, but when his own case is represented to
   him under the person of another, will freely enough pass sentence
   against the wickedness he himself is guilty of; and, with sufficient
   severity, exclaim against all iniquity. This shows abundantly, that all
   variation from the eternal rule of right is absolutely and in the
   nature of the thing itself to be abhorred and detested, and that the
   unprejudiced mind of man as naturally disapproves injustice in moral
   matters, as in natural things it cannot but dissent from falsehood, or
   dislike incongruities. Even in reading the histories of past and far
   distant ages, where it is plain we can have no concern for the events
   of things, nor prejudices concerning the characters of persons; who is
   there, that does not praise and admire, nay highly esteem, and in his
   imagination love (as it were) the equity, justice, truth, and fidelity
   of some persons, and, with the greatest indignation and hatred, detest
   the barbarity, injustice, and treachery of others? Nay, further, when
   the prejudices of corrupt minds lie all on the side of injustice, as
   when we have obtained some very great profit or advantage through
   another man's treachery or breach of faith; ye [123] who is there,
   that, upon that very occasion, does not (even to a proverb,) dislike
   the person and the action, how much soever he may rejoice at the event?
   But when we come ourselves to suffer by iniquity, then where are all
   the arguments and sophistries by which unjust men, while they are
   oppressing others, would persuade themselves that they are not sensible
   of any natural difference between good and evil? When it comes to be
   these men's own case to be oppressed by violence, or overreached by
   fraud, where then are all their pleas against the eternal distinction
   of right and wrong? How, on the contrary, do they then cry out for
   equity, and exclaim against injustice? How do they then challenge and
   object against Providence, and think neither God nor man severe enough,
   in punishing the violators of right and truth? Whereas if there was no
   natural and eternal difference between just and unjust, no man could
   have any reason to complain of injury, any other than what laws and
   compacts made so; which in innumerable cases will be always to be
   evaded.

   An answer to the objection drawn from the total ignorance of some
   barbarous nations in matters of morality. There is but one thing that I
   am sensible of, which can here with any colour be objected against what
   has been hitherto said concerning the necessity of the mind's giving
   its assent to the eternal law of righteousness; and that is, the total
   ignorance which some whole nations are reported to lie under of the
   nature and force of these moral obligations. I am not satisfied the
   matter of fact is true; but if it was, yet mere ignorance affords no
   just objection against the certainty of any truth. Were there upon
   earth a nation of rational and considerate persons, whose notions
   concerning moral obligations, and concerning the nature and force of
   them, were universally and directly contrary to what I have hitherto
   represented, this would be indeed a weighty objection; but ignorance
   and stupidity are no arguments against the certainty of any thing.
   There are many nations and people almost totally ignorant of the
   plainest mathematical truths; as, of the proportion, for example, of a
   square to a triangle of the same base and height: And yet these truths
   are such, to which the mind cannot but give its assent necessarily and
   unavoidably, as soon as they are distinctly proposed to it. All that
   this objection proves, therefore, supposing the matter of it to be
   true, is only this; not, that the mind of man can ever dissent from the
   rule of right, much less that there is no necessary difference in
   nature between moral good and evil, any more than it proves that there
   are no certain and necessary proportions of numbers, lines, or figures;
   but this it proves only, that men have great need to be taught and
   instructed in some very plain and easy, as well as certain truths; and
   if they be important truths, that then men have need also to have them
   frequently inculcated, and strongly enforced upon them: Which is very
   true; and is (as shall hereafter be particularly made to appear,) one
   good argument for the reasonableness of expecting a revelation.

   4. Of the principal moral obligations in particular. Thus it appears,
   in general, that the mind of man cannot avoid giving its assent to the
   eternal law of righteousness, that is, cannot but acknowledge the
   reasonableness and fitness of men's governing all their actions by the
   rule of right or equity; and also that this assent is a formal
   obligation upon every man, actually and constantly to conform himself
   to that rule. I might now from hence deduce, in particular, all the
   several duties of morality or natural religion; but, because this would
   take up too large a portion of my intended discourse, and may easily be
   supplied abundantly out of several-late excellent writers, I shall only
   mention the three great and principal branches from which all the other
   and smaller instances of duty do naturally flow, or may without
   difficulty be derived.

   First, Of piety, or men's duty towards God. then; in respect of God,
   the rule of righteousness is, that we keep up constantly in our minds
   the highest possible honour, esteem, and veneration for him, which must
   express itself in proper and respective influences upon all our
   passions, and in the suitable direction of all our actions;--that we
   worship and adore him, and him alone, as the only supreme author,
   preserver, and governor of all things;--that we employ our whole being,
   and all our powers and faculties in his service, and for his glory,
   that is, in encouraging the practice of universal righteousness, and
   promoting the designs of his divine goodness amongst men, in such way
   and manner as shall at any time appear to be his will we should do
   it;--and, finally, that, to enable us to do this continually, we pray
   unto him constantly for whatever we stand in need of, and return him
   continual and hearty thanks for whatever good things we at any time
   receive. There is no congruity or proportion in the uniform disposition
   and correspondent order of any bodies or magnitudes, no fitness or
   agreement in the application of similar and equal geometrical figures
   one to another, or in the comparing them one with another, so visible
   and conspicuous as is the beauty and harmony of the exercise of God's
   several attributes, meeting with suitable returns of duty and honour
   from all his rational creatures throughout the universe;--the
   consideration of his eternity and infinity, his knowledge and his
   wisdom, necessarily commands our highest admiration;--the sense of his
   omnipresence forces a perpetual, awful regard towards him;--his supreme
   authority, as being the creator, preserver, and absolute governor of
   all things, obliges us to pay him all possible honour and veneration,
   adoration, and worship, and his unity requires that it be paid to him
   alone;--his power and justice demand our fear;--his mercy and
   placableness encourage our hope;--his goodness necessarily excites our
   love;--his veracity and unchangeableness secure our trust in him;--the
   sense of our having received our being, and all our powers from him,
   makes it infinitely reasonable that we should employ our whole being
   and all our faculties in his service;--the consciousness of our
   continual dependence upon him both for our preservation and the supply
   of every thing we want, obliges us to constant prayer;--and every good
   thing we enjoy, the air we breathe, and the food we eat, the rain from
   heaven, and the fruitful seasons, all the blessings and comforts of the
   present time, and the hopes and expectations we have of what is to
   come, do all demand our heartiest gratitude and thanksgiving to him.
   [124] The suitableness and proportion, the correspondency and connexion
   of each of these things respectively, is as plain and conspicuous as
   the shining of the sun at noon-day; [125] and it is the greatest
   absurdity and perverseness in the world for creatures, indued with
   reason, to attempt to break through and transgress this necessary order
   and dependency of things: All inanimate and all irrational beings, by
   the necessity of their nature, constantly obey the laws of their
   creation, and tend regularly to the ends for which they were appointed;
   how monstrous then is it that reasonable creatures, merely because they
   are not necessitated, should abuse that glorious privilege of liberty
   by which they are exalted in dignity above the rest of God's creation,
   to make themselves the alone unreasonable and disorderly part of the
   universe!--that a tree planted in a fruitful soil, and watered
   continually with the dew of heaven, and cherished constantly with the
   kindly warmth and benign influence of the sunbeams, should yet never
   bring forth either leaves or fruit, is in no degree so irregular, and
   contrary to nature, as that a rational being, created after the image
   of God, and conscious of God's doing every thing for him that becomes
   the relation of an infinitely good and bountiful Creator to his
   creatures, should yet never on his part make any return of those duties
   which arise necessarily from the relation of a creature to his Creator.

   Secondly. Of righteousness or the duty of men one towards another. In
   respect of our fellow-creatures, the rule of righteousness is; that in
   particular we so deal with every man, as in like circumstances we could
   reasonably expect he should deal with us, and that in general we
   endeavour, by an universal benevolence, to promote the welfare and
   happiness of all men: The former branch of this rule is equity, the
   latter is love.

   Of justice and equity. As to the former, viz. equity; the reason which
   obliges every man in practice, so to deal always with another as he
   would reasonably expect that others should in like circumstances deal
   with him, is the very same as that which forces him, in speculation, to
   affirm, that if one line or number be equal to another, that other is
   reciprocally equal to it. Iniquity is the very same in action as
   falsity or contradiction in theory, and the same cause which makes the
   one absurd makes the other unreasonable. Whatever relation or
   proportion one man in any case bears to another, the same that other,
   when put in like circumstances, bears to him. Whatever I judge
   reasonable or unreasonable, for another to do for me, that, by the same
   judgment, I declare reasonable or unreasonable that I in the like case
   should do for him. And to deny this either in word or action, is as if
   a man should contend, that though two and three are equal to five, yet
   five are not equal to two and three. [126] Wherefore, were not men
   strangely and most unnaturally corrupted by perverse and unaccountably
   false opinions, and monstrous evil customs and habits, prevailing
   against the clearest and plainest reason in the world, it would be
   impossible that universal equity should not be practised by all
   mankind, and especially among equals, where the proportion of equity is
   simple and obvious, and every man's own case is already the same with
   all others, without any nice comparing or transposing of circumstances.
   It would be as impossible [127] that a man, contrary to the eternal
   reason of things, should desire to gain some small profit to himself,
   by doing violence and damage to his neighbour, as that he should be
   willing to be deprived of necessaries himself, to satisfy the
   unreasonable covetousness or ambition of another. In a word, it would
   be impossible for men not to be as much ashamed of doing iniquity, as
   they are of believing contradictions. In considering indeed the duties
   of superiors in various relations, the proportion of equity is somewhat
   more complex, but still it may always be deduced from the same rule of
   doing as we would be done by, if careful regard be had at the same time
   to the difference of relation; that is, if, in considering what is fit
   for you to do to another, you always take into the account, not only
   every circumstance of the action, but also every circumstance wherein
   the person differs from you, and in judging what you would desire that
   another, if your circumstances were transposed, should do to you, you
   always consider not what any unreasonable passion or private interest
   would prompt you, but what impartial reason would dictate to you to
   desire. For example, a magistrate, in order to deal equitably with a
   criminal, is not to consider what fear or self-love would cause him in
   the criminal's case to desire, but what reason and the public good
   would oblige him to acknowledge was fit and just for him to expect. And
   the same proportion is to be observed in deducing the duties of parents
   and children, of masters and servants, of governors and subjects, of
   citizens and foreigners, in what manner every person is obliged, by the
   rule of equity, to behave himself in each of these and all other
   relations. In the regular and uniform practice of all which duties
   among all mankind, in their several and respective relations, through
   the whole earth, consists that universal justice which is the top and
   perfection of all virtues: which, if, as Plato says, [128] it could be
   represented visibly to mortal eyes, would raise in us an inexpressible
   love and admiration of it; which would introduce into the world such a
   glorious and happy state as the ancient poets have attempted to
   describe in their fiction of a golden age; which in itself is so truly
   beautiful and lovely, that, as Aristotle [129] elegantly expresses it,
   the motions of the heavenly bodies are not so admirably regular and
   harmonious, nor the brightness of the sun and stars so ornamental to
   the visible fabric of the world, as the universal practice of this
   illustrious virtue would be conducive to the glory and advantage of the
   rational part of this lower creation; which, lastly, is so truly noble
   and excellent in its own nature, that the wisest and most considering
   men have always declared, [130] that neither life itself, nor [131] all
   other possible enjoyments in the world, put together, are of any value
   or esteem in comparison of, or in competition with, that right temper
   and disposition of mind from which flows the practice of this universal
   justice and equity. On the contrary, injustice and iniquity, violence,
   fraud, and oppression, the universal confusion of right and wrong, and
   the general neglect and contempt of all the duties arising from men's
   several relations one to another, is the greatest and most unnatural
   corruption of God's creation that it is possible for depraved and
   rebellious creatures to introduce: As they themselves who practise
   iniquity most, and are most desirous to defend it, yet whenever it
   comes to be their own turn to suffer by it, are not very backward to
   acknowledge. To comprise this matter, therefore, in one word; what the
   sun's forsaking that equal course, which now, by diffusing gentle
   warmth and light, cherishes and invigorates every thing in a due
   proportion through the whole system, and on the contrary, his burning
   up, by an irregular and disorderly motion, some of the orbs with
   insupportable heat, and leaving others to perish in extreme cold and
   darkness; what this, I say, would be to the natural world, that very
   same thing, injustice, and tyranny, iniquity, and all wickedness, is to
   the moral and rational part of the creation. The only difference is
   this; that the one is an obstinate and wilful corruption, and most
   perverse depravation of creatures made after the image of God, and a
   violating the eternal and unalterable law or reason of things, which is
   of the utmost importance; whereas the other would be only a revolution
   or change, of the arbitrary and temporary frame of nature.

   Of universal mutual benevolence. The second branch of the rule of
   righteousness, with respect to our fellow-creatures, I said, was
   universal love or benevolence; that is, not only the doing barely what
   is just and right in our dealings with every man, but also a constant
   endeavouring to promote, in general, to the utmost of our power, the
   welfare and happiness of all men. The obligation to which duty, also,
   may easily be deduced from what has been already laid down. For if (as
   has been before proved) there be a natural and necessary difference
   between good and evil, and that which is good is fit and reasonable,
   and that which is evil is unreasonable to be done; and that which is
   the greatest good, is always the most fit and reasonable to be chosen:
   Then, as the goodness of God extends itself universally over all his
   works through the whole creation, by doing always what is absolutely
   best in the whole; so every rational creature ought, in its sphere and
   station, according to its respective powers and faculties, to do all
   the good it can to all its fellow-creatures. To which end, universal
   love and benevolence is as plainly the most direct, certain, and
   effectual means, as [132] in mathematics the flowing of a point is to
   produce a line, or, in arithmetic, the addition of numbers to produce a
   sum; or in physics, certain kind of motions to preserve certain bodies,
   which other kinds of motions tend to corrupt. Of all which, the mind of
   man is so naturally sensible, that, except in such men whose affections
   are prodigiously corrupted by most unnatural and habitual vicious
   practices, there is no duty whatsoever, the performance whereof affords
   a man so ample pleasure [133] and satisfaction, and fills his mind with
   so comfortable a sense of his having done the greatest good he was
   capable to do, of his having best answered the ends of his creation,
   and nearliest imitated the perfections of his Creator, and consequently
   of his having fully complied with the highest and principal obligations
   of his nature; as the performance of this one duty, of universal love
   and benevolence, naturally affords. But further; the obligation to this
   great duty may also otherwise be deduced from the nature of man, in the
   following manner. Next to that natural self-love, or care of his own
   preservation, which every one necessarily has in the first place for
   himself, there is in all men a certain natural affection for their
   children and posterity, who have a dependence upon them; and for their
   near relations and friends, who have an intimacy with them. And because
   the nature of man is such, that they cannot live comfortably in
   independent families, without still further society and commerce with
   each other; therefore they naturally desire to increase their
   dependences, by multiplying affinities, and to enlarge their
   friendships by mutual good offices, and to establish societies by a
   communication of arts and labour, till, [134] by degrees, the affection
   of single persons becomes a friendship of families, and this enlarges
   itself to society of towns, and cities, and nations, and terminates in
   the agreeing community of all mankind: The foundation, preservation,
   and perfection of which universal friendship or society is mutual love
   and benevolence. And nothing hinders the world from being actually put
   into so happy a state but perverse iniquity, and unreasonable want of
   mutual charity. Wherefore, since men are plainly so constituted by
   nature, that they stand in need of each other's assistance to make
   themselves easy in the world, and are fitted to live in communities,
   and society is absolutely necessary for them, and mutual love and
   benevolence is the only possible means to establish this society in any
   tolerable and durable manner; and in this respect [135] all men stand
   upon the same level, and have the same natural wants and desires, and
   are in the same need of each other's help, and are equally capable of
   enjoying the benefit and advantage of society, it is evident every man
   is bound by the law of his nature, and as he is also prompted by the
   [136] inclination of his uncorrupted affections, to [137] look upon
   himself as a part and member of that one universal body or community
   which is made up of all mankind, to think himself [138] born to promote
   the public good and welfare of all his fellow-creatures, and
   consequently obliged, as the necessary and only effectual means to that
   end, to [139] embrace them all with universal love and benevolence, so
   that he cannot, [140] without acting contrary to the reason of his own
   mind, and transgressing the plain and known law of his being, do
   willingly any hurt and mischief to any man, no, not even to those who
   have first injured him, [141] but ought, for the public benefit, to
   endeavour to appease with gentleness rather than exasperate with
   retaliations; and finally, to comprehend all in one word, (which is the
   top and complete perfection of this great duty,) ought to [142] love
   all others as himself. This is the argumentation of that great master
   Cicero, whose knowledge and understanding of the true state of things,
   and of the original obligations of human nature, was as much greater
   than Mr. Hobbes's as his helps and advantages to attain that knowledge
   were less.

   Thirdly. Of sobriety, or men's duty towards themselves; and of the
   unlawfulness of self-murder. With respect to ourselves, the rule of
   righteousness is; that every man preserve his own being, as long as he
   is able, and take care to keep himself at all times in such temper and
   disposition both of body and mind, as may best fit and enable him to
   perform his duty in all other instances. That is; he ought to bridle
   his appetites, with temperance; to govern his passions, with
   moderation; and to apply himself to the business of his present station
   in the world, whatsoever it be, with attention and contentment. That
   every man ought to preserve his own being as long as he is able, is
   evident; because what he is not himself the author and giver of, he can
   never of himself have just power or authority to take away. He that
   sent us into the world, and alone knows for how long time he appointed
   us our station here, and when we have finished all the business he
   intended we should do, can alone judge when it is fit for us to be
   taken hence, and has alone authority to dismiss and discharge us. This
   reasoning has been admirably applied by Plato, Cicero, and others of
   the best philosophers. So that though the stoics of old, and the deists
   of late, have, in their ranting discourses, and some few of them in
   their rash practice, contradicted it, yet they have never been able,
   with any colour of reason, to answer or evade the force of the
   argument; which, indeed, to speak the truth, has been urged by the
   fore-mentioned philosophers with such singular beauty, as well as
   invincible strength, that it seems not capable of having any thing
   added to it. Wherefore I shall give it you, only in some of their own
   words. We men, (says [143] Plato, in the person of Socrates,) are all,
   by the appointment of God, in a certain prison or custody, which we
   ought not to break out of, and run away. We are as servants, or as
   cattle, in the hand of God. And would not any of us, saith he, if one
   of our servants should, contrary to our direction, and to escape out of
   our service, kill himself, think that we had just reason to be very
   angry, and if it was in our power, punish him for it? So likewise
   Cicero; God, says he, [144] the supreme governor of all things, forbids
   us to depart hence without his order: and though, when the divine
   providence does itself offer us a just occasion of leaving this world,
   (as when a man chooses to suffer death rather than commit wickedness,)
   a wise man will then indeed depart joyfully, as out of a place of
   sorrow and darkness into light; yet he will not be in such haste as to
   break his prison contrary to law; but will go when God calls him, as a
   prisoner when dismissed by the magistrate or lawful power. Again: that
   short remainder of life, saith he, [145] which old men have a prospect
   of, they ought neither too eagerly to desire, nor yet on the contrary
   unreasonably and discontentedly deprive themselves of it: for, as
   Pythagoras teaches, it is as unlawful for a man, without the command of
   God, to remove himself out of the world, as for a soldier to leave his
   post without his general's order. And in another place: unless that
   God, saith he, [146] whose temple and palace this whole world is,
   discharges you himself out of the prison of the body, you can never be
   received to his favour. Wherefore you, and all pious men, ought to have
   patience to continue in the body, as long as God shall please, who sent
   us hither; and not force yourselves out of the world, before he calls
   for you, lest you be found deserters of the station appointed you of
   God. And to mention no more,--that excellent author, Arrian: wait,
   saith he, [147] the good pleasure of God: when he signifies it to be
   his will that you should be discharged from this service, then depart
   willingly; but, in the meantime, have patience, and tarry in the place
   where he has appointed you: wait, and do not hurry yourselves away
   wilfully and unreasonably. The objections, which the author of the
   defence of self-murder, prefixed to the Oracles of Reason, has
   attempted to advance against this argument, are so very weak and
   childish that it is evident he could not, at the time he wrote them,
   believe in earnest that there was any force in them; as when he says,
   that the reason why it is not lawful for a centinel to leave his
   station without his commander's order, is because he entered into the
   service by his own consent; as if God had not a just power to lay any
   commands upon his creatures without their own consent: Or when he says,
   that there are many lawful ways to seek death in; as if, because a man
   may lawfully venture his life in many public services, therefore it was
   lawful for him directly to throw it away upon any foolish discontent.
   But the author of that discourse has since been so just as to confess
   his folly, and retract it publicly himself. Wherefore, to proceed. For
   the same reason that a man is obliged to preserve his own being at all,
   he is bound likewise to preserve himself, as far as he is able, in the
   right use of all his faculties: that is, to keep himself constantly in
   such temper, both of body and mind, by regulating his appetites and
   passions, as may best fit and enable him to perform his duty in all
   other instances, For, as it matters not whether a soldier deserts his
   post, or by drunkenness renders himself incapable of performing his
   duty in it; so for a man to disable himself, by any intemperance or
   passion, from performing the necessary duties of life, is, at least for
   that time, the same thing as depriving himself of life. And neither is
   this all. For great intemperance and ungoverned passions not only
   incapacitate a man to perform his duty, but also expose him to run
   headlong into the commission of the greatest enormities: there being no
   violence or injustice whatsoever, which a man, who has deprived himself
   of his reason by intemperance or passion, is not capable of being
   tempted to commit. So that all the additional obligations which a man
   is any way under, to forbear committing the most flagrant crimes, lie
   equally upon him to govern his passions and restrain his appetites:
   without doing which, he can never secure himself effectually from being
   betrayed into the commission of all iniquity. This is indeed the great
   difficulty of life, to subdue and conquer our unreasonable appetites
   and passions. But it is absolutely neccessary to be done: And it is
   [148] moreover the bravest and most glorious conquest in the world.
   Lastly: For the same reason that a man is obliged not to depart
   wilfully out of this life, which is the general station that God has
   appointed him, he is obliged likewise to attend the duties of that
   particular station or condition of life, whatsoever it be, wherein
   providence has at present placed him, with diligence, and contentment:
   Without being either uneasy and discontented, that others are placed by
   providence in different and superior stations in the world; or so
   extremely and unreasonably solicititous to change his state for the
   future, as thereby to neglect his present duty,

   The law of nature eternal, universal, and absolutely unchangeable. From
   these three great and general branches, all the smaller and more
   particular instances of moral obligations may (as I said) easily be
   deduced.

   5. And now this, (this eternal rule of equity, which I have been
   hitherto discribing,) is that right reason which makes the principal
   distinction between man and beasts. This is the law of nature, which
   (as Cicero excellently expresses it) is [149] of universal extent, and
   everlasting duration, which can neither be wholly abrogated, nor
   repealed in any part of it, nor have any law made contrary to it, nor
   be dispensed with by any authority; which [150] was in force before
   ever any law was writen, or the foundation of any city or commonwealth
   was laid; which [151] was not invented by the wit of man, nor
   established by the authority of any people, but its obligation was from
   eternity, and the force of it reaches throughout the universe; which,
   being founded in the nature and resaon of things, did not then begin to
   be a law, when it was first writen and enacted by men, but is of the
   same original with the eternal reasons or proportions of things, and
   the perfections or attributes of God himself, so [152] that if there
   was no law at Rome against rapes at that time when Tarquin offered
   violence to Lucretia, it does not therefore follow that he was at all
   the more excusable, or that his sin against the eternal rule of equity
   was the less heinous. This is that law of nature to which the reason of
   all men, [153] everywhere as naturally and necessarily assents, as all
   animals conspire in the pulse and motion of their heart and arteries,
   or as all men agree in their judgment concerning the whiteness of snow
   or the brightness of the sun. For though in some nice cases, the bounds
   of right and wrong may indeed (as was before observed,) be somewhat
   difficult to determine; and in some few even plainer cases, the laws
   and customs of certain barbarous nations may be contrary one to
   another, (which some have been so weak as to think a just objection
   against there being any natural difference between good and evil at
   all,) yet in reality this [154] no more disproves the natural assent of
   all men's unprejudiced reason to the rule of right and equity than the
   difference of men's countenances in general, or the deformity of some
   few monsters in particular, proves that there is no general likeness or
   uniformity in the bodies of men. For, whatever difference there may be
   in some particular laws, it is certain, as to the main and principal
   branches of morality, there never was any nation upon earth but owned
   that to love and honour God, to be grateful to benefactors, to perform
   equitable compacts, to preserve the lives of innocent and harmless men,
   and the like, were things fitter and better to be practised than the
   contrary. In fine, this is the law of nature, which, being founded in
   the eternal reason of things, is as absolutely unalterable, as natural
   good and evil, as mathematical, or arithmetical truths, [155] as light
   and darkness, as sweet and bitter, as pleasure and pain: The observance
   of which, [156] though no man should commend it, would yet be truly
   commendable in itself. Which to suppose depending on the opinions of
   men, and the customs of nations, that is to suppose that what shall be
   accounted the virtue of a man depends merely on imagination or customs
   to determine, is [157] as absurd as it would be to affirm that the
   fruitfulness of a tree, or the strength of a horse, depends merely on
   the imagination of those who judge of it. In a word, it is that law,
   which if it had its original from the authority of men, and could be
   changed by it, then [158] all the commands of the cruellest and most
   barbarous tyrants in the world would be as just and equitable as the
   wisest laws that ever were made, and [159] to murder men without
   distinction, to confound the rights of all families by the grossest
   forgeries, to rob with unrestrained violence, to break faith
   continually, and defraud and cheat without reluctance, might, by the
   decrees and ordinances of a mad assembly, be made lawful and honest: In
   which matters, if any man thinks that the votes and suffrages of fools
   have such power as to be able to change the nature of things, why do
   they not likewise decree (as Cicero admirably expresses himself) that
   poisonous things may become wholsome, and that any other thing which is
   now destructive of mankind may become preservative of it.

   6. Eternal moral obligations antecedent in some respect even to this
   consideration, of their being the will and command of God himself.
   Further yet: As this law of nature is infinitely superior to all
   authority of men, and independent upon it, so its obligation, primarily
   and originally, is antecedent also even to this consideration, [160] of
   its being the positive will or command of God himself: For, [161] as
   the addition of certain numbers necessarily produces a certain sum, and
   certain geometrical or mechanical operations give a constant and
   unalterable solution of certain problems or propositions; so in moral
   matters there are certain necessary and unalterable respects or
   relations of things which have not their original from arbitrary and
   positive constitution, but are of eternal necessity in their own
   nature. For example; [162] as, in matters of sense, the reason why a
   thing is visible is not because it is seen, but it is therefore seen
   because it is visible; so in matters of natural reason and morality,
   that which is holy and good (as creatures depending upon and worshiping
   God, and practising justice and equity in their dealings with each
   other, and the like,) is not therefore holy and good, because it is
   commanded to be done, but is therefore commanded of God, because it is
   holy and good. The existence, indeed, of the things themselves, whose
   proportions and relations we consider, depends entirely on the mere
   arbitrary will and good pleasure of God; who can create things when he
   pleases, and destroy them again whenever he thinks fit. But when things
   are created, and so long as it pleases God to continue them in being,
   their proportions, which are abstractly of eternal necessity, are also
   in the things themselves absolutely unalterable. Hence God himself,
   though he has no superior from whose will to receive any law of his
   actions, yet disdains not to observe the rule of equity and goodness,
   as [163] the law of all his actions in the government of the world, and
   condescends to appeal even to men for Ezekiel xviii. the equity and
   righteousness of his judgments. To this law, the infinite perfections
   of his divine nature make it necessary for him (as has been before
   proved,) to have constant regard, and (as a learned prelate of our own
   has excellently shown, [164] ) not barely his infinite power, but the
   rules of this eternal law are the true foundation and the measure of
   his dominion over his creatures. (For, if infinite power was the rule
   and measure of right, it is evident that goodness and mercy, and all
   other divine perfections, would be empty words without any
   signification at all.) Now, for the same reason that God, who hath no
   superior to determine him, yet constantly directs all his own actions
   by the eternal rule of justice and goodness; it is evident all
   intelligent creatures, in their several spheres and proportions, ought
   to obey the same rule according to the law of their nature, even though
   it could be supposed separate from that additional obligation of its
   being the positive will and command of God; and, doubtless there have
   been many men in all ages, in many parts of the heathen world, who, not
   having philosophy enough to collect from mere nature any tolerably just
   and explicit apprehensions concerning the attributes of God, much less
   having been able to deduce from thence any clear and certain knowledge
   of his will, have yet had a very great sense of right and truth, and
   been fully persuaded in their own minds of many unalterable obligations
   of morality: But this speculation, though necessary to be taken notice
   of in the distinct order and method of discourse, is in itself too dry,
   and of less use to us, who are abundantly assured that all moral
   obligations are, moreover, the plain and declared will of God, as shall
   be shown particularly in its proper place.

   7. The law of nature obligatory, antecedent to all consideration of
   particular rewards and punishments. Lastly, This law of nature has its
   full obligatory power, antecedent to all consideration of any
   particular private and personal reward or punishment, annexed, either
   by natural consequence or by positive appointment, to the observance or
   neglect of it. This also is very evident; because if good and evil,
   right and wrong, fitness and unfitness of being practised, be (as has
   been shown) originally, eternally, and necessarily, in the nature of
   the things themselves, it is plain that the view of particular rewards
   or punishments, which is only an after-consideration, and does not at
   all alter the nature of things, cannot be the original cause of the
   obligation of the law, but is only an additional weight to enforce the
   practice of what men were before obliged to by right reason: There is
   no man, who has any just sense of the difference between good and evil,
   but must needs acknowledge that virtue and goodness are truly amiable,
   [165] and to be chosen for their own sakes and intrinsic worth, though
   a man had no prospect of gaining any particular advantage to himself,
   by the practice of them; and that, on the contrary, cruelty, violence,
   and oppression, fraud, injustice, and all manner of wickedness, are of
   themselves hateful, and by all means to be be avoided; even though a
   man had absolute assurance that he should bring no manner of
   inconvenience upon himself by the commission of any or all of these
   crimes. [166] This likewise is excellently and admirably expressed by
   Cicero: [167] Virtue, saith he, is that which, though no profit or
   advantage whatsoever was to be expected to a man's self from the
   practice of it, yet must, without all controversy, be acknowledged to
   be truly desirable for its own sake alone. And, accordingly, [168] all
   good men love right and equity, and do many things without any prospect
   of advantage at all, merely because they are just and right and fit to
   be done: On the contrary, vice is so odious in its own nature, and so
   fit to be avoided, even though no punishment was to ensue, that no man,
   [169] who has made any tolerable proficiency in moral philosophy, can
   in the least doubt, but, if he was sure the thing could be for ever
   concealed entirely both from God and men, so that there should not be
   the least suspicion of its being ever discovered, yet he ought not to
   do any thing unjustly, covetously, wilfully, passionately,
   licentiously, or any way wickedly, Nay, [170] if a good man had it in
   his power to gain all his neighbour's wealth by the least motion of his
   finger, and was sure it would never be at all suspected either by God
   or man, unquestionably he would think he ought not to do it; and
   whoever wonders at this, has no notion what it is to be really a good
   man: [171] Not that any such thing is possible in nature, that any
   wickedness can be indeed concealed from God, but only, upon such a
   supposition, the natural and necessary difference between justice and
   injustice is made to more clearly and undeniably.

   Thus far is clear. Yet it does not from thence at all follow, either
   that a good man ought to have no respect to rewards and punishments, or
   that rewards and punishments are not absolutely necessary to maintain
   the practice of virtue in this present world. But now from hence it
   does not at all follow, either that a good man ought to have no respect
   to rewards and punishments, or that rewards and punishments are not
   absolutely necessary to maintain the practice of virtue and
   righteousness in this present world. It is certain, indeed, that virtue
   and vice are eternally and necessarily different; and that the one
   truly deserves to be chosen for its own sake, and the other ought by
   all means to be avoided, though a man was sure, for his own particular,
   neither to gain nor lose any thing by the practice of either. And if
   this was truly the state of things in the world, certainly that man
   must have a very corrupt mind, indeed, who could in the least doubt, or
   so much as once deliberate with himself, which he would choose. But the
   case does not stand thus. The question now in the general practice of
   the world, supposing all expectation of rewards and punishments set
   aside, will not be, whether a man would choose virtue for its own sake,
   and avoid vice; but the practice of vice is accompanied with great
   temptations and allurements of pleasure and profit; and the practice of
   virtue is often threatened with great calamities, losses, and sometimes
   even with death itself. And this alters the question, and destroys the
   practice of that which appears so reasonable in the whole speculation,
   and introduces a necessity of rewards and punishments. For though
   virtue is unquestionably worthy to be chosen for its own sake, even
   without any expectation of reward, yet it does not follow that it is
   therefore entirely self-sufficient, and able to support a man under all
   kinds of sufferings, and even death itself, for its sake, without any
   prospect of future recompense. Here, therefore, began the error of the
   Stoics, who taught that the bare practice of virtue was itself the
   chief good, and able of itself to make a man happy, under all the
   calamities in the world. Their defence indeed of the cause of virtue
   was very brave: they saw well that its excellency was intrinsic, and
   founded in the nature of things themselves, and could not be altered by
   any outward circumstances; that therefore virtue must needs be
   desirable for its own sake, and not merely for the advantage it might
   bring along with it; and if so, then consequently neither could any
   external disadvantage, which it might happen to be attended with,
   change the intrinsic worth of the thing itself, or ever make it cease
   to be truly desirable. Wherefore, in the case of sufferings and death,
   for the sake of virtue; not having any certain knowledge of a future
   state of reward, (though the wisest of them did indeed hope for it, and
   think it highly probable;) they were forced, that they might be
   consistent with their own principles, to suppose the practice of virtue
   a sufficient reward to itself in all cases, and a full compensation for
   all the sufferings in the world. And accordingly they very bravely
   indeed taught, that the practice of virtue was not only [172]
   infinitely to be preferred before all the sinful pleasures in the
   world; but also [173] that a man ought without scruple to choose, if
   the case was proposed to him, rather to undergo all possible sufferings
   with virtue, than to obtain all possible worldly happiness by sin. And
   the suitable practice of some few of them, as of Regulus, for instance,
   who chose to die the cruelest death that could be invented, rather than
   break his faith with an enemy, is indeed very wonderful, and to be
   admired. But yet, after all this, it is plain that the general practice
   of virtue in the world can never be supported upon this foot. The
   discourse is admirable, but it seldom goes further than mere words: And
   the practice of those few who have acted accordingly, has not been
   imitated by the rest of the world. Men never will generally, and indeed
   it is not very reasonable to be expected they should, part with all the
   comforts of life, and even life itself, without expectation of any
   future recompense. So that, if we suppose no future state of rewards,
   it will follow, that God has indued men with such faculties, as put
   them under a necessity of approving and choosing virtue in the judgment
   of their own minds; and yet has not given them wherewith to support
   themselves in the suitable and constant practice of it. The
   consideration of which inexplicable difficulty ought to have led the
   philosophers to a firm belief and expectation of a future state of
   rewards and punishments, without which their whole scheme of morality
   cannot be supported. And because a thing of such necessity and
   importance to mankind was not more clearly and directly and universally
   made known, it might naturally have led them to some farther
   consequences also, which I shall have occasion particularly to deduce
   hereafter.

   Thus have I endeavoured to deduce the original obligations of morality
   from the necessary and eternal reason and proportions of things. Some
   have chosen to found [174] all difference of good and evil, in the mere
   positive will and power of God: But the absurdity of this, I have shown
   elsewhere. Others have contended, that all difference of good and evil,
   and all obligations of morality, ought to be founded originally upon
   considerations of public utility. And true indeed it is, in the whole,
   that the good of the universal creation does always coincide with the
   necessary truth and reason of things. But otherwise, (and separate from
   this consideration, that God will certainly cause truth and right to
   terminate in happiness,) what is for the good of the whole creation, in
   very many cases, none but an infinite understanding can possibly judge.
   Public utility is one thing to one nation, and the contrary to another:
   And the governors of every nation will and must be judges of the public
   good: And by public good they will generally mean the private good of
   that particular nation. But truth and right (whether public or private)
   founded in the eternal and necessary reason of things, is what every
   man can judge of, when laid before him. It is necessarily one and the
   same, to every man's understanding, just as light is the same to every
   man's eyes.

   He who thinks it right and just, upon account of public utility, to
   break faith (suppose) with a robber, let him consider that it is much
   more useful to do the same by a multitude of robbers, by tyrants, by a
   nation of robbers: And then all faith is evidently at an end. For,
   mutato nomine de te, &c. What fidelity and truth are, is understood by
   every man; but between two nations at war, who shall be judge which of
   them are the robbers? Besides: To rob a man of truth and of eternal
   happiness, is worse than robbing him of his money and of his temporal
   happiness: And therefore it will be said that heretics may even more
   justly, and with much greater utility to the public, be deceived and
   destroyed by breach of truth and faith, than the most cruel robbers.
   Where does this terminate?

   The manifold absurdities of Mr Hobbes's doctrines concerning the
   original of right shown in particular. And now, from what has been said
   upon this head, it is easy to see the falsity and weakness of Mr
   Hobbes's doctrines, that there is no such thing as just and unjust,
   right and wrong, originally in the nature of things; that men in their
   natural state, antecedent to all compacts, are not obliged to universal
   benevolence, nor to any moral duty whatsoever; but are in a state of
   war, and have every one a right to do whatever he has power to do; and
   that, in civil societies, it depends wholly upon positive laws or the
   will of governors to define what shall be just or unjust. The contrary
   to all which having been already fully demonstrated, there is no need
   of being large, in further disproving and confuting, particularly,
   these assertions themselves. I shall therefore only mention a few
   observations, from which some of the greatest and most obvious
   absurdities of the chief principles, upon which Mr Hobbes builds his
   whole doctrine in this matter, may most easily appear.

   1. First, then, the ground and foundation of Mr Hobbes's scheme, is
   this, [175] that all men being equal by nature, and naturally desiring
   the same things, have [176] every one a right to every thing, are every
   one desirous to have absolute dominion over all others; and may every
   one justly do whatever at any time is in his power, by violently taking
   from others either their possessions or lives, to gain to himself that
   absolute dominion. Now this is exactly the same thing as if a man
   should affirm that a part is equal to the whole, or that one body can
   be present in a thousand places at once. For to say that one man has a
   full right to the same individual things, which another man at the same
   time has a full right to, is saying that two rights may be [177]
   contradictory to each other; that is, that a thing may be right, at the
   same time that it is confessed to be wrong. For instance; if every man
   has a right to preserve his own life, then [178] it is manifest I can
   have no right to take any man's life away from him, unless he has first
   forfeited his own right, by attempting to deprive me of mine. For
   otherwise, it might be right for me to do that which, at the same time,
   because it could not be done but in breach of another man's right, it
   could not be right for me to do; which is the greatest absurdity in the
   world. The true state of this case, therefore, is plainly this. In Mr
   Hobbes's state of nature and equality, every man having an equal right
   to preserve his own life, it is evident every man has a right to an
   equal proportion of all those things which are either necessary or
   useful to life. And consequently, so far is it from being true, that
   any one has an original right to possess all, that, on the contrary,
   whoever first attempts, without the consent of his fellows, and except
   it be for some public benefit, to take to himself more than his
   proportion, is the beginner of iniquity, and the author of all
   succeeding mischief.

   2. To avoid this absurdity, therefore, Mr Hobbes is forced to assert,
   in the next place, that since every man has confessedly a right to
   preserve his own life, and consequently to do every thing that is
   necessary to preserve it, and since, in the state of nature, men will
   necessarily have [179] perpetual jealousies and suspicions of each
   other's encroaching, therefore just precaution gives every one a right
   to endeavour, [180] for his own security, to prevent, oppress, and
   destroy all others, either by secret artifice or open violence, as it
   shall happen at any time to be in his power, as being the only certain
   means of self-preservation. [181] But this is even a plainer absurdity,
   if possible, than the former. For (besides that, according to Mr
   Hobbes's principles, men, before positive compacts, may justly do what
   mischief they please, even without the pretence of self-preservation,)
   what can be more ridiculous that to imagine a war of all men against
   all, the directest and certainest means of the preservation of all?
   Yes, says he, because it leads men to a necessity of entering into
   compact for each other's security. But then to make these compacts
   obligatory, he is forced (as I shall presently observe more
   particularly) to recur to an [182] antecedent law of nature, and this
   destroys all that he had before said. For the same law of nature which
   obliges men to fidelity, after having made a compact, will unavoidably,
   upon all the same accounts, be found to oblige them before all
   compacts, to contentment and mutual benevolence, as the readiest and
   certainest means to the preservation and happiness of them all. It is
   true, men, by entering into compacts, and making laws, agree to compel
   one another to do what perhaps the mere sense of duty, however really
   obligatory in the highest degree, would not, without such compacts,
   have force enough of itself to hold them to in practice; and so,
   compacts must be acknowledged to be in fact a great addition and
   strengthening of men's security. But this compulsion makes no
   alteration in the obligation itself, and only shows that that entirely
   lawless state, which Mr Hobbes calls the state of nature, is by no
   means truly natural, or in any sense suitable to the nature and
   faculties of man, but, on the contrary, is a state of extremely
   unnatural and intolerable corruption, as I shall presently prove more
   fully from some other considerations.

   3. Another notorious absurdity and inconsistency in Mr. Hobbes's
   scheme, is this: That he all along supposes some particular branches of
   the law of nature (which he thinks necessary for the foundation of some
   parts of his own doctrine,) to be originally obligatory from the bare
   reason of things; at the same time that he denies and takes away
   innumerable others, which have plainly in the nature and reason of
   things the same foundation of being obligatory as the former, and
   without which the obligation of the former can never be solidly made
   out and defended. Thus, he supposes that, in the state of nature,
   before any compact be made, every [183] man's own will is his only law;
   that [184] nothing a man can do, is unjust: and that [185] whatever
   mischief one man does to another is no injury nor injustice; neither
   has the person, to whom the mischief is done, how great soever it be,
   any just reason to complain of wrong; (I think it may here reasonably
   be presumed, that if Mr. Hobbes had lived in such a state of nature,
   and had happened to be himself the suffering party, he would in this
   case have been of another opinion:) And yet at the same time he
   supposes, that in the same state of nature men are by all means obliged
   [186] to seek peace, and [187] to enter into compacts to remedy the
   fore-mentioned mischiefs. Now if men are obliged, by the original
   reason and nature of things to seek terms of peace, and to get out of
   the pretended natural state of war, as soon as they can; how come they
   not to be obliged originally by the same reason and nature of things,
   to live from the beginning in universal benevolence, and avoid entering
   into the state of war at all? He must needs confess they would be
   obliged to do so, did not self-preservation necessitate them every man
   to war upon others: But this cannot be true of the first aggressor;
   whom yet Mr Hobbes, in the place [188] now cited, vindicates from being
   guilty of any injustice; and therefore herein he unavoidably
   contradicts himself. Thus, again; in most instances of morality, he
   supposes right and wrong, just and unjust, to have no foundation in the
   nature of things, but to depend entirely on positive laws; that [189]
   the rules or distinctions of good and evil, honest and dishonest, are
   mere civil constitutions; and whatever the chief magistrate commands,
   is to be accounted good; whatever he forbids, evil; that it is the law
   of the land only which makes robbery to be robbery; [190] or adultery
   to be adultery; that the commandments, [191] to honour our parents, to
   do no murder, not to commit adultery, and all the other laws of God and
   nature, are no further obligatory than the civil power shall think fit
   to make them so; nay, that where the supreme authority commands men to
   worship God by an image or idol, in heathen countries, [192] (for in
   this instance he cautiously excepts Christian ones,) it is lawful, and
   their duty to do it; and (agreeably, as a natural consequence to all
   this,) that it is men's positive duty to obey the commands of the civil
   power in all things, even in things [193] clearly and directly against
   their conscience; (that is, that it is their positive duty to do that
   which at the same time they know plainly it is their duty not to do;)
   [194] keeping up indeed always in their own minds an inward desire to
   observe the laws of nature and conscience, but not being bound to
   observe them in their outward actions, except when it is safe so to do;
   (He might as well have said that human laws and constitutions have
   [195] power to make light be darkness, and darkness light; to make
   sweet be bitter, and bitter sweet: And, indeed, as one absurdity will
   naturally lead a man into another, he does say something very like it;
   namely, that the [196] civil authority is to judge of all opinions and
   doctrines whatsoever; to [197] determine questions philosophical,
   mathematical; and, because indeed the signification of words is
   arbitrary, even [198] arithmetical ones also; as whether a man shall
   presume to affirm that two and three make five or not:) And yet at the
   same time, some particular things, which it would either have been too
   flagrantly scandalous for him to have made depending upon human laws;
   as that [199] God is to be loved, honoured, and adored; [200] that a
   man ought not to murder his parents; and the like: Or else, which were
   of necessity to be supposed for the foundation of his own scheme; [201]
   as that compacts ought to be faithfully performed, and [202] obedience
   to be duly paid to civil powers: The obligation of these things he is
   forced to deduce entirely from the internal reason and fitness of the
   things themselves; [203] antecedent to, independent upon, and
   unalterable by all human constitutions whatsoever: In which matter he
   is guilty of the grossest absurdity and inconsistency that can be. For
   if those greatest and strongest of all our obligations; to love and
   honour God, for instance, or, to perform compacts faithfully; depend
   not at all on any human constitution, but must of necessity (to avoid
   making obligations reciprocally depend on each other in a circle,) be
   confessed to arise originally from, and be founded in, the eternal
   reason and unalterable nature and relations of things themselves; and
   the nature and force of these obligations be sufficiently clear and
   evident; so that he who dishonours God, [204] or wilfully breaks his
   faith, [205] is (according to Mr Hobbes's own reasoning) guilty of as
   great an absurdity in practice, and of as plainly contradicting the
   right reason of his own mind, as he who in a dispute is reduced to a
   necessity of asserting something inconsistent with itself; and the
   original obligation to these duties can from hence only be distinctly
   deduced: Then, for the same reason, all the other duties likewise of
   natural religion; such as universal benevolence, justice, equity, and
   the like, (which I have before proved to receive in like manner their
   power of obliging from the eternal reason and relations of things,)
   must needs be obligatory, antecedent to any consideration of positive
   compact, and unalterably and independently on all human constitutions
   whatsoever: And consequently Mr Hobbes's whole scheme, (both of a state
   of nature at first wherein there was no such thing as right or wrong,
   just or unjust, at all; and of these things depending afterwards, by
   virtue of compact, wholly and absolutely on the positive and arbitrary
   determination of the civil power;) falls this way entirely to the
   ground, by his having been forced to suppose some particular things
   obligatory, originally, and in their own nature. On the contrary, if
   the rules of right and wrong, just and unjust, have none of them any
   obligatory force in the state of nature, antecedent to positive
   compact, then, for the same reason, neither will they be of any force
   after the compact, so as to afford men any certain and real security;
   (excepting only what may arise from the compulsion of laws, and fear of
   punishment, which, therefore, it may well be supposed, is all that Mr
   Hobbes really means at the bottom.) For if there be no obligation of
   just and right antecedent to the compact, then whence arises the
   obligation of the compact itself, on which he supposes all other
   obligations to be founded? If, before any compact was made, it was no
   injustice for a man to take away the life of his neighbour, not for his
   own preservation, but merely to satisfy an arbitrary humour [206] or
   pleasure, and without any reason or provocation at all, how comes it to
   be an injustice, after he has made a compact, to break and neglect it?
   Or what is it that makes breaking one's word, to be a greater and more
   unnatural crime, than killing a man merely for no other reason but
   because no positive compact has been made to the contrary? So that
   [207] this way also, Mr Hobbes's whole scheme is entirely destroyed.

   4. That state, which Mr Hobbes calls the state of nature, is not in any
   sense a natural state; but a state of the greatest, most unnatural, and
   most intolerable corruption that can be imagined. For reason, which is
   the proper nature of man, can never (as has been before shown) lead men
   to any thing else than universal love and benevolence; and wars,
   hatred, and violence, can never arise but from extreme corruption. A
   man may sometimes, it is true, in his own defence, be necessitated, in
   compliance with the laws of nature and reason, to make war upon his
   fellows: But the first aggressors, who, upon Mr Hobbes's principles,
   (that all men [208] have a natural will to hurt each other, and that
   every one in the state of nature has a right [209] to do whatever he
   has a will to;)--the first aggressors, I say, who, upon these
   principles, assault and violently spoil as many as they are superior to
   in strength, without any regard to equity or proportion; these can
   never, by any colour whatsoever, be excused from having utterly [210]
   divested themselves of human nature, and having introduced into the
   world, [211] contrary to all the laws of nature and reason, the
   greatest calamities, and most unnatural confusion, that mankind, by the
   highest abuse of their natural powers and faculties, are capable of
   falling under. Mr Hobbes pretends, indeed, that one of the first and
   most natural principles of human life [212] is a desire necessarily
   arising in every man's mind, of having power and dominion over others;
   and that this naturally impels men to use force and violence to obtain
   it. But neither is it true, that men, following the dictates of reason
   and uncorrupted nature, desire disproportionate power and dominion over
   others; neither, if it was natural to desire such power, would it at
   all follow that it was agreeable to nature to use violent and hurtful
   means to obtain it. For since the only natural and good reason to
   desire power and dominion, (more than what is necessary for every man's
   self-preservation) is, that the possessor of such power may have a
   larger compass, and greater abilities, and opportunities of doing good,
   (as is evident from God's exercise of perfectly absolute power,) it is
   plain that no man obeying the uncorrupted dictates of nature and reason
   can desire to increase his power by such destructive and pernicious
   methods, the prevention of which is the only good reason that makes the
   power itself truly desirable: All violence, therefore, and war, are
   plainly the effects, not of natural desires, but of unnatural and
   extreme corruption; and this Mr Hobbes himself unwarily proves against
   himself by those very arguments whereby he endeavours to prove that war
   and contention is more natural to men than to bees or ants; for his
   arguments on this head are all drawn from men's using themselves (as
   the animals he is speaking of cannot do,) to strive about honours and
   dignities, till the contention grows up into hatred, seditions, and
   wars; [213] to separate each one his private interest from the public,
   [214] and value himself highly above others, upon getting and
   engrossing to himself more than his proportion of the things of life,
   to find fault with each other's management, [215] and, through
   self-conceit, being in continual innovation and distractions, to impose
   one upon another by lies, [216] falsifying, and deceit, calling good
   evil, and evil good, to grow envious at the prosperity of others, [217]
   or proud and domineering when themselves are in ease and plenty, and to
   keep up tolerable peace and agreement among themselves, [218] merely by
   artificial compacts and the compulsion of laws; all which things are so
   far from being truly the natural effects and result of men's reason and
   other faculties, that, on the contrary, they are evidently some of the
   grossest abuses and most unnatural corruptions thereof, that any one
   who was arguing on the opposite side of the question could easily have
   chosen to have instanced in.

   5. Lastly; The chief and principal argument, which is one of the main
   foundations of Mr Hobbes's and his followers' system, namely, that
   God's irresistible power is the only foundation of his dominion, [219]
   and the only measure of his right over his creatures; and,
   consequently, that every other being has just so much right as it has
   natural power, that is, that it is naturally right for every thing to
   do whatever it has power to do: [220] This argument, I say, is of all
   his others the most notoriously false and absurd; as may sufficiently
   appear, (besides what has been already said of God's other perfections
   being as much the measure of his right as his power is, [221] ) from
   this single consideration, suppose the devil, (for when men run into
   extreme impious assertions, they must be answered with suitable
   suppositions,) suppose, I say, such a being as we conceive the devil to
   be, of extreme malice, cruelty, and iniquity, was indued with supreme
   absolute power, and made use of it only to render the world as
   miserable as was possible, in the most cruel, arbitrary, and unequal
   manner that can be imagined; would it not follow undeniably, upon Mr
   Hobbes's scheme, since dominion is founded on power, and power is the
   measure of right, and consequently absolute power gives absolute right,
   that such a government as this would not only be as much of necessity
   indeed to be submitted to, but also that it would be as just and right,
   and with as little reason to be complained of, [222] as is the present
   government of the world in the hands of the ever-blessed and infinitely
   good God, whose love and goodness and tender mercy appear everywhere
   over all his works?

   Here Mr Hobbes, as an unanswerable argument in defence of his
   assertion, urges, [223] that the only reason why men are bound to obey
   God is plainly nothing but weakness or want of power; because, if they
   themselves were all-powerful, it is manifest they could not be under
   any obligation to obey; and, consequently, power would give them an
   undoubted right to do what they pleased. That is to say; if men were
   not created and dependent beings, it is true they could not indeed be
   obliged to the proper relative duty of created and dependent beings,
   viz. to obey the will and command of another in things positive. But
   from their obligation to the practice of moral virtues, of justice,
   righteousness, equity, holiness, purity, goodness, beneficence,
   faithfulness, and truth, from which Mr Hobbes fallaciously, in this
   argument, and most impiously in his whole scheme, [224] endeavours to
   discharge them; from this they could not be discharged by any addition
   of power whatsoever; because the obligation to these things is not, as
   the obligation to obey in things of arbitrary and positive
   constitution, founded only in the weakness, subjection, and dependency
   of the persons obliged; but also, and chiefly, in the eternal and
   unchangeable nature and reason of the things themselves: For these
   things are the law of God himself, not only to his creatures, but also
   to himself, as being the rule of all his own actions in the government
   of the world.

   I have been the longer upon this head, because moral virtue is the
   foundation and the sum, the essence and the life, of all true religion;
   for the security whereof all positive institution was principally
   designed; for the restoration whereof all revealed religion was
   ultimately intended; and inconsistent wherewith, or in opposition to
   which, all doctrines whatsoever, supported by what pretence of reason
   or authority soever, are as certainly and necessarily false, as God is
   true.

Proposition II.

   II. Proposition II. Though these eternal moral obligations are indeed
   of themselves incumbent on all rational beings, even antecedent to the
   consideration of their being the positive will and command of God, yet
   that which most strongly confirms, and in practice most effectually and
   indispensably enforces them upon us, is this; that both from the
   perfections of God, and the nature of things, and from several other
   collateral considerations, it appears, that as God is himself
   necessarily just and good in the exercise of his infinite power in the
   government of the whole world, so he cannot but likewise positively
   require that all his rational creatures should in their proportion be
   so too, in the exercise of each of their powers in their several and
   respective spheres: That is; as these eternal moral obligations are
   really in perpetual force, merely from their own nature, and the
   abstract reason of things; so also they are moreover the express and
   unalterable will, command, and law of God to his creatures, which he
   cannot but expect should, in obedience to his supreme authority, as
   well as in compliance with the natural reason of things, be regularly
   and constantly observed through the whole creation.

   This proposition is very evident, and has little need of being
   particularly proved.

   For 1st. That moral duties are the positive will and command of God,
   proved from the consideration of the divine attributes. The same
   reasons which prove to us that God must of necessity be himself
   infinitely holy, and just, and good, manifestly prove, that it must
   also be his will, that all his creatures should be so likewise,
   according to the proportions and capacities of their several natures.
   That there are eternal and necessary differences of things, agreements
   and disagreements, proportions and disproportions, fitnesses and
   unfitnesses of things, absolutely in their own nature, has been before
   largely demonstrated. That, with regard to these fixed and certain
   proportions and fitnesses of things, the will of God, which can neither
   be influenced by any external power, nor imposed upon by any error or
   deceit, constantly and necessarily determines itself to choose always
   what in the whole is best and fittest to be done, according to the
   unalterable rules of justice, equity, goodness, and truth; has likewise
   been already proved. That the same considerations ought also regularly
   to determine the wills of all subordinate rational beings, to act in
   constant conformity to the same eternal rules, has in like manner been
   shown before. It remains therefore only to prove, that these very same
   moral rules, which are thus of themselves really obligatory, as being
   the necessary result of the unalterable reason and nature of things,
   are moreover the positive will and command of God to all rational
   creatures; and, consequently, that the wilful transgression or neglect
   of them, is as truly an insolent contempt of the authority of God, as
   it is an absurd confounding of the natural reasons and proportions of
   things. Now this also plainly follows from what has been already laid
   down: For, the same absolute perfection of the divine nature, which (as
   has been before shown) makes us certain that God must himself be of
   necessity infinitely holy, just, and good; makes it equally certain,
   that he cannot possibly approve iniquity in others. And the same
   beauty, the same excellency, the same weight and importance of the
   rules of everlasting righteousness, with regard to which God is always
   pleased to make those rules the measure of all his own actions, prove
   it impossible but he must likewise will and desire that all rational
   creatures should proportionably make them the measure of theirs. Even
   among men, there is no earthly father, but in those things which he
   esteems his own excellencies, desires and expects to be imitated by his
   children. How much more is it necessary that God, who is infinitely far
   from being subject to such passions and variableness as frail men are;
   and who has an infinitely tenderer and heartier concern for the
   happiness of his creatures, than mortal men can have for the welfare of
   their posterity; must desire to be imitated by his creatures in those
   perfections which are the foundation of his own unchangeable happiness?
   In the exercise of his supreme power, we cannot imitate him; in the
   extent of his unerring knowledge, we cannot attain to any similitude
   with himJob xl. 9. . We cannot at all thunder with a voice like him;
   nor are we able to search out and comprehend the least part of the
   depth of his unfathomable wisdom. But his holiness and goodness, his
   justice, righteousness, and truth; these things we can understand; in
   these things we can imitate him; nay, we cannot approve ourselves to
   him as obedient children, if we do not imitate him therein. If God be
   himself essentially of infinite holiness and purity; (as, from the
   light of nature, it is of all things most manifest that he is,) Hab. i.
   13. it follows, that it is impossible but he must likewise be of purer
   eyes than to behold with approbation any manner of impurity in his
   creatures; and consequently it must needs be his will, that they should
   all (according to the measure of their frail and finite nature) be holy
   as he is holy. If God is himself a being of infinite justice,
   righteousness, and truth, it must needs be his will, that all rational
   creatures, whom he has created after his own image, to whom he has
   communicated some resemblance of his divine perfections, and whom he
   has indued with excellent powers and faculties to enable them to
   distinguish between good and evil, should imitate him in the exercise
   of those glorious attributes, by conforming all their actions to the
   eternal and unalterable law of righteousness. If God is himself a being
   of infinite Mat. v. 45. goodness, making the sun to rise on the evil
   and on the good, and sending rain on the just and on the unjust; Acts
   xiv. 17. having never left himself wholly without witness, but always
   doing good, given men rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, and
   filling their hearts with food and gladness; it cannot but be his will
   that all reasonable creatures should, by mutual love and benevolence,
   permit and assist each other to enjoy in particular the several effects
   and blessings of the divine universal goodness. Lastly, if God is
   himself a being of infinite mercy and compassion, as it is plain he
   bears long with men before he punishes them for their wickedness, and
   often freely forgives them his ten thousand talents; it must needs be
   hisMat. xviii. 24. 28. will, that they should forgive one another their
   hundred pence; being merciful one to another, as he isLu. vi. 36.
   merciful to them all; and having compassion eachMat. xi. 23. on his
   fellow-servants, as God has pity on them. Thus from the attributes of
   God, natural reason leads men to the knowledge of his will: All the
   same reasons and arguments, which discover to men the natural fitnesses
   or unfitnesses of things, and the necessary perfections or attributes
   of God, proving equally at the same time, that [225] that which is
   truly the law of nature, or the reason of things, is in like manner the
   will of God. And from hence the soberest and most intelligent persons
   among the heathens in all ages, very rightly and wisely concluded that
   the best and certainest part of natural religion, which was of the
   greatest importance, and wherein was the least danger of their being
   mistaken, was [226] to imitate the moral attributes of God, by a life
   of holiness, righteousness, and charity: Whereas in the external part
   of their worship, there was nothing but uncertainty and doubtfulness;
   it being absolutely impossible, without express revelation, to discover
   what in that particular they might be secure would be truly acceptable
   to God.

   This method of deducing the will of God from his attributes, is of all
   others the best and clearest, the certainest and most universal, that
   the light of nature affords: Yet there are also (as I said) some other
   collateral considerations, which help to prove and confirm the same
   thing; namely, that all moral obligations, arising from the nature and
   reason of things, are likewise the positive will and command of God: As

   2. And from the consideration of the nature of God's creation. This
   appears in some measure from the consideration of God's creation. For
   God, by creating things, manifests it to be his will that things should
   be what they are. And as providence wonderfully preserves things in
   their present state; and all necessary agents, by constantly and
   regularly obeying the laws of their nature, necessarily employ all
   their natural powers in promoting the same end; so it is evident it
   cannot but be the will of God, [227] that all rational creatures, whom
   he has indued with those singular powers and faculties of
   understanding, liberty, and free-choice, whereby they are exalted in
   dignity above the rest of the world; should likewise employ those their
   extraordinary faculties in preserving the order and harmony of the
   creation, and not in introducing disorder and confusion therein. The
   nature indeed and relations, the proportions and disproportions, the
   fitnesses and unfitnesses of things, are eternal and in themselves
   absolutely unalterable; but this is only upon supposition that the
   things exist, and that they exist in such manner as they at present do.
   Now that things exist in such manner as they do, or that they exist at
   all, depends entirely on the arbitrary will and good pleasure of God.
   At the same time, therefore, and by the same means, that God manifests
   it to be his will that things should exist, and that they should exist
   in such manner as they do; (as by creating them he at first did, and by
   preserving them he still continually does, declare it to be his will
   they should;) he at the same time evidently declares, that all such
   moral obligations as are the result of the necessary proportions and
   relations of things, are likewise his positive will and command. And
   consequently, whoever acts contrary to the forementioned reasons and
   proportion of things, by dishonouring God, by introducing unjust and
   unequal dealings among equals, by destroying his own being, or by any
   way corrupting, abusing, and misapplying the faculties wherewith God
   has indued him, (as has been above more largely explained,) is
   unavoidably guilty of transgressing at the same time the positive will
   and command of God, which in this manner also is sufficiently
   discovered and made known to him.

   3. And from the tendency of the practice of morality to the good and
   happiness of the whole world.The same thing may likewise further appear
   from the following consideration:--Whatever tends directly and
   certainly to promote the good and happiness of the whole, and (as far
   as is consistent with that chief end,) to promote also the good and
   welfare of every particular part of the creation, must needs be
   agreeable to the will of God; [228] who, being infinitely
   self-sufficient to his own happiness, could have no other motive to
   create things at all, but only that he might communicate to them his
   goodness and happiness; and who consequently cannot but expect and
   require, that all his creatures should, according to their several
   powers and faculties, endeavour to promote the same end. Now that the
   exact observance of all those moral obligations, which have before been
   proved to arise necessarily from the nature and relations of things;
   (that is to say, living agreeably to the unalterable rules of justice,
   righteousness, equity, and truth,) is the certainest and directest
   means to promote the welfare and happiness, as well of every man in
   particular, both in body and mind, as of all men in general, considered
   with respect to society, is so very manifest, that even the greatest
   enemies of all religion, who suppose it to be nothing more than a
   worldly or state-policy, do yet by that very supposition confess thus
   much concerning it; and, indeed, this it is not possible for any one to
   deny: For the practice of moral virtues does [229] as plainly and
   undeniably tend to the natural good of the world, as any physical
   effect or mathematical truth is naturally consequent to the principles
   on which it depends, and from which it is regularly derived. And
   without such practice, in some degree, the world can never be happy in
   any tolerable measure; as is sufficiently evident from Mr Hobbes's own
   description of the extreme miserable condition that men would be in
   through the total defect of the practice of all moral virtue, if they
   were to live in that state which he styles (falsely and contrary to all
   reason, as has been before fully proved,) the state of nature; but
   which really is a state of the grossest abuse and most unnatural
   corruption and misapplication of men's natural faculties that can be
   imagined. For, since God has plainly so constituted the nature of men,
   that they stand continually in need of each other's help and
   assistance, and can never live comfortably without society and mutual
   friendship, and are indued with the faculties of reason and speech, and
   with other natural powers, evidently fitted to enable them to assist
   each other in all matters of life, and mutually to promote universal
   love and happiness; it is manifestly agreeable to nature, and to the
   will of God, who gave them these faculties, that they should employ
   them wholly to this regular and good end; and, consequently, it is on
   the contrary evident likewise, that all abuse and misapplication of
   these faculties, to hurt and destroy, to cheat and defraud, to oppress,
   insult, and domineer over each other, is directly contrary both to the
   dictates of nature and to the will of God, who, necessarily doing
   always what is best, and fittest, and most for the benefit of the whole
   creation, it is manifest cannot will the corruption and destruction of
   any of his creatures, any otherwise than as his preserving their
   natural faculties, (which in themselves are good and excellent, but
   cannot but be capable of being abused and misapplied,) necessarily
   implies a consequential permission of such corruption.

   And this now is the great aggravation of the sin and folly of all
   immorality; that it is an obstinate setting up the self-will of frail,
   finite, and fallible creatures; as in opposition to the eternal reason
   of things, the unprejudiced judgment of their own minds, and the
   general good and welfare both of themselves and their fellow-creatures;
   so also in opposition to the will of the supreme author and creator of
   all things, who gave them their beings and all the powers and faculties
   they are indued with: In opposition to the will of the all-wise
   preserver and governor of the universe, on whose gracious protection
   they depend every moment for the preservation and continuance of their
   beings: And in opposition to the will of their greatest benefactor, to
   whose bounty they wholly owe whatever they enjoy at present, and all
   the hopes of what they expect hereafter, this is the highest of all
   aggravations. The utmost ureasonableness, joined with obstinate
   disobedience, and with the greatest ingratitude.

Proposition III.

   III. Proposition III. Though the fore-mentioned eternal moral
   obligations are incumbent indeed on all rational creatures, antecedent
   to any respect of particular reward or punishment, yet they must
   certainly and necessarily be attended with rewards and punishments:
   Because the same reasons, which prove God himself to be necessarily
   just and good, and the rules of justice, equity, and goodness, to be
   his unalterable will, law, and command, to all created beings; prove
   also that he cannot but be pleased with and approve such creatures as
   imitate and obey him by observing those rules, and be displeased with
   such as act contrary thereto; and consequently, that he cannot but some
   way or other, make a suitable difference in his dealings with them; and
   manifest his supreme power and absolute authority, in finally
   supporting, maintaining, and vindicating effectually the honour of
   these his divine laws, as becomes the just and righteous governor and
   disposer of all things.

   This proposition also is in a manner self-evident.

   For 1st, That the practice of virtue or vice must be attended with
   rewards and punishments, proved from the attributes of God. If God is
   himself necessarily a being (as has been before shown) of infinite
   goodness, justice, and holiness; and if the same reasons which prove
   the necessity of these attributes in God himself, prove moreover (as
   has likewise been shown already,) that the same moral obligations must
   needs be his positive will, law, and command, to all rational
   creatures; it follows also necessarily, by the very same argument, that
   he cannot but be pleased with and approve such creatures as imitate and
   obey him by observing those rules, and be displeased with such as act
   contrary thereto. And if so; then in the nature of the thing itself it
   is evident, that having absolute power and uncontrollable authority, as
   being supreme governor and disposer of all things, he cannot but
   signify, by some means or other, his approbation of the one, and his
   displeasure against the other. And this can no way be done to any
   effectual purpose but by the annexing of respective rewards and
   punishments. Wherefore, if virtue goes finally unrewarded, and
   wickedness unpunished, then God never signifies his approbation of the
   one, nor his displeasure against the other; and if so, then there
   remains no sufficient proof that he is really at all pleased or
   displeased with either, and the consequence of that will be, that there
   is no reason to think the one to be his will and command, or that the
   other is forbidden by him; which being once supposed, there will no
   longer remain any certain evidence of his own moral attributes contrary
   to what has been already demonstrated.

   2. And from the necessity there is, that there should be some
   vindication of the honour of God's laws and government. The certainty
   of rewards and punishments in general may also somewhat otherwise be
   deduced from their being necessary to support the honour of God and of
   his laws and government, in the following manner. It is evident we are
   obliged, in the highest ties of duty and gratitude, to pay all possible
   honour to God, from whom we receive our being, and all our powers and
   faculties, and whatever else we enjoy. Now it is plain likewise, that
   we have no other way to honour God, (whose happiness is capable of no
   addition from any thing that any of his creatures are capable of
   doing,) than by honouring, that is, by obeying, his laws. The honour
   therefore that is thus done to his laws, God is pleased to accept as
   done immediately to himself. And though we were indeed absolutely
   obliged, in duty, to honour him in this manner, notwithstanding that
   there had been no reward to be expected thereupon, yet it is necessary,
   in the government of the world, and well-becoming an infinitely wise
   and good governor, that those who honour him he should honour; 1 Sam.
   ii. 30. that is, should distinguish them with suitable marks of his
   favour. On the contrary; though nothing that weak and finite creatures
   are able to do, can in the least diminish from the absolute glory and
   happiness of God, yet, as to us, the dishonouring, that is, the
   disobeying his laws, is a dishonouring of himself: that is, it is, as
   much as in us lies, a despising his supreme authority, and bringing his
   government into contempt:--Now the same reason that there is, why
   honour should be paid to the laws of God at all; the same reason there
   is, that that honour should be vindicated, after it has been diminished
   and infringed by sin: For no lawgiver who has authority to require
   obedience to his laws, can or ought to see his laws despised and
   dishonoured, without taking some measures to vindicate the honour of
   them, for the support and dignity of his own authority and government.
   And the only way, by which the honour of a law, or of its author, can
   be vindicated after it has been infringed by wilful sin, is either by
   the repentance and reformation of the transgressor, or by his
   punishment and destruction. So that God is necessarily obliged, in
   vindication of the honour of his laws and government, to punish those
   who presumptuously and impenitently disobey his commandments. Wherefore
   if there be no distinction made by suitable rewards and punishments,
   between those who obey the laws of God and those who obey them not,
   then God suffers the authority of his laws to be finally trampled upon
   and despised, without ever making any vindication of it: Which being
   impossible, it will follow that these things are not really the laws of
   God, and that he has no such regard to them as we imagine. And the
   consequence of this must needs be the denial of his moral attributes,
   contrary, as before, to what has been already proved: And consequently
   the certainty of rewards and punishments, in general, is necessarily
   established.

Proposition IV.

   IV. Proposition IV. Though in order to establish this suitable
   difference between the fruits or effects of virtue and vice, so
   reasonable in itself, and so absolutely necessary for the vindication
   of the honour of God, the nature of things, and the constitution and
   order of God's creation, was originally such, that the observance of
   the eternal rules of justice, equity, and goodness, does indeed of
   itself tend by direct and natural consequence to make all creatures
   happy, and the contrary practice to make them miserable; yet since,
   through some great and general corruption and depravation,
   (whencesoever that may have arisen,) the condition of men in this
   present state is such, that the natural order of things in this world
   is an event manifestly perverted, and virtue and goodness are visibly
   prevented in great measure from obtaining their proper and due effects
   in establishing men's happiness, proportionable to their behaviour and
   practice; therefore, it is absolutely impossible that the whole view
   and intention, the original and the final design, of God's creating
   such rational beings as men are, and placing them on this globe of
   earth, as the chief and principal, or indeed (to speak more properly)
   the only inhabitants, for whose sake alone this part at least of the
   creation is manifestly fitted up and accommodated; it is absolutely
   impossible (I say) that the whole of God's design in all this should be
   nothing more than to keep up eternally a succession of such short-lived
   generations of men as we at present are, and those in such a corrupt,
   confused, and disorderly state of things, as we see the world is now
   in; without any due observation of the eternal rules of good and evil;
   without any clear and remarkable effect of the great and most necessary
   difference of things; and without any final vindication of the honour
   and laws of God, in the proportionable reward of the best, or
   punishment of the worst of men. And, consequently, it is certain and
   necessary (even as certain as the moral attributes of God before
   demonstrated,) that instead of continuing an eternal succession of new
   generations in the present form and state of things, there must at some
   time or other be such a revolution and renovation of things, such a
   future state of existence of the same persons, as that, by an exact
   distribution of rewards and punishments therein, all the present
   disorders and inequalities may be set right, and that the whole scheme
   of providence, which, to us who judge of it by only one small portion
   of it, seems now so inexplicable and confused, may appear, at its
   consummation, to be a design worthy of infinite wisdom, justice, and
   goodness.

   1. That, according to the original constitution of things, virtue and
   vice are attended with natural rewards and punishments. In order to
   establish a just and suitable difference between the respective fruits
   or effects of virtue and vice, the nature of things, and the
   constitution and order of God's creation, was originally such that the
   observance of the eternal rules of piety, justice, equity, goodness,
   and temperance, does of itself plainly tend, by direct and natural
   consequence, to make all creatures happy, and the contrary practice to
   make them miserable. This is evident in general; because the practice
   of universal virtue is (in imitation of the divine goodness) the
   practice of that which is best in the whole; and that which tends to
   the benefit of the whole, must, of necessary consequence, originally,
   and in its own nature, tend also to the benefit of every individual
   part of the creation. More particularly; a frequent and habitual
   contemplating the infinitely excellent perfections of the almighty
   creator and all-wise governor of the world, and our most bountiful
   benefactor; so as to excite in our minds a suitable adoration, love,
   and imitation of those perfections; a regular employing all our powers
   and faculties, in such designs and to such purposes only, as they were
   originally fitted and intended for by nature; and a due subjecting all
   our appetites and passions to the government of sober and modest
   reason; are evidently the directest means to obtain such settled peace
   and solid satisfaction of mind, as the first foundation, and the
   principal and most necessary ingredient of all true happiness. The
   temperate and moderate enjoyment of all the good things of this present
   world, and of the pleasures of life, according to the measures of right
   reason and simple nature, is plainly and confessedly the certainest and
   most direct method to preserve the health and strength of the body. And
   the practice of universal justice, equity, and benevolence, is
   manifestly (as has been before observed) as direct and adequate a means
   to promote the general welfare and happiness of men in society, as any
   physical motion, or geometrical operation, is to produce its natural
   effect. So that if all men were truly virtuous, and practised these
   rules in such manner that the miseries and calamities arising usually
   from the numberless follies and vices of men were prevented,
   undoubtedly this great truth would evidence itself visibly in fact, and
   appear experimentally in the happy state and condition of the world. On
   the contrary; neglect of God, and insensibleness of our relation and
   duty towards him; abuse and unnatural misapplication of the powers and
   faculties of our minds; inordinate appetites, and unbridled and furious
   passions,--necessarily fill the mind with confusion, trouble, and
   vexation. And intemperance naturally brings weakness, pains, and
   sicknesses into the body. And mutual injustice and iniquity; fraud,
   violence, and oppression; wars, and desolation; murders, rapine, and
   all kinds of cruelty,--are sufficiently plain causes of the miseries
   and calamities of men in society. So that the original constitution,
   order, and tendency of things, is evidently enough fitted and designed
   to establish naturally a just and suitable difference in general
   between virtue and vice, by their respective fruits or effects.

   2. But that now in this present world, the natural order of things is
   so perverted that vice often flourishes in great prosperity, and virtue
   falls under the greatest calamities of life. But though originally the
   constitution and order of God's creation was indeed such, that virtue
   and vice are, by the regular tendency of things, followed with natural
   rewards and punishments; yet, in event, through some great and general
   corruption and depravation, (whencesoever that may have arisen, of
   which more hereafter;) the condition of men in the present state is
   plainly such, that this natural order of things in the world is
   manifestly perverted. Virtue and goodness are visibly prevented in
   great measure from obtaining their proper and due effect, in
   establishing men's happiness proportionable to their behaviour and
   practice; and wickedness and vice very frequently escape the punishment
   which the general nature and disposition of things tends to annex unto
   it. Wicked men, by stupidity, inconsiderateness, and sensual pleasure,
   often make shift to silence the reproaches of conscience, and feel very
   little of that confusion and remorse of mind which ought naturally to
   be consequent upon their vicious practices. By accidental strength and
   robustness of constitution, they frequently escape the natural ill
   consequences of intemperance and debauchery; and enjoy the same
   proportion of health and vigour as those who live up to the rules of
   strict and unblameable sobriety. And injustice and iniquity, fraud,
   violence, and cruelty, though they are always attended indeed with
   sufficiently calamitous consequences in the general; yet the most of
   those ill consequences fall not always upon such persons in particular
   as have the greatest share in the guilt of the crimes, but very
   commonly on those that have the least. On the contrary; virtue and
   piety, temperance and sobriety, faithfulness, honesty and charity;
   though they have indeed both in themselves the true springs of
   happiness, and also the greatest probabilities of outward causes to
   concur in promoting their temporal prosperity; though they cannot
   indeed be prevented from affording a man the highest peace and
   satisfaction of spirit, and many other advantages both of body and mind
   in respect of his own particular person; yet in respect of those
   advantages which the mutual practice of social virtues ought to produce
   in common, it is in experience found true, that the vices of a great
   part of mankind do so far prevail against nature and reason, as
   frequently to oppress the virtue of the best; and not only hinder them
   from enjoying those public benefits, which would naturally and
   regularly be the consequences of their virtue; but oft-times bring upon
   them the greatest temporal calamities, even for the sake of that very
   virtue. For it is but too well known that good men are very often
   afflicted and impoverished, and made a prey to the covetousness and
   ambition of the wicked; and sometimes most cruelly and maliciously
   persecuted, even upon account of their goodness itself. In all which
   affairs the providence of God seems not very evidently to interpose for
   the protection of the righteous. And not only so, but even in judgments
   also, which seem more immediately to be inflicted by the hand of
   heaven, it frequently suffers the righteous to be involved in the same
   calamities with the wicked, as they are mixed together in business and
   the affairs of the world.

   3. That therefore there must needs be a future state of rewards and
   punishments.Which things being so; (viz. that there is plainly in event
   no sufficient distinction made between virtue and vice; no
   proportionable and certain reward annexed to the one, nor punshment to
   the other, in this present world:) And yet it being no less undeniably
   certain in the general, as has been before shown, that if there be a
   God, (and that God be himself a being of infinite justice and goodness;
   and it be his will, that all rational creatures should imitate his
   moral perfections; and he [230] cannot but see and take notice how
   every creature behaves itself; and cannot but be accordingly pleased
   with such as obey his will and imitate his nature, and be displeased
   with such as act contrary thereto;) it being certain, I say, that if
   these things be so, God must needs, in vindication of the honour of his
   laws and government, signify at some time or other this his approbation
   or displeasure, by making finally a suitable difference between those
   who obey him, and those who obey him not; it follows unavoidably,
   either that all these notions which we frame concerning God, are false;
   and that there is no providence, and God sees not, or at least has no
   regard to what is done by his creatures, and consequently the ground of
   all his own moral attributes is taken away, and even his being itself;
   or else that there must necessarily be a future state of rewards and
   punishments after this life, wherein all the present difficulties of
   providence shall be cleared up, by an exact and impartial
   administration of justice. But now, that these notions are true, that
   there is a God, and a providence, and that God is himself a being
   induced with all moral perfections, and expects and commands that all
   his rational creatures should govern all their actions by the same
   rules, has been particularly and distinctly proved already. It is
   therefore directly demonstrated, that there must be a future state of
   rewards and punishments. Let not thine heart envy sinners, but be thou
   in the fear of the Lord all the day long, for surely there is a reward,
   and thine expectation shall not be cut off.--Prov.xxiii. 17 and 18.

   4. Of the Stoical opinion concerning the self-sufficiency of virtue to
   its own happiness. This argument is indeed a common one, but it is
   nevertheless strongly conclusive and unanswerable; so that, whoever
   denies a future state of rewards and punishments, must, of necessity,
   by a chain of unavoidable consequences, be forced to recur to
   down-right atheism. The only middle opinion that can be invented, is
   that assertion of the Stoics that virtue is self-sufficient to its own
   happiness, and a full reward to itself in all cases, even under the
   greatest sufferings that can befal a man for its sake. Men who were not
   certain of a future state, (though most of them did indeed believe it
   highly probable,) and yet would not give up the cause of virtue, had no
   other way left to defend it than by asserting that it was in all cases,
   and under all circumstances, absolutely self-sufficient to its own
   happiness; whereas, on the contrary, because it is manifestly not
   self-sufficient, and yet undoubtedly the cause of virtue is not to be
   given up; therefore, they ought from thence to have concluded the
   certainty of a future state: That virtue is truly worthy to be chosen,
   even merely for its own sake, without any respect to any recompense or
   reward, must indeed necessarily be acknowledged; but it does not from
   hence follow, that he who dies for the sake of virtue is really any
   more happy than he that dies for any fond opinion, or any unreasonable
   humour or obstinacy whatsoever; if he has no other happiness than the
   bare satisfaction arising from the sense of his resoluteness in
   persisting to preserve his virtue, and in adhering immoveably to what
   he judges to be right, and there be no future state wherein he may reap
   any benefit of that his resolute perseverance. On the contrary, it will
   only follow, that God has made virtue necessarily amiable, and such as
   men's judgment and conscience can never but choose, and yet that he has
   not annexed to it any sufficient encouragement to support men
   effectually in that choice. Brave indeed, and admirable, were the
   things which some of the philosophers have said upon this subject, and
   which some very few extraordinary men (of which Regulus is a remarkable
   instance,) seem to have made good in their practice, even beyond the
   common abilities of human nature; but it is very plain, as I before
   intimated, that the general practice of virtue in the world can never
   be supported upon this foot; it being, indeed, neither possible nor
   truly reasonable that men, by adhering to virtue, should part with
   their lives, [231] if thereby they eternally deprived themselves of all
   possibility of receiving any advantage from that adherence. Virtue, it
   is true, in its proper seat, and with all its full effects and
   consequences unhindered, must be confessed to be the chief good, as
   being truly the enjoyment, as well as the imitation of God; but, [232]
   as the practice of it is circumstantiated in this present world, and in
   the present state of things, it is plain it is not itself the chief
   good, but only the means to it, as running in a race is not in itself
   the prize, but the way to obtain it.

   5. From whence the certainty of a future state is again concluded. It
   is therefore absolutely impossible, that the whole view and intention,
   the original and the final design of God's creating such rational
   beings as men are, indued with such noble faculties, and so necessarily
   conscious of the eternal and unchangeable differences of good and evil;
   it is absolutely impossible (I say) that the whole design of an
   infinitely wise, and just, and good God, in all this, should be nothing
   more than to keep up eternally a succession of new generations of men,
   and those in such a corrupt, confused, and disorderly state of things
   as we see the present world is in, without any due and regular
   observation of the eternal rules of good and evil, without any clear
   and remarkable effect of the great and most necessary differences of
   things, without any sufficient discrimination of virtue and vice, by
   their proper and respective fruits, and without any final vindication
   of the honour and laws of God, in the proportionable reward of the
   best, or punishment of the worst of men: And consequently it is certain
   and necessary, (even as certain as the moral attributes of God before
   demonstrated,) that instead of continuing an eternal succession of new
   generations in the present form and state of things, there must at some
   time or other be such a revolution and renovation of things, such a
   future state of existence of the same persons, as that, by an exact
   distribution of rewards and punishments therein, all the present
   disorders and inequalities may be set right; and that the whole scheme
   of Providence, which to us who judge of it by only one small portion of
   it, seems now so inexplicable and much confused, may appear at its
   consummation to be a design worthy of infinite wisdom, justice, and
   goodness. Without this [233] all comes to nothing. If this scheme be
   once broken, there is no justice, no goodness, no order, no reason, nor
   any thing upon which any argument in moral matters can be founded, left
   in the world. Nay, even though we should set aside all consideration of
   the moral attributes of God, and consider only his natural perfections,
   his infinite knowledge and wisdom, as framer and builder of the world;
   it would even in that view only appear infinitely improbable that God
   should have created such beings as men are, and indued them with such
   excellent faculties, and placed them on this globe of earth, as the
   only inhabitants for whose sake this part at least of the creation is
   manifestly fitted up and accommodated; and all this without any further
   design [234] than only for the maintaining a perpetual succession of
   such short-lived generations of mortals as we at present are; to live
   in the utmost confusion and disorder for a very few years, and then
   perish eternally into nothing. [235] What can be imagined more vain and
   empty? What more absurd? What more void of all marks of wisdom, than
   the fabric of the world, and the creation of mankind, upon this
   supposition? But then, take in also the consideration of the moral
   attributes of God, and it amounts (as I have said) to a complete
   demonstration that there must be a future state.

   6. Why the wisdom of God is not so clearly and plainly seen in his
   government of the moral, as in the fabric of the natural world. It may
   here at first sight seem to be a very strange thing, that through the
   whole system of nature in the material, in the inanimate, in the
   irrational part of the creation, every single thing should have in
   itself so many and so obvious, so evident and undeniable marks of the
   infinitely accurate skill and wisdom of their Almighty Creator, that,
   from the brightest star in the firmament of heaven to the meanest
   pebble upon the face of the earth, there is no one piece of matter
   which does not afford such instances of admirable artifice and exact
   proportion and contrivance, as exceeds all the wit of man (I do not say
   to imitate, but even) ever to be able fully to search out and
   comprehend; and yet, that in the management of the rational and moral
   world, for the sake of which all the rest was created, and is preserved
   only to be subservient to it, there should not in many ages be plain
   evidences enough, either of the wisdom, or of the justice and goodness
   of God, or of so much as the interposition of his divine providence at
   all, to convince mankind clearly and generally of the world's being
   under his immediate care, inspection, and government. This, I say, may
   indeed at first sight seem very wonderful. But if we consider the
   matter more closely and attentively, it will appear not to be so
   strange and astonishing as we are apt to imagine: For as, in a great
   machine, contriv ed by the skill of a consummate artificer, fitted up
   and adjusted with all conceivable accuracy for some very difficult and
   deep-projected design, and polished and fine wrought in every part of
   it with admirable niceness and dexterity, any man who saw and examined
   one or two wheels thereof could not fail to observe, in those single
   parts of it, the admirable art and exact skill of the workman; and yet
   the excellency of the end or use for which the whole was contrived he
   would not at all be able, even though he was himself a skilful
   artificer, to discover and comprehend, without seeing the whole fitted
   up and put together: So though in every part of the natural world,
   considered even single and unconnected, the wisdom of the great creator
   sufficiently appears, yet his wisdom, and justice, and goodness in the
   disposition and government of the moral world, which necessarily
   depends on the connexion and issue of the whole scheme, cannot perhaps
   be distinctly and fully comprehended by any finite and created beings,
   much less by frail and weak and short-lived mortals, before the period
   and accomplishment of certain great revolutions. But it is exceedingly
   reasonable to believe, that as the great discoveries, which by the
   diligence and sagacity of later ages have been made in astronomy and
   natural philosophy, have opened surprising scenes of the power and
   wisdom of the creator, beyond what men could possibly have conceived or
   imagined in former times; so at the unfolding of the whole scheme of
   providence in the conclusion of this present state, men will be
   surprised with the amazing manifestations of justice and goodness which
   will then appear to have run through the whole series of God's
   government of the moral world.

   This is the chief and greatest argument on which the natural proof of a
   future state of rewards and punishments must principally be founded.
   Yet there are also several other collateral evidences which jointly
   conspire to render the same thing extremely credible to mere natural
   reason: As,

   1st. Of the immortality of the soul and the natural proofs we have of
   it. There is very great reason, even from the bare nature of the thing
   itself, to believe the soul to be immortal, separate from all moral
   arguments drawn from the attributes of God, and without any
   consideration of the general system of the world, or of the universal
   order and constitution, connexion, and dependencies of things: The
   immortality of the soul has been commonly believed in all ages and in
   all places, [236] by the unlearned part of all civilized people, and by
   the almost general consent of all the most barbarous nations under
   heaven, from a tradition so ancient and so universal, as cannot be
   conceived to owe its original either to chance or to vain imagination,
   or to any other cause than to the author of nature himself: And the
   most learned and thinking part of mankind, at all times and in all
   countries, where the study of philosophy has been in any measure
   cultivated, have almost generally agreed, that it is capable of a just
   proof from the abstract consideration of the nature and operations of
   the soul itself: That none of the known qualities of matter can in any
   possible variation, division, or composition, produce sense, and
   thought, and reason, is abundantly evident, as has been demonstrated in
   the former discourse: [237] That matter consists of innumerable,
   divisible, separable, and for the most part actually disjoined parts,
   is acknowledged by all philosophers: That, since the powers and
   faculties of the soul are the most remote and distant from all the
   known properties of matter that can be imagined, it is at least a
   putting great violence upon our reason to imagine them superadded by
   omnipotence to one and the same substance, cannot easily be denied:
   That it is highly unreasonable and absurd to suppose the soul made up
   of innumerable consciousnesses, as matter is necessarily made up of
   innumerable parts; and, on the contrary, that it is highly reasonable
   to believe the seat of thought to be a simple substance, such as cannot
   naturally be divided and crumbled into pieces, as all matter is
   manifestly subject to be, must of necessity be confessed: Consequently
   the soul will not be liable to be dissolved at the dissolution of the
   body, and therefore it will naturally be immortal. All this seems to
   follow, at least with the highest degree of probability, from the
   single consideration of the soul's being indued with sense, thought, or
   consciousness. I cannot imagine, saith Cyrus, [238] (in that speech
   which Xenophon relates he made to his children a little before his
   death,) that the soul, while it is in this mortal body, lives, and that
   when it is separated from it, then it should die: I cannot persuade
   myself that the soul, by being separated from this body, which is
   devoid of sense, should thereupon become itself likewise devoid of
   sense: On the contrary, it seems to me more reasonable to believe that,
   when the mind is separated from the body, it should then become most of
   all sensible and intelligent; thus he: But then further; if we take
   also into the consideration all the higher and nobler faculties,
   capacities, and improvements of the soul, the argument will still
   become much stronger. I am persuaded, saith Cicero, [239] when I
   consider with what swiftness of thought the soul is indued, with what a
   wonderful memory of things past, and forecast of things to come; how
   many arts, how many sciences, how many wonderful inventions it has
   found out, that that nature, which is possessor of such faculties,
   cannot be mortal: Again; the memory, saith he, [240] which the soul has
   of things that have been, and its foresight of things that will be, and
   its large comprehension of things that at present are, are plainly
   divine powers; nor can the wit of man ever invent any way by which
   these faculties could possibly come to be in men, but by immediate
   communication from God: Again; though we see not, saith he, [241] the
   soul of man, as indeed neither are we able to see God; yet, as from the
   works of God we are certain of his being, so, from the faculties of the
   soul, its memory, its invention, its swiftness of thought, its noble
   exercise of all virtue, we cannot but be convinced of its divine
   original and nature: And, speaking of the strength and beauty of that
   argument, which, from the wonderful faculties and capacities of the
   soul, concludes it to be of an immaterial and immortal nature; though
   all the vulgar and little philosophers in the world, saith he, [242]
   (for so I cannot but call all such as dissent from Plato and Socrates,
   and those superior geniuses,) should put their heads together; they
   will not only never, while they live, be able to explain any thing so
   neatly and elegantly; but even this argument itself they will never
   have understanding enough fully to perceive and comprehend how neat,
   and beautiful, and strong it is. The chief prejudice against the belief
   of the soul's existing thus, and living after the death of the body,
   and the sum of all the objections brought against this doctrine by the
   Epicurean philosophers of old, who denied the immortality of the soul,
   and by certain atheistical persons of late, who differ very little from
   them in their manner of reasoning, is this: That they cannot apprehend
   how the soul can have any sense of perception, [243] without the body
   wherein evidently are all the organs of sense; But neither can they any
   better apprehend or explain how the soul in the body, [244] (that is,
   the body itself, according to their opinion,) is capable of sense or
   perception, by means of the organs of sense: And besides, this
   argument, that the soul can have no perception, when all the ways of
   perception that we have at present ideas of, are removed, is exactly
   the very same argument, and no other, than what a man born blind might
   make use of, with the very same force, to prove that none of us can
   possibly have in our present bodies any perception of light or colours,
   as I have explained more particularly in the former discourse. [245]

   This consideration, The natural credibility of the soul's being
   immortal of great use to the wiser heathens. of the soul's appearing in
   all reason to be naturally immortal, afforded great pleasure and
   satisfaction to the wisest and soberest men in the heathen world; was a
   great support under calamities and sufferings, especially under such as
   men brought upon themselves by being virtuous; filled them with great
   hopes and comfortable expectations of what was to come hereafter, and
   was a mighty encouragement to the practice of all moral virtue, and
   particularly to take pains in subduing the body and keeping it in
   subjection to the reason of the mind. First, it afforded great pleasure
   and satisfaction to the wisest and soberest men in the heathen world,
   from the bare contemplation of the thing itself. Nobody, saith Cicero,
   [246] shall ever drive me from the hope of immortality; and, [247] if
   this my opinion concerning the immortality of the soul should at last
   prove an error, yet it is a very delightful error, and I will never
   suffer myself to be undeceived in so pleasing an opinion as long as I
   live. Secondly, it was a great support to them under calamities and
   sufferings, especially under such as men brought upon themselves by
   being virtuous: These and the like contemplations, saith Cicero, [248]
   had such an effect upon Socrates, that when he was tried for his life,
   he neither desired any advocate to plead his cause, nor made any
   supplication to his judges for mercy; and on the very last day of his
   life made many excellent discourses upon this subject, and a few days
   before, when he had an opportunity offered him to have escaped out of
   prison, he would not lay hold of it: For thus he believed, and thus he
   taught; that when the souls of men depart out of their bodies, they go
   two different ways; the virtuous to a place of happiness, the wicked
   and the sensual to misery. Thirdly, it filled them with great hopes and
   comfortable expectations of what was to come hereafter: O happy day,
   saith the good old man in Cicero, [249] when I shall go to that blessed
   assembly of spirits, and depart out of this wicked and miserably
   confused world! Lastly, it was a mighty encouragement to the practice
   of all moral virtue, and particularly to take pains in subduing the
   body and keeping it in subjection to the reason of the mind: We ought
   to spare no pains, saith Plato, [250] to obtain the habit of virtue and
   wisdom in this life; for the prize is noble, and the hope is very
   great. Again; having reckoned up the temporal advantages of virtue in
   the present world, he adds: [251] But we have not yet mentioned the
   greatest and chiefest rewards which are proposed to virtue; for what
   can be truly great in so small a portion of time?--The whole age of the
   longest liver in this our present world, being inconsiderable, and
   nothing in comparison of eternity. And again; these things, saith he,
   [252] are nothing, either in number or greatness, in comparison with
   those rewards of virtue, and punishments of vice, which attend men
   after death. And to mention no more places, they, saith he, [253] who
   in the games hope to obtain a victory in such poor matters as
   wrestling, running, and the like, think not much to prepare themselves
   for the contest by great temperance and abstinence; and shall our
   scholars, in the study of virtue, not have courage and resolution
   enough to persevere, with patience, for a far nobler prize? Words very
   like those of St. Paul, 1 Cor. ix. 24. Know ye not that they which run
   in a race, run all; and every man that striveth for the mastery, is
   temperate in all things? Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown,
   but we an incorruptible.

   2. The argument for a future state drawn from men's natural desire of
   immortality. Another argument which may be used in proof of a future
   state, so far as to amount to a very great probability, is, that
   necessary desire of immortality, which seems to be naturally implanted
   in all men, with an unavoidable concern for what is to come hereafter.
   If there be no existence after this life, it will seem that the
   irrational creatures who always enjoy the present good, without any
   care or solicitude for what may happen afterwards, are better provided
   for by nature than man, whose reason and foresight, and all other those
   very faculties, by which they are made more excellent than beasts,
   serve them, upon this supposition, scarcely for any other purpose, than
   to render them uneasy and uncertain, and fearful and solicitous about
   things which are not. And it is not at all probable that God should
   have given men appetites which were never to be satisfied; desires
   which had no objects to answer them; and unavoidable apprehensions of
   what was never really to come to pass.

   3. Another drawn from men's conscience or judgment of-their own
   actions. Rom. ii. 14, 15. Another argument, which may be brought to
   prove a future state, is that conscience which all men have of their
   own actions, or that inward judgment which they necessarily pass upon
   them in their own minds; whereby they that have not any law, are a law
   unto themselves, their conscience bearing witness, and their thoughts
   accusing or else excusing one another. There is no man, who at any time
   does good, and brave, and generous things, but the reason of his own
   mind applauds him for so doing; and no man at any time does things base
   and vile, dishonourable and wicked, but at the same time he condemns
   himself in what he does. The one is necessarily accompanied with good
   hope, and expectation of reward; the other with continual torment and
   fear of punishment. And hence, as before, it is not probable that God
   should have so framed and constituted the mind of man as necessarily to
   pass upon itself a judgment which shall never be verified, and stand
   perpetually and unavoidably convicted by a sentence which shall never
   be confirmed.

   4. Another drawn from man's being by nature an accountable creature.
   Lastly, another argument, which may be drawn from right reason, in
   proof of a future state, is this; that man is plainly in his nature an
   accountable creature, and capable of being judged. Those creatures,
   indeed, whose actions are all determined by something without
   themselves, or by what we call mere instinct, as they are not capable
   of having a rule given them, so it is evident that neither can they be
   accountable for their actions. But man, who has entirely within himself
   a free principle or power of determining his own actions upon moral
   motives, and has a rule given him to act by, which is right reason, can
   be, nay, cannot but be, accountable for all his actions, how far they
   have been agreeable or disagreeable to that rule. Every man, because of
   the natural liberty of his will, can and ought to govern all his
   actions by some certain rule, and give a reason for every thing he
   does. Every moral action he performs, being free and without any
   compulsion or natural necessity, proceeds either from some good motive
   or some evil one; is either conformable to right reason, or contrary to
   it; is worthy either of praise or dispraise, and capable either of
   excuse or aggravation: Consequently, it is highly reasonable to be
   supposed, that since there is a Superior Being, from whom we received
   all our faculties and powers, and since in the right use or in the
   abuse of those faculties, in the governing them by the rule of right
   reason, or in the neglecting that rule, consists all the moral
   difference of our actions; there will at some time or other be an
   examination or inquiry made, into the grounds, and motives, and
   circumstances of our several actions, how agreeable or disagreeable
   they have been to the rule that was given us; and a suitable judgment
   be passed upon them. Upon these considerations the wisest of the
   ancient heathens believed and taught that the actions of every
   particular person should all be strictly tried and examined after his
   death, and he have accordingly a just and impartial sentence passed
   upon him: Which doctrine though the poets indeed wrapped up in fables
   and obscure riddles, yet the wisest of the philosophers had a better
   notion of it, and more agreeable to reason. From this judgment, saith
   Plato, [254] let no man hope to be able to escape: For though you could
   descend into the very depth of the earth, or fly on high to the
   extremities of the heavens; yet should you never escape the just
   judgment of the gods, either before or after death: An expression very
   agreeable to that of the Psalmist; Psal. cxxxix. 8, 9.

   These, I say, are very good and strong arguments for the great
   probability of a future state: But that drawn as above, from the
   consideration of the moral attributes of God, seems to amount even to a
   demonstration.

Proposition V.

   V. Proposition V. Though the necessity and indispensableness of all the
   great and moral obligations of natural religion, and also the certainty
   of a future state of rewards and punishments, be thus in general
   deducible, even demonstrably, by a chain of clear and undeniable
   reasoning; yet (in the present state of the world, by what means soever
   it came originally to be so corrupted, the particular circumstances
   whereof could not now be certainly known but by revelation,) such is
   the carelessness, inconsiderateness, and want of attention of the
   greater part of mankind; so many the prejudices and false notions taken
   up by evil education; so strong and violent the unreasonable lusts,
   appetites, and desires of sense; and so great the blindness introduced
   by superstitious opinions, vicious customs, and debauched practices
   through the world; that very few are able, in reality and effect, to
   discover these things clearly and plainly for themselves: But men have
   great need of particular teaching, and much instruction, to convince
   them of the truth, and certainty, and importance of these things; to
   give them a due sense, and clear and just apprehensions concerning
   them, and to bring them effectually to the practice of the plainest and
   most necessary duties.

   1. Men hindered from discovering and understanding religious truths, by
   carelessness and want of attention. There is naturally in the greater
   part of mankind such a prodigious carelessness, inconsiderateness and
   want of attention, as not only hinders them from making use of their
   reason, in such manner as to discover these things clearly and
   effectually for themselves, but is the cause of the grossest and most
   stupid ignorance imaginable. Some seem to have little or hardly any
   notion of God at all; and more take little or no care to frame just and
   worthy apprehensions concerning him, concerning the divine attributes
   and perfections of his nature; and still many more are entirely
   negligent and heedless to consider and discover what may be his will.
   Few make a due use of their natural faculties, to distinguish rightly
   the essential and unchangeable difference between good and evil; fewer
   yet so attend to the natural notices which God has given them, as by
   their own understanding to collect that what is good is the express
   will and command of God, and what is evil is forbidden by him; and
   still fewer consider with themselves the weight and importance of these
   things, the natural rewards or punishments that are frequently annexed
   in this life to the practice of virtue or vice, and the much greater
   and certainer difference that shall be made between them in a life to
   come. Hence it is that (as travellers assure us) even some whole
   nations seem to have very little notion of God, or at least very poor
   and unworthy apprehensions concerning him; and a very small sense of
   the obligations of morality; and very mean and obscure expectations of
   a future state. Not that God has anywhere left himself wholly without
   witness; or that the difference of good and evil is to any rational
   being undiscernible; or that men at any time or in any nation, could
   ever be firmly and generally persuaded in their own minds that they
   perished absolutely at death: But through supine negligence and want of
   attention, they let their reason (as it were) sleep, [255] and are deaf
   to the dictates of common understanding; and, like brute beasts,
   minding only the things that are before their eyes, never consider any
   thing that is abstract from sense, or beyond their present private
   temporal interest. And it were well if even in civilized nations this
   was not very nearly the case of too many men, when left entirely to
   themselves, and void of particular instruction.

   2. And by early prejudices and false notions. The greater part of
   mankind are not only inattentive, and barely ignorant, but commonly
   they have also, through a careless and evil education, taken up early
   prejudices, and many vain and foolish notions, which pervert their
   natural understanding, and hinder them from using their reason in moral
   matters to any effectual purpose. This cannot be better described than
   in the words of Cicero: If we had come into the world, saith he, [256]
   in such circumstances as that we could clearly and distinctly have
   discerned nature herself, and have been able in the course of our lives
   to follow her true and uncorrupted directions, this alone might have
   been sufficient, and there would have been little need of teaching and
   instruction. But now nature has given us only some small sparks of
   right reason, which we so quickly extinguish with corrupt opinions and
   evil practices, that the true light of nature nowhere appears: As soon
   as we are brought into the world, immediately we dwell in the midst of
   all wickedness, and are surrounded with a number of most perverse and
   foolish opinions, so that we seem to suck in error even with our
   nurse's milk: Afterwards, when we return to our parents, and are
   committed to tutors, then we are further stocked with such variety of
   errors, that truth becomes perfectly overwhelmed with falsehood, and
   the most natural sentiments of our minds are entirely stifled with
   confirmed follies; but when, after all this, we enter upon business in
   the world, and make the multitude, conspiring everywhere in wickedness,
   our great guide and example, then our very nature itself is wholly
   transformed, as it were, into corrupt opinions. A livelier description
   of the present corrupt estate of human nature is not easily to be met
   with.

   3. And by sensual appetites, passions, and worldly business. In the
   generality of men the appetites and desires of sense are so violent and
   importunate, the business and the pleasures of the world take up so
   much of their time, and their passions are so very strong and
   unreasonable, that of themselves they are very backward and unapt to
   employ their reason, and fix their attention upon moral matters, and
   still more backward to apply themselves to the practice of them. The
   love of pleasure is (as Aristotle elegantly expresses it, [257] ) so
   nourished up with us from our very childhood, and so incorporated (as
   it were) into the whole course of our lives, that it is very difficult
   for men to withdraw their thoughts from sensual objects, and fasten
   them upon things remote from sense; and if perhaps they do attend a
   little, and begin to see the reasonableness of governing themselves by
   a higher principle than mere sense and appetite, yet with such variety
   of temptations are they perpetually encompassed and continually
   solicited, [258] and the strength of passions and appetites, make so
   great opposition to the motions of reason, that commonly they yield and
   submit to practise those things which at the same time the reason of
   their own mind condemns, [259] and what they allow not that they do;
   which observation is so true of too great a part of mankind, that Plato
   upon this ground declares all arts and sciences to have, in his
   opinion, [260] less of difficulty in them than that of making men good;
   insomuch that it is well, saith he, [261] if men can come to attain a
   right sense, and just and true notions of things, even by that time
   they arrive at old age.

   4. And above all, by vicious habits and practices. But that which,
   above all other things, most depraves men's natural understanding, and
   hinders them from discerning and judging rightly of moral truths, is
   this; that as stupid and careless ignorance leads them into fond and
   superstitious opinions, and the appetites of sense overcome and tempt
   them into practices contrary to their conscience and judgment; so, on
   the reverse, the multitude of superstitious opinions, vicious habits,
   and debauched practices, which prevail in all ages through the greater
   part of the world, do reciprocally increase men's gross ignorance,
   carelessness, and stupidity. False and unworthy notions of God, or
   superstitious apprehensions concerning him, which men carelessly and
   inconsiderately happen to take up at first; do (as it were) blind the
   eyes of their reason for the future, and hinder them from discerning
   what of itself originally was easy enough to be discovered. That which
   may be known Rom. i. 19, &c. of God has been manifest enough unto men
   in all ages, for God hath showed it unto them: For the invisible things
   of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
   understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
   godhead: So that they who are ignorant of him cannot but be without
   excuse. But notwithstanding all the heathen world had so certain means
   of knowing God, yet generally they glorified him not as God; neither
   were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
   heart was darkened; and they changed the glory of the incorruptible God
   into images of the meanest and most contemptible creatures; and
   worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is
   blessed for ever: The natural consequence of which absurd idolatry, and
   also the just judgment of God upon them for it was, that they were
   given up to a reprobate mind, to uncleanness, and to all vile affection
   to such a degree, that not only their common practices, but even their
   most sacred rites and religious performances became themselves the
   extremest abominations. And when men's morals are thus corrupted, and
   they run with greediness into all excess of riot and debauchery; then,
   on the other hand, by the same natural consequence, and by the same
   just judgment of God, both their vicious customs and actions, as well
   as superstitious opinions, reciprocally increase the blindness of their
   hearts,Eph. iv. 18. 19. darken the judgment of their understandings,
   stupify and sear their consciences so as to become past feeling, [262]
   and by degrees extinguish wholly that light of nature in their own
   minds, which was given them originally to enable them to discern
   between good and evil.

   Wherefore men have great need to be taught and instructed in matters of
   religion. By these means it comes to pass, that though the great
   obligations and the principal motives of morality, are indeed certainly
   discoverable and demonstrable by right reason; and all considerate men,
   when those motives and obligations are fairly proposed to them, must of
   necessity (as has been fully proved in the foregoing heads) yield their
   assent to them as certain and undeniable truths; yet under the
   disadvantages now mentioned, (as it is the case of most men to fall
   under some or other of them,) very few are of themselves able, in
   reality and effect, discover those truths clearly and plainly for
   themselves: But most men have great need of particular teaching and
   much instruction, not without some weight of authority, as well as
   reason and persuasion;

   1st. To raise and stir up their attention,--to move them to shake off
   their habitual carelessness, stupidity, and inconsiderateness,--to
   persuade them to make use of their natural reason and understanding,
   and to apply their minds to apprehend and study the truth and certainty
   of these things: For, as men, notwithstanding all the rational
   faculties they are by nature indued with, may yet, through mere neglect
   and incogitancy, be grossly and totally ignorant of the plainest and
   most obvious mathematical truths; so men may also, for want of
   consideration, be very ignorant of some of the plainest moral
   obligations, which, as soon as distinctly proposed to them, they cannot
   possibly avoid giving their assent unto.

   2. To give them a due sense, and right and just apprehensions
   concerning these things,--to convince them of the great concern and
   vast importance of them,--to correct the false notions, vain
   prejudices, and foolish opinions, which deprave their judgment,--and to
   remove that levity and heedlessness of spirit which makes men
   frequently to be in their practice very little influenced by what in
   abstract opinion they may seem firmly to believe: For there are many
   men who will think themselves highly injured if any one should make any
   doubt of their believing the indispensable obligations of morality, and
   the certainty of a future state of rewards and punishments, who yet in
   their lives and actions seem to have upon their minds but a very small
   sense of the weight and infinite importance of these great truths.

   3. To inculcate these things frequently upon them, and press them
   effectually to the practice of the plainest and most necessary
   duties,--to persuade them to moderate those passions,--to subdue those
   lusts,--to conquer those appetites,--to despise those pleasures of
   sense,--and (which is the greatest difficulty of all) to reform and
   correct those vicious customs and evil habits which tempt and hurry
   them too often into the commission of such things, as they are
   convinced at the same time, in the reason of their own minds, ought not
   to be practised: For it is very possible men may both clearly
   understand their duty and also be fully convinced of the reasonableness
   of practising it, and yet at the same time find a law in their
   membersRom. vii. 23. warring and prevailing against the law of their
   mind, and bringing them into captivity to the law of sin and death. Men
   may be pleased with the beauty and excellency of virtue, [263] and have
   some faint inclinations and even resolutions to practise it, and yet,
   at the return of their temptations, constantly fall back into their
   accustomed vices, if the great motives of their duty be not very
   frequently and very strongly inculcated upon them, so as to make very
   deep and lasting impressions upon their minds, and they have not some
   greater and higher assistance afforded them than the bare conviction of
   their own speculative reason.

   For these reasons (I say) it is very fit, that, notwithstanding the
   natural demonstrableness both of the obligations and motives of
   morality, yet considering the manifest corruptness of the present
   estate which human nature is in, the generality of men should not by
   any means be left wholly to the workings of their own minds, to the use
   of their natural faculties, and to the bare convictions of their own
   reason, but should be particularly taught and instructed in their duty,
   should have the motives of it frequently and strongly pressed and
   inculcated upon them with great weight and authority, and should have
   many extraordinary assistances afforded them, to keep them effectually
   in the practice of the great and plainest duties of religion.

   The great use and necessity of an order of preachers. And hence we may,
   by the way, justly observe the exceeding great use and necessity there
   is, of establishing an order or succession of men, whose peculiar
   office and continual employment it may be, to teach and instruct people
   in their duty, to press and exhort them perpetually to the practice of
   it, and to give them all possible assistances for that purpose. To
   which excellent institution, the right and worthy notion of God and his
   divine perfections, the just sense and understanding of the great
   duties of religion, and the universal belief and due apprehension of a
   future state of rewards and punishments; with the generality even of
   the meaner and more ignorant sort of people among us, are now possessed
   of; is manifestly and undeniably almost wholly owing: As I shall have
   occasion hereafter more particularly to observe.

Proposition VI.

   VI. Proposition VI. Though in almost every age there have indeed been
   in the heathen world some wise and brave and good men, who have made it
   their business to study and practise the duties of natural religion
   themselves, and to teach and exhort others to do the like, who seem
   therefore to have been raised up by Providence, as instruments to
   reprove in some measure, and put some kind of check to the extreme
   superstition and wickedness of the nations wherein they lived; yet none
   of these have ever been able to reform the world with any considerable
   great and universal success, because they have been but very few that
   have in earnest set themselves about this excellent work; and they that
   have indeed sincerely done it have themselves been entirely ignorant of
   some doctrines, and very doubtful and uncertain of others, absolutely
   necessary for the bringing about that great end; and those things which
   they have been certain of, and in good measure understood, they have
   not been able to prove and explain clearly enough; and those that they
   have been able both to prove and explain by sufficiently clear
   reasoning, they have not yet had authority enough to enforce and
   inculcate upon men's minds with so strong an impression as to influence
   and govern the general practice of the world.

   1. There have, indeed, in almost every age been, in the heathen world,
   some wise, and brave, and good men, who have made it their business to
   study and practise the duties of natural religion themselves, and to
   teach and exhort others to do the like: An eminent instance whereof, in
   the eastern nations, the Scripture itself affords us in the history of
   Job; concerning whom it does not certainly appear that he knew any
   positive revealed institution of religion, or that, before his
   sufferings, any immediate revelation was made to him, as there was to
   Abraham and the rest of the patriarchs. Among the Greeks Socrates seems
   to be an extraordinary example of this kind, concerning whom Plato
   tells us, in his apology, [264] that he did nothing else but go
   continually about, persuading both old and young, not to be so much
   solicitous to gratify the appetites of the body, or to heap up wealth,
   or to raise themselves to honour, or gain any outward advantage
   whatsoever: as to improve the mind, by the continual exercise of all
   virtue and goodness: Teaching them, that a man's true value did not
   arise from his riches, or from any outward circumstances of life; but
   that true riches, and every real good, whether public or private,
   proceeded wholly from virtue. After him, Plato and Aristotle and others
   followed his example, in teaching morality. And among the Romans,
   Cicero, and in later times, Epictetus and Antoninus, and several
   others, gave the world admirable systems of ethics, and noble moral
   instructions and exhortations, of excellent use and benefit to the
   generations wherein they live, and deservedly of great value and esteem
   even unto this day.

   2. Who seem to have been designed by Providence to bear witness against
   the wickedness of the nations wherein they lived. So that I think, it
   may very justly be supposed, that these men were raised up and designed
   by Providence, (the abundant goodness of God having never left itself
   wholly without witness, notwithstanding the greatest corruptions and
   provocations of mankind,) as instruments to reprove in some measure,
   and put some kind of check to the extreme superstition and wickedness
   of the nations wherein they lived; or at least to bear witness against,
   and condemn it. Concerning Job, the case is evident and confessed. And
   for the same reason, some of the ancientest writers of the church have
   not scrupled to call even Socrates also, [265] and some others of the
   best of the heathen moralists, by the name of Christians; and to
   affirm, that, [266] as the law was as it were a schoolmaster to bring
   the Jews unto Christ, so true moral philosophy was to the gentiles a
   preparative to receive the gospel. This perhaps was carrying the matter
   somewhat to far: But, to be sure, thus much we may safely assert, that
   [267] whatever any of these men were at any time enabled to deliver
   wisely and profitably, and agreeably to divine truth, was as a light
   shining in a dark place, derived to them by a ray of that infinite
   overflowing goodness, which does good to all even both just and unjust;
   from God the sole fountain of all truth and wisdom: And this, for some
   advantage and benefit to the rest of the world, even in its blindest
   and most corrupt estate.

   3. But yet none of these men were ever able to reform the world with
   any considerable success. But then, notwithstanding the most that can
   be made of this supposition, it is certain the effect of all the
   teaching and instruction even of the best of the philosophers in the
   heathen world, was in comparison very small and inconsiderable. They
   never were able to reform the world with any great and universal
   success, nor to keep together any considerable number of men in the
   knowledge and practice of true virtue. With respect to the worship of
   God, idolatry prevailed universally in all nations; and,
   notwithstanding men did indeed know God, so as to be without excuse,
   yet "they did not like to retain him in their knowledge, but became
   vain in theirRom. i, 21-28. imaginations, and their foolish heart was
   darkened, and they changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into
   images" of the vilest creatures; and no philosophers ever turned any
   great number of men from this absurd idolatry, to the acknowledgment
   and worship of the only true God. In respect of men's dealings one with
   another, honour and interest, and friendship, and laws, and the
   necessity of society, did indeed cause justice to be practised in many
   heathen nations to a great degree; but very few men among them were
   just and equitable upon right and true principles, a due sense of
   virtue, and a constant fear and love of God. With respect to
   themselves, intemperance and luxury, and unnatural uncleanness, was
   commonly practised, even in the most civilized countries; and this not
   so much in opposition to the doctrine of the philosophers, as by the
   consent indeed and encouragement of too great a part of them. I shall
   not enlarge upon this ungrateful and melancholy subject: There are
   accounts enough extant of the universal corruption and debauchery of
   the heathen world. St. Paul's description of it, in the whole first
   chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, is alone sufficient; and the
   complaints of their own writers abundantly confirm it. [268] The
   disciples of the best moralists, at least the practisers of their
   doctrine were, in their own lifetime, [269] very few, as too plainly
   appears from the evil treatment which that great man Socrates met
   withal at Athens: And at their deaths their doctrine in great measure
   died with them, not having any sufficient evidence or authority to
   support it; and their followers quickly fell back into the common
   idolatry, superstition, uncleanness, and debauchery, of which the
   character the Roman writers give of those that called themselves the
   disciples of Socrates is a particular and remarkable instance. These
   considerations (so very early did they appear to be true,) affected in
   such a manner that great admirer of Socrates, Plato, that he sometimes
   seems to give over all hopes of working any reformation in men by
   philosophy; and says that a good man, [270] when he considers these
   things, would even choose to sit quiet, and shift for himself, like a
   man that in a violent hurricane creeps under a wall for his defence;
   and seeing the whole world round about him filled with all manner of
   wickedness, be content if, preserving his single self from iniquity and
   every evil work, he can pass away the present life in peace, and at
   last die with tranquillity and good hope. And, indeed, for many
   reasons, it was altogether impossible that the teaching of the
   philosophers should ever be able to reform mankind, and recover them
   out of their very degenerate and corrupt estate, with any considerably
   great and universal success.

   1. Because they have been but very few that have in earnest set
   themselves about that excellent work. In the first place, because the
   number of those who have in earnest set themselves about this excellent
   work have been exceeding few: Philosophers, indeed, that called
   themselves so, there were enough in every place, and in every age: But
   those who truly made it their business to improve their reason to the
   height, to free themselves from the superstition which overwhelmed the
   whole world, to search out the obligations of morality, and the will of
   God their creator, to obey it sincerely themselves, as far as they
   could discover it by the light of nature, and to encourage and exhort
   others to do the like; were but a very few names. The doctrine of far
   the greatest part of the philosophers consisted plainly in nothing but
   words, and subtilty, and strife, and empty contention; as did not at
   all amend even their own manners, much less was fitted to reform the
   world. Their scholars, [271] as Aristotle excellently describes them,
   thought themselves greatly improved in philosophy, and that they were
   become gallant men if they did but hear and understand and learn to
   dispute about morality, though it had no effect at all nor influence
   upon their manners; just as if a sick man should expect to be healed by
   hearing a physician discourse, though he never followed any of his
   directions. Undoubtedly, saith he, the mind of the one was exactly as
   much improved by such philosophy, as the health of the other's body by
   such physic: And no wonder the generality of the common hearers judged
   of their own improvement in philosophy by such false measures, when the
   enormous viciousness of the lives of the philosophers themselves [272]
   made it plainly appear that their art was not so much intended and
   fitted for the reformation of men's manners, as to be an exercise of
   wit and subtilty, and an instrument of vainglory: Excepting, perhaps,
   Socrates and Plato, and some others of that rank, this account is too
   plainly true of the greatest part of the philosophers. The argument is
   too unpleasant to instance in particulars. Whoever pleases, may, in
   Diogenes Laertius, and other writers, find accounts enough of the
   lewdness and unnatural vices of most of the philosophers. It is a shame
   for us, so much as to speak of those things, which were done of them,
   not only in secret, but even in the most public manner. I shall here
   only add the judgment of Cicero, a man as able to pass a right judgment
   in this matter as ever lived. Do you think, [273] says he, that these
   things (meaning the precepts of morality,) had any influence upon those
   men, (excepting only a very few of them,) who taught, and wrote, and
   disputed about them? No; who is there of all the philosophers, whose
   mind, and life, and manners were conformable to right reason? Whoever
   made his philosophy to be the law and rule of his life, and not a mere
   boast and show of his wit and parts? who observed his own instructions,
   and lived in obedience to his own precepts? On the contrary; many of
   them were slaves to filthy lusts, many to pride, many to covetousness,
   &c.

   2. And those few of the philosophers, who did indeed sincerely
   endeavour to reform mankind, were yet themselves entirely ignorant of
   some doctrines absolutely necessary to the bringing about that great
   end. Those few extraordinary men of the philosophers, who did indeed in
   good measure sincerely obey the laws of natural religion themselves,
   and make it their chief business to instruct and exhort others to do
   the same, were yet themselves entirely ignorant of some doctrines
   absolutely necessary to the bringing about this great end, of the
   reformation and recovery of mankind.

   In general: Having no knowledge of the whole scheme, order, and state
   of things, the method of God's governing the world, his design in
   creating mankind, the original dignity of human nature, the ground and
   circumstances of men's present corrupt condition, the manner of the
   divine interposition necessary to their recovery, and the glorious end
   to which God intended finally to conduct them: Having no knowledge (I
   say) of all this, their whole attempt to discover the truth of things,
   and to instruct others therein, was like wandering in the wide sea,
   [274] without knowing whither they were to go, or which way they were
   to take, or having any guide to conduct them: And accordingly the
   wisest of them were never backward to confess their own ignorance and
   great blindness; [275] that truth was hid from them [276] as it were in
   an unfathomable depth; that they were much in the dark, [277] and very
   dull and stupid, not only as to the profounder things of wisdom, but as
   to such things also which seemed very capable of being in great part
   discovered: Nay, that even those things which in themselves were of all
   others the most manifest, [278] (that is, which, whenever made known,
   would appear most obvious and evident,) their natural understanding was
   of itself as unqualified to find out and apprehend as the eyes of bats
   to behold the light of the sun; that the very first and most necessary
   thing of all, [279] the nature and attributes of God himself, were,
   notwithstanding all the general helps of reason, very difficult to them
   to find out in particular, and still more difficult to explain; it
   being much more easy to say what God was not than what he was: [280]
   And finally, that the method of instructing men effectually, and making
   them truly wise and good, was a thing very obscure and dark, and
   difficult to be found out: [281] In a word, Socrates himself always
   openly professed, that he pretended to be wiser than other men only in
   this one thing, that he was duly sensible of his own ignorance, and
   believed that it was merely for that very reason that the oracle
   pronounced him the wisest of men. [282]

   Particularly they were very ignorant in what manner God might be
   acceptably worshipped. More particularly; the manner in which God might
   be acceptably worshipped these men were entirely and unavoidably
   ignorant of. That God ought to be worshipped is, in the general, as
   evident and plain from the light of nature as any thing can be; but in
   what particular manner, and with what kind of service he will be
   worshipped, cannot be certainly discovered by bare reason. Obedience to
   the obligations of nature, and imitation of the moral attributes of
   God, the wisest philosophers easily knew was undoubtedly the most
   acceptable service to God: But some external adoration seemed also to
   be necessary, and how this was to be performed they could not with any
   certainty discover. Accordingly even the very best of them complied
   therefore generally with the outward religion of their country, and
   advised others to do the same; and so, notwithstanding all their wise
   discourses, they fell lamentably into the practice of the most foolish
   idolatry. Plato, [283] after having delivered very noble, and almost
   divine truths concerning the nature and attributes of the Supreme God,
   weakly advises men to worship likewise inferior gods, [284] demons, and
   spirits, and dared not to condemn the worshipping even of statues also
   and images, dedicated according to the laws of their country; as if the
   honour they paid to lifeless idols could procure the favour and
   good-will of superior intelligences; [285] And so he corrupted and
   spoiled the best philosophy in the world by adding idolatry to that
   worship which he had wisely and bravely before proved to be due to the
   creator of all things. [286] After him, Cicero, the greatest and best
   philosopher that Rome or perhaps any other nation ever produced,
   allowed men to continue the idolatry of their ancestors; [287] advised
   them to conform themselves to the superstitious religion of their
   country, [288] in offering such sacrifices to different gods as were by
   law established; and disapproves and finds fault with the Persian Magi,
   [289] for burning the temples of the Grecian gods, and asserting that
   the whole universe was God's temple: In [290] all which he fondly
   contradicts himself, by inexcusably complying with the practices of
   those men, whom in many of his writings he largely and excellently
   proves to be extremely foolish upon account of those very practices:
   And to mention no more, (for indeed those of a lower rank, the minuter
   philosophers, as Tully calls them, are not worth mentioning,) that
   admirable moralist Epictetus, who, for a true sense of virtue, seems to
   have had no superior in the heathen world; even he also advises men to
   offer libations and sacrifices to the gods, [291] every one according
   to the religion and custom of his country:

   And in what method God would be reconciled to returning sinners. But
   still more particularly: That which of all other things, these best and
   wisest of the philosophers were most absolutely and unavoidably
   ignorant of, and yet which, of all other things, was of the greatest
   importance for sinful men to know, was the method by which such as have
   erred from the right way, and have offended God, may yet again restore
   themselves to the favour of God, and to the hopes of happiness. From
   the consideration of the goodness and mercifulness of God, the
   philosophers did indeed very reasonably hope, that God would show
   himself placable to sinners, and might be some way reconciled; but when
   we come to inquire more particularly what propitiation he will accept,
   and in what manner this reconciliation must be made, here nature stops,
   and expects with impatience the aid of some particular revelation. That
   God will receive returning sinners, and accept of repentance instead of
   perfect obedience, they cannot certainly know to whom he has not
   declared that he will do so; for though this be the most probable and
   only means of reconciliation that nature suggests, yet whether this
   will be alone sufficient, or whether God will not require something
   further for the vindication of his justice, and of the honour and
   dignity of his laws and government, and for the expressing more
   effectually his indignation against sin, before he will restore men to
   the privileges they have forfeited, they cannot be satisfactorily
   assured; for it cannot positively be proved, from any of God's
   attributes, that he is absolutely obliged to pardon all creatures all
   their sins, at all times, barely and immediately upon their repenting.
   There arises, therefore, from nature, no sufficient comfort to sinners,
   but anxious and endless solicitude about the means of appeasing the
   Deity. Hence those divers ways of sacrificing, and numberless
   superstitions, which overspread the face of the heathen world, but were
   so little satisfactory to the wiser part of mankind, even in those
   times of darkness, that the more considering philosophers could not
   forbear frequently declaring that [292] they thought those rites could
   avail little or nothing towards appeasing the wrath of a provoked God,
   or making their prayers acceptable in his sight; but that something
   still seemed to them to be wanting, though they knew not what.

   3. And other doctrines absolutely necessary in order to reform mankind,
   the best philosophers were very doubtful and uncertain about. Some
   other doctrines absolutely necessary, likewise, to the bringing about
   this great end of the reformation of mankind, though there was indeed
   so much proof and evidence of the truth of them to be drawn from
   reason, as that the best philosophers could not by any means be
   entirely ignorant of them; yet so much doubtfulness, uncertainty, and
   unsteadiness, was there in the thoughts and assertions of these
   philosophers concerning them, as could not but [293] very much diminish
   their proper effect and influence upon the hearts and lives of men. I
   instance, in the immortality of the soul, the certainty of a future
   state, and the rewards and punishments to be distributed in a life to
   come. The arguments, which may be drawn from reason and from the nature
   of things, for the proof of these great truths, seem really (as I have
   before shown) to come very little short of strict demonstration: And
   accordingly the wisest philosophers (as has likewise been shown before)
   did indeed sometimes seem to have reasoned themselves into a firm
   belief of them, and to have been fully convinced of their certainty and
   reality; even so far as to apply them to excellent purposes and uses of
   life. But then, on the other hand, a man cannot without some pity and
   concern of mind observe, how strangely, at other times, the weight of
   the same arguments seems to have slipped (as it were) out of their
   minds; and with what wonderful diffidence, wavering, and unsteadiness,
   they discourse about the same things. I do not here think it of any
   very great moment, that there were indeed some whole sects of
   philosophers, who absolutely denied the immortality of the soul, and
   peremptorily rejected all kind of expectation of a life to come;
   (though, to be sure, this could not but in some measure shock the
   common people, and make them entertain some suspicion about the
   strength of the arguments used on the other side of the question by
   wiser men:) Yet, I say,) it cannot be thought of any very great moment,
   that some whole sects of philosophers did indeed absolutely deny the
   immortality of the soul; because these men were weak reasoners in other
   matters also, and plainly low and contemptible philosophers, in
   comparison of those greater geniuses we are now speaking of. But that
   which I now observe, and which I say cannot be observed without some
   pity and concern of mind, is this; that even those great philosophers
   themselves, the very best and wisest and most considerate of them that
   ever lived, notwithstanding the undeniable strength of the arguments
   which sometimes convinced them of the certainty of a future state, did
   yet at other times express themselves with so much hesitancy and
   unsteadiness concerning it, as, without doubt, could not but extremely
   hinder the proper effect and influence which that most important
   consideration ought to have upon the hearts and lives of men. I am now,
   said Socrates [294] a little before his death, about to leave this
   world; and ye are still to continue in it: Which of us have the better
   part allotted to us, God only knows: [295] Seeming to express some
   doubtfulness, whether he should have any existence after death, or not.
   And again, at the end of his most admirable discourse concerning the
   immortality of the soul; I would have you to know, [296] said he to his
   friends who came to pay him their last visit, that I have great hopes I
   am now going into the company of good men: Yet I would not be too
   peremptory and confident concerning it. But [297] if death be only as
   it were a transmigration from hence unto another place; and those
   things, which are told us, be indeed true; that those who are dead to
   us, do all live there: Then, &c. So likewise Cicero, speaking of the
   same subject: I will endeavour, saith he, [298] to explain what you
   desire; yet I would not have you depend upon what I shall say, as
   certain and infallible; but I may guess, as other men do, at what shall
   seem most probable: And further than this, I cannot pretend to go.
   Again: Which of those two opinions, [299] saith he, [that the soul is
   mortal, or that it is immortal,] be true, God only knows; which of them
   is most probable, is a very great question. And again in the same
   discourse, having brought all those excellent arguments before
   mentioned in proof of the immortality of the soul; yet we ought not,
   saith he, [300] to be overconfident of it: For it often happens that we
   are strongly affected at first with an acute argument; and yet, a
   little while after, stagger in our judgment, and alter our opinion,
   even in clearer matters than these: For these things must be confessed
   to have some obscurity in them. And again: I know not how, saith he,
   [301] when I read the arguments in proof of the soul's immortality,
   methinks I am fully convinced; and yet after I have laid aside the
   book, and come to think and consider of the matter alone by myself,
   presently I find myself slipt again insensibly into my old doubts. From
   all which it appears, that notwithstanding all the bright arguments and
   acute conclusions, and brave sayings of the best philosophers, yet life
   and immortality were not fully and satisfactorily brought to light by
   bare natural reason; [302] but men still plainly stood in need of some
   farther and more complete discovery.

   4. And those things which they were indeed certain of, yet they were
   not able to prove and explain clearly and distinctly enough. Those
   things which the philosophers were indeed the most fully certain of,
   and did in good measure understand; such as the obligations of virtue,
   and the will of God in matters of morality; yet they were never able to
   prove and explain clearly and distinctly enough, to persons of
   capacities, in order to their complete conviction and reformation.
   First, because most of their discourses upon these subjects have been
   rather speculative and learned, nice and subtile disputes, than
   practical and universally useful instructions. They proved, by strict
   and nice argumentation, that the practice of virtue is wise and
   reasonable, and fit to be chosen, rather than that it is of plain,
   necessary, and indispensable obligation; and were able to deduce the
   will of God only by such abstract and subtile reasonings as the
   generality of men had by no means either abilities or opportunities to
   understand or to be duly affected by. Their very profession and manner
   of life led them to make their philosophy rather an entertainment of
   leisure time, [303] a trial of wit and parts, an exercise of eloquence,
   and of the art and skill of good speaking, than an endeavour to reform
   the manners of men, by showing them their plain and necessary duty: And
   accordingly the study of it, was, as Cicero [304] himself observes,
   unavoidably confined to a few, and by no means fitted for the bulk and
   common sort of mankind, who, as they cannot judge of the true strength
   of nice and abstract arguments, so they will always be suspicious of
   some fallacy in them. None but men of parts and learning, of study and
   liberal education, have been able to profit by the sublime doctrine of
   Plato, or by the subtile disputations of other philosophers; whereas
   the doctrine of morality, which is the rule of life and manners, ought
   to be plain, easy, and familiar, and suited fully to the capacities of
   all men. [305] Secondly, another reason why the philosophers were never
   able to prove and explain clearly and distinctly enough, even those
   things of which they were the most certain, to persons of all
   capacities, in order to their complete conviction and reformation, was
   because they never were able to frame to themselves any complete,
   regular, and consistent system or scheme of things; but the truths
   which they taught [306] were single and scattered, accidental as it
   were, and hit upon by chance, rather than by any knowledge of the whole
   true state of things; and consequently less universally convictive.
   Nothing could be more certain, (as they all well knew,) than that
   virtue was unquestionably to be chosen, and the practice of it to be
   recommended necessarily above all things; and yet they could never
   clearly and satisfactorily make out upon what principles originally,
   and for what end ultimately, this choice was to be made; and upon what
   grounds it was universally to be supported. Hence they perpetually
   disagreed, [307] opposed, and contradicted one another in all their
   disputations, to such a degree that St. Austin, somewhere out of Varro,
   reckons up no less than 280 opinions concerning that one question, What
   was the chief good or final happiness of man? The effect of all which
   differences could not, without doubt, but be a mighty hindrance to that
   conviction and general influence which that great truth, in the
   certainty whereof they all clearly agreed, (namely, that the practice
   of virtue was necessary and indispensable,) ought to have had upon the
   minds and lives of men. This whole matter is excellently set forth by
   Lactantius: The philosophers, saith he, [308] take them altogether, did
   indeed discover all the particular doctrines of true religion; but
   because each one endeavoured to confute what the others asserted, and
   no one's single scheme was in all its parts consistent, and agreeable
   to reason and truth, and none of them were able to collect into one
   whole and entire scheme the several truths dispersed among them all,
   therefore they were not able to maintain and defend what they had
   discovered. And again, having set down a brief summary of the whole
   doctrine and design of true religion, from the original to the
   consummation of all things; this entire scheme, says he, [309] because
   the philosophers were ignorant of, therefore they were not able to
   comprehend the truth, notwithstanding that they saw and discovered
   singly almost all the particulars of which the whole scheme consists:
   But this was done by different men, and at different times, and in
   different manners, (with various mixtures of different errors, in what
   every one discovered of truth singly;) and without finding the
   connexion of the causes, and consequences, and reasons of things, from
   the mutual dependencies of which the completeness and perfection of the
   whole scheme arises; whereas, had there been any man who could have
   collected and put together in order all the several truths which were
   taught singly and scatteredly by philosophers of all the different
   sects, and have made up out of them one entire consistent scheme, truly
   he would not have differed much from us Christians: But this it was not
   possible for any man to do, without having the true system of things
   first revealed to him.

   5. And those things which they were able to prove and explain clearly
   and distinctly enough, yet they had not sufficient authority to enforce
   in practice. Lastly: Even those things which the philosophers were not
   only themselves certain of, but which they have also been able to prove
   and explain to others, with sufficient clearness and plainness,--such
   as are the most obvious and necessary duties of life,--they have not
   yet had authority enough to enforce and inculcate upon men's minds with
   so strong an impression as to influence and govern the general practice
   of the world. The truths which they proved by speculative reason wanted
   still some more sensible authority to back them, [310] and make them of
   more force and efficacy in practice; and the precepts which they laid
   down, however evidently reasonable and fit to be obeyed, [311] seemed
   still to want weight, and to be but the precepts of men. Hence none of
   the philosophers, even of those who taught the clearest and certainest
   truths, and offered the best and wisest instructions, and enforced them
   with the strongest motives that could be, [312] were yet ever able to
   work any remarkable change in the minds and lives of any considerable
   part of mankind, as the preaching of Christ and his apostles undeniably
   did. Nor does it appear in history [313] that any number of Socrates's
   or Plato's followers were convinced of the excellency of true virtue,
   or the certainty of its final reward, in such a manner as to be willing
   to lay down their lives for its sake, as innumerable of the disciples
   of Christ are known to have done. In speculation, indeed, it may,
   perhaps, seem possible, that notwithstanding it must be confessed
   philosophy cannot discover any complete and satisfactory remedy for
   past miscarriages, yet the precepts and motives offered by the best
   philosophers might at least be sufficient to amend and reform men's
   manners for the future: But in experience and practice it hath, on the
   contrary, appeared to be altogether impossible for philosophy and bare
   reason to reform mankind effectually, without the assistance of some
   higher principle: For though the bare natural possibility of the thing
   cannot indeed easily be denied, yet in this case (as Cicero excellently
   expresses it [314] ,) in like manner as in physic it matters nothing
   whether a disease be such as that no man does, or no man can recover
   from it; so neither does it make any difference whether by philosophy
   no man is, or no man can be made wise and good: So that, without some
   greater help and assistance, mankind is plainly left in a very bad
   state. Indeed, in the original uncorrupted state of human nature,
   before the mind of man was depraved with prejudicate opinions, corrupt
   affections, and vicious inclinations, customs, and habits, right reason
   may justly be supposed to have been a sufficient guide, and a principle
   powerful enough to preserve men in the constant practice of their duty.
   But, in the present circumstances and condition of mankind, the wisest
   and most sensible of the philosophers themselves have not been backward
   to complain, that they found the understandings of men so dark and
   cloudy, their wills so biassed and inclined to evil, their passions so
   outrageous and rebelling against reason, that they looked upon the
   rules and laws of right reason as very hardly practicable, and which
   they had very little hopes of ever being able to persuade the world to
   submit to. In a word they confessed that human nature was strangely
   corrupted; and they acknowledged this corruption to be a disease
   whereof they knew not the true cause, and could not find out a
   sufficient remedy. So that the great duties of religion were laid down
   by them as matters of speculation and dispute, rather than as the rules
   of action; and not so much urged upon the hearts and lives of men, as
   proposed to the admiration of those who thought them hardly possible to
   be effectually practised by the generality of men. To remedy all these
   disorders, and conquer all these corruptions, there was plainly wanting
   some extraordinary and supernatural assistance, which was above the
   reach of bare reason and philosophy to procure, and yet without which
   the philosophers themselves were sensible there could never be any
   truly great men. [315]

Proposition VII.

   VII. Proposition VII. For these reasons there was plainly wanting a
   divine revelation, to recover mankind out of their universally
   degenerate estate, into a state suitable to the original excellency of
   their nature: Which divine revelation both the necessities of men and
   their natural notions of God gave them reasonable ground to expect and
   hope for; as appears from the acknowledgments which the best and wisest
   of the heathen philosophers themselves have made of their sense of the
   necessity and want of such a revelation; and from their expressions of
   the hopes they had entertained that God would some time or other
   vouchsafe it unto them.

   1. A divine revelation absolutely necessary for the recovery of
   mankind. There was plainly wanting a divine revelation, to recover
   mankind out of their universal corruption and degeneracy; and without
   such a revelation it was not possible that the world should ever be
   effectually reformed; for if (as has been before particularly shown)
   the gross and stupid ignorance, the innumerable prejudices and vain
   opinions, the strong passions and appetites of sense, and the many
   vicious customs and habits which the generality of mankind continually
   labour under, make it undeniably too difficult a work for men of all
   capacities to discover every one for himself, by the bare light of
   nature, all the particular branches of their duty; but most men, in the
   present state of things, have manifestly need of much teaching and
   particular instruction; if those who were best able to discover the
   truth, and instruct others therein, namely the wisest and best of the
   philosophers, were themselves unavoidably altogether ignorant of some
   doctrines, and very doubtful and uncertain of others, absolutely
   necessary to the bringing about that great end, the reformation of
   mankind; if those truths, which they were themselves very certain of,
   they were not yet able to prove and explain clearly enough to vulgar
   understandings; if even those things which they proved sufficiently,
   and explained with all clearness, they had not yet authority enough to
   enforce and inculcate upon men's minds with so strong an impression as
   to influence and govern the general practice of the world; nor
   pretended to afford men any supernatural assistance, which yet was very
   necessary to so great a work; And if, after all, in the discovery of
   such matters as are the great motives of religion, men are apt to be
   more easily worked upon, and more strongly affected, by good testimony,
   than by the strictest abstract arguments; so that, upon the whole, it
   is plain the philosophers were never by any means well qualified to
   reform mankind with any considerable success; then there was evidently
   wanting some particular revelation, which might supply all these
   defects. There was plainly a necessity of some particular revelation,
   to discover in what manner, [316] and with what kind of external
   service, God might acceptably be worshipped. There was a necessity of
   some particular revelation, to discover what expiation God would accept
   for sin, by which the authority, honour, and dignity of his laws might
   be effectually vindicated. There was a necessity of some particular
   revelation, to give men full assurance of the truth of those great
   motives of religion, the rewards and punishments of a future state,
   which, not withstanding the strongest arguments of reason, men could
   not yet forbear doubting of. [317] In fine, there was a necessity of
   some particular divine revelation, [318] to make the whole doctrine of
   religion clear and obvious to all capacities, to add weight and
   authority to the plainest precepts, and to furnish men with
   extraordinary assistances, to enable them to overcome the corruptions
   of their nature: And, without the assistance of such a revelation, it
   is manifest it was not possible that the world could ever be
   effectually reformed. Ye may even give over, saith Socrates, [319] all
   hopes of amending men's manners for the future, unless God be pleased
   to send you some other person to instruct you. And Plato: Whatever,
   saith he, [320] is set right and as it should be, in the present evil
   state of the world, can be so only by the particular interposition of
   God.

   2. That it was agreeable to the dictates of nature and right reason, to
   expect or hope for such a divine revelation. Since, therefore, there
   was plainly and confessedly wanting a divine revelation, to relieve the
   necessities of men in their natural state; and since no man can presume
   to say that it is inconsistent with any of the attributes of God, or
   unbecoming the wisdom of the Creator of all things, to supply that
   want; to reveal to his creatures more fully the way to happiness; to
   make more particular discoveries of his will to them; to set before
   them in a clearer light the rewards and punishments of a future state;
   to explain in what manner he will be pleased to be worshipped; and to
   declare what satisfaction he will accept for sin, and upon what
   conditions he will receive returning sinners: Nay, since, on the
   contrary, it seems more suitable to our natural notions of the goodness
   and mercy of God, to suppose that he should do all this than not; it
   follows undeniably, that it was most reasonable and agreeable to the
   dictates of nature to expect or hope for such a divine revelation. The
   generality of the heathen world, who were far more equal and less
   prejudiced judges in this matter than modern deists, were so fully
   persuaded that the great rules for the conduct of human life must
   receive their authority from heaven, that their chief lawgivers thought
   it not a sufficient recommendation of their laws that they were
   agreeable to the light of nature, unless they pretended also that they
   received them from God. But I have no need, in this argument, to make
   use of the examples of idolatrous lawgivers. The philosophers
   themselves, the best and wisest, and the least superstitious of them
   that ever lived, were not ashamed to confess openly their sense of the
   want of a divine revelation, and to declare their judgment that it was
   most natural and truly agreeable to right and sound reason to hope for
   something of that nature. There is, besides the several places before
   cited, a most excellent passage in Plato to this purpose; one of the
   most remarkable passages, indeed, in his whole works, though not quoted
   by any that I have met with, which therefore I think highly worthy to
   be transcribed at large, as a just and unanswerable reproach to all
   those who deny that there is any want or need of a revelation. It seems
   best to me, saith Socrates [321] to one of his disciples, that we
   expect quietly; nay, it is absolutely necessary, that we wait with
   patience till such time as we can learn certainly how we ought to
   behave ourselves both towards God and towards men. When will that time
   come, replies the disciple, and who is it that will teach us this? For,
   methinks, I earnestly desire to see and know who the person is that
   will do it. It is one, answers Socrates, who has now a concern for you.
   But in like manner, as Homer relates, that Minerva took away the mist
   from before Diomede's eyes, that he might be able to distinguish one
   person from another, so it is necessary that the mist, which is now
   before your mind, be first taken away, that afterwards you may learn to
   distinguish rightly between good and evil; for, as yet, you are not
   able to do it. Let the person you mentioned, replies the disciple, take
   away this mist, or whatever else it be, as soon as he pleases; for I am
   willing to do any thing he shall direct, whosoever this person be, so
   that I may but become a good man. Nay, answers Socrates, that person
   has a wonderful readiness and willingness to do all this for you. It
   will be best, then, replies the disciple, to forbear offering any more
   sacrifices till the time that this person appears. You judge very well,
   answers Socrates; it will be much safer so to do, than to run so great
   a hazard of offering sacrifices, which you know not whether they are
   acceptable to God or no. Well then, replies the disciple, we will then
   make our offerings to the Gods, when that day comes; and I hope, God
   willing, it may not be far off. And, in another place, the same author
   having given a large account of that most excellent discourse, which
   Socrates made a little before his death, concerning the great doctrines
   of religion, the immortality of the soul, and the certainty of a life
   to come, he introduces one of his disciples replying in the following
   manner: I am, [322] saith he, of the same opinion with you, O Socrates,
   concerning these things; that to discover the certain truth of them, in
   this present life, is either absolutely impossible for us, or at least
   exceeding difficult. Yet not to inquire, with our utmost diligence,
   into what can be said about them, or to give over our inquiry before we
   have carried our search as far as possible, is the sign of a mean and
   low spirit. On the contrary, we ought therefore by all means to do one
   of these two things, either, by hearkening to instruction, and by our
   own diligent study, to find out the truth, or, if that be absolutely
   impossible, then to fix our foot upon that which to human reason, after
   the utmost search, appears best and most probable; and, trusting to
   that, venture upon that bottom to direct the course of our lives
   accordingly; unless a man could have still some more sure and certain
   conduct to carry him through this life, such as a divine discovery of
   the truth would be. I shall mention but one instance more, and that is
   of Porphyry, who, though he lived after our Saviour's time, and had a
   most inveterate hatred to the Christian revelation in particular, yet
   confesses in general, [323] that he was sensible there was wanting some
   universal method of delivering men's souls, which no sect of philosophy
   had yet found out.

   3. The unreasonableness of modern deists, in denying the want and use
   of a revelation. This sense of the ancient and wisest philosophers is
   much departed from by modern deists, who contend that there was no
   want, no need of a revelation; that philosophy and right reason was of
   itself sufficiently able to instruct and preserve men in the practice
   of their duty; and that nothing was to be expected from revelation. But
   besides what has been already intimated concerning the extreme
   barbarity of the present heathen world, and what the philosophers, both
   Greeks and Latins, have confessed concerning the state of the more
   civilized nations wherein they lived; I think we may safely appeal even
   to our adversaries themselves, whether the testimony of Christ,
   (without considering at present what truth and evidence it has,)
   concerning the immortality of the soul, and the rewards and punishments
   of a future state, have not had (notwithstanding all the corruptions of
   Christians) visibly in experience and effect a greater and more
   powerful influence upon the lives and actions of men than the
   reasonings of all the philosophers that ever were in the world: [324]
   Whether credible testimony, and the belief and authority of revelation,
   be not in itself as it were a light held to the consciences of stupid
   and careless men; and the most natural and proper means that can be
   imagined to awaken and rouse up many of those who would be little
   affected with all the strict arguments and abstract reasonings in the
   world. And, to bring this matter to a short issue; whether in Christian
   countries, (at least where Christianity is professed in any tolerable
   degree of purity,) the generality even [325] of the meaner and most
   vulgar and ignorant people have not truer and worthier notions of God,
   more just and right apprehensions concerning his attributes and
   perfections, a deeper sense of the difference of good and evil, a
   greater regard to moral obligations and to the plain and most necessary
   duties of life, and a more firm and universal expectation of a future
   state of rewards and punishments; than in any heathen country any
   considerable number of men were ever found to have had.

   It may The great necessity and use of divine revelation. here perhaps
   be pretended, by modern deists, that the great ignorance and undeniable
   corruptness of the whole heathen world has always been owing, not to
   any absolute insufficiency of the light of nature itself, but merely to
   the fault of the several particular persons, in not sufficiently
   improving that light; and that deists now, in places where learning and
   right reason are cultivated, are well able to discover and explain all
   the obligations and motives of morality, without believing any thing of
   revelation. But this, even though it were true, (as, in the sense they
   intend, it by no means is; because, as has been before shown, there are
   several very necessary truths not possible to be discovered with any
   certainty by the bare light of nature; but) supposing it, I say, to be
   true, that all the obligations and motives of morality could possibly
   be discovered and explained clearly, by the mere light of nature alone,
   yet even this would not at all prove that there is no need of
   revelation: For, whatever the bare natural possibility was, it is
   certain in fact the wisest philosophers of old [326] never were able to
   do it to any effectual purpose, but always willingly acknowledged that
   they still wanted some higher assistance. And as to the great pretences
   of modern deists, it is to be observed, that the clearness of moral
   reasonings was much improved, and the regard to a future state very
   much increased, even in heathen writers, after the coming of Christ.
   And almost all the things that are said wisely and truly by modern
   deists, are plainly borrowed from that revelation which they refuse to
   embrace, and without which they could never have been able to have said
   the same things. Now, indeed, when our whole duty, with its true
   motives, is clearly revealed to us, its precepts appear plainly
   agreeable to reason; and conscience readily approves what is good, as
   it condemns what is evil: Nay, after our duty is thus made known to us,
   it is easy not only to see its agreement with reason, but also to begin
   and deduce its obligation from reason. But had we been utterly
   destitute of all revealed light, then, to have discovered our duty in
   all points, with the true motives of it, merely by the help of natural
   reason, would have been a work of nicety, pains and labour; like
   groping for an unknown way, in the obscure twilight. What ground have
   any modern deists to imagine, that if they themselves had lived without
   the light of the gospel, they should have been wiser than Socrates, and
   Plato, and Cicero? How are they certain they should have made such a
   right use of their reason as to have discovered the truth exactly,
   without being any way led aside by prejudice or neglect? If their lot
   had been among the vulgar, how are they sure they should have been so
   happy, or so considerate, as not to have been involved in that idolatry
   and superstition which overspread the whole world? If they had joined
   themselves to the philosophers, which sect would they have chosen to
   have followed? And what book would they have resolved upon to be the
   adequate rule of their lives and conversations? Or, if they should have
   set up for themselves, how are they certain they should have been
   skilful and unprejudiced enough to have deduced the several branches of
   their duty, and applied them to the several cases of life, by
   argumentation and dint of reason? It is one thing to see that those
   rules of life, which are beforehand plainly and particularly laid
   before us, are perfectly agreeable to reason; and another thing to find
   out those rules merely by the light of reason, without their having
   first been any otherwise made known. We see that even many of those,
   who profess to govern their lives by the plain written rule of an
   instituted and revealed religion, are yet most miserably ignorant of
   their duty; and how can any man be sure he should have made so good
   improvement of his reason, as to have understood it perfectly in all
   its parts, without any such help? We see that many of those who profess
   to believe firmly that great and everlasting happiness which Christ has
   promised to obedience, and that great and eternal misery which Christ
   has threatened to disobedience, are yet hurried away, by their lusts
   and passions, to transgress the conditions of that covenant to which
   these promises and these threatenings are annexed: And how can any man
   be sure he should be able to overcome those great temptations, if these
   mighty motives were less distinctly known, or less powerfully enforced?
   But suppose he could, and that by strength of reason he could
   demonstrate to himself these things with all clearness and
   distinctness, yet could all men do so? Assuredly all men are not
   equally capable of being philosophers, though all men are equally
   obliged to be religious. At least thus much is certain, that the
   rewards and punishments of another world, the great motives of
   religion, cannot be so powerfully enforced, to the influencing the
   lives and practice of all sorts of men, by one who shall undertake to
   demonstrate the reality of them by abstract reason and arguments, as by
   one who, showing sufficient credentials of his having been himself in
   that other state, shall assure them of the truth and certainty of these
   things. But, after all, the question does not really lie here. The
   truth, at the bottom, is plainly this: All the great things that modern
   deists affect to say of right reason, as to its sufficiency in
   discovering the obligations and motives of morality, is only a pretence
   to be made use of when they are opposing Christianity. At other times,
   and in reality, they have no hearty regard for morality, nor for the
   natural evidences of the certainty of a future state: They are willing
   enough to believe that men perish absolutely at death; and so they have
   no concern to support effectually the cause of virtue, nor care to make
   out any consistent scheme of things, but unavoidably recur, in truth,
   to downright atheism; at least, in the manners of most of them it is
   too plain and apparent that absolute libertinism is the thing they
   really aim at; and, however their creed may pretend to be the creed of
   deists, yet almost always their practice is the practice of very
   atheists.

   4. Yet God was not absolutely obliged to afford men the help of such a
   revelation. To return therefore to the argument: From what has been
   said upon this head, it appears plainly that it is agreeable to the
   natural hopes and expectations of men, that is, of right reason duly
   improved, to suppose God making some particular revelation of his will
   to mankind, which may supply the undeniable defects of the light of
   nature: And, at the same time, it is evident that such a thing is by no
   means unworthy of the divine wisdom, or inconsistent with any of the
   attributes of God, but rather, on the contrary, most suitable to them.
   Consequently, considering the manifold wants and necessities of men,
   and the abundant goodness and mercy of God, there is great ground, from
   right reason and the light of nature, to believe that God would not
   always leave men wholly destitute of so needful an assistance, but
   would at some time or other actually afford it them: Yet it does not
   from hence at all follow, (as some have imagined,) that God is obliged
   to make such a revelation; for then it must needs have been given in
   all ages, and to all nations; and might have been claimed and demanded
   as of justice, rather than wished for and desired as of mercy and
   condescending goodness. But the fore-mentioned considerations are such
   as might afford men reasonable ground to hope for some favour of this
   kind, to be conferred at such time, and in such manner, and upon such
   persons, as should seem best to supreme infinite wisdom; at least they
   might well dispose and prepare men before-hand, whenever any doctrine
   should come accompanied with just and good evidence of its being such a
   revelation to believe and embrace it with all readiness.

   Want of universality, no sufficient objection against the truth of a
   revelation. It has been made use of by a modern author, [327] as his
   principal and strongest argument against the reasonableness of
   believing any revelation at all, that it is confessed there has been no
   revelation universally owned and embraced as such, either in all ages,
   or by all nations in any age. He pretends to acknowledge, that if the
   doctrine of Christianity was universally entertained, he would not
   doubt of its being truly a revelation of the will of God to mankind.
   But since, in fact, there is no instituted religion universally
   received as a divine revelation, and there are several nations to whom
   the Christian doctrine in particular was never so much as preached, nor
   ever came to their knowledge at all, he concludes, that what is not
   universal and equally made known to all men, cannot be needful for any;
   and consequently, that there never was any real want of a revelation at
   all, nor any ground to think any further assistance necessary to enable
   men to answer all the ends of their creation than the bare light of
   nature. This is the sum and strength of this author's reasoning; and
   herein all the deniers of revelation agree with him. Now, (not to take
   notice here that it is by no means impossible but all men may be
   capable of receiving some benefit from a revelation, which yet a great
   part of them may have never heard of,) if these men's reasoning was
   true, it would follow, by the same argument, that neither was natural
   religion necessary to enable men to answer the ends of their creation:
   For, though all the truths of natural religion are indeed certainly
   discoverable by the due use of right reason alone, yet it is evident
   all men are not indued with the same faculties and capacities, nor have
   they all equally afforded to them the same means of making that
   discovery; as these gentlemen themselves upon some occasions are
   willing enough to own, when they are describing the barbarous ignorance
   of some poor Indian nations. And, consequently, the knowledge of
   natural religion being, in fact, by no means universal, it will follow
   that there is no great necessity even of that, but that men may do very
   well without it, in performing the functions of the animal life, and
   directing themselves wholly by the inclinations of sense: And thus
   these gentlemen must at last be forced to let go all moral obligations,
   and so recur unavoidably to absolute atheism. The truth is: As God was
   not obliged to make all his creatures equal, to make men angels, or to
   indue all men with the same faculties and capacities as any, so neither
   is he bound to make all men capable of the same degree or the same kind
   of happiness, or to afford all men the very same means and
   opportunities of obtaining it.--There is ground enough, from the
   consideration of the manifest corruption of human nature, to be so far
   sensible of the want of a divine revelation, as that right reason and
   the light of nature itself will lead a wise and considerate man to
   think it very probable that the infinitely merciful and good God may
   actually vouchsafe to afford men some such supernatural assistance; and
   consequently such a person will be very willing, ready, and prepared to
   entertain a doctrine which shall at any time come attended with just
   and good evidence of its being truly a revelation of the will of God.
   But it does not at all from hence follow, either that God is absolutely
   bound to make such a revelation, or that, if he makes it, it must
   equally be made to all men; or that, since in fact it is not made to
   all, therefore there is no reason to believe that there is any need or
   any probability of its being made to any.

Proposition VIII.

   VIII. Proposition VIII. There is no other religion now in the world but
   the Christian that has any just pretence or tolerable appearance of
   reason, to be esteemed such a divine revelation; and, therefore, if
   Christianity be not true, there is no revelation of the will of God at
   all made to mankind.

   This proposition will easily be granted by all modern unbelievers; and
   therefore I need not be particular in the proof of it.

   Of the Mahometan religion. The Mahometan religion was founded by a
   vicious person, proposes ridiculous and trifling doctrines to be
   believed, was propagated merely by violence and force of arms, was
   confirmed by no public and incontestable miracles, promises vain and
   sensual rewards to its professors, and is every way encompassed with
   numberless such absurdities and inconsistencies (as those who have
   given us accounts of the life of Mahomet, and the nature of his
   religion, have abundantly made out; and is sufficiently evident even
   from the Alcoran itself;) that there is no great danger of its imposing
   upon rational and considerate men.

   Of the Jewish religion. The Jewish religion was founded wholly upon the
   expectation of a Messiah to come: And the time of his appearance was
   limited by such plain and determinate prophecies that what difficulties
   soever there may be in computing the very nice and exact time of their
   completion, or what different periods soever may be fixed from whence
   to begin several computations; yet the time of their being fulfilled is
   now, in all possible ways of computing, so very far elapsed, that if
   the Christian doctrine be false, there is no supposition left, upon
   which the Jewish religion can, with any colour of reason, be believed
   to be true.

   It being evident, therefore, that either the Christian revelation is
   true, or else (how great want soever there may be of it) there is no
   such thing as revelation at all;--it remains that I proceed to consider
   what positive and direct evidence there is to prove the actual truth of
   this divine revelation.
     __________________________________________________________________

Proposition IX.

   IX. Proposition IX. The Christian religion, considered in its primitive
   simplicity, and as taught in the Holy Scriptures, has all the marks and
   proofs of being actually and truly a divine revelation, that any divine
   revelation, supposing it was true, could reasonably be imagined or
   desired to have.

   The marks of a religion coming from God. The necessary marks and proofs
   of a religion coming from God, are these. First, that the duties it
   enjoins be all such as are agreeable to our natural notions of God, and
   perfective of the nature and conducive to the happiness and well-being
   of men. And that the doctrines it teaches be all such, as, though not
   indeed discoverable by the bare light of nature, yet, when discovered
   by revelation, may be consistent with and agreeable to sound and
   unprejudiced reason; for otherwise no evidence whatsoever can be of so
   great force to prove that any doctrine is true; as its being either
   contradictory in itself, or wicked in its tendency, is to prove that it
   must necessarily be false. Secondly, for the same reason, the motives
   likewise, by which it is recommended to men's belief and practice, and
   all the peculiar circumstances with which it is attended, must be such
   as are suitable to the excellent wisdom of God, and fitted to amend the
   manners and perfect the minds of men. Lastly, it must moreover be
   positively and directly proved to come from God, by such certain signs
   and matters of fact as may be undeniable evidences of its author's
   having actually a divine commission: For otherwise, as no evidence can
   prove a doctrine to come from God, if it be either impossible or wicked
   in itself, so, on the other hand, neither can any degree of goodness or
   excellency in the doctrine itself make it demonstrably certain, but
   only highly probable, to have come from God; unless it has moreover
   some positive and direct evidence of its being actually revealed.

   The entire proof therefore of this proposition must be made by an
   induction of particulars, as follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

Proposition X.

   X. Proposition X. First, the practical duties which the Christian
   religion enjoins, are all such as are most agreeable to our natural
   notions of God, and most perfective of the nature, and conducive to the
   happiness and well-being of men. That is, Christianity even in this
   single respect, as containing alone, and in one consistent system, all
   the wise and good precepts (and those improved, augmented, and exalted
   to the highest degree of perfection,) that ever were taught singly and
   scatteredly, and many times but very corruptly by the several schools
   of the philosophers; and this without any mixture of the fond, absurd,
   and superstitious practices of any of these philosophers; ought to be
   embraced and practised by all rational and considering deists, who will
   act consistently, and steadily pursue the consequences of their own
   principles; as at least the best scheme and sect of philosophy that
   ever was set up in the world; and highly probable, even though it had
   no external evidence to be of divine original.

   The proposition proved in the several instances of duty. This
   proposition is so very evident, that the greatest adversaries of the
   Christian institution have never been able to deny it any otherwise
   than by confounding the inventions of men, the superstitious practices
   of particular persons, or the corrupt additions of certain particular
   churches or societies of Christians, with the pure and simple precepts
   of the gospel of Christ. In all those instances of duty which pure and
   uncorrupt Christianity enjoins, the proposition is manifest, and
   altogether undeniable; the duties of love, fear, and adoration, which
   the Christian religion obliges us to render unto God, are so plainly
   incumbent upon us from the consideration of the excellent attributes of
   the divine nature, and our relation to him as our creator and
   preserver, that no man who considers can think himself free from the
   obligations which our religion lays upon him to practise these duties,
   without denying the very being of God, and acting contrary to the
   reason and all the natural notions of his own mind. It is placing the
   true and acceptable worship of God, not so much in any positive and
   ritual observances, as in approaching him with pure hearts and
   undefiled bodies, with unfeigned repentance for all past miscarriages,
   and sincere resolutions of constant obedience for the future, in
   praying to him for whatever we want, and returning him our most hearty
   thanks for whatever good things we receive, with such dependence and
   humility, such submission, trust, and reliance, as are the proper
   affections of dutiful children: All this is plainly most agreeable to
   our natural notions and apprehensions of God; and that the prayers of
   sinful and depraved creatures, sincerely repenting, should be offered
   up to God, and become prevalent with him, through and by the
   intercession of a mediator, is very consonant to right and unprejudiced
   reason, as I shall have occasion to show more particularly hereafter,
   when I come to consider the articles of our belief. Again: The duties
   of justice, equity, charity, and truth, which the Christian religion
   obliges us to exercise towards men, are so apparently reasonable in
   themselves, and so directly conducive to the happiness of mankind, that
   their unalterable obligations are not only in great measure deducible
   from the bare light of nature and right reason, but even those men
   also, who have broken through all the bonds of natural religion itself,
   and the original obligations of virtue, have yet thought it necessary,
   for the preservation of society and the well-being of mankind, that the
   observation of these duties, to some degree, should be enforced by the
   penalties of human laws; and the additional improvements Mat. v. 16,
   &c. which our Saviour has made to these duties, by commanding his
   disciples to be, as it were, lights in the world, and examples of good
   works to all men; to be so far from injuring others, that, on the
   contrary, they should not indulge themselves in any degree of anger or
   passion; to seek reconciliation immediately upon any difference or
   offence that may arise; to bear injuries patiently, rather than return
   evil for evil; to be always willing to forgive one another their
   trespasses, as they all expect forgiveness at the hands of God; to be
   kind and charitable to all men; to assist readily, and be willing to do
   all good offices, not only to their friends, but even to their
   bitterest enemies also; in a word, to raise their virtue and goodness
   far above the common practice of men, extending their charity
   universally in imitation of the goodness of God himself, who maketh the
   sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
   and on the unjust; these precepts, I say, are such as no unprejudiced
   philosopher would have been unwilling to confess were the utmost
   improvements of morality, and to the highest degree perfective of human
   nature. In like manner, the duties of sobriety, temperance, patience,
   and contentment, which our religion enjoins us to practise in
   ourselves, are so undeniably agreeable to the inward constitution of
   human nature, and so perfective of it, that the principal design of all
   true philosophy has ever been to recommend and set off these duties to
   the best advantage, though, as the philosophers themselves have always
   confessed, no philosophy was ever able to govern men's practice
   effectually in these respects: But the additional precepts, and the new
   weight and authority, which our Saviour has added to his instructions
   of this kind, teaching his disciples to governMatt. v. 28.
   Matt. vi. 19, 24, &c. their very thoughts, desires, and inclinations,
   to contemn and get above all the desires of this present world, and to
   set their affections principally upon that which is to come; these are
   the things which, when the Christian religion was in its primitive and
   purest state, worked men up actually to such a pitch of cheerful and
   generous obedience to the laws of God, and taught them to obtain such a
   complete victory over the world, and over all the desires and appetites
   of sense, as the best philosophers have acknowledged their instructions
   were never able to do. Lastly, even those positive and external
   observances, (the two sacraments,) which are instituted in the
   Christian religion, as means and assistances to keep men stedfast in
   the practice of those great and moral duties which are the weightier
   matters of the law; even those positive institutions (I say) are so
   free from all appearance of superstition and vanity, and so wisely
   fitted to the end for which they were designed, that no adversaries of
   Christianity have ever been able to object any thing at all against the
   things themselves, but only against certain corruptions and
   superstitions, which some who call themselves Christians, have,
   directly in opposition to the true design of Christianity, introduced
   and annexed to them. For what reasonable man can pretend to say, that
   it is any way unreasonable or superstitious for every member of the
   society to be solemnly admitted into his profession, by a plain and
   significant rite, entitling him to all the privileges, and charging him
   with all the obligations, which belong to the members of that society
   as such? which is the design of one of the sacraments: Or that it is
   unreasonable and superstitious for men frequently to commemorate, with
   all thankfulness, the love of their greatest benefactor, and humbly and
   solemnly to renew their obligations and promises of obedience to him?
   which is the design of the other.

   This a great evidence of a religion coming from God. Let now any
   impartial person judge whether this be not a wise and excellent
   institution of practical religion, highly conducive to the happiness of
   mankind, and worthy to be established by a revelation from God; when
   men had confessedly corrupted themselves to such a degree, that not
   only the light of nature, and right reason, was altogether insufficient
   to restore true piety; but even that light itself (as Cicero expressly
   acknowledges) nowhere appeared. [328] Let any impartial person judge,
   whether a religion that tends thus manifestly to the recovery of the
   rational part of God's creation, to restore men to the imitation and
   likeness of God, and to the dignity and highest improvement of their
   nature, has not within itself an intrinsic and very powerful evidence
   of its being truly divine. Let any one read the fifth, sixth, and
   seventh chapters of St Matthew's Gospel, and judge if they do not, as
   it were, set before his eyes such a lovely image and representation of
   true virtue, as Plato said, could not but charm men with the highest
   degree of love and admiration imaginable. [329] In a word, let any man
   of an honest and sincere mind consider, whether that practical doctrine
   has not even in itself the greatest marks of a divine original; wherein
   whatsoever things are true, whatsoeverPhil. iv. 8. things are honest,
   whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
   things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be
   any virtue, if there be any thing praiseworthy; all these, and these
   only are the things that are earnestly recommended to men's practice.
   What wise precept was ever delivered by any philosopher of any sect
   which is not more plainly laid down by our Saviour and his apostles?
   And not only so, but enforced moreover with greater efficacy and
   strength? founded upon nobler and more consistent principles? urged
   with greater weight and authority? and pressed with more powerful and
   affecting arguments? Nay, neither is this all the difference, even in
   respect barely of the excellency of the doctrine itself. For the
   philosophers taught indeed many excellent moral truths, but some upon
   one occasion and upon one set of principles; some upon another; and
   every one of them were mistaken in some instances of duty, and mingled
   particular superstitions and false notions with their good
   instructions, and built their doctrine upon no sure foundation of
   consistent principles; and all of them (as has been before shown) were
   very imperfect and deficient, and far from being able to make up an
   entire and complete scheme of the whole duty of man in all cases. But
   now, [330] to put together all the wise and good precepts that ever
   were delivered by any wise men of any sect and in any age, to improve
   and exalt every one of them to the highest possible degree of
   excellency and perfection, to separate and lay aside all the
   superstitious opinions and practices that had been mixed by all or any
   of the different sects of philosophers, or teachers of religion in any
   nation, with their respective moral instructions, and to supply all
   those doctrines wherein both moral philosophy and the additional
   institutions of all religions in the world had in the whole been
   hitherto altogether deficient; and all this, in one plain, entire, and
   regular system upon the foundation of certain and consistent
   principles: This is the peculiar character of the Christian
   institution; and all this cannot, with any colour of reason, be
   imagined to have ever been done by any man but one sent immediately
   from God: Upon this consideration alone, by all sincere deists (if any
   such there be) who really are what they pretend to be, who believe the
   being and attributes of God, and are firmly convinced of the
   obligations of virtue and natural religion, and the certainty of a
   future state of rewards and punishments, must needs, by their own
   principles, be strongly inclined to embrace the Christian religion, to
   believe, at least to hope confidently, that a doctrine so plainly
   fitted to recover men out of their universally corrupt estate, and
   restore them to the knowledge and favour of God, is truly divine; and
   to entertain it with all cheerfulness, as what in itself has those
   manifold marks of goodness and perfection which are themselves
   sufficient, though not indeed to prove it demonstrably, yet to satisfy
   a good man, that it cannot be any thing else than a revelation from
   God, even though it had wanted all those outward proofs, [331] and
   divine and miraculous testimonies, which shall hereafter be mentioned
   in their proper place.

Proposition XI.

   XI. Proposition XI. Secondly, The motives by which the Christian
   religion enforces the practice of the duties it enjoins are such as are
   most suitable to the excellent wisdom of God, and most answerable to
   the natural expectations of men.

   1. Of the acceptableness of true repentance, a motive to obedience. The
   acceptableness of true repentance, in the sight of God, and the certain
   assurance of pardon upon such repentance, which the Christian religion
   affords us, is a most powerful and necessary motive to frail and sinful
   creatures, to encourage and support them effectually in the practice of
   their duty. It is indeed in general evidently most agreeable to right
   reason, and to men's natural notions of God, to believe him placable,
   and merciful, and willing to forgive. But since at the same time it
   cannot be proved, by any arguments from reason, that God is absolutely
   obliged to forgive, and it is confessedly evident that it becomes the
   supreme governor of the universe to vindicate the honour and authority
   of his laws and government, to give some evidences of his hatred and
   indignation against sin, and sometimes, by instances of severity, to
   prevent sinners from abusing his mercy and patience, no less than that
   it is agreeable to his infinite wisdom and goodness to suffer his anger
   to be by some means appeased: No motive in this case can be imagined
   more expedient and powerful to encourage sinners to return to the
   practice of their duty, and to persuade them to continue therein
   immoveably for the future; nothing can be imagined more seasonable and
   satisfactory to the mind of man, and &gt;more agreeable to the
   excellent wisdom of God, and worthy of the supreme and infinitely
   merciful governor of all things, than such a positive declaration of
   the acceptableness of sincere repentance, and such an authentic
   assurance of pardon and forgiveness thereupon, as under the Christian
   dispensation the divine goodness and mercy has found means to afford
   unto us, in such manner as is at the same time abundantly consistent
   with the honour and dignity of the laws of God, and with his
   irreconcileable hatred against all unrighteousness and sin.

   2. Of the divine assistance, as another motive to obedience. That
   divine and supernatural assistance, which, under the Christian
   dispensation, they who sincerely endeavour to obey the will of God,
   have encouragement to hope for, upon all necessary occasions, is
   another powerful motive to support men effectually in the practice of
   their duty. The wisest of the philosophers were so far sensible of the
   great corruption and depravity of human nature in its present state;
   they were sensible that such was the carelessness, stupidity, and want
   of attention, of the greater part of mankind; so many the early
   prejudices and false notions taken in by evil education; so strong and
   violent the unreasonable lusts, appetites, and desires of sense; and so
   great the blindness, introduced by superstitious opinions, vicious
   customs, and debauched practices through the world; that (as has been
   before shown,) they themselves openly confessed they had very little
   hope of ever being able to reform mankind with any considerably great
   and universal success, by the bare force of philosophy and right
   reason; but that, to produce so great a change, and enable men
   effectually to conquer all their corrupt affections, there was need of
   some supernatural and divine assistance, or the immediate interposition
   of God himself. Now this divine assistance is vouchsafed to men under
   the Christian dispensation, in such a manner, as (from what has been
   already said concerning the judgment of the wisest of the ancient
   philosophers in this matter,) appears to be undeniably agreeable to the
   natural expectations of right reason, and suitable to the best and
   worthiest notions that men have ever by the light of nature been able
   to frame to themselves, concerning the attributes and perfections of
   God. Luke xi. 13. If ye, says our Saviour, being evil, know how to give
   good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly father
   give the holy spirit to them that ask him? The effect of this divine
   assistance evidenced itself in a very visible and remarkable manner in
   the primitive times, [332] by the sudden, wonderful, and total
   reformation of far greater numbers of wicked men than ever were brought
   to repentance by the teaching and exhortations of all the philosophers
   in the world. And even at this day, notwithstanding all the corruption
   introduced among Christians, I think it can hardly be denied by any
   unbelievers of revelation, but that there are among us many more
   persons of all conditions, who worship God in sincerity and simplicity
   of heart, and live in the constant practice of all righteousness,
   holiness, and true virtue, than ever were found in any of the most
   civilized nations, and most improved by philosophy in the heathen
   world.

   3. Of the clear discovery of future rewards and punishments, as another
   motive to obedience. The rewards and punishments which the Christian
   religion proposes, to obedience or disobedience, are a motive perfectly
   agreeable to men's natural hopes and fears, and worthy of God to make
   known by positive and express revelation. For since it is confessedly
   suitable to the divine wisdom, to make variety of creatures, indued
   with very different powers and faculties, and capable of very different
   kinds and degrees of improvement, and since all rational creatures, by
   reason of that natural liberty of will which is essentially necessary
   to their being such, cannot but be capable of exalting and improving
   their nature by the practice of virtue and the imitation of God, and on
   the contrary of depraving and debasing their nature by the practice of
   vice and alienation of themselves from God; it follows undeniably, (as
   has been before shown by a more particular deduction,) that it is
   highly agreeable to the light of nature and to right reason to suppose
   that God, the supreme governor and disposer of all things, will finally
   make a just and suitable distinction between his creatures, by the
   distribution of proportionable rewards and punishments. Nevertheless,
   both the truth itself of these final rewards and punishments was so far
   called in question, and rendered doubtful and uncertain, by the
   disputations even of the wisest philosophers that ever lived; and those
   who did in general believe the truth and certainty of them, had yet so
   very blind and obscure notions of what nature and kind they were to be,
   having their imaginations strangely prejudiced with poetical fictions
   and fabulous stories, that the setting this matter clear and right, and
   the supplying this single defect in the light of nature, was a thing
   highly worthy of divine revelation: It being plainly a very different
   thing, and of very different force as to the influencing men's actions,
   for men to be able to argue themselves into a reasonable expectation of
   future rewards and punishments; and to be certainly assured of the
   reality of them by express testimony of divine revelation. And
   accordingly, by divine revelation in the gospel, this defect of the
   light of nature is now actually supplied in such a manner; life and
   immortality are so brought to light, and the wrath of God is so
   revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men, that this very thing, the clear and distinct and consistent
   account which the gospel gives us of these final rewards and
   punishments, (which, though indeed in themselves so absolutely
   necessary, that without them no tolerable vindication could be made of
   the attributes of God, yet neither by the light of nature, nor by any
   positive institution of religion, excepting only the Christian, were
   they ever so clearly and plainly represented to mankind, as to have
   their full and proper effect upon the hearts and lives of men;) this
   very thing (I say) the clear, distinct, and consistent account which
   the gospel gives us of these final rewards and punishments, is itself
   no contemptible argument of the truth and divine authority of the
   Christian revelation. By the certain knowledge of these rewards and
   punishments it is that the practice of virtue is now established upon a
   sure foundation. Men have now abundantly sufficient encouragement to
   support them in their choice of virtue, and in their constant adherence
   to it, in all cases and under all circumstances that can be supposed.
   There is now sufficient weight on the side of virtue to enable men to
   conquer all the temptations of the devil, the flesh, and the world; and
   to despise the severest threatenings, even death itself. This is the
   victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. The only difficulty
   in this matter, arising from the duration of the final punishment of
   the wicked, shall be considered when I come to discourse of the
   articles of our belief.

Proposition XII.

   XII. Proposition XII. Thirdly, the peculiar manner and circumstances
   with which the Christian religion enjoins the duties, and urges the
   motives before mentioned, are exactly consonant to the dictates of
   sound reason, or the unprejudiced light of nature, and most wisely
   perfective of it.

   The proposition proved by particular instances. For what can be more
   agreeable to the light of nature, and more evidently perfective of it,
   than to have those duties, which nature hints at only in general,
   explained fully and largely, and urged in particular, and inculcated
   upon the meanest capacities with great weight and authority, and
   exemplified in the lives of holy persons, proposed as patterns for our
   imitation? What can be more perfective of the light of nature than to
   have those great motives of religion, the rewards and punishments of a
   future state, which nature only obscurely points at, described to us
   most plainly, affectionately, and lively? What can be more perfective
   of the light of nature, than to have the means of atoning for sin,
   which nature discovers only the want of, plainly declared and exhibited
   to us? What can be more perfective of the light of nature, than such a
   discovery of the heinousness of sin and the necessity of holiness, as
   the death of Christ and the purity of the gospel does make unto us? In
   fine, what can more effectually perfect the religion of nature, than
   the gathering together the worshippers of the true God into one body;
   the causing them to enter into solemn obligations to live suitably to
   their holy profession? The giving them gracious assurances that true
   repentance shall be accepted for what is past, and sincere renewed
   obedience for the future? The uniting them by a few positive rites in
   one religion as well as civil communion, for mutual assistance and
   improvement? And the establishing a certain order or perpetual
   succession of men, whose constant business it may be to explain the
   great duties of religion to persons of meaner capacities; to urge and
   enforce the practice of them; to set before men the reasons of their
   duty, and the necessity of it; to show them clearly and impartially the
   danger of neglecting it, and the great advantage of performing it
   sincerely; in a word, to instruct the ignorant, and to admonish the
   wicked; to reclaim those that err, to comfort the doubting, to reprove
   the obstinate; and to be instruments of conveying to men all proper
   assistances, to enable them to perform their whole duty effectually?

   If these things be the ordinances of one who came to contradict the
   dictates of right reason, and not to perfect the law of nature, but to
   destroy it; then let all wise men for ever forsake the assemblies of
   Christians, and profess themselves again disciples of the philosophers.
   But if these things be perfectly agreeable to nature and right reason,
   and tend exceedingly to the supplying the deficiences there of; then
   let none, under pretence of maintaining natural religion, revile and
   blaspheme the Christian, lest they be found liars unto God.

   An answer to the objection drawn from the division among Christians.
   The many contentions, indeed, about opinions of great uncertainty and
   little importance, which, to the very great scandal of Christianity,
   have in several ages of the church been, with unreasonable zeal, kept
   up, instead of promoting the universal interest of true practical
   religion and virtue, have, it must be confessed, given some occasion to
   the enemies of our most holy religion to blaspheme and revile both it
   and the teachers of it. But though such things as these have indeed
   afforded them too plausible an occasion, yet they have not given them
   any just reason so to do: For the acknowledged corruption of a doctrine
   or institution, in any particular part or respect, is by no means a
   weighty or real objection against the truth of the whole: And there has
   always been extant a sufficient rule to enable sincere persons, in the
   midst of the greatest disputes and contentions, to distinguish the
   doctrine which is of God from the opinions of men; the doctrine of
   Christ having been plainly and fully delivered in our Saviour's own
   discourses, and in the writings of his immediate followers the
   Apostles, who cannot, with any reason, be imagined either to have
   misrepresented it, or to have represented it imperfectly. But besides,
   I think it can hardly be denied, even by our adversaries themselves,
   but that in all times and places, wherein Christianity has been
   professed in any tolerable degree of purity; whatever contentions and
   disputes may have arisen about particular, and perhaps unnecessary
   doctrines; yet the great, the most necessary, and fundamental doctrines
   of religion, concerning God and providence; concerning the gracious
   method of God's reconciliation with penitent sinners; concerning the
   necessity of true piety, righteousness, and sobriety; concerning a
   judgment to come, and the final reward of the righteous, and the
   punishment of wicked men, in such a manner as will effectually
   vindicate both the justice and goodness, the wisdom and honour of God;
   these things (I say) have, notwithstanding all differences concerning
   smaller matters, been nevertheless at the same time universally and
   constantly taught, pressed and inculcated upon persons of all
   capacities, by the earnest and continual preaching of all the ministers
   of the gospel; with an effect infinitely more considerable and visible,
   both in extent and duration, than by the teaching of any heathen
   philosophers that ever lived: Which shows undeniably the excellency at
   least, if not the divine authority of the Christian institution, in
   this particular respect.

Proposition XIII.

   XIII. Proposition XIII. Fourthly; all the [credenda, or] doctrines,
   which the true, simple, and uncorrupted Christian religion teaches,
   (that is, not only those plain doctrines which it requires to be
   believed as fundamental and of necessity to eternal salvation, but even
   all the doctrines which it teaches as matters of truth,) are, though
   indeed many of them not discoverable by bare reason unassisted with
   revelation; yet, when discovered by revelation, apparently most
   agreeable to sound unprejudiced reason, have every one of them a
   natural tendency, and a direct and powerful influence to reform men's
   minds, and correct their manners, and do together make up an infinitely
   more consistent and rational scheme of belief than any that the wisest
   of the ancient philosophers ever did, or the cunningest of modern
   unbelievers can invent or contrive.

   1. Of the one supreme God. That there is one only living and true God,
   existing of himself, by the necessity of his own nature, absolutely
   independent, eternal, omnipresent, unchangeable, incorruptible, without
   body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, knowledge, and wisdom; of
   perfect liberty, and freedom of will; of infinite goodness, justice,
   and truth, and all other possible perfections; so as to be absolutely
   self-sufficient to his own infinite and unalterable happiness: This is
   not only the first and principal article of the Christian faith, but
   also the first and most evident truth that the light of nature itself
   teaches us, being clearly demonstrable, upon certain and undeniable
   principles of right reason.

   2. Of the only begotten son of God. That this supreme self-existent
   cause and father of all things did, before all ages, in an
   incomprehensible manner, by his almighty power and will, beget or
   produce a divine person, styled the Logos, the word, or wisdom, or son,
   of God; God, of God; [333] in whom dwells the fulness of Divine
   perfections, (excepting absolute supremacy, independency, or
   self-origination;) being the image of the invisible God, the Col. i.
   15. Heb. i. 3. Apaugasma tes doxes autou. John i. 2. xvii. 5. Heb. i.
   3. Rom. ix. 5. and John i. 1. brightness of his father's glory, and the
   express image of his person, having been in the beginning with God,
   partaker with him of his glory before the world was; the upholder of
   all things by the word of his power, and himself over all, (by
   communication of his father's glory and dominion) God blessed for ever:
   This doctrine (I say) though not indeed discoverable by bare reason,
   yet, when made known by revelation, appears plainly very consistent
   with right reason, and (it is manifest) contains nothing that implies
   any manner of absurdity or contradiction in it.

   Indeed, if any men, pretending to be wise above and beyond what is
   written, have at any time given such explications of the manner how the
   son of God derived his being from the father, or have offered such
   accounts of his nature and attributes, as can by any just and necessary
   consequence be reduced to imply or involve any contradiction, (which
   perhaps many of the schoolmen have but too justly been accused of
   doing,) [334] such explications are, without all controversy, false,
   and very injurious to religion. But as this doctrine is delivered in
   Scripture I think there is nothing in it in any degree contrary to
   right reason, as I have elsewhere endeavoured to show in a particular
   discourse, to which I refer the reader.

   Of the Holy Spirit. Now the same that is said of the son, may in like
   manner, with little variation, be, very agreeably to right reason,
   understood concerning the original procession or manner of derivation
   of the Holy Spirit likewise from the father.

   3. Of the creation of the universe. That the universe, the heavens, and
   the earth, and all things that are therein, were created and made by
   God, and this through the operation of his son, that divine word, or
   wisdom of the father, by whom Heb. i. 2. Eph. iii. 9. Col. i. 16. the
   Scripture says that God made the worlds, that by him God created all
   things, that by him were all things created that are in heaven and that
   are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or
   dominions, or principalities or powers; all things were created by him
   and for him, and he is before all John i. 3. things, and by him all
   things consist; that all things were made by him, and without him was
   not any thing made that was made: All this likewise is very agreeable
   to sound and unprejudiced reason. For that neither the whole, nor any
   part of the world; neither the form, nor motion, nor matter of the
   world, could exist of itself by any necessity in its own nature, is
   abundantly demonstrable from undeniable principles of reason, as has
   been shown in my former discourse: Consequently, both the whole world,
   and all the variety of things that now exist therein, must of necessity
   have received both their being itself, and also their form and manner
   of being, from God, the alone supreme and self-existent cause, and must
   needs depend upon his good pleasure every moment, for the continuance
   and preservation of that being. Accordingly, if we set aside the
   Epicureans, (whose absurd hypothesis has long since been given up even
   by all atheists themselves,) and some very few others, who with no less
   absurdity (as I have also at large shown) contended that the world was
   in its present form self-existent and necessary, all the philosophers
   of all ages, (even not excepting those who held the eternity of the
   world,) have unanimously agreed in this great truth, that the world
   evidently owes both its being and preservation to God, the supreme
   cause and author of all things. And then, that God made the world by
   the operation of his son, though this could not indeed be known
   certainly without express revelation; yet is it by no means incredible,
   or contrary to right reason. For, to the judgment of reason, it is one
   and the same thing, whether God made the world immediately by himself,
   or mediately by the ministration of a second principle. And what Plato
   and his followers have said concerning a second Nous or mind, whom they
   frequently stile Demiourgos the minister or workman by whom God framed
   all things, proves undeniably thus much at least, that the doctrines
   delivered in Scripture concerning this matter cannot be rejected as
   inconsistent and irreconcilable with right reason.

   4. Of the formation of the earth. Gen. i. 2. That, about the space of
   6000 years since, the earth was without form and void, that is, a
   confused chaos, out of which God framed this beautiful and useful
   fabric we now inhabit, and stocked it with the seeds of all kinds of
   plants, and formed upon it man, and all the other species of animals it
   is now furnished with, is also very agreeable to right reason. For
   though the precise time, indeed, when all this was done, could not now
   have been known exactly without revelation, yet even at this day there
   are remaining many considerable and very strong rational proofs, which
   make it exceedingly probable, (separate from the authority of
   revelation,) that this present frame and constitution of the earth
   cannot have been of a very much longer date. The universal tradition
   delivered down from all the most ancient nations of the world, both
   learned and barbarous; the constant and agreeing doctrine of all
   ancient philosophers and poets, concerning the earth's being formed
   within such a period of time, out of water or a chaos; the manifold
   absurdities and contradictions of those few accounts which pretend to a
   much greater antiquity; the number of men with which the earth is at
   present inhabited; the late original of learning and all useful arts
   and sciences; the impossibility that universal deluges, or other
   accidents, should at certain long periods have oft-times destroyed far
   the greatest part of mankind, with the memory of all former actions and
   inventions, and yet never have happened to destroy them all; the
   changes that must necessarily fall out naturally in the earth in vast
   length of time, by the sinking and washing down of mountains, the
   consumption of water by plants, and innumerable other such like
   accidents; these (I say) and many more arguments, drawn from nature,
   reason, and observation, make that account of the time of the earth's
   formation exceedingly probable in itself, which from the revelation
   delivered in Scripture-history we believe to be certain.

   5. Of the continual government of Providence. That the same God who
   created all things by the word of his power, and upholds and preserves
   them by his continual concourse, does also by his all-wise providence
   perpetually govern and direct the issues and events of things; takes
   care of this lower world, and of all, even the smallest things that are
   therein; disposes things in a regular order and succession in every
   age, from the beginning of the world to its final period; and inspects,
   with a more particular and special regard, the moral actions of men:
   This, as it is far more expressly, clearly, and constantly taught in
   Scripture than in any of the writings of the philosophers; so it is
   also highly agreeable to right and true reason: For, that an
   omnipresent and infinitely wise being cannot but know every thing that
   is done in every part of the universe, and with equal ease take notice
   of the minutest things as of the greatest; that an infinitely powerful
   being must needs govern and direct every thing in such manner, and to
   such ends, as he knows to be best and fittest in the whole; so far as
   is consistent with that liberty of will which he has made essential to
   all rational creatures; and that an infinitely just and good governor
   cannot but take more particular and exact notice of the moral actions
   of all his rational creatures, and how far they are conformable or not
   conformable to the rules he has set them; all this (I say) is most
   evidently agreeable to right reason, and as has been before shown,
   deducible from it.

   6. Of paradise, and the loss of it by sin. That God, after the
   formation of the earth, created man at first upright and innocent, and
   placed him in a happy and paradisiacal state, where he enjoyed plenty
   and abundance of all things without labour or sorrow; and that sin was
   the original cause, that now on the contrary the very ground is cursed
   andGen. iii. 17, 18, 19.barren for our sake, and in sorrow we eat of it
   all the days of our life, that thorns also and thistles are brought
   forth to us, and in the sweat of our face we eat bread, till we return
   unto the ground: This likewise is very reasonable and credible in
   itself, as appears, not only from the abstract consideration of the
   nature of the thing, but also from the general opinion that the ancient
   learnedest heathens entertained, upon very obscure and uncertain
   tradition, that the original state of man was innocent and simple, and
   the earth, whereon they dwelt, fruitful of itself, and abundant with
   all plenty; [335] but that God, for the sin of man, changed this happy
   constitution of things, and made labour necessary for the support of
   our lives.

   7. Of the flood. That in process of time, after the first entrance of
   sin into the world, men by degrees corrupted themselves more and more,
   till at length God, for the punishment of their sin and
   incorrigibleness, [336] brought upon them a general flood, which
   destroyed them all except a few persons, preserved for the restoration
   of the human race, is a truth delivered down to us, not only by
   authority of Scripture, but also by the concurrent testimony of almost
   all heathen philosophers and poets: And the histories of all nations
   backwards terminate in it; and, (which is the most remarkable thing of
   all, because it is a demonstrative and ocular proof of the universality
   of some such kind of dissolution,) the present visible frame and
   constitution of the earth throughout, the disposition and situation of
   the several strata of different kind of matter, whereof it is composed;
   the numberless shells of fishes, bones of other animals, and parts of
   all kinds of plants, which in every country and in almost every place
   are, at great variety of depths, found inclosed in earth, in clay, in
   stones, and in all sorts of matter; are such apparent demonstrations of
   the earth's having been in some former times, and perhaps more than
   once, (the whole surface of it at least) in a state of fluidity; that
   whosoever has seen the collections of this kind made by the very
   ingenious Dr Woodward and others, must in a manner abandon all use both
   of his senses and reason, if he can in the least doubt of this truth.

   8. Of God's revealing himself to the patriarchs, and giving the law to
   the Jews. That God, after the flood, made particular revelation of
   himself and of his will to the patriarchs, is a thing very credible in
   itself, for the same reasons that I have before shown, in general, that
   the expectation of some revelation from God was a reasonable and
   probable expectation. And that, after this, God should vouchsafe, by
   express revelation, to give a law to the whole nation of the Jews,
   consisting very much in sacrifices, and in external rites and
   ceremonious observances, cannot with any just reason be rejected as an
   incredible fact; if we consider that such a kind of institution was
   necessary, in those times and circumstances, to preserve that nation
   from the idolatry and worship of false gods, wherewith the countries
   around them were overspread; that those rites and ceremonies were
   typical of, and preparative to, a higher and more excellent
   dispensation; that the Jews were continually told by their prophets,
   that their observance of those rites and ceremonies was by no means so
   highly acceptable to God, nor so absolutely and indispensably insisted
   upon by him, as obedience to the moral law; and that the whole matter
   of fact, relating to that revelation, is delivered down to us in a
   history, on which the policy of a whole nation was founded, at a time
   when nobody could be ignorant of the truth of the principal facts, and
   concerning which we can now have no more reason to doubt than of any
   history of any ancient matter of fact in the world. The most
   considerable and real difficulty, viz. Why this favour was granted to
   that single nation only, and not to all the rest of the world likewise,
   is to be accounted for by the same reasons which prove (as has been
   before shown) that God was not obliged to make known the revelation of
   the gospel to all men alike.

   9. Of the other particulars of Scripture-history in the Old Testament.
   That all the other particulars of Scripture history contained in the
   Old Testament, are true relations of matter of fact, (not to insist now
   on the many arguments which prove in general the antiquity,
   genuineness, and authority of the books themselves,) will to a rational
   inquirer appear very credible from hence, that very many of the
   particular histories, and some even of the minuter circumstances also
   of those histories, are confirmed by concurrent testimonies of profane
   and unquestionably unprejudiced authors: Of which Grotius, in his
   excellent book of the truth of the Christian religion, [337] has given
   us a large collection: As particularly, that the manner of the
   formation of the earth out of a chaos is mentioned by the ancientest
   Phoenician, Egyptian, Indian and Greek historians; the very names of
   Adam and Eve, by Sanchuniathon and others; the longevity of the
   antediluvians, by Berosus and Manethos, and others; the ark of Noah, by
   Berosus; many particulars of the flood, by Ovid and others; the family
   of Noah, and two of every kind of animals entering into the ark with
   him, mentioned by Lucian himself, as a tradition of the ancient
   Grecians; the dove which Noah sent out of the ark, by Abydenus and
   Plutarch; [338] the building of Babel, by Abydenus, the burning of
   Sodom, by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, and Tacitus, and others; several
   particulars of the history of Abraham and the rest of the patriarchs,
   by Berosus and others; many particulars of Moses's life, by several
   ancient writers; the eminent piety of the most ancient Jews, by Strabo
   and Justin; [339] divers actions of David and Solomon, in the Phnician
   annals; some of the actions of Elijah, by Menander, and confessed by
   Julian himself; the history of Jonah, under the name of Hercules, by
   Lycophron and Æ neas Gazæus; and the histories of the following times,
   by many more authors. Besides that (as learned men have upon exceeding
   probable grounds supposed, [340] ) many of the most ancient
   scripture-histories are acknowledged and asserted in the writings of
   the poets, both Greeks and Latins; the true histories being couched
   under fictitious names and fabulous representations.

   10. Of God's sending his son into the world for the redemption of
   mankind. That God, in the fulness of time, that is, at that time which
   his infinite wisdom had fore-appointed, which all the ancient
   prophecies had determined, and which many concurrent circumstances in
   the state of the Jewish religion, and in the disposition of the Roman
   empire, had made a fit season for the reception and propagation of a
   new institution of religion; that God (I say) at that time, should send
   his only-begotten son, that word or wisdom of the father, that divine
   person by whom (as has been before shown) he created the world, and by
   whom he made all former particular manifestations of himself unto men,
   that he should send him, to take upon him our human nature, and therein
   to make a full and particular revelation of the will of God to mankind
   (who by sin had corrupted themselves and forfeited the favour of God,
   so that by the bare light of nature they could not discover any certain
   means by which they could be satisfactorily and absolutely secure of
   regaining that favour;) to preach unto men repentance and remission of
   sin; and by giving himself a sacrifice and expiation for sin, to
   declare the acceptableness of repentance, and the certainty of pardon
   thereupon, in a method evidently consistent with all necessary
   vindication of the honour and authority of the divine laws, and with
   God's irreconcileable hatred against sin; to be a mediator and
   intercessor between God and man, to procure the particular assistance
   of God's holy spirit which might be in men a new and effectual
   principle of a heavenly and divine life; in a word, to be the Saviour
   and judge of mankind, and finally to bring them to eternal life; all
   this, when clearly and expressly revealed, and by good testimony proved
   to be so revealed, is apparently agreeable and very credible to right
   and true reason. As (because it is the main and fundamental article of
   the Christian faith,) I shall endeavour to make out more largely and
   distinctly, by showing, in particular, that none of the several
   objections, upon which speculative unbelievers reject this doctrine, do
   at all prove any inconsistency in the belief of it, with sound and
   unprejudiced reason.

   That it is not unreasonable to suppose God making a revelation of his
   will to men. For, first, it cannot be thought unreasonable to be
   believed in the general, that God should make a revelation of his will
   to mankind, since, on the contrary, (as has been before proved at
   large,) it is very agreeable to the moral attributes of God, and to the
   notions and expectations of the wisest and most rational men that lived
   in the heathen world.

   That it is not unreasonable to believe, that God would appoint a
   sacrifice or expiation for sin. Secondly, it cannot be thought
   unreasonable to be believed, that in such a revelation, wherein God
   freely proclaims remission of sin, and the acceptableness of
   repentance, he should nevertheless have appointed such a sacrifice or
   expiation for sin, as might at the same time be a sufficient testimony
   of his irreconcilable hatred against it. For though, by the light of
   nature, it was indeed exceeding probable and to be hoped for that God
   would forgive sin upon true repentance, yet it could not be proved that
   he was absolutely obliged to do so, or that he would certainly do so.
   On the contrary, there was reason to suppose, that, in vindication of
   the honour and dignity of his laws, he would require some further
   satisfaction and expiation. And accordingly we find the custom of
   sacrificing to have prevailed universally over the heathen world in all
   ages; which, how unreasonable soever an expectation it was, to think
   that the blood of beasts could truly expiate sin, yet thus much it
   plainly and undeniably shows, that it has been the common apprehension
   of mankind, in all ages, that God would not be appeased, nor pardon
   sin, without some punishment and satisfaction; and yet at the same time
   they had good hopes, that, upon the repentance of sinners, God would
   accept some other satisfaction instead of the destruction of the
   offenders. It is therefore plainly agreeable to right reason, to
   believe that God, in vindication of the honour of his laws, and for a
   testimony of his hatred against sin, should appoint some sacrifice or
   expiation for sin, at the same time that he forgives the sinner upon
   his true repentance.

   Thirdly, That it is not unreasonable to believe, that a mediator should
   be appointed between God and man. It cannot be thought unreasonable to
   be believed, that a mediator or intercessor should be appointed between
   God and man, through and by whom the prayers of sinners may be offered
   up, so as to be acceptable in the sight of God. It is well known, the
   generality of the wisest heathens thought it agreeable to reason to
   make use of subordinate intelligences, demons or heroes, by whom they
   put up their prayers to the superior gods, hoping, that, by the
   mediation of those intercessors, the unworthiness of their own persons,
   and the defects of these prayers might be supplied, and they might
   obtain such merciful and gracious answers to their prayers as they
   could not presume to hope for upon their own account. Wherein though
   those pagans laboured indeed under very great uncertainty, in doing a
   thing for which they had no sufficient warrant, and in using mediators
   whom they neither knew distinctly to have any being, nor could they
   however have any good security that such mediation would be acceptable
   to the supreme God; yet, at the same time, this undeniably proves, that
   it is by no means inconsistent with right reason, to believe that a
   mediator may by divine authority be appointed between God and sinful
   men, to be their intercessor and advocate with a justly offended God.

   Fourthly, Of the objection drawn from the dignity of the person whom we
   believe to be our mediator and redeemer. The greatest real difficulty
   in this matter, to the judgment of right reason, seems to arise from
   the consideration of the dignity of the person whom we believe to have
   given himself a sacrifice and propitiation for the sins of mankind,
   viz. how it is possible, that the only-begotten son of God should be
   incarnate and become man; how it is conceivable that God should
   condescend so far as to send, and the son of God condescend willingly
   to be sent, and do such great things for his creatures; and, above all,
   how it is consistent with reason, to suppose God condescending to do so
   much for such frail and weak creatures as men, who, in all appearance
   seem to be but a very small, low, and inconsiderable part of the
   creation. And here indeed it must readily be acknowledged, that human
   reason could never have discovered such a method as this, for the
   reconciliation of sinners to an offended God without express
   revelation. But then neither, on the other side, when once this method
   is made known, is there any such difficulty or inconceivableness in it
   as can reasonably make a wise and considerate man call in question the
   truth of a well attested revelation, merely upon that account; which,
   indeed, any plain absurdity, or contradiction in the matter of a
   doctrine pretended to be revealed, would, it must be confessed,
   unavoidably do. For as to the possibility of the incarnation of the son
   of God, whatever mysteriousness there confessedly was in the manner of
   it, yet, as to the thing itself, there is evidently no more
   unreasonableness in believing the possibility of it, than in believing
   the union of our soul and body, or any other certain truth which we
   plainly see implies no contradiction in the thing itself, at the same
   time that we are sensible we cannot discover the manner how it is
   affected. Again, as to the incredibility of the doctrine, that God
   should make so great a condescension to his creatures, and that a
   person of such dignity as the only begotten son of God should vouchsafe
   to give himself a sacrifice for the sins of men: He that duly
   considers, how it is no diminution to the glory and greatness of the
   father of all things, to inspect, govern, and direct every thing by his
   all-wise providence through the whole creation; to take care even of
   the meanest of his creatures, so that not a sparrow falls to the
   ground, or a hair of our head perishes, without his knowledge; and to
   observe exactly every particle, even of inanimate matter in the
   universe; he (I say) who duly considers this, cannot with reason think
   it any real disparagement to the son of God, (though it was indeed a
   most wonderful and amazing instance of humility and condescension,)
   that he should concern himself so far for sinful men as to appear in
   their nature to reveal the will of God more clearly to them, to give
   himself a sacrifice and expiation for their sins, and to bring them to
   repentance and eternal life. The greatest enemies and deriders of
   Christianity have asserted things, far more incredible, to have been
   done upon far less occasions; witness what Julian the apostate [341]
   thought fit to believe concerning Æ sculapius's coming down from
   heaven, and conversing upon earth in a visible form, only to teach men
   the art of healing diseases. And modern unbelievers, who seem willing,
   in the contrary extreme, to deny God's having any regard, or taking any
   care in any respect, for the welfare and happiness of his creatures,
   are forced, if they will go about to give any account or explication of
   things, to invent much more incredible hypotheses, dishonourable to
   God, and utterly inconsistent with his divine attributes. Indeed, if we
   will consider things impartially, so far is it from being truly any
   diminution of the greatness and glory of God, to send his son into the
   world for the redemption and salvation of mankind, that, on the
   contrary, it is a means of bringing the very greatest honour to the
   laws and government of God that can be imagined. For what can be
   imagined more honourable, and worthy of the supreme lord and governor
   of all things, than to show forth his mercy and goodness, in forgiving
   the sins of frail and fallible creatures, and suffering himself to be
   reconciled to them upon their true repentance; and yet at the same time
   to cause such an expiation to be made for sin, by the sufferings and
   death of his own son, in their nature, as might be abundant evidences
   of his irreconcilable hatred against sin, a just vindication of the
   authority and dignity of his laws, and a sufficient and effectual
   warning to deter men from sin, to create in them the greatest dread and
   detestation of it, and for ever to terrify them from venturing upon
   wilful transgression and disobedience? It is true, no man can take upon
   him certainly to say, but God, by his absolute sovereignty and
   authority, might, if he had so pleased, have pardoned sin upon
   repentance, without any sacrifice or expiation at all. But this method
   of doing it by the death of Christ is more wise and fit, and evidently
   more proper and effectual to discountenance and prevent presumption, to
   discourage men from repeating their transgressions, to give them a deep
   sense of the heinous nature of sin, and to convince them of the
   excellency and importance of the laws of God, and the indispensable
   necessity of paying obedience to them; forasmuch as it shows us, that
   at the same time that God was willing to save the sinner, yet, lest
   encouragement should be given to sin by letting it go unpunished, he
   did not think fit to forgive the transgressions of men without great
   sufferings in our nature, and to put away the guilt of our sins but
   upon such difficult terms as the death of his own son. So that in this
   dispensation, justice, and mercy, and truth, are met together;
   righteousness and peace have kissed each other. And by how much the
   greater the dignity of the person was, who gave himself thus a
   sacrifice for the sins of men, of so much the greater weight and force
   is this argument to deter men for the future from sin, and to convince
   them of the necessity of obedience. Wherefore, so far is it from being
   true, that the consideration of the dignity of the person suffering is
   a real objection against the credibility of the doctrine, that, on the
   contrary, that very consideration contains the highest vindication
   imaginable of the greatness, and honour, and authority of the laws of
   God, and at the same time the greatest possible instance or expression
   of his mercy and compassion towards men, agreeable to our natural
   notions of his divine attributes. And then, as to the last part of this
   difficulty, viz. how it can be consistent with reason, to suppose God
   condescending to do so very great things for such mean and weak
   creatures, as men are, who in all appearance seem to be but a very
   small, low, and inconsiderable part of the creation; forasmuch as the
   whole earth itself is but a little spot, that bears no proportion at
   all to the universe; and in all probability of reason, the large and
   numberless orbs of heaven cannot but be supposed to be filled with
   beings more capable than we to show forth the praise and glory of their
   Almighty Creator, and more worthy to be the objects of his care and
   love. To this part of the difficulty, I say, the answer is very easy:
   That the mercy and love of the infinitely good God is extended equally
   over all his works; that, let the universe be supposed as large, and
   the rational creatures, with which it is furnished, as many and
   excellent as any one can imagine; yet mankind is plainly the chief,
   indeed the only inhabitant for whose sake it is evident this our globe
   of earth was formed into a habitable world; and this our earth is, as
   far as we have any means of judging, as considerable and worthy of the
   divine care as most other parts of the system; and this our system as
   considerable as any other single system in the universe; and finally,
   that, in like manner as the same divine providence, which presides over
   the whole creation, does particularly govern and direct every thing in
   this our lower world, as well as in every other particular part of the
   universe; so there is no real difficulty to right reason, in conceiving
   that the same divine logos, the word or messenger of the father, who,
   in various dispensations, according to the particular needs and
   exigencies of mankind, has made various manifestations of God, and
   discoveries of the divine will, to us here upon earth; may also, for
   ought we know, have to other beings, in other parts of the universe,
   according to their several capacities or wants, made different
   manifestations of God, and discoveries of his will, in ways of which we
   can know nothing, and in which we have no concern; there being nothing
   in this at all contrary to the nature of God, or the condition of
   things.

   Fifthly, Of the objection drawn from the Christian revelation not being
   in fact universal. and lastly, if any one thinks it unreasonable to be
   believed, that God should send his Son into the world for the
   redemption of mankind, and yet that this appearance of the Son of God
   upon earth should not be till the later ages of the world; and after he
   has appeared, yet his appearance not be made known equally to all
   nations; such a one must likewise, for the same reason, affirm, that it
   is unreasonable to believe the necessity and obligations even of
   natural religion itself, because it is plain all men are not furnished
   equally with the same capacities and opportunities of understanding
   those obligations, and consequently no deist can, consistently with his
   own principles, make this objection against the truth of Christianity.
   He must likewise, for the same reason, affirm, that God is obliged in
   all other respects also to make all his creatures equal; to make men
   angels; to indue all men with the same faculties and capacities as any,
   at least to make all men capable of the very same kind and the same
   degree of happiness, and to afford to all of them all the very same
   means or opportunities of obtaining it: In a word, he must assert that
   infinite wisdom cannot reasonably be supposed to have a right of making
   variety of creatures in very various circumstances; which is an
   assertion palpably most absurd, in experience false, and a very unjust
   diminution of God's sovereignty in the world. But besides, though the
   redemption purchased by the Son of God is not indeed actually made
   known unto all men, yet as no man ever denied but that the benefit of
   the death of Christ extended backwards to those who lived before his
   appearance in the world, so no man can prove but that the same benefit
   may likewise extend itself forwards to those who never heard of his
   appearance, though they lived after it.

   11. Of the other particulars of scripture-history contained in the New
   Testament. That the history of the life of Christ, contained in the New
   Testament, is a true relation of matters of fact, (not to insist here
   on the testimony of his disciples and followers, which shall be
   considered hereafter in its proper place,) will to a rational inquirer
   appear very credible from hence, that very many particulars of that
   history are confirmed by concurrent testimonies of profane and
   unquestionably unprejudiced authors. That, before the coming of our
   Saviour, there was a general expectation spread over all the eastern
   nations, that out of Judea should arise a person, who should he
   governor of the world, is expressly affirmed by the Roman historians,
   Suetonius [342] and Tacitus. [343] That there lived in Judea, at the
   time which the Gospel relates, such a person as Jesus of Nazareth, is
   acknowledged by all authors, both Jewish and pagan, who have written
   since that time. The star that appeared at his birth, and the journey
   of the Chaldæan wise men, is mentioned by Chalcidius the Platonist.
   [344] Herod's causing all the children in Bethlehem, under two years
   old to be slain, and a reflection made upon him on that occasion by the
   emperor Augustus, is related by Macrobius. [345] Many of the miracles
   that Jesus worked in his life-time are, as to matters of fact,
   (particularly, his healing the lame and the blind, and casting out
   devils,) expressly owned by the most implacable enemies of
   Christianity, by Celsus and Julian, [346] and the authors of the Jewish
   Talmud. And how the power of the heathen gods ceased after the coming
   of Christ is acknowledged by Porphyry, who attributes it to their being
   angry at the setting up of the Christian religion, which he styles
   impious and profane. Many particulars of the collateral history,
   concerning John Baptist, and Herod, and Pilate, (not to mention the
   famous testimony concerning Jesus himself, because it is by some
   suspected not to be genuine, notwithstanding it is found in all the
   ancient copies,) are largely recorded by Josephus. The crucifixion of
   Christ under Pontius Pilate, is related by Tacitus; [347] and divers of
   the most remarkable circumstances attending it, such as the earthquake
   and miraculous darkness, were recorded in the public Roman registers,
   [348] commonly appealed to by the first Christian writers, as what
   could not be denied by the adversaries themselves. Then, as to the
   resurrection and ascension of Christ; these depend on the general
   proofs of the credibility of his disciples' testimony, and other
   following evidences, which will be considered hereafter in their proper
   place.

   12. Of the day of judgment, and Christ the judge. That God has
   appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world in righteousness, by
   that person whom he has ordained, in order to reward every man
   according to his works; is a doctrine perfectly agreeable to right
   reason, and to our natural notions of the attributes of God; as may
   appear more particularly from what has been before said concerning the
   necessity and certainty of another life after this; and is evident from
   the opinion of all the wiser heathens concerning this matter. Nor may
   it perhaps be altogether impertinent to observe here, that the poets,
   both Greek and Latin, have unanimously agreed in this one particular
   circumstance, that men after death should not have judgment passed upon
   them immediately by God himself, but by just men appointed for that
   purpose.

   13. Of the resurrection of the body. That, in order to this final
   judgment, not only the soul shall survive the dissolution of the body,
   but the body itself also shall be raised again; this doctrine, though
   not indeed discoverable with any kind of certainty by the bare light of
   nature, because the belief of the soul's immortality (for ought that
   appears to reason alone) is sufficient to answer all the purposes of a
   future state, as far as is discoverable merely by the light of nature;
   yet this doctrine (I say) of the resurrection of the body, when made
   known by revelation, evidently contains nothing in it in the least
   contrary to right reason: For, what reasonable man can deny but that it
   is plainly altogether as easy for God to raise the body again after
   death as to create and form it at first? Some of the Stoical
   philosophers seem to have thought it not only possible, but even
   probable: [349] And many of the Jews, who had no express revelation
   concerning it, did yet believe it upon an ancient tradition, as appears
   from all their writings, and particularly from the translation in the
   last verse of the book of Job, which according to the Seventy runs
   thus: So Job died, being old and full of days, but it is written that
   he shall rise again with those whom the Lord raises up. [350] The only
   real difficulty in this doctrine seems to arise upon putting the
   supposition of one body's being turned into the nourishment, and
   becoming part of the substance of another, so as that the same parts
   may equally belong to two bodies, to both of which it shall
   nevertheless be absolutely impossible that the same parts should be
   restored. But this objection, as great and principal a difficulty as it
   is, is really but a great trifle. For there does not at all appear any
   absolute necessity, that, to constitute the same body, there must be an
   exact restitution of all and only the same parts. And if there was any
   such necessity; yet even still without making that hard supposition
   (which Grotius and others have done, [351] ) that God by a miraculous
   providence always interposes to prevent the parts of one human body
   from incorporating with and becoming the nourishment of another, (for I
   cannot see any sufficient ground to deny, but that it may be possible
   in nature for barbarous cannibals, if any such there be, to subsist for
   some time and live wholly one upon another, if deprived of all other
   sustenance;) without any such hard suppositions as these (I say,) it is
   easy to imagine many ways by which the resurrection of the same body,
   properly speaking, shall nevertheless be very possible; and the whole
   foundation of this, and all other difficulties of this kind, concerning
   the parts, and forms, and magnitudes, and proportions of our future
   bodies, be entirely taken away.

   Of the resurrection of the same body. As first, No man can say it is
   improbable, (and they who have been most and best versed in
   microscopical observations think it more than probable,) that the
   original stamina, which contain all and every one of the solid parts
   and vessels of the body, not excepting even the minutest nerves and
   fibres, are themselves the entire body, and that all the extraneous
   matter, which, coming in by way of nourishment, fills up and distends
   the minute and insensible vessels, of which all the visible and
   sensible vessels are composed, is not strictly and properly part of the
   body. Consequently, while all this extraneous matter, which serves only
   to swell the body to its just magnitude, is in continual flux, the
   original stamina may continue unchanged, and so no confusion of bodies
   will be possible in nature. There may be made many very considerable
   observations, concerning the determinate figure into which every
   respective body unfolds itself by growth; concerning the impossibility
   of the body's extending itself, by any nourishment whatsoever, beyond
   that certain magnitude to which the original vessels are capable of
   being unfolded; and concerning the impossibility of restoring by any
   nourishment any the smallest vessel or solid part of the body that has
   at any time happened to be mutilated by any accident; all which
   observations, often and carefully made, will seem very much to favour
   some such speculation as this.

   Secondly, It may also be supposed otherwise, not without good
   probability, that in like manner as in every grain of corn there is
   contained a minute insensible seminal principle, [352] which is itself
   the entire future blade and ear, and in due season, when all the rest
   of the grain is corrupted, evolves and unfolds itself visibly into that
   form; so our present mortal and corruptible body may be but the exuviæ,
   as it were of some hidden and at present insensible principle,
   (possibly the present seat of the soul,) which at the resurrection
   shall discover itself in its proper form. This way also, there can be
   no confusion of bodies possible in nature. And it is not without some
   weight that the ancientest writers of the church have always made use
   of this very similitude; that the apostle St Paul himself alleges the
   same comparison; and that the Jewish writers seem to have had some
   obscure glimpse of this notion, when they talked of a certain
   incorruptible part of the body; though these latter indeed explained
   themselves very weakly and unphilosophically.

   Many other ways perhaps may be imagined, by which the same thing may be
   explained intelligibly. But these speculations are nice and subtile,
   and neither needful nor proper to be enlarged upon in this place. Only
   the bare mention of them shows the manifold possibility of the doctrine
   of the resurrection, against the objections of those who would have it
   seem contradictory.

   14. Of the eternal happiness of the blessed, and the eternal punishment
   of the damned. Lastly, That after the resurrection and the general
   judgment, wherein every man shall be judged according to his works,
   they that have done well shall go into everlasting happiness, and they
   that have done evil, into everlasting punishment, is a doctrine in
   itself very credible, and reasonable to be believed. Concerning the
   everlasting happiness of the righteous there is no dispute, it being
   evident that God in his infinite bounty may reward the sincere
   obedience of his creatures, as much beyond the merit of their own weak
   and imperfect works, as he himself pleases. But the everlasting
   punishment threatened to the wicked has seemed to many a great
   difficulty; since it is certain, from our natural notions of the
   attributes of God, that no man shall be punished beyond the just
   demerit of his sins. Here, therefore, it is to be observed, first that
   no man can say, it is unreasonable that they who by wilful and stubborn
   disobedience to their almighty creator and most merciful benefactor,
   and by the habitual practice of unrepented wickedness, have, during the
   state of trial, made themselves unfit for the enjoyment of that
   happiness which God has prepared for them that love and obey him,
   should be eternally rejected, and excluded from it. Thus much, the
   wickedest of men are willing enough to believe: And if bare deprivation
   of happiness was all the punishment they had reason to fear, they would
   be well content to sit still in their wickedness. But is it at all
   agreeable to reason to believe, that the punishment to be inflicted by
   the final wrath of a provoked God upon his most obstinate and
   incorrigible enemies, should be merely such a thing as is in its own
   nature less dreadful and terrible than even those afflictions which by
   certain experience we see in this present life fall sometimes upon such
   persons with whom God is not angry at all? Is it agreeable to reason to
   believe, that God, who (as is evident by experience) suffers the very
   best of his own servants, for the punishment of their sins, or even
   only for the trial of their virtue, to fall sometimes under all the
   calamities and miseries which it is possible for the cruellest and most
   powerful tyrants to invent and execute, should punish his most
   obstinately rebellious and finally impenitent creatures, with nothing
   more than the negation of happiness? There must, therefore, in the next
   place be some sensible and positive punishment, besides the mere
   negative loss of happiness. And whoever seriously considers the
   dreadful effects of God's anger in this present world, in the instance
   of the general deluge, the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, the amazing
   calamities which befel the whole Jewish nation at the destruction of
   Jerusalem, and other such like examples; in some of which cases, the
   judgments have fallen upon mixed multitudes of good men and bad
   together; (not to mention the calamities which sometimes befal even
   good men by themselves;) whosoever, I say, seriously considers all
   this, cannot but frame to himself very terrible apprehensions of the
   greatness of that punishment which the despised patience of God shall
   finally inflict on the impenitently wicked and incorrigible, when they
   shall be separated and be by themselves. And then, as to the duration
   of this punishment, no man can presume, in our present state of
   ignorance and darkness, to be able truly to judge, barely by the
   strength of his own natural reason, what in this respect is or is not
   consistent with the wisdom, and justice, and goodness of the supreme
   governor of the world, since we neither know the place, nor kind, nor
   manner, nor circumstances, nor degrees, nor all the ends and uses of
   the final punishment of the wicked. Only this one thing we are certain
   of, that the justice of God will abundantly vindicate itself, and all
   mouths shall be stopped before him, and be forced to acknowledge the
   exact righteousness of all his judgments, and to condemn their own
   folly and wickedness; forasmuch as the degrees or intenseness of the
   punishment which shall be inflicted on the impenitent shall be exactly
   proportionate to their sins, as a recompense of their demerit, so that
   no man shall suffer more than he has deserved. [353] This being once
   clearly established, the difficulty about the duration of the
   punishment will not appear so insuperable to right reason: For nothing
   can be more evident than that God may justly banish the wicked
   eternally from his kingdom of glory, and from that happiness which is
   his free and undeserved gift to the righteous; and the positive
   punishment which shall be inflicted upon them in that state of eternal
   rejection shall undoubtedly be such, and so proportioned to men's
   deserts, as the righteous judge will then make appear before men and
   angels, to be just, and wise, and necessary, and such only as becomes
   the infinitely wise and good lord and governor of the universe to
   inflict. The wisest of the heathen philosophers, without the help of
   revelation, have taught, and did believe it agreeable to right reason,
   that the punishment of the incorrigible should be [aionios] without any
   determinate or known end; [354] and we cannot tell how many wise
   designs God may serve thereby. We know not but that as God has now
   discovered to us in some measure the fall and punishment of evil
   angels, to be a warning to us, so he may hereafter use the example of
   the punishment of wicked and incorrigible men, to be a means of
   preserving other beings in their obedience. And many other
   considerations there may possibly be, very necessary to enable us to
   judge rightly concerning this matter, which, in this present state, we
   have no sufficient means of coming to the knowledge of.

   Thus, all the credenda, or doctrines, which the Christian religion
   teaches; (that is, not only those plain doctrines which it requires to
   be believed as fundamental and of necessity to eternal salvation, but
   even all the doctrines which it teaches as matters of truth;) are, in
   the first place, though indeed many of them not discoverable by bare
   reason unassisted with revelation, yet, when discovered by revelation,
   apparently most agreeable to sound and unprejudiced reason. [355]

   Every one of them has a direct tendency and powerful influence to
   reform men's manners. In the next place, every one of these doctrines
   hasa natural tendency, and a direct and powerful influence to reform
   men's lives, and correct their manners. This is the great end and
   ultimate design of all true religion; and it is a very great and fatal
   mistake to think that any doctrine or any belief whatsoever can be any
   otherwise of any benefit to men, than as it is fitted to promote this
   main end. There was none of the doctrines of our Saviour, (as an
   excellent prelate of our church admirably expresses this matter [356] )
   calculated for the gratification of men's idle curiosities, the busying
   and amusing them with airy and useless speculations; much less were
   they intended for an exercise of our credulity, or a trial how far we
   could bring our reason to submit to our faith: But, as, on the one
   hand, they were plain and simple, and such as by their agreeableness to
   the rational faculties of mankind, did highly recommend themselves to
   our belief; so, on the other hand, they had an immediate relation to
   practice, and were the genuine principles and foundation upon which all
   human and divine virtues were naturally to be superstructed.
   Particularly, what can be a more necessary and excellent foundation of
   true religion than that doctrine which the Christian religion clearly
   and distinctly teaches us, concerning the nature and attributes of the
   one only true God, without any of that ambiguity and doubtfulness,
   those various and inconsistent opinions and conjectures, those
   uncertain and oft-times false reasonings concerning the nature of God,
   which, notwithstanding the natural possibility of discovering very many
   of the attributes of God by the light of true reason, did yet in fact
   overspread the greatest part of the heathen world with polytheism or
   atheism? What can be so certain a preservative against idolatry, and
   the worship of false gods, as the doctrine, that the universe, the
   heavens, and the earth, and all things contained therein, are the
   creatures and workmanship of the one true God, and have a continual
   dependence upon him for the preservation of their being? What can be so
   sure a ground of true piety and reliance upon God, as the clear
   Christian doctrine concerning providence, concerning God's perpetually
   governing and directing the issues and events of all things, and
   inspecting with a more especial regard the moral actions of men? Which
   doctrine was perplexed by the philosophers with endless disputes. What
   can be so just a vindication of the goodness of God, and consequently
   so necessary in order to our maintaining in our minds worthy and
   honourable notions concerning him, as the doctrine that God created man
   at first upright, and that the original of all evil and misery is sin?
   The want of a clear knowledge of which truth extremely perplexed the
   heathen world, and made many recur to that most absurd fiction of a
   self-existent evil principle. What can be a more proper motive to piety
   than the doctrine that the deluge and other remarkable calamities which
   have befallen mankind, were sent upon them by God's immediate
   direction, as punishments for their wickedness? What can be a greater
   encouragement to the practice of holiness, than the doctrine that God
   has at several times vouchsafed to make several particular revelations
   of his will to men, to instruct and support them more effectually in
   that practice? But above all, what doctrine could ever have been
   imagined so admirably fitted in all respects to promote all the ends of
   true religion, as that of the incarnation of the Son of God? Which way
   could men have been filled with so deep a sense of the mercy and love
   of God towards them, and have been instructed in all divine truths in a
   method so well accommodated to their present infirmities, as by God's
   sending his only-begotten Son, to take upon him our nature, and therein
   to make a general revelation of the will of God to mankind? How could
   the honour, and dignity, and authority of the laws of God have been so
   effectually vindicated, and at the same time so satisfactory an
   assurance of pardon upon true repentance have been given unto men, as
   by this method of the son of God giving himself a sacrifice and
   expiation for sin? What could have been a more glorious manifestation
   of the mercy and compassion of God, and at the same time a more
   powerful means to discountenance men's presumption, to discourage them
   from repeating their transgressions, to give them a deep sense of the
   heinous nature of sin, and of God's extreme hatred and utter
   irreconcilableness to it, and to convince them of the excellency and
   importance of the laws of God, and the indispensable necessity of
   paying obedience to them, than this expedient of saving sinners by the
   sufferings and death of the son of God, and by establishing with them a
   new and gracious covenant upon the merits of that satisfaction? How
   could men be better encouraged to begin a religious life, than by
   having such a mediator, advocate, and intercessor for them with God, to
   obtain pardon of all their frailties, and by being assured of the
   assistance of the Spirit of God, to enable them to conquer all their
   corrupt affections, and to be in them an effectual principle of a
   heavenly and divine life? In fine, what stronger and more powerful
   motives could possibly have been contrived to persuade men to live
   virtuously, and to deter them from vice, than the clear discovery made
   to us in the gospel of God's having appointed a day, wherein he will
   judge the world in righteousness, every man according to his works, and
   that they who have done well shall be adjudged to everlasting
   happiness, and they that have done evil to endless punishment; of which
   the light of nature afforded men but obscure glimpses? And may we not
   here, upon the whole, appeal now even to our adversaries themselves,
   whether, in all and every one of these doctrines, there be not a more
   powerful, a more effectual method laid down, for the reforming human
   nature, and obliging the whole world to forsake their sins, and to lead
   holy and virtuous lives, than was ever taught before; nay, or than was
   possible to have been contrived by all the wit of mankind? This is the
   great and highest recommendation of the Christian doctrine; this is
   what to a well disposed mind would well nigh satisfactorily prove, even
   without the addition of any external testimony, that the revelation of
   Christianity could not possibly but come from God, seeing that not only
   all its practical precepts, but even all its articles of belief also,
   tend plainly to this one and the same end, to make men universally
   amend and reform their lives, to recover and restore them to their
   original excellent state, from the corruption and misery which had been
   introduced by sin, and to establish upon earth the practice of
   everlasting righteousness, and entire and hearty obedience to the will
   of God; which would have been the religion of men (had they continued
   innocent) in paradise, and now is the religion of angels, and for ever
   will be the religion of saints in heaven. Vain men may value themselves
   upon their speculative knowledge, right opinions, and true and orthodox
   belief, separate from the practice of virtue and righteousness; but as
   sure as the gospel is true, no belief whatsoever shall finally be of
   any advantage to men, any otherwise than only so far as it corrects
   their practice, hinders them from being workers of iniquity, and makes
   them likeLuke, xiii. 7. unto God.

   Lastly, And all of them together make up the most consistent and
   rational scheme of belief in the world. all the doctrines of the
   Christian faith do together make up an infinitely more consistent and
   rational scheme of belief than any that the wisest of the ancient
   philosophers ever did, or the cunningest of modern unbelievers can
   invent or contrive. This is evident from a summary view of the
   fore-mentioned scheme of the Christian doctrines, wherein every article
   has a just dependence on the foregoing ones, and a close connexion with
   those that follow; and the whole account of the order and disposition
   of things, from the original to the consummation of all things, is one
   entire, regular, complete, consistent, and every way a most rational
   scheme: Whereas the wisest of the ancient philosophers, that is, those
   of them who hit upon the greatest number of single truths, and taught
   the fewest absurdities, were yet never able to make out any universal,
   entire, and coherent system of doctrines, [357] and scheme of the whole
   state of things, with any manner of probability: And the cunningest of
   modern deists, (besides that they must needs, in their own way, believe
   some particular things stranger, and in themselves more incredible,
   than any of the fore-mentioned Christian doctrines,) cannot, in the
   whole, as has been before shown, frame to themselves any fixed and
   settled principles upon which to argue consistently; but must
   unavoidably either be perplexed with inextricable absurdities, or
   confessedly recur to downright atheism. There have indeed, even among
   Christians themselves, been many differences and disputes about
   particular doctrines: (But, excepting such as have intolerably
   corrupted the very fundamental doctrines, and even the main design
   itself of the whole Christian dispensation; of which there are too many
   instances in writers of the Romish church especially;) these disputes
   among Christians have not been, like those among the philosophers, de
   rerum summa, concerning the whole scheme and system of things, but only
   concerning particular explications of particular doctrines; which kind
   of disputes do not at all affect the certainty of the whole religion
   itself, [358] nor ought in reason to be any manner of hindrance to the
   effect which the plain and weighter, and confessedly more important
   fundamental doctrines ought to have upon the hearts and lives of men.

Proposition XIV.

   XIV. Proposition XIV. Fifthly, As this revelation, to the judgment of
   right and sober reason, appears of itself highly credible and probable,
   and abundantly recommends itself in its native simplicity, merely by
   its own intrinsic goodness and excellency, to the practice of the most
   rational and considering men, who are desirous in all their actions to
   have satisfaction and comfort and good hope within themselves, from the
   conscience of what they do: So it is moreover positively and directly
   proved to be actually and immediately sent to us from God, by the many
   infallible signs and miracles which the author of it worked publicly as
   the evidence of his divine commission, by the exact completion both of
   the prophecies that went before concerning him, and of those that he
   himself delivered concerning things that were to happen after; and by
   the testimony of his followers, which in all its circumstances was the
   most credible, certain, and convincing evidence, that was ever given to
   any matter of fact in the world.

   First, The Christian revelation is positively and directly proved to be
   actually and immediately sent to us from God, by the many infallible
   signs and miracles which the author of it worked publicly as the
   evidence of his divine commission.

   Of the life and character of our Saviour, as an evidence of the truth
   of the Christian revelation. Besides the great excellency and
   reasonableness of the doctrine considered in itself, of which I have
   already treated, it is here of no small moment to observe, that the
   author of it (separate from all external proof of his divine
   commission) appeared in all his behaviour, words, and actions, to be
   neither an impostor nor an enthusiast. [359] His life was innocent and
   spotless, spent entirely in serving the ends of holiness and charity,
   in doing good to the souls and bodies of men, in exhorting them to
   repentance, and inviting them to serve and glorify God. When his
   bitterest enemies accused him, in order to take away his life, they
   could not charge him with any appearance of vice or immorality. And so
   far was he from being guilty of what they did accuse him of, namely, of
   vain-glory and attempting to move sedition, that once, when the
   admiring people would by force have taken him and made him their king,
   he chose even to work a miracle to avoid that, which was the only thing
   that could be imagined to have been the design of an impostor. In like
   manner, whoever seriously considers the answers he gave to all
   questions whether moral or captious, his occasional discourses to his
   disciples, and more especially the wisdom and excellency of his sermon
   upon the mount, which is as it were the system and summary of his
   doctrine, manifestly surpassing all the moral instructions of the most
   celebrated philosophers that ever lived; cannot, without the extremest
   malice and obstinacy in the world, charge him with enthusiasm.

   Of the miracles of Christ as the evidence of his divine commission.
   These considerations cannot but add great weight and authority to his
   doctrine, and make his own testimony concerning himself exceedingly
   credible. But the positive and direct proof of his divine commission
   are the miracles which he worked for that purpose; his healing the
   sick,--his giving sight to the blind,--his casting out devils,--his
   raising the dead,--the wonders that attended his crucifixion,--his own
   resurrection from the dead,--his appearance afterwards to his
   disciples,--and his ascension visibly into heaven.

   These, and the rest of his stupendous miracles, were, to the disciples
   that saw them, sensible demonstrations of our Lord's divine commission:
   And to those who have lived since that age, they are as certain
   demonstrations of the same truth, as the testimony of those first
   disciples, who were eye-witnesses of them, is certain and true.

   To the disciples that saw them, these miracles were sensible and
   complete demonstrations of our Lord's divine commission, because they
   were so great, and so many, and so public, and so evident, that it was
   absolutely impossible they should be the effect of any art of man, of
   any chance, or fallacy; and the doctrine they were brought to confirm
   was of so good and holy a tendency, that it was impossible he should be
   enabled to work them by the power and assistance of evil spirits; so
   that, consequently, they must of necessity have been performed, either
   immediately or mediately by God himself.

   Of miracles in general. But here, because there have been many
   questions raised, and some perplexity introduced by the disputes and
   different opinions of learned men, concerning the power of working
   miracles, and concerning the extent of the evidence which miracles give
   to the truth of any doctrine, and because it hath been much
   controverted, whether true miracles can be worked by any less power
   than the immediate power of God; and whether, to complete the evidence
   of a miracle, the nature of the doctrine pretended to be proved thereby
   is requisite to be taken into the consideration or no; it may not
   perhaps be improper, upon this occasion, to endeavour to set this whole
   matter in its true light, as briefly and clearly as I can.

   1st, That in respect of the power of God, all things are alike easy.
   then; In respect of the power of God, and in respect to the nature of
   the things themselves, absolutely speaking, all things that are
   possible at all, that is, which imply not a direct contradiction, are
   equally and alike easy to be done. The power of God extends equally to
   great things as to small, and to many as to few; and the one makes no
   more difficulty at all, or resistance to his will, than the other.

   That therefore miracles ought not to be defined by any absolute
   difficulty in the nature of the things themselves to be done. It is not
   therefore a right distinction to define or distinguish a miracle by any
   absolute difficulty in the nature of the thing itself to be done; as if
   the things we call natural were absolutely and in their own nature
   easier to be effected, than those that we look upon as miraculous; on
   the contrary, it is evident and undeniable, that it is at least as
   great an act of power to cause the sun or a planet to move at all, as
   to cause it to stand still at any time: Yet this latter we call a
   miracle; the former not. And to restore the dead to life, which is an
   instance of an extraordinary miracle, is in itself plainly altogether
   as easy as to dispose matter at first into such order as to form a
   human body in that which we commonly call a natural way. So that,
   absolutely speaking, in this strict and philosophical sense, either
   nothing is miraculous, namely, if we have respect to the power of God;
   or, if we regard our own power and understanding, then almost every
   thing, as well what we call natural, as what we call supernatural, is
   in this sense really miraculous; and it is only usualness or
   unusualness that makes the distinction.

   2. What degrees of power God may have communicated to created beings is
   not possible for us to determine. What degrees of power God may
   reasonably be supposed to have communicated to created beings, to
   subordinate intelligences, to good or evil angels, is by no means
   possible for us to determine. Some things absolutely impossible for men
   to effect, it is evident may easily be within the natural powers of
   angels; and some things beyond the power of inferior angels may as
   easily be supposed to be within the natural power of others that are
   superior to them; and so on. So that, (unless we knew the limit of
   communicable and incommunicable power) we can hardly affirm, with any
   certainty, that any particular effect, how great or miraculous soever
   it may seem to us, is beyond the power of all created beings in the
   universe to have produced.

   That therefore a miracle is not rightly defined to be such an effect as
   could not have been produced by any less power than the divine
   omnipotence. It is not therefore a right distinction to define a
   miracle (as some very learned and very pious men have done,) to be such
   an effect as could not have been produced by any less power than the
   divine omnipotence. There is no instance of any miracle in scripture,
   which, to an ordinary spectator, would necessarily imply the immediate
   operation of original, absolute, and underived power: And consequently
   such a spectator could never be certain that the miraculous effect was
   beyond the power of all created beings in the universe to produce.
   There is one supposition, indeed, upon which the opinion of all
   miracles being necessarily the immediate effects of the divine
   omnipotence, may be defended; and that is, if God, together with the
   natural powers wherewith he hath indued all subordinate intelligent
   beings, has likewise given a law, or restraint, whereby they be
   hindered from ever interposing in this lower world, to produce any of
   those effects which we call miraculous or supernatural: But then, how
   certain soever it is, that all created beings are under some particular
   laws and restraints, yet it can never be proved that they are under
   such restraints universally, perpetually, and without exception: And,
   without this, a spectator that sees a miracle can never be certain that
   it was not done by some created intelligence. Reducing the natural
   power of created beings to as low a degree as any one can desire to
   suppose, will help nothing in this matter; for, supposing (which is
   very unreasonable to suppose) that the natural powers of the highest
   angels were no greater than the natural powers of men, yet, since
   thereby an angel would be enabled to do all that invisibly, which a man
   can do visibly, he would even in this supposition be naturally able to
   do numberless things which we should esteem the greatest of miracles.

   3. All things that are done in the world, are done either immediately
   by God himself, or by created intelligent beings; matter being capable
   of no laws or powers. And consequently there is, properly speaking, no
   such thing as the course or power of nature. All things that are done
   in the world are done either immediately by God himself, or by created
   intelligent beings; matter being evidently not at all capable of any
   laws or powers whatsoever, any more than it is capable of intelligence,
   excepting only this one negative power, that every part of it will, of
   itself, always and necessarily continue in that state, whether of rest
   or motion, wherein it at present is; so that all those things which we
   commonly say are the effects of the natural powers of matter and laws
   of motion, of gravitation, attraction, or the like, are indeed (if we
   will speak strictly and properly) the effects of God's acting upon
   matter continually and every moment, either immediately by himself, or
   mediately by some created intelligent beings: (Which observation, by
   the way, furnishes us, as has been before noted, with an excellent
   natural demonstration of Providence.) Consequently, there is no such
   thing as what men commonly call the course of nature, or the power of
   nature. The course of nature, truly and properly speaking, is nothing
   else but the will of God producing certain effects in a continued,
   regular, constant, and uniform manner; which course or manner of acting
   being in every moment perfectly arbitrary, is as easy to be altered at
   any time as to be preserved. And if (as seems most probable,) this
   continual acting upon matter be performed by the subserviency of
   created intelligences appointed to that purpose by the supreme Creator,
   then it is as easy for any of them, and as much within their natural
   power, (by the permission of God,) to alter the course of nature at any
   time, or in any respect, as to preserve or continue it.

   That therefore a miracle is not rightly defined to be that which is
   against the course of nature or above the natural powers of created
   agents. It is not therefore a right distinction to define a miracle to
   be that which is against the course of nature, meaning, by the course
   of nature, the power of nature or the natural powers of created agents;
   for, in this sense, it is no more against the course of nature for an
   angel to keep a man from sinking in the water, than for a man to hold a
   stone from falling in the air by overpowering the law of gravitation;
   and yet the one is a miracle, the other not so. In like manner, it is
   no more above the natural power of a created intelligence to stop the
   motion of the sun or of a planet, than to continue to carry it on in
   its usual course; and yet the former is a miracle, the latter not so:
   But, if by the course of nature, be meant only (as it truly signifies)
   the constant and uniform manner of God's acting, either immediately or
   mediately, in preserving and continuing the order of the world, then,
   in that sense, indeed, a miracle may be rightly defined to be an effect
   produced contrary to the usual course or order of nature, by the
   unusual interposition of some intelligent being superior to men, as I
   shall have occasion presently to observe more particularly.

   The unreasonableness of those who deny the possibility of miracles in
   general. And from this observation we may easily discover the vanity
   and unreasonableness of that obstinate prejudice which modern deists
   have universally taken up against the belief of miracles in general:
   They see that things generally go on in a constant and regular method;
   that the frame and order of the world is preserved by things being
   disposed and managed in an uniform manner; that certain causes produce
   certain effects in a continued succession according to certain fixed
   laws or rules; and from hence they conclude, very weakly and
   unphilosophically, that there are in matter certain necessary laws or
   powers, the result of which is that which they call the course of
   nature, which they think is impossible to be changed or altered, and
   consequently, that there can be no such thing as miracles: Whereas, on
   the contrary, if they would consider things duly, they could not but
   see that dull and lifeless matter is utterly incapable of obeying any
   laws, or of being indued with any powers; and that, therefore, that
   order and disposition of things, which they vulgarly call the course of
   nature, cannot possibly be any thing else but the arbitrary will and
   pleasure of God exerting itself and acting upon matter continually,
   either immediately by itself, or mediately by some subordinate
   intelligent agents, according to certain rules of uniformity and
   proportion, fixed indeed, and constant, but which yet are made such
   merely by arbitrary constitution, not by any sort of necessity in the
   things themselves, as has been abundantly proved in my former
   discourse: And, consequently, it cannot be denied, but that it is
   altogether as easy to alter the course of nature as to preserve it;
   that is, that miracles, excepting only that they are more unusual, are
   in themselves, and in the nature and reason of the thing, as credible
   in all respects, and as easy to be believed, as any of those we call
   natural effects.

   4. Some effects prove the constant providence of God, and others prove
   the occasional interposition either of God himself, or of some
   intelligent being superior to man. Those effects which are produced in
   the world regularly and constantly, which we call the works of nature,
   prove to us, in general, the being, the power, and the other attributes
   of God. Those effects, which upon any rare and extraordinary occasion,
   are produced in such manner that it is manifest they could neither have
   been done by any power or art of man, nor by what we call chance, that
   is, by any composition or result of those laws which are God's constant
   and uniform actings upon matter, these undeniably prove to us the
   immediate and occasional interposition either of God himself, or at
   least of some intelligent agent superior to men, at that particular
   time, and on that particular account. For instance, the regular and
   continued effects of the power of gravitation, and of the laws of
   motion; of the mechanic, and of the animal powers; all these prove to
   us, in general, the being, the power, the presence, and the constant
   operation, either immediate or mediate, of God in the world. But if,
   upon any particular occasion, we should see a stone suspended in the
   air, or a man walking upon the water, without any visible support, a
   chronical disease cured by a word speaking, or a dead and corrupted
   body restored to life in a moment; we could not then doubt but there
   was an extraordinary interposition either of God himself, in order to
   signify his pleasure upon that particular occasion, or at least of some
   intelligent agent far superior to man, in order to bring about some
   particular design.

   5. Whether such interposition be the immediate work of God, or of some
   good or evil angels, can hardly be discovered merely by the work
   itself. Whether such an extraordinary interposition of some power
   superior to men be the immediate interposition of God himself, or of
   some good angel, or of some evil angel, can hardly be distinguished
   certainly, merely by the work or miracle itself; because it is
   impossible for us to know, with any certainty, either that the natural
   power of good angels, or of evil ones, extends not beyond such or such
   a certain limit, or that God always restrains them from exercising
   their natural powers in producing such or such particular effects.

   That there is no reason to suppose all the wonders worked by evil
   spirits to be mere delusions. It is not therefore a right distinction,
   to suppose the wonders which the scripture attributes to evil spirits,
   to be mere præstigiæ, sleights, or delusions. For if the devil has any
   natural power of doing any thing at all, even but so much as the
   meanest of men, and be not restrained by God from exercising that
   natural power, it is evident he will be able, by reason of his
   invisibility, to work true and real miracles. Neither is it a right
   distinction to suppose the miracles of evil spirits not to be real
   effects in the things where they appear, but impositions upon the
   senses of the spectators; for, to impose in this manner upon the senses
   of men, (not by sleights and delusions, but by really so affecting the
   organs of sense as to make things appear what they are not;) is to all
   intents and purposes a true a miracle, and as great an one, as making
   real changes in the things themselves.

   6. How we are to distinguish miracles worked by God, for the proof of
   any doctrine, from the frauds of evil spirits. When therefore, upon any
   particular occasion, for instance, when at the will of a person who
   teaches some new doctrine as coming from God, and in testimony to the
   truth of that doctrine, there is plainly and manifestly an
   interposition of some superior power producing such miraculous effects
   as have been before mentioned; the only possible ways by which a
   spectator may certainly and infallibly distinguish whether those
   miracles be indeed the works, either immediately of God himself, or
   (which is the very same thing,) of some good angel employed by him,
   and, consequently, the doctrine witnessed by the miracles be infallibly
   true and divinely attested; or whether, on the contrary, the miracles
   be the works of evil spirits, and consequently the doctrine a fraud and
   imposition upon men: The only possible ways (I say) of distinguishing
   this matter certainly and infallibly, are these:--If the doctrine
   attested by miracles be in itself impious, or manifestly tending to
   promote vice, then, without all question, the miracles, how great
   soever they may appear to us, are neither worked by God himself, nor by
   his commission; because our natural knowledge of the attributes of God,
   and of the necessary difference between good and evil, is greatly of
   more force to prove any such doctrine to be false than any miracles in
   the world can be to prove it true: As, for example, suppose a man,
   pretending to be a prophet, should work any miracle, or give any sign
   or wonder whatsoever, in order to draw men from the worship of the true
   God, and tempt them to idolatry, and to the practice of such vices as
   in all heathen nations have usually attended the worship of false Gods,
   nothing can be more infallibly certain, than that such miracles ought
   at first sight to be rejected as diabolical. If the Deut. xiii. 1, &c.
   doctrine attested by miracles be in itself indifferent, that is, such
   as cannot by the light of nature and right reason alone, be certainly
   known whether it be true or false; and, at the same time, in opposition
   to it, and in proof of the direct contrary doctrine, there be worked
   other miracles, more and greater than the former, or at least attended
   with such circumstances as evidently show the power by which these
   latter are worked to be superior to the power that worked the former;
   then that doctrine which is attested by the superior power must
   necessarily be believed to be divine: This was the case of Moses and
   the Egyptian magicians. The magicians worked several miracles to prove
   that Moses was an impostor, and not sent of God; Moses, to prove his
   divine commission, worked miracles more and greater than theirs, or
   else (which is the very same thing,) the power by which he worked his
   miracles restrained the power by which they worked theirs, from being
   able at that time to work all the same miracles that he did; and so
   appeared evidently the superior power: Wherefore, it was necessarily to
   be believed that Moses's commission was truly from God. If, in the last
   place, the doctrine attested by miracles be such as, in its own nature
   and consequences, tends to promote the honour and glory of God and the
   practice of universal righteousness amongst men, and yet, nevertheless,
   be not in itself demonstrable, nor could, without revelation, have been
   discovered to be actually true, (or even if it was but only indifferent
   in itself, and such as could not be proved to be any way contrary to or
   inconsistent with these great ends,) and there be no pretence of more
   or greater miracles on the opposite side to contradict it; (which is
   the case of the doctrine and miracles of Christ;) then the miracles are
   unquestionably divine, and the doctrine must, without all controversy,
   be acknowledged as an immediate and infallible revelation from God:
   Matt. xii. 25. Because, (besides that it cannot be supposed that evil
   spirits would overthrow their own power and kingdom,) should God, in
   such cases as these, permit evil spirits to work miracles to impose
   upon men, the error would be absolutely invincible; and that would, in
   all respects, be the very same thing as if God worked the miracles to
   deceive men himself. No man can doubt but evil spirits, if they have
   any natural powers at all, have power to destroy men's bodies and
   lives, and to bring upon men innumerable other calamities; which yet,
   in fact, it is evident God restrains them from doing, by having set
   them laws and bounds which they cannot pass. Now, for the very same
   reason, it is infinitely certain that God restrains them likewise from
   imposing upon men's minds and understandings, in all such cases where
   wise, and honest, and virtuous men would have no possible way left by
   which they could discover the imposition.

   The difference between those who teach that the immediate power of God
   is, or is not, necessarily requisite to the working of a miracle, is
   not very great at bottom. And here at last the difference between those
   who believe that all miracles necessarily require the immediate power
   of God himself to effect them, and those who believe created spirits
   able to work miracles, is not very great. They who believe all miracles
   to be effected only by the immediate power of God, must do it upon this
   ground, that they suppose God, by a perpetual law, restrains all
   subordinate intelligent agents from interposing at any time to alter
   the regular course of things in this lower world; (for, to say that
   created spirits have not otherwise a natural power, when unrestrained,
   to do what we call miracles, is saying that those invisible agents have
   no power naturally to do any thing at all.) And they who believe that
   subordinate beings have power to work miracles must yet of necessity
   suppose that God restrains them in all such cases at least where there
   would not be sufficient marks left, by which the frauds of evil spirits
   could be clearly distinguished from the testimony and commission of
   God.

   And now, from these few clear and undeniablo propositions, it evidently
   follows;--

   1st. The true definition of a miracle: That the true definition of a
   miracle, in the theological sense of the word, is this--that it is a
   work effected in a manner unusual or different from the common and
   regular method of providence, by the interposition either of God
   himself, or of some intelligent agent superior to man, for the proof or
   evidence of some particular doctrine, or in attestation to the
   authority of some particular person. And if a miracle so worked be not
   opposed by some plainly superior power; nor be brought to attest a
   doctrine either contradictory in itself, or vicious in its
   consequences, (a doctrine of which kind no miracles in the world can be
   sufficient to prove;) then the doctrine so attested must necessarily be
   looked upon as divine, and the worker of the miracle entertained as
   having infallibly a commission from God.

   2. The strength of the evidence of our Saviour's miracles. From hence
   it appears, that the complete demonstration of our Saviour's being a
   teacher sent from God, was, to the disciples who saw his miracles,
   plainly this: That the doctrine he taught, being in itself possible,
   and in its consequences tending to promote the honour of God and true
   righteousness among men; and the miracles he worked being such that
   there neither was nor could be any pretence of more or greater miracles
   to be set up in opposition to them,--it was as infallibly certain that
   he had truly a divine commission as it was certain that God would not
   himself impose upon men a necessary and invincible error.

   3. Concerning the objection, that we prove in a circle the miracles by
   the doctrine, and the doctrine by the miracles. From hence it appears,
   how little reason there is to object, as some have done, that we prove
   in a circle the doctrine by the miracles, and the miracles by the
   doctrine. For the miracles, in this way of reasoning, are not at all
   proved by the doctrine; but only the possibility and the good tendency,
   or at least the indifferency of the doctrine, is a necessary condition
   or circumstance, without which the doctrine is not capable of being
   proved by any miracles. It is indeed the miracles only that prove the
   doctrine, and not the doctrine that proves the miracles; but then, in
   order to this end, that the miracles may prove the doctrine, it is
   always necessarily to be first supposed that the doctrine be such as is
   in its nature capable of being proved by miracles. The doctrine must be
   in itself possible and capable to be proved, and then miracles will
   prove it to be actually and certainly true. The doctrine is not first
   known, or supposed to be true, and then the miracles proved by it; but
   the doctrine must be first known to be such as is possible to be true,
   and then miracles will prove that it actually is so. Some doctrines
   are, in their own nature, necessarily and demonstrably true, such as
   are all those which concern the obligation of plain moral precepts; and
   these neither need nor can receive any stronger proof from miracles
   than what they have already (though not perhaps so clearly indeed to
   all capacities,) from the evidence of right reason. Other doctrines are
   in their own nature necessarily false and impossible to be true; such
   as are all absurdities and contradictions, and all doctrines that tend
   to promote vice; and these can never receive any degree of proof from
   all the miracles in the world. Lastly, other doctrines are in their own
   nature indifferent, or possible, or perhaps probable to be true; and
   these could not have been known to be positively true, but by the
   evidence of miracles, which prove them to be certain. To apply this to
   the doctrine and miracles of Christ. The moral part of our Saviour's
   doctrine would have appeared infallibly true, whether he had ever
   worked any miracles or no. The rest of his doctrine was what evidently
   tended to promote the honour of God, and the practice of righteousness
   amongst men: Therefore that part also of his doctrine was possible and
   very probable to be true; but yet it could not from thence be known to
   be certainly true, nor ought to have been received as a revelation from
   God, unless it had been proved by undeniable miracles. And the miracles
   he worked did indeed undeniably prove it to be the doctrine of God.
   Nevertheless, had his doctrine in any part of it been either absurd and
   contradictory in itself, or vicious in its tendency and consequences,
   no miracles could then possibly have proved it to have been true. It is
   evident therefore that the nature of the doctrine to be proved must be
   taken into the consideration, as a necessary circumstance; and yet that
   only the miracles are properly the proof of the doctrine, and not the
   doctrine of the miracles.

   4. Of the pretended miracles of Apollonius and others. From hence it
   follows, that the pretended miracles of Apollonius Tyaneus, Aristeas
   Proconnesius, and some few others among the heathens, even supposing
   them to have been true miracles, (which yet there is no reason at all
   to believe, because they are very poorly attested, and are in
   themselves very mean and trifling, as has been fully shown by Eusebius
   in his book against Hierocles, and by many late writers; but supposing
   them, I say, to have been true miracles,) yet they will prove nothing
   at all to the disadvantage of Christianity: Because they were worked
   either without any pretence of confirming any new doctrine at all; or
   else to prove absurd and foolish things; or to establish idolatry and
   the worship of false Gods; and consequently they could not be done by
   the divine power and authority, nor bear any kind of comparison with
   the miracles of Christ, [360] which were worked to attest a doctrine
   that tended in the highest degree to promote the honour of God and the
   general reformation of mankind.

   To return therefore to the argument. The miracles (I say) which our
   Saviour worked were, to the disciples that saw them, sensible
   demonstration of his divine commission. And to those who have lived
   since that age they are as certain demonstrations of the same truth as
   the testimony of those first disciples, who were eye-witnesses of them,
   is certain and true: Which I shall have occasion to consider presently.

   Secondly. Of the fulfilling the prophecies, as an evidence of our
   Saviour's divine commission. The proof of the divine authority of the
   Christian revelation is confirmed and ascertained, by the exact
   completion both of all those prophecies that went before concerning our
   Lord, and of those that he himself delivered concerning things that
   were to happen after.

   Of the prophecies that went before, concerning the Messiah. Concerning
   the Messiah it was foretold, (Gen. xlix.10.) that he should come,
   before the sceptre departed from Judah: And accordingly Christ appeared
   a little before the time when the Jewish government was totally
   destroyed by the Romans. It was foretold that he should come before the
   destruction of the second temple, (Hagg. ii. 7.) The desire of all
   nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the
   Lord of hosts; the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of
   the former: And accordingly Christ appeared some time before the
   destruction of the city and temple. It was foretold that he should come
   at the end of 490 years, after the restoring of Jerusalem which had
   been laid waste during the captivity, (Dan. ix. 24.) and that he should
   be cut off; and that, after that, the city and sanctuary should be
   destroyed and made desolate: And accordingly, at what time soever the
   beginning of the four hundred and ninety years can, according to any
   interpretation of the words, be fixed, the end of them will fall about
   the time of Christ's appearing, and it is well known how entirely the
   city and sanctuary were destroyed some years after his being cut off.
   It was foretold that he should do many great and beneficial miracles;
   that the eyes of the blind (Isa. xxxv. 5.) should be opened, and the
   ears of the deaf unstopped; that the lame man should leap as an hart,
   and the tongue of the dumb sing;--and this was literally fulfilled in
   the miracles of Christ,--the blind received their sight, and the lame
   walked, the deaf heard, &c. (Matt. xi. 5.) It was foretold that he
   should die a violent death, (Isai.liii. throughout,) and that not for
   himself, (Dan. ix. 26.) but for our transgressions, (Isai. liii. 5, 6,
   and 12.) for the iniquity of us all, and that he might bear the sin of
   many;--all which was exactly accomplished in the sufferings of Christ.
   It was foretold, (Gen. xlix. 10.) that to him should the gathering of
   the people be, and (Psal. ii. 8.) that God would give him the heathen
   for his inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for his
   possession;--which was punctually fulfilled by the wonderful success of
   the gospel, and its universal spreading through the world. Lastly, many
   minuter circumstances were foretold of the Messiah,--that he should be
   of the tribe of Judah, and of the seed of David, that he should be born
   in the town of Bethlehem, (Mic. v. 2.) that he should ride upon an ass
   in humble triumph into the city of Jerusalem, (Zech. ix. 9.) that he
   should be sold for thirty pieces of silver, (Zech. xi. 12.) that he
   should be scourged, buffeted, and spit upon, (Is. l. 6.) that his hands
   and feet should be pierced, (Psal. xxii. 16.) that he should be
   numbered among malefactors, (Is. liii. 12.) that he should have gall
   and vinegar offered him to drink, (Psal. lxix. 21.) that they who saw
   him crucified, should mock at him, and at his trusting in God to
   deliver him, (Psal. xxii. 8.) that the soldiers should cast lots for
   his garments, (Psal. xxii. 18.) that he should make his grave with the
   rich, (Is. liii. 9.) and that he should rise again without seeing
   corruption, (Psal. xvi. 10.) All which circumstances were fulfilled to
   the greatest possible exactness, in the person of Christ: Not to
   mention the numberless typical representations which had likewise
   evidently their complete accomplishment in him. And it is no less
   evident, that none of these prophecies can possibly be applied to any
   other person that ever pretended to be the Messiah.

   Of the prophecies that Christ himself delivered concerning things that
   were to happen after. Further, the prophecies or predictions which
   Christ delivered himself, concerning things that were to happen after,
   are no less strong proofs of the truth and divine authority of his
   doctrine, than the prophecies were which went before concerning him. He
   did very particularly, and at several times, foretel his own death, and
   the circumstances of it, (Matt.xvi. 21.) that the chief priests and
   scribes should condemn him to death and deliver him to the Gentiles,
   that is to Pilate and the Roman soldiers, to mock, and scourge, and
   crucify him, (Matt. xx. 18 and 19.) that he should be betrayed into
   their hands, (Matt. xx. 18.) that Judas Iscariot was the person who
   would betray him, (Matt. xxvi. 23.) that all his disciples would
   forsake him and flee, (Matt. xxvi. 31.) that Peter particularly would
   thrice deny him in one night; (Mar. xiv. 30.) he foretold further, that
   he would rise again the third day, (Matt. xvi. 21.) that, after his
   ascension, he would send down the Holy Ghost upon hi sapostles, (John
   xv. 26.) which should enable them to work many miracles: (Mar. xvi.
   17.) he foretold also the destruction of Jerusalem, with such very
   particular circumstances, in the whole 24th chapter of St Matthew, and
   the 13th of St Mark and 21st of St Luke, that no man who reads
   Josephus's history of that dreadful and unparalleled calamity, [361]
   can without the greatest obstinacy imaginable, doubt of our Saviour's
   divine fore-knowledge. Lastly, he foretold likewise many particulars
   concerning the future success of the gospel, and what should happen to
   several of his disciples; he foretold what opposition and persecution
   they should meet withal in their preaching; (Matt. x. 17.) he foretold
   what particular kind of death St Peter should die; (Job xxi. 18.) and
   hinted, that St John should live till after the destruction of
   Jerusalem; (Job, xxi. 22.) and foretold, that, notwithstanding all
   opposition and persecutions, the gospel should yet have such success as
   to spread itself over the world; (Matt. xvi. 18. xxiv. 14. xxviii. 19.)
   all and every one of which particulars were exactly accomplished,
   without failing in any respects.

   Some of these things are of permanent and visible effects, even unto
   this day; particularly the captivity and dispersion of the Jews through
   all nations, for more than 1600 years; and yet their continuing a
   distinct people, in order to the fulfilling the prophecies of things
   still future: This (I say) is particularly a permanent proof of the
   truth of the ancient prophecies: But the greatest part of the instances
   above mentioned were sensible and ocular demonstrations of the truth of
   our Lord's doctrine only to those persons who lived at the time when
   they happened: The credibility of whose testimony, therefore, shall be
   considered presently in its proper place.

   Objections answered. But before I proceed to this, it may not be
   improper in this place to take notice of some objections which have of
   late been revived and urged against this whole notion, both of the
   prophecies themselves, and of the application of them to Christ. The
   sum and strength of which objections is briefly this.

   That all the promises supposed to be made to the Jews before Christ's
   time, of a Messiah, or deliverer, were understood and meant of some
   "temporal deliverer" only, who should restore to the Israelites a mere
   worldly kingdom, "without the least imagination of a spiritual
   deliverance," or of any such Saviour as is preached in the New
   Testament.

   That, consequently, "all the prophecies" in the Old Testament, applied
   to Christ by the apostles in the New, are applied to him in a sense
   merely "typical, mystical, allegorical, or enigmatical;" in a sense
   "different from the obvious and literal sense," by "new interpretations
   put upon them not agreeable to the obvious and literal meaning of those
   books" from whence they are cited: That is to say, that the prophecies
   were all of them intended concerning other persons, and other persons
   only; and, therefore, are falsely and groundlessly applied either to
   Christ in particular, or in general to the expectation of any such
   Messiah as should introduce a spiritual and eternal kingdom.

   That there are several passages, cited by the apostles out of the Old
   Testament, which are either not found there at all, or else are very
   different in the text itself from the citations alleged; and
   consequently, are, by the apostles, either misunderstood or misapplied.

   That even miracles themselves "can never render a foundation valid,
   which is in itself invalid;--can never make a false inference
   true;--can never make a prophecy fulfilled, which is not
   fulfilled;"--can never make those things to be spoken concerning
   Christ, which were not spoken concerning Christ: And, consequently,
   that the miracles said to have been worked by Christ could not possibly
   have been really worked by him; but must, of necessity, together with
   the whole system, both of the Old and New Testament, have been wholly
   the effect of imagination and enthusiasm, if not of imposture.

   Now, in order to enable every careful and sincere reader to find a
   satisfactory answer to these, and all other objections of the like
   nature, I would lay before him the following considerations.

   1. I suppose it to have been already proved in the foregoing part of
   this discourse, that there is a God, and that the nature and
   circumstances of men, and the necessary perfections of God, do
   demonstrate the obligations and the motives of natural religion; that
   is, that God is a moral as well as natural governor of the world.
   Whoever denies either of these assertions is obliged to invalidate the
   arguments alleged for proof of them in the former part of this book,
   before he has any right to intermix atheistical arguments and
   objections in the present question: It being evidently ridiculous in
   all who believe not that God is, and that he is a moral judge as well
   as natural governor, to argue at all about a revelation concerning
   religion, or to make any inquiry whether it be from God or no.

   2. As God has in fact made known even demonstrable truths, [362]
   natural and moral truths, not to all men equally, but in different
   degrees and proportions to such as have a disposition and desire to
   inquire after them; so it is agreeable to reason and to the analogy of
   God's proceedings, to believe that he may possibly, by revelation and
   tradition, have given some further degrees of light to such as are
   sincerely desirous to know and obey him; so that they who will do his
   will may know of the doctrine whether it be of God: As our natural
   knowledge of moral and religious truths in fact is, so revelation
   possibly may further be, as it were a light shining in a dark place.

   3. It appears in history, that the great truths and obligations of
   natural religion have, from the beginning, been confirmed by a
   perpetual tradition in particular families, who, though in the midst of
   idolatrous nations, yet stedfastly adhered to the worship of the God of
   nature, the one God of the universe. And by the nation of the Jews
   (notwithstanding all their corruptions in practice, yet in the system
   and constitution of their religion) has the same tradition been
   continually preserved: Whereby they have been as it were a city upon a
   hill, a standng testimony against an idolatrous world.

   4. Among the writings of all, even the most ancient and learned
   nations, there are none but the books of the Jews, which (agreeably to
   the above demonstrated truths concerning the God of nature, and the
   foundations of natural religion,) have, exclusive of chance and of
   necessity, ascribed either the original of the universe in general (an
   universe full of infinite variety and choice,) to the will and
   operation of an intelligent and free cause, or given any tolerable
   account, in particular, of the formation of this our earth into its
   present habitable state.

   5. But in these books there is not only (in order to prevent idolatry)
   a full account (agreeable to the principles of natural reason,) how the
   heavens, and the earth, and all things therein contained, are the
   creatures of God, but, moreover, an uniform series of history from the
   infancy of mankind, consistent with itself, and with the state of the
   Jewish and Christian church at this day, and with the possibilities of
   the predicted series for the future, for several thousands of years.
   Which consistency with the possibilities of such predicted future
   events could not be by chance (as I shall show presently,) but is
   itself a great and standing miracle.

   6. In these books, agreeably to the hopes and expectations naturally
   founded on the divine perfections, God did from the beginning make, and
   has all along continued to his church or true worshippers, a promise
   that truth and virtue shall finally prevail; should prevail over the
   spirit of error and wickedness, of delusion and disobedience: That the
   seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head: (Gen. iii. 15.)
   That among her posterity should arise a deliverance from the delusion
   and power of sin, by which Satan should be bruised under their feet:
   (Rom. xvi. 20.) That, in particular, from the seed of Abraham, and from
   the family of Isaac, and from the posterity of Jacob, and from the
   house of David, should arise the accomplishment of all God's promises
   to his church, and all the blessings included in God's covenant with
   his true worshippers. That at length the earth should be full of the
   knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea, (Is. xi. 9.) that
   the kingdoms of this world should become the kingdoms of the Lord:
   (Rev. xi. 15. Dan. vii. 27.) That in the last days, unto the mountain
   of the Lord's house, the seat of his true worship, should all nations
   flow; (Is. ii. 2.) That God would create new heavens and a new earth;
   (Is. lxv. 17.) wherein dwelleth righteousness; (2 Pet. iii. 13.)
   wherein the people should be all righteous, and inherit the land for
   ever: (Is. lx. 21. lxv. 25. xi. 9. 1. 26.) Should be all holy; (Is. iv.
   8.) even every one that is written among the living. [363] That God
   would set up a kingdom, which should never be destroyed, but stand for
   ever; (Dan. ii. 44.) and that the saints of the Most High should take
   the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever,
   (Dan. vii. 18, 22, 27. Is. chap. lx.)

   7. All the great promises, therefore, which God has ever made to his
   church, to his people, to the families or nations of his true
   worshippers, are evidently to be all along so understood as that wicked
   and unworthy persons, of whatever family, or nation, or profession of
   religion they be, shall be excluded from the benefit of those promises,
   shall be cut off from God's people; and worthy persons of all nations,
   from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the
   south, shall be accepted in their stead. That is to say; in like manner
   as the promise was made originally, not to all the children of Abraham,
   but to Isaac only, and not to both the sons of Isaac, but to Jacob
   only; and among the posterity of Jacob, all were not Israel which were
   of Israel, but in Elijah's days, seven thousand only were the true
   Israel; and in the time of Isaiah, though the number of the children of
   Israel was as the sand of the sea, (Is. x. 22.) yet a remnant only was
   to be saved, (Rom. ix. 27.); and in Hosea God says, I will call them my
   people which were not my people, and her beloved which was not beloved,
   (Hos. ii. 23. Rom. ix. 25.) So it is all along evidently to be
   understood, that the children of the promise, in the literal sense,
   according to the flesh, the visible church, or professed worshippers of
   the true God, are but the type or representative of the real invisible
   church of God, the (Rom. ii. 28. iii. 7 and 9. iv. 12.) true children
   of Abraham, in the spiritual and religious sense, the saints of the
   Most High, who shall possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and
   ever, (Dan. vii. 18.) even every one that is written among the living.
   (Is. iv. 3.)

   8. It being evident that God cannot be the God of the dead, but of the
   living; and that all promises made to such worshippers of the true God
   as at any time forsook all that they had, and even life itself, for the
   sake of that worship, could be nothing but mere mockery if there was no
   life to come and God had no power to restore them from the dead: This
   (I say) being self-evident, it follows necessarily, that when the time
   comes that the promised kingdom shall take place, the dead must be
   raised, and the saints, which have died in the intermediate time, must
   live again, and stand in their lot at the end of the days, (Dan. xii.
   13.) When God styles himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
   (Exod. iii. 6, 16.) and said to Abraham, I am thy exceeding great
   reward, (Gen. xv. 1.) and I will--be a God unto thee, and to thy seed
   after thee, (Gen. xvii. 7.) and I will give the land unto thee, and to
   thy seed after thee, (Gen. xvii. 8, 13, 15, 17.) and repeated the very
   same promises to Isaac, (Gen. xxvi. 3.) and to Jacob personally, (Gen.
   xxviii. 13.) as well as to their posterity after them; (Deut. i. 8.)
   and yet gave Abraham none inheritance in the land, though he promised
   that he would give it to him and to his seed after him, (Acts vii. 5.)
   but Abraham himself sojourned only in the land of promise as in a
   strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the
   heirs with him of the same promise, (Heb. xi. 9.) who all confessed
   that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth, (Heb. xi. 13.) and
   Jacob particularly complained that the days of the years of his
   pilgrimage had been few and evil; (Gen. xlvii. 9.) and, in blessing
   Isaac and Ishmael, God promised to make Ishmael fruitful, and to
   multiply him exceedingly, (Gen. xvii. 20. xxi. 18.) so that he should
   beget twelve princes, and God would make him a great nation, and
   multiply his seed exceedingly, that it should not be numbered for
   multitude; (Gen. xvi. 10.) and yet in the very same sentence expressly,
   by way of opposition, and of high and eminent distinction, declares
   that, notwithstanding all this, yet his covenant, his everlasting
   covenant, he would establish with Isaac: (Gen. xvii. 19, 21.) When all
   this (I say) is considered, the inference of the apostle to the Hebrews
   cannot but appear unanswerably just, that these patriarchs looked for a
   city somewhat more than temporal, even a city which hath foundations,
   whose builder and maker is God; (Heb. xi. 10.) and that they who said
   such things declared plainly that they sought a country, a better
   country, that is, an heavenly; (Heb. xi. 14, 16.) and that for this
   reason God was not ashamed to be called their God, because he had
   prepared for them a city. And if this inference was necessarily true
   concerning the patriarchs, who confessed that they were strangers and
   pilgrims on the earth; (Heb. xi. 13.) much more concerning those who
   were tortured, not accepting deliverance, (Heb. xi. 35.) must it needs
   be true that the only possible reason of this their choice was that
   they might obtain a better resurrection.

   Other notices in the Old Testament, that the worshippers of the true
   God, in every age of the world, should at the end have their lot in the
   kingdom promised to the saints of the Most High, are, the translation
   of Enoch, (Gen. v. 24.) that he should not see death; (Heb. xi. 5.
   Wisd. iv. 10. Eccles. xliv. 16. xlix. 14.) and the taking up of Elijah
   into Heaven, (2 Kings ii. 11, Eccles. xlviii. 9. 1 Macc. ii. 58.)
   Allusions to it at least, if perhaps not direct assertions, are the
   words of Job, (Job xix. 25.) I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that
   he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my
   skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. [364]
   And those of Isaiah: Thy dead men shall live; together with my dead
   body shall they arise. A wake and sing, ye that dwell in dust; for thy
   dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. (Is.
   xxvi. 19.) And your bones shall flourish like an herb. (Is. lxvi. 14.)
   And that passage in Hosea: I will ransom them from the power of the
   grave; I will redeem them from death. (Hos. xiii. 14.) O death, I will
   be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction. And that in
   Ezekiel: Behold,--the bones came together, bone to his bone; and-- the
   sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them
   above;-- and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up
   upon their feet;----Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and
   cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of
   Israel. (Ezek.xxxvii. 7, 8, 10, 12.) Again: The words of Isaiah; The
   righteous perisheth, and-- is taken away from the evil to come; He
   shall enter into peace: (Is. lvii. 1, 2.) What more natural
   signification have they than that which the Book of Wisdom expresses,
   ch. iii. 1, 3. The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God;--They
   are in peace. And what but the future state can the conclusion of
   Isaiah's prophecy reasonably be referred to? Behold, I create new
   heavens and a new earth;--As the new heavens and the new earth which I
   will make shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed
   and your name remain. And-- all flesh shall come to worship before me,
   saith the Lord. And they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of
   the men that have transgressed against me: For their worm shall not
   die; neither shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an
   abhorring unto all flesh, (Is. lxv. 17. lxvi. 22, 23, 24.) In like
   manner; Whom does God speak of by Ezekiel, when he says, the sons of
   (Ezek. xliv. 15, 16.) Zadock, that kept the charge of my sanctuary,
   when the children of Israel went astray from me; [365] [which went not
   astray when the children of Israel went astray, (Ezek. xlviii.
   11.)]--they shall enter into my sanctuary. And to what do the following
   words of the same prophet most naturally refer? [366] Every thing shall
   live whither the river cometh:--And by the river, upon the bank
   thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat,
   whose leaf shall not fade; neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed:
   It shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their
   waters they issued out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be
   for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine. Still more strong is that
   allusion in Daniel; I beheld till the thrones were cast down, [till the
   thrones were placed,] and the ancient of days did sit:--A fiery stream
   issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered
   unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: The
   judgment was set, and the books were opened. (Dan.vii. 9. 10.) But the
   following words of the same prophet are direct and express. Many of
   them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to
   everlasting life, [every one that shall be found written in the book,]
   and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall
   shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to
   righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.--But go thou thy way,
   till the end be; for thou shalt rest, and shalt stand in thy lot at the
   end of the days; (Dan. xii 2, 3, 13.) Can any one, who considers these
   texts, with any truth or reason affirm that all the promises supposed
   to be made to the Jews before Christ's time were meant of some
   "temporal" deliverance only, "without the least imagination of a
   spiritual deliverance?"

   9. There are in the Old Testament many intimations, and some direct
   predictions, that all the great promises of God, made to his true
   worshippers, shall receive their final accomplishment by means of a
   particular person, anointed of God for that purpose; who, after the
   reduction of all adversaries, shall set up the everlasting kingdom. The
   seed of Abraham, in which all the nations of the earth were to be
   blessed, (and, in like manner, the seed of the woman, which was to
   bruise the serpent's head,) might originally, with equal propriety, and
   in as reasonable and natural a sense of the words, be understood to
   signify (what St. Paul afterward asserts it did signify, [367] ) in the
   singular sense, a particular person, as, in the plural sense, a number
   of persons. The Shiloh which was to come, and to whom the gathering of
   the people was to be, (Gen. xlix. 10.) (the promise laid up in store,
   ta apokeimena auto, as the LXX render it,) by its opposition in the
   text to the terms sceptre and lawgiver, most naturally signifies a
   single person who was to reign; and, by the gradation in the words of
   the text, somewhat of superior dignity to that of a sceptre and a
   lawgiver. The words of Balaam:--(Num. xxiv. 17, 19.) I shall see him,
   but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh: There shall come a star
   out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel;--out of Jacob
   shall come he that shall have dominion;--are words so put in his mouth,
   as most properly and obviously to describe a much greater person than
   perhaps he thought of, a much greater person than one who should smite
   the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. Again; that
   the words of Moses:--(Deut. xviii. 15.) The Lord thy God will raise up
   unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, like unto me, unto him
   shall ye hearken;--were not meant barely of Joshua, or of "a succession
   of prophets," but of one who should have as eminent a legislative
   authority as Moses, may reasonably be gathered from the occasion of
   their being spoken, not merely by Moses, upon a general reliance and
   trust that God would provide him a successor, but by God himself, upon
   the people's desiring in Horeb,--saying, Let me not hear again the
   voice of the Lord my God, neither let me see this great fire any more,
   that I die not: Then the Lord said, They have well spoken:--I will
   raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and
   will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I
   command him: And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken
   unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of
   him. (Deut.xviii. 16, 17, 18, 19.)--And that the words were anciently,
   long before the application of them by the writers of the New
   Testament, thus understood, and not concerning Joshua, or a succession
   of prophets, appears from those additional words at the conclusion of
   the book of Deuteronomy:--(Deut.xxxiv. 9, 10.) Joshua, the son of Nun,
   was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon
   him--But there arose not a prophet since in Israel, like unto Moses,
   whom the Lord knew face to face.--The prediction of Isaiah is still
   clearer:--(Is. ix. 6, 7.) Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is
   given, and the government shall be upon his shoulders; and his name
   shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting
   Father, the Prince of Peace: [368] Of the increase of his government
   and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his
   kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with
   justice from henceforth even for ever: The zeal of the Lord of Hosts
   will perform this. Again:--(Is. xi. 1, 3, 6, 9.) There shall come forth
   a rod out of the stem of Jesse.--He shall not judge after the sight of
   his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: But with
   righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the
   meek of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his
   mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.--The
   wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, &c.--They shall not hurt nor
   destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the
   knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. And (Is. xlii. 1,
   3, 4.--Matt. xii. 17.) Behold my servant,--mine elect, in whom my soul
   delighteth: I have put my spirit upon him:--A bruised reed shall he not
   break:--He shall bring forth judgment unto truth:--till he have set
   judgment in the earth, and the isles shall wait for his law. The
   prophet Jeremiah no less plainly:--(Jer.xxiii. 5, 6.--xxxiii. 15, 16.)
   I will raise unto David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign and
   prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth:--And this
   is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. And
   Ezekiel:--(Ezek.xxxiv. 23, 25.--xxxvii. 22, 23, 24, 25.--Hos.iii. 5.) I
   will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my
   servant David;--And I will make with them a covenant of peace, &c.--One
   king shall be king to them all;--neither shall they defile themselves
   any more with their idols;--and they all shall have one shepherd; they
   shall also walk in my judgments,--and my servant David shall be their
   prince for ever. By Haggai is the same predicted:--(Hagg. ii. 6,
   7.--Heb. xii. 26.) Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the
   heavens and the earth,--And the desire of all nations shall come. [369]
   And by Zechary:--(Zech. ix. 9, 10.--Matt. xxi. 5.) Behold, thy king
   cometh unto thee: He is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding
   upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an ass:--He shall speak peace
   unto the heathen; and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and
   from the river even to the ends of the earth. And by
   Malachi;--(Mal.iii. 1.) The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to
   his temple; even the messenger of the covenant. But most expressly of
   all by Daniel:--(Dan.vii. 13, 14.) I saw in the night visions, and
   behold one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and came
   to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him: [370] And
   there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom; that all
   people, nations, and languages, should serve him: His dominion is an
   everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and his kingdom that
   which shall not be destroyed. And the anointing of the Holy One, this
   prophet calls (Dan. ix. 24.) the sealing up of the vision and prophecy,
   and the finishing of transgression, and the making an end of sins, and
   the making reconciliation for iniquity, and the bringing in
   ever-lasting righteousness. [Do all these things denote nothing but
   "temporal" deliverance, "without the least imagination of a spiritual
   deliverance?"] And in the words next following, he is styled, by name,
   Messiah. (Dan. ix. 25.) Know, therefore, [vtd know also] and
   understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and
   to build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks.
   [371]

   10. Concerning this Messiah, in the setting up of whose kingdom all the
   promises of God terminate, it is clearly predicted in the Old Testament
   that he should arise particularly from the tribe of Judah, from the
   family of David, and in the town of Bethlehem.

   The first of these particulars is expressed in those emphatical words
   of Jacob:--(Gen. xlix. 8, 10.) Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren
   shall praise,-- thy father's children shall bow down before thee:-- The
   sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from between his
   feet, until Shiloh come, [LXX, heos an elthe ta apokeimena auto, till
   the accomplishment of the promises which God has laid up in store for
   him,] and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. To which the
   writer of the Chronicles seems to refer, when he says:--(Chr. v. 1, 2.)
   The genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birth-right; for Judah
   prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler, [Heb.
   and from him was it prophesied the ruler should arise.] And the
   Psalmist,--(Ps.lx. 7. cviii. 8.) Judah is my lawgiver.

   The second is expressed in that promise to David,--(2 Sam. vii. 16.)
   thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee,
   [LXX, enopio`n mou, before me;] thy throne shall be established for
   ever. Which words might, indeed, of themselves be understood concerning
   a succession of kings in the house of David: But that God had a further
   and a greater meaning in them, he very clearly explains by the
   following prophets. By Isaiah:--(Is. xi. 1, &c. compare Rev. iii. 7. v.
   5. xxii. 16.) there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,
   and a branch shall grow out of his roots; and then follows through the
   whole chapter a glorious description of an everlasting kingdom of
   righteousness, over both Jews and Gentiles. By Jeremiah;--(Jer. xxiii.
   5.) I will raise unto David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign
   and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth:--And
   this is his name whereby he shall be called, the Lord our
   righteousness. By Ezekiel;--(Ezek.xxvii. 23, 24, 25, 26.) they shall be
   my people, and I will be their God; and David my servant shall be king
   over them, and they all shall have one shepherd;--and my servant David
   shall be their prince for ever; Moreover I will make a covenant of
   peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant. And by
   Hosea:--(Hos. iii. 4.) The children of Israel shall abide many days
   without a king and without a prince, and without a
   sacrifice:--Afterward shall the children of Israel return and seek the
   Lord their God, and David their king, and shall fear the Lord and his
   goodness in the latter days.

   The third particular is expressed in those words of Micah:--(Micah, v.
   2. Mat. i. 6.) But thou Bethlehem Euphratah, though thou be little
   among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
   me, that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of
   old, from everlasting. After the passages now cited out of the
   foregoing prophets, what can be more jejune than to understand these
   words of Micah concerning Zorobabel only as having been of an ancient
   family?

   11. In the books of the Old Testament it is expressly predicted, that
   the kingdom of the Messiah should extend not over the Jews only, but
   also over the Gentiles. The (Gen. xii. 3. xviii. 18. xxii. 18. xxvi. 4.
   xxviii. 14.) promise made to Abraham, and so often repeated to him, and
   to Isaac, and to Jacob, that in their seed should all the nations of
   the earth be blessed, is thus opened and explained by the
   prophets.--(Is.xi. 10.) There shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
   stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek, and
   his rest shall be glorious.--(Is.xlii. 1, 6. Matt. xii. 18.) Behold my
   servant--in whom my soul delighteth,--he shall bring forth judgment to
   the Gentiles;--I will--give thee for a covenant of the people, for a
   light of the Gentiles. (Is.xlix. 6.) It is a light thing that thou
   shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore
   the preserved of Israel; I will also give thee for a light to the
   Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.
   (Is.lvi. 6, 7, 8.--John x. 16.) Also the sons of the stranger, that
   join themselves to the Lord,--even them will I bring to my holy
   mountain, and--mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all
   people. The Lord God, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel, saith,
   yet will I gather others to him, besides those that are gathered unto
   him. (Ezek. xlvii. 22.) The strangers that sojourn among you,--shall
   have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. (Mal. i. 11.)
   From the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my
   name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense
   shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering; for my name shall
   be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of Hosts.

   12. Concerning the same Messiah, of whom so great things are spoken,
   and whose kingdom is to be an everlasting kingdom, it is still
   expressly predicted by the prophets that he should suffer and be cut
   off. Concerning the very same person, who (with respect to his coming
   to reign, and to introduce the everlasting jubilee or rest to the
   people of God, (Heb. iv. 9. sabbatismo's.) is styled Messiah the
   prince; (Dan. ix. 25.) concerning the very same person, I say, it is in
   the very same sentence expressly predicted that he should be cut off,
   but not for himself, (Dan. ix. 26.) [Heb. and the people should not
   then be his; unto him should not then the gathering of the people be.
   (Gen. xlix. 10.)] For which reason, and also because the words can with
   no tolerable sense be applied to any other person, and because moreover
   the connexion of the whole prophecy leads to the same interpretation;
   the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah likewise is most justly understood to
   be spoken of the Messiah: There shall come forth a rod out of the stem
   of Jesse; (Isa. xi. 1.)--with righteousness shall he judge the poor:
   (Isa.xi. 4.)--Behold my servant--mine elect in whom my soul
   delighteth;--he shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be
   heard in the street; a bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking
   flax shall he not quench; he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
   (Isa. xlii. 1, 2, 3.--Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; (Is.
   lii. 13.) Surely he hath born our griefs;--he was wounded for our
   transgressions; he was bruised for our iniquities:--He is brought as a
   lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so
   he openeth not his mouth: He was taken from prison and from judgment,
   and who shall declare his generation?--For the transgression of my
   people was he stricken; and he made his grave with the wicked, and with
   the rich in his death:--When thou shalt make his soul an offering for
   sin;--my righteous servant shall justify many, for he shall bear their
   iniquities:--He was numbered with the transgressors, and he bare the
   sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. (Is. liii. 4,
   &c.)

   13. All prophecies of blessings to the worshippers of the true God,
   expressed either as being to happen in the latter days, or in words
   which imply a lasting duration, are in reason to be understood as
   having reference to the times of the promised kingdom of the Messiah,
   of whom it is expressly said, that he shall bring in everlasting
   righteousness, (Dan. ix. 24.) and that his dominion is an everlasting
   dominion which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall
   not be destroyed. (Dan. vii. 14.) Some prophecies of this kind are
   direct and express. Others, beginning with promises of particular
   intermediate blessings, and proceeding with general expressions more
   great and lofty than can naturally be applied to the temporal blessing
   immediately spoken of, are most reasonably understood to have a
   perpetual view and regard to that great and general event, in which all
   God's promises to his true worshippers do centre and terminate, and of
   which all intermediate blessings promised by God are justly looked upon
   as beginnings, types, pledges, or earnests.

   14. For since, from the express prophecies before cited, of the
   Messiah's everlasting kingdom of righteousness, it appears that God had
   in fact a view to that, as the great and general end of all the
   dispensations of providence towards his true worshippers from the
   beginning; and no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private
   interpretation, (2 Pet. i. 20.) (that is, the meaning of prophecies is
   not what perhaps the prophet himself might imagine in his private
   judgment of the state of things then present,) because the prophecy in
   old time came not by the will of man, but holy men spake as they were
   moved by the Holy Ghost; there may, therefore, very possibly, and very
   reasonably, be supposed to be many prophecies, which, though they may
   have a prior and immediate reference to some nearer event, yet, by the
   spirit of God, (whom those prophecies which are express show to have
   had a further view,) may have been directed to be uttered in such
   words, as may even more properly and more justly be applied to the
   great event which providence had in view, than to the intermediate
   event which God designed as only a pledge or earnest of the other: For
   instance; suppose these words of Daniel,--I beheld till the thrones
   were cast down, [till the thrones were placed,] and the ancient of days
   did sit:--A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him;
   thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten
   thousand stood before him; the judgment was set, and the books were
   opened: (Dan. vii. 9, 10.) Suppose (I say) these words were spoken
   concerning the slaying of a wild beast, or the destruction of a
   temporal empire, (ver. 11.) yet what reasonable man, who had ever
   elsewhere met with any notices of a judgment to come, could doubt but
   the destruction there spoken of was therefore expressed in those words,
   that it might be understood to be the introduction to the general
   judgment? The exact and very particular description of a resurrection,
   in the 37th of Ezekiel, supposing it to be indeed spoken of a temporal
   restoration of the Jews, yet who can doubt but it was so worded with
   design to allude to a real resurrection of the dead? The words of
   Micah: Thou, Bethlehem, though thou be little among the thousands of
   Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler
   in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting:
   (Micah, v. 2. Mat. ii. 6.) Supposing it possible they could be spoken
   of Zorobabel, yet, if afterwards there should arise out of Bethlehem
   one in whom were found all the other prophetic characters of the
   promised Messiah, who could doubt but the words were intended either
   solely, or at least chiefly, of the latter? The words of Jeremiah:
   (Jer. i. 7.--vi. 5.) Babylon hath been a golden cup;--the nations have
   drunken of her wine, therefore the nations are mad: Flee out of the
   midst of Babylon,--be not cut off in her iniquity:--My people, go ye
   out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the
   fierce anger of the Lord. Who, that considers the nature and character
   of the Babylon in Jeremiah's time, and compares it with the nature and
   character of the Babylon described by St John, can doubt but the spirit
   which influenced Jeremiah foresaw and intended to allude to that
   Babylon which had (Rev. xvii. 4.) a golden cup in her hand full of
   abominations, (ver. 2.) and the inhabiters of the earth have been made
   drunk with the wine of her fornication, (ch. xviii. 3, 4.) and the
   kings of the earth have committed fornication with her:--Come out of
   her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
   receive not of her plagues: For the words of Jeremiah are more strictly
   applicable to this latter Babylon than to that in his own time. Again;
   The words of Isaiah:--(Is. vii. 14.--Matt. i. 23.) Behold, a virgin
   shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call his name Immanuel, that
   is to say, God with us. Supposing Isaiah himself could possibly at that
   time understand them concerning a son of his own, concerning a son to
   be born of a young woman afterwards, who at the time then present was a
   virgin; and that his being styled Immanuel meant nothing more than
   that, before this child was grown up, Judah should be delivered from
   the then threatened incursions of Israel and Syria; (all which,
   notwithstanding the seeming connexion of the words in the place they
   stand, is very difficult to suppose;) yet, if afterwards any person,
   comparing the solemn introduction wherewith the words are brought in,
   "Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary
   men, but will ye weary my God also? therefore the Lord himself shall
   give you a sign; behold a virgin shall conceive," &c. If any one, I
   say, comparing this solemn introduction with the promises repeated to
   the house of David in other passages of the prophets, that there should
   be born unto them a Son who should (Is. ix. 7.--Ezek. xxxvii. 25.) sit
   upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom for ever, and of the
   increase of whose government and peace there should be no end;--and
   considering, moreover, the character of this promised Son, that he
   should (Dan. ix. 24.) finish transgression, and make an end of sins,
   and make reconciliation for iniquity, and bring in everlasting
   righteousness: If a person, considering and comparing these things,
   should in his own days find a son really born of a virgin, attested to
   by numerous miracles, and by God's command named Jesus, (which is
   synonymous to immanuel, a potent Saviour or God with us,) because he
   (Matt. i. 21.) should save his people from their sins, that is, should
   (Dan. ix. 24.) make reconciliation for iniquity, and bring in
   everlasting righteousness; Could such a person possibly entertain the
   least doubt, whether God, who sent Isaiah to repeat the fore cited
   words to the house of David, did not intend thereby to describe, if not
   wholly and solely, at least chiefly and ultimately, this latter
   saviour? In like manner; suppose those great promises to David, (2 Sam.
   vii. 13, 14, 16.) concerning the establishment of the throne of his Son
   for ever, were by David, and the prophet himself that delivered them,
   understood (te idia epilusei, as St. Peter speaks,) concerning Solomon,
   and a succession of kings in his family; yet, when following prophecies
   clearly and expressly declared, that out of the root of Jesse should
   arise a Messiah who should reign for ever, no reasonable man can doubt,
   but that the former and less clear prophecy was likewise intended of
   God, and therefore rightly applied by the apostles of Christ to the
   same purpose? To give but one instance more: Suppose the words, (Ps.
   xvi. 10.) Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer
   thy Holy One to see corruption, were by David spoken concerning
   himself, (which, however, can by no way be proved,) yet who, that
   (Acts. ii. 30.) knew David himself to be a prophet, and that had
   compared the other prophecies concerning the (Is. xi. 1, &c.) branch
   out of the roots of Jesse, the (Ezek. xxxvii. 24.) one shepherd of
   Israel, even God's (ver. 25.) servant David who should be their prince
   for ever, and yet was to be (Dan. ix. 26.--Is. liii. tot.) cut off
   before he should reign for ever; and that had himself seen (as St.
   Peter did) and actually conversed with Christ risen from the dead; who,
   (I say) in these circumstances, could possibly doubt but that (2 Sam.
   xxiii. 2.) the spirit of the Lord which spake by David intended the
   fore-mentioned words should be understood of, and applied to Christ?
   And the like may be said concerning some other prophecies which are
   vulgarly supposed to be applied typically to Christ.

   15. It is not agreeable to reason, or to the analogy of Scripture, to
   suppose that the Jews, before our Saviour's time, could have a clear
   and distinct understanding of the full meaning, even of the express
   prophecies, much less of those which were more obscure and indirect;
   when both were intended to be only as it were a light shining in a dark
   place. [372] But thus much is evident, that the Jews, both before and
   in our Saviour's time, had from these prophecies a general expectation
   of a Messiah, [373] and that this Messiah was to be, not merely a
   "temporal" deliverer, but 'vytsr, Pater futuri seculi, the head of the
   future state, as well as of the present. Nor does it at all appear that
   our Lord's disciples, when they (Luke, xxiv. 21.) thought he would have
   redeemed Israel, or when they (Acts, i. 6.) asked if he would at this
   time restore again the kingdom to Israel, I say, it does not at all
   appear that they expected merely a "temporal" kingdom, but their error
   was in expecting a present kingdom; and therefore our Lord's answer to
   them, is not concerning the nature but the time of the kingdom. And the
   modern Jews, at this day, who to be sure have entertained no
   prejudicate notions from the New Testament writer's interpretation or
   application of prophecies, have (I think) still an universal
   expectation, that the Messiah shall be their prince in the future state
   as well as in the present.

   16. When Jesus Christ, by (John x. 25.) the works which he did in his
   father's name, and (John v. 36.) which his father gave him to finish,
   had proved himself to be sent of God; (which truth the apostles
   likewise confirmed by their testimony, by their works, and by laying
   down their lives, not for their opinions, which possibly erroneous and
   enthusiastic persons may sometimes sincerely do, but in attestation to
   facts of their own knowledge) and it appeared, moreover, that there was
   wanting in him no circumstance, no sine qua non, no character,
   appropriated by any of the ancient prophets to the promised Messiah, he
   had then a clear right to apply to himself all the prophecies, which
   either directly spoke of the Messiah, or which, through any
   intermediate events, pointed at him, and were applicable to him.

   17. The application of this latter sort of prophecies to Christ is not
   allegorical. It is not an allegorical application, much less an
   allegorical argument or reasoning. But they are applied to him, as
   being really and intentionally, in the view of providence, the end and
   complete accomplishment of that, whereof the intermediate blessing was
   a pledge or beginning.

   18. The application of this latter sort of prophecies to Christ, was
   never by reasonable men urged as being itself a proof that Jesus was
   the true Messiah. Nay, the application of the most direct and express
   prophecies whatsoever, (unless when the characters be so particular as
   not to be at all compatible to different persons, or the marks of time
   be very definite and exact,) has not of itself the nature of a direct
   or positive proof, but can only be a sine qua non, an application of
   certain marks or characters, without which no person could be the
   promised Messiah. Many men were of the seed of Abraham, and of the
   tribe of Judah, and of the family of David, and born in Bethlehem of
   Judea, and suffered, and were cut of; and yet neither any nor all of
   these characters could prove any man to be the promised Messiah, but
   the want of any one of them would prove that any man was not he. The
   proof of Jesus being the Christ were (John v. 36.) the works which his
   father gave him to finish. The application of direct and express
   prophecies to him is nothing but such a congruity of marks or
   characters as removes all objections by which an adversary would
   endeavour to prove that it was not he. Ought not Christ (Luke, xxiv.
   26.) to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory, is not
   proving from his sufferings, that Jesus was the Christ; but removing
   the objection, by which some were apt to infer from his sufferings that
   he could not possibly be the Christ. The application of indirect
   prophecies to him is only a giving of further light from the analogy
   and conformity of the Old Testament to the New, by way of illustration
   and confirmation, to such as have been before convinced by the direct
   proofs. The proof, therefore, of the truth of Christianity does not
   stand upon the application of prophecies; but the works by which Christ
   proved himself to be sent of God gave him a right to apply to himself
   the prophecies concerning the Messiah; and the marks or characters of
   the promised Messiah, given by the prophets, were so many tests by
   which his claim was to be tried. "Miracles," indeed, "can never render
   a foundation valid, which is in itself invalid; can never make a false
   inference true; can never make a prophecy fulfilled, which is not
   fulfilled; can never mark out a Messias, or Jesus for the Messias, if
   both are not marked out in the Old Testament:" But miracles can give a
   man a just and undeniable claim to be received as the promised Messiah,
   if the prophetic characters of the Messiah be applicable to him: And
   this it is by which Jesus was proved to be the Christ.

   19. From what has been said concerning the application of indirect
   prophecies, it is easy to observe the nature and use of types and
   figures, and allegorical manner of speaking; that these were much less
   intended to be ever alleged for proofs of the truth of a doctrine; and
   yet, in their proper place, may afford very great light and assistance
   towards the right understanding of it: An instance or two will make
   this matter obvious. There is a very remarkable passage in the epistle
   to the Galatians, where the apostle himself styles the thing he is
   speaking of, an (Gal. iv. 24.) allegory; that is, he draws an argument,
   a simile. The allegory, or similitude, he makes use of is not alleged
   by him as a "proof" of the truth of the doctrine he is asserting, but
   as a proof of the falseness and groundlessness of a particular
   objection urged by the unbelieving Jews against it: The doctrine the
   apostle asserts (both in the epistle to the Romans and in this to the
   Galatians,) is, that Christians of the Gentiles, who imitate the faith
   and obedience of Abraham, (being circumcised with the circumcision--of
   Christ, Col. ii. 11.) are equally capable of being admitted to the
   benefit of God's promises to his people, as the Jews of the literal
   circumcision, who were lineally descended from that patriarch. In
   opposition to this, the Jews alleged, that since to the Israelites
   confessedly (Rom. ix. 4.) pertained the adoption, and the glory, and
   the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and
   the promises; since theirs, confessedly, were the fathers or
   patriarchs, to whom all the promises of God were originally made, it
   could not possibly be true, nor consistent with the promises of God
   made to their fathers, that these Israelites, who had been all along
   the peculiar people or church of God, should at last be rejected for
   not receiving the gospel; and that believers from among the Gentiles of
   all nations should be received in their stead. Now, in reply to this
   objection, the apostle argues with the greatest justness and strength,
   from the analogy of a like case acknowledged by themselves, in which
   the reason of the thing was the same, even from the analogy of God's
   method and manner of proceeding in the giving of those very original
   promises to the patriarchs, upon which this prejudice of the Jews was
   founded. (Gal. iv. 21. &c.) Tell me, says he, ye that desire to be
   under the law, do ye not hear the law? That is, will ye not attend to
   the analogy of God's method of proceeding, in those very promises on
   which ye depend? For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one
   by a bond-maid, the other by a free woman: But he who was of the
   bond-woman, was born after the flesh; but he of the free woman, was by
   promise: Which things are an allegory, &c. That is to say, even
   originally, the promise was not made to all the children of Abraham,
   but to Isaac only, which was, from the beginning, a very plain
   declaration that God did not principally intend his promise to take
   place in (Rom. ix. 8.) Abraham's descendants according to the flesh,
   but in those who, by a faith or fidelity like his, were in a truer and
   higher sense the children and followers of that Great Father of the
   faithful. In like manner, and for the same reason, the promise was not
   made (Rom. ix. 10.) to both the sons of Isaac, but to Jacob only; and,
   among the posterity of Jacob, all (Rom. ix. 6.) were not Israel, which
   were of Israel. What ye (Gal. iv. 21.) yourselves, therefore, saith St.
   Paul, who are so desirous to be under the Mosaic law, cannot but
   acknowledge to have been originally and always true, the same is true
   (ver. 29.) now. What was true concerning the two sons of Abraham, and
   likewise concerning the two sons of Isaac, who were the patriarchs with
   whom God's covenant was originally made, is, by continuance of the same
   analogy, true concerning the covenant established with the families,
   and with the nation of the Jews, descended from those patriarchs; it is
   true concerning the church of God through all successive ages; it is
   true concerning the (Gal. iv. 25.) Jerusalem which now is, and
   concerning that which is to come. As (ver. 22.) Abraham had two sons,
   the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free woman: And as (ver. 30.)
   the son of the bond-maid, though, according to the flesh, no less truly
   his natural descendant than the other, yet was not to be co-heir with
   him, who, by the promise of God, was appointed to inherit: So, says the
   apostle, the (ver. 25. 26.) Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage
   with her children, the visible earthly church, which received the
   external ceremonial law from Mount Sina, is not, by that outward
   general denomination, entitled to the eternal favour of God: But the
   Jerusalem which is above, which is the mother of us all, of all who, by
   true faith and sincere obedience are pleasing to God; this heavenly
   Jerusalem, this spiritual invisible church or city of the living God it
   is, to which all the promises of God, made in all ages to his church,
   are, in reality, originally and finally appropriated.

   From this remarkable instance, it is well worth observing, by the way,
   that when the apostles are supposed to argue with the Jews ad hominem,
   the meaning is, that arguments alleged by the apostles to the Jews in
   particular, differ from arguments brought to the Gentiles, in this; not
   that they were at any time arguments drawn from things acknowledged by
   the Jews, and in themselves otherwise inconclusive; but that they were
   drawn, justly and strongly, from things well known among the Jews,
   though what the Gentiles were strangers to.

   The correspondences of types and antetypes, though they are not
   themselves proper proofs of the truth of a doctrine, yet they may be
   very reasonable confirmations of the foreknowledge of God; of the
   uniform view of providence under different dispensations; of the
   analogy, harmony, and agreement between the Old Testament and the New.
   The words in the law, concerning one particular kind of death, (Deut.
   xxi. 23.) He that is hanged is accursed of God, can hardly be conceived
   to have been put in upon any other account than with a view and
   foresight to the application made of it by St. Paul. (Gal. iii. 13.)
   The analogies between the (Exod. xii. 22. 46. Johni. 29. xix. 36. Rev.
   i. 5.) Paschal Lamb, and the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of
   the world; between the Egyptian bondage and the tyranny of sin; between
   the (1 Cor. x. 1, 2.) baptism of the Israelites in the sea and in the
   cloud, and the baptism of Christians; between the (Heb. iii. 15.-9. iv.
   1, 2, 3. 1 Cor. x. 1-11.) passage through the wilderness, and through
   the present world; between (Heb. iv. 8. 9.) Jesus [Joshua] bringing the
   people into the promised land, and Jesus Christ being the captain of
   salvation to believers; between the Sabbath of rest (Heb. iv. 5. ix.
   1.) promised to the people of God in the earthly Canaan, and the
   eternal rest promised in the heavenly Canaan; between the (Numb. xxxv.
   25. 28.) liberty granted from the time of the death of the High Priest,
   to him that had fled into a city of refuge, and the redemption
   purchased by the death of Christ; between the (Heb. ix. 25.) High
   Priest entering into the holy place every year with blood of others,
   and Christ's (Heb. iv. 12, 24, 26.) once entering with his own blood
   into heaven itself, to appear in the presence of God for us; these (I
   say) and innumerable other analogies, between the (Col.ii. 17.) shadows
   of things to come, the (Heb. x. i.) shadows of good things to come, the
   (Heb. viii. 5.) shadows of heavenly things, the (Heb. ix. 9.) figures
   for the time then present, the (Heb. ix. 23.) patterns of things in the
   heavens, and (Heb. ix. 2.) the heavenly things themselves; cannot,
   without the force of strong prejudice, be conceived to have happened by
   mere chance, without any foresight or design. There are no such
   analogies, much less such series of analogies, found in the books of
   mere enthusiastic writers, much less of enthusiastic writers living in
   such remote ages from each other. It is much more credible and
   reasonable to suppose, (what St. Paul affirms,) that (1 Cor. x. 6.)
   these things were our examples; and that, in the uniform course of
   God's government of the world, (Ver. 11.) all these things happened
   unto them of old for ensamples, and they are written for our
   admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. And hence arises
   that aptness of similitude, in the application of several legal
   performances to the morality of the gospel, that it can very hardly be
   supposed not to have been originally intended. As (1 Cor. v. 6, 7, 8.)
   know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out
   therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are
   unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.
   Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the
   leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of
   sincerity and truth. Again; (Phil. iii. 3.) we are the circumcision,
   which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus; and have
   no confidence in the flesh. And (Col. ii, 13, 11.) you being dead in
   your sins, and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath God quickened
   together with Christ:--In whom also ye are circumcised with the
   circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of
   the flesh, by [the Christian, the spiritual circumcision,] the
   circumcision of Christ. And (1 Cor. ix. 13, 14, 8, 9, 10. 1 Tim. v.
   18.) do ye not know that they which--wait at the altar, are partakers
   with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach
   the gospel should live of the gospel.--Say I these things as a man? or
   saith not the law the same also? for it is written in the law of Moses,
   thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn.
   Doth God take care for oxen? or saith he it altogether for our sakes?

   Some applications of texts out of the Old Testament are mere allusions;
   that is, nothing more is intended to be affirmed than that the words
   spoken in the Old Testament are as truly and as justly applicable to
   the present occasion as they were to that upon which they were
   originally spoken. Of this kind I think is that of St. Matthew:--(Matt.
   iii. 17.--Jer.xxxi. 15.) Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by
   Jeremiah the prophet, saying, in Rama there was a voice heard,
   lamentation and weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her
   children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. Thus
   likewise St. Paul:--(2 Cor. viii. 13, 14, 15.) I mean not that other
   men be eased, and you burdened; but by an equality; as it is written he
   that had gathered much, had nothing over; and he that had gathered
   little, had no lack. Again:--(Is. vi. 9.) What Isaiah says of the Jews,
   (supposing he did not speak there prophetically, though the solemnity
   of the introduction makes it much more reasonable to believe he did:
   But, supposing he spake of the Jews in his own time,) Go and tell this
   people, hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye, indeed, but
   perceive not; make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears
   heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear
   with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert and be
   healed: was (Matt. xiii. 14.) fulfilled, was verified, was equally
   true, equally applicable to the Jews, in our Saviour's days. Of the
   same kind seems to be (Matt.viii. 17.) St. Matthew's explication of
   that passage in (Is. liii. 4.) Isaiah; Surely he hath borne our griefs
   and carried our sorrows. The sense of the words in the prophecy is what
   St. Peter expresses:--(1 Pet. ii. 24.) Who his own self bare our sins
   in his own body on the tree. And the Apostle to the Hebrews:--(Heb. ix.
   28.) Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many. Yet St. Matthew
   says:--(Matt. viii. 16, 17.) He healed all that were sick, that it
   might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
   himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. His meaning is,
   Christ healed diseases in such a manner, that even in that sense also
   the words of Isaiah were literally verified. To give but one instance
   more; (Matt. xiii. 34, 35.) All these things, (saith the evangelist)
   spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables,--that it might be fulfilled
   which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in
   parables, I will utter things which have been kept secret from the
   foundation of the world: That is, the words (Ps. lxxviii. 2.) of the
   psalmist were as properly, as truly, and as justly applicable to the
   things which our Lord spoke, as to the occasion upon which they were
   originally spoken by the psalmist.

   To such as are accustomed only to modern languages, and understand not
   the nature of the Hebrew and Syriac speech, it may seem very
   surprising, that, in the (Matt. viii. 17.--xiii. 35.) two
   last-mentioned passages, the citations are introduced with these words,
   That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, &c.
   But all who understand those languages well know, that the phrase
   answering to these expressions, hina plerothe, that it might be
   fulfilled; mean nothing more than, hereby was verified, or, so that
   hereby was verified, or the like. And they who understand not the
   languages may yet easily apprehend this, by considering the nature and
   force of some other expressions of the like kind. As: (Jer.xxvii. 15.)
   They prophecy a lie in my name, that I might drive you out. (Matt.
   xxiii. 34, 35.) Behold, I send unto you prophets,--That upon you may
   come all the righteous blood. With (Exod. xi. 9.--xvii. 3.--Numb.
   xxxii. 14.--Ps. li. 4.--Jer.vii. 18.--Matt. x. 34, 35.) many other
   passages of the same nature; where the words "that such a thing may
   be," do not at all signify the intention, "to the end that it may be,"
   but merely the event, "so that it will be." In the case of the most
   direct and express prophecies of all, the words, "this was done, that
   it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet," never do, never
   possibly can signify literally, that the thing was done for that end,
   that the prophecy might be fulfilled; because, on the reverse, the
   reason why any thing is predicted always is, because the thing was
   (before that prediction) appointed to be done. Much more, therefore, in
   the case of indirect prophecies, the words--this was done, that it
   might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet--necessarily and
   evidently mean this only, that the thing was so done, as that thereby
   or therein was verified what the prophet had spoken.

   20. It cannot, therefore, with any sort of reason or justice, be
   inferred from such citations out of the Old Testament as I have now
   mentioned, that the apostles either misunderstood, or enthusiastically
   misapplied the writings of the prophets. Nor can any just argument be
   drawn against the authority of the books of the Old and New Testament
   from such topics as these; that the copies of the law, in the times of
   the idolatrous kings of Judah and Israel, were well nigh lost, that
   some texts cited out of the Old Testament by the writers of the New,
   are not now found in the Old Testament at all; that other texts are
   read differently in the Old Testament itself, from the citations of the
   same texts recorded in the New, and the like: Which things have indeed
   given occasion to weak and ridiculous writers to invent certain
   senseless rules or regulations, according to which men may at any time
   rightly make what wrong quotations they please: But, in truth, the
   things themselves I am here speaking of are nothing but what must of
   necessity happen in a long succession of ages.

   When--(2 Chr. xxxiv. 14.) Hilkiah the priest (in the days of Josiah,)
   found, in the house of the Lord, a book of the law of the Lord, given
   by Moses; it is very probable, indeed, from the circumstances of the
   history, that copies of the law were then very scarce, and that this
   found by Hilkiah, was, to his surprise, an authentic or original copy.
   But that the whole should have been at that time a forgery of Hilkiah,
   is evidently impossible, because the very being and polity of the
   nation, as well as their religion, was founded upon the acknowledgment
   of the law of Moses, how much soever idolatrous kings might at certain
   times have corrupted that religion, and caused the study of the law to
   have been neglected. And in the very same book, wherein the account is
   given of this particular fact, of Hilkiah's finding a copy [an
   authentic copy] of the law, it is expressly and at large recorded how,
   in a foregoing reign, the king--(2 Chr. xvii. 7. 8, 9.) sent to his
   princes--to teach in the cities of Judah, and with them he sent Levites
   and priests;--and they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of
   the Lord with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah,
   and taught the people.

   That, in length of time, some whole books should have been lost, is
   nothing wonderful. There are several books expressly cited in the Old
   Testament, of which we have now nothing remaining. That in the books
   which remain there should sometimes, for want of infallibility in
   transcribers, [374] happen omissions, transpositions, and various
   readings, is still less to be wondered at. Nothing but perpetual
   miracle could prevent it: They who have skill to compare, in the
   original, certain passages in the books of Chronicles, with the
   correspondent places in the books of Kings, or the 18th Psalm, with 2
   Sam. c. xxii. which is a transcript of the same Psalm, or the 14thPsalm
   with the 53d, which are also one and the same Psalm transcribed; and,
   much more, they who can compare the Septuagint translation with the
   original will be able to find instances of these things, and very often
   also to see plainly how and whence they happened: (All which, far from
   diminishing the authority of the books, are strong arguments of their
   antiquity, and against their having been forged by Esdras, or any other
   hand.) What wonder then is it, that among the numerous texts cited in
   the New Testament out of the Old, one or two should now not be found in
   our present copies of the Old Testament, and that some others should be
   read differently in the Old Testament, from the citations of the same
   texts recorded in the New? Or how does this at all affect the authority
   of either, when much the greatest part of the texts cited agree
   perfectly either in words or at least in sense; and the whole series,
   harmony, analogy, connexion, and uniformity of both, compared with the
   system of natural and moral truths, and with the history of the world
   and the state of nations, through a long succession of ages, from the
   days of Moses to this present time, shows that the books are not the
   result of random and enthusiastic imaginations, but of long foresight
   and design? for the spirit of enthusiasm is very hardly consistent with
   itself through the writings of one single person. How then is it
   possible that for 3000 years together, and pretending too (through all
   that time) to an uniform series of predictions, it should happen never
   to have fallen into such a track of expected events, as the nature and
   truth of things and the situation of the kingdoms of the world should
   have rendered absolutely impossible, and altogether incapable of any
   farther, much less of any final completion?

   21. I shall conclude this head with pointing at some particular
   extraordinary prophecies, which deserve to be carefully considered and
   compared with the events, whether they could possibly have proceeded
   from chance or from enthusiasm. Some of them are of such a nature as
   that they can only be judged of by persons learned in history, and
   these I shall but just mention. Others are obvious to the consideration
   of the whole world, and with those I shall finish what I think proper
   at this time to offer upon this subject.

   Concerning Babylon, "it was particularly foretold [375] that it (Is.
   xiii. 17. xxi. 2.) should be shut up, and besieged by the Medes,
   Elamites, and Armenians: That the river should be dried up: (Jer. l.
   38. li. 36.) That the city should be taken in the time of a feast,
   (Jer.li. 39. 57.) while her--mighty men were drunken; which accordingly
   came to pass," when "Belshazzar and all his thousand princes, who were
   drunk with him at the feast," were "slain by Cyrus's soldiers;"
   (Cyropædia, lib. 7.) Also it was particularly foretold, "that God would
   make the country of Babylon (Is. xiv. 23.) a possession for the
   bittern, and pools of water; which was accordingly fulfilled by the
   overflowing and drowning of it, on the breaking down of the great dam
   in order to take the city." Could the correspondence of these events
   with the predictions be the result of chance? But suppose these
   predictions were forged after the event; can the following ones also
   have been written after the event? or with any reason be ascribed to
   chance? (Jer. l. 39.) The wild beasts of the desert--shall dwell there,
   and the owls shall dwell therein: And it shall be no more inhabited for
   ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: As
   God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, &c. (Jer. li. 26. xxxvii. 64.) They
   shall not take of thee a stone for a corner,--but thou shalt be
   desolate for ever, saith the Lord:--Babylon shall become heaps, a
   dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment and an hissing without an
   inhabitant:--It shall sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I
   will bring upon her. (Is. i. 19, 20, 21.) Babylon, the glory of
   kingdoms,--shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah: It shall
   never be inhabited; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to
   generation: Neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall
   the shepherds make their fold there: But wild beasts of the desert
   shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures;
   and owls shall dwell there.

   Concerning Egypt, was the following prediction forged after the event?
   Or, can it, with any reason, be ascribed to chance? (Ezek. xxix. 14,
   15.) Egypt--shall be a base kingdom: It shall be the basest of
   kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: For
   I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.

   Concerning Tyre, the prediction is no less remarkable: (Ezek.xxvi. 14,
   21.) I will make thee like the top of a rock; thou shalt be a place to
   spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more;--thou shalt be no more;
   (Ezek. xxvii. 36.) The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee;
   thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more. (Ezek. xxviii.
   19.) All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
   thee.

   The description of the extent of the dominion of that people, who were
   to possess Judea in the latter days; Was it forged after the event? Or
   can it reasonably be ascribed to chance? (Dan. xi. 40, 41, 42, 43.) He
   shall come--with horsemen and with many ships, and--shall overflow and
   pass over: He shall enter also into the glorious land, [and (ver.45.)
   shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the
   glorious holy mountain;] and many countries shall be overthrown: But
   these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom and Moab, and the chief
   of the children of Ammon. He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the
   countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape. But he shall have
   power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the
   precious things of Egypt; and the Lybians and Ethiopians [ksym] shall
   be at his steps.

   When Daniel, [376] in the vision of Nebuchadnezzar's image foretold
   (Dan. ii. 38-44.) four great successive monarchies; was this written
   after the event? Or can the congruity of his description with the
   things themselves reasonably be ascribed to mere chance?

   When the angel says to Daniel; (Dan. ix. 24.) seventy weeks [377] are
   determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the
   transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation
   for iniquity, &c. Was this written after the event? Or can it
   reasonably be ascribed to chance, that from (Ezra, vii. 6, 7, 8.) the
   seventh year of Artaxerxes the king, (when Ezra went up from
   Babylon--unto Jerusalem with a commission to restore the government of
   the Jews,) to the death of Christ; [378] [from ann. Nabonass. 290, to
   ann. Nabonass. 788,] should be precisely 490. [70 weeks of] years?

   When the angel tells Daniel, that (Dan. ix. 25.) threescore and two
   weeks the street [of Jerusalem] shall be built again, and the wall,
   even in troublous times [vvtsvq htym, but this in troublous times not
   like those that should be under Messiah the prince, when he should come
   to reign;] was this written after the event? Or can it reasonably be
   ascribed to chance, that from the twenty-eighth of Artaxerxes, [379]
   when the walls were finished, to the birth of Christ, [from ann.
   Nabonass. 311, to ann. Nobonass. 745,] should be precisely 434 [62
   weeks of] years?

   When Daniel further says; (Dan. ix. 27.) and he shall confirm [or
   nevertheless he shall confirm] the covenant with many for one week; was
   this written after the event? Or can it reasonably be ascribed to
   chance, that from the death of Christ, (anno Dom.33,) to the command
   given first to St Peter to preach to Cornelius and the Gentiles, (anno
   Dom. 40,) should be exactly seven [one week of] years?

   When he still adds; (Dan. ix. 27.) and in the midst of the week
   [$word$, and in half a week] he shall cause the sacrifice and the
   oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall
   make it desolate: Was this written after the event? Or can it with any
   reason be ascribed to chance, that from Vespasian's marching into Judea
   in the spring anno Dom. 67, to the taking of Jerusalem by Titus in the
   autumn anno Dom. 70, should be [half a septenary of years,] three years
   and a half?

   When the same Daniel foretels a tyrannical power, which should wear out
   the saints of the Most High, and they should be given into his hand
   until (Dan. vii. 25.) a time and times and the dividing of time, and
   (Dan. xii. 7.) again, for a time, [380] times, and a half: (Which can
   no way be applied to the short persecution of Antiochus, because these
   prophecies are expressly declared to be (Dan. viii. 26.) for many days
   concerning (Dan. x. 14.) what shall befal thy people in the latter
   days, for yet the vision is for many days, concerning (ch. viii. 17.)
   the time of the end, (ch. viii. 19.) what shall be in the last end of
   the indignation; concerning those who (ch. xi. 33.) shall fall by the
   sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, many days; (ch. xi. 35.)
   to try them, even to the time of the end, because it is yet for a time
   appointed; concerning (ch. xii. 1.) a time of trouble, such as never
   was since there was a nation; the time (ch. xii. 7.) when God shall
   have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people; (ch. xii.
   9.) the time of the end, till which the words are closed up and sealed;
   (ch. xii. 4.) to which the prophet is commanded to shut up his words,
   and seal the book, for many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall
   be increased: even (ch. xii. 13.) the end, till which Daniel was to
   rest, and then stand in his lot at the end of the days. When Daniel, I
   say, foretels such a tyrannical power to continue such a determined
   period of time; and St John prophecies that the (Rev. xi. 2.) Gentiles
   should tread the holy city under foot, forty and two months, which is
   exactly the same period of time with that of Daniel: And again, that
   (Rev. xi. 3.) two witnesses clothed in sackcloth, should prophesy a
   thousand two hundred and threescore days, which is again exactly the
   very same period of time: And again, that the (Rev. xii. 6.) woman
   which fled into the wilderness from persecution, should continue there
   a thousand two hundred and threescore days: And again, that she should
   (Rev. xii. 14.) fly into the wilderness for a time, and times, and half
   a time; which is still the very same period: And again, that a wild
   beast, a tyrannical power, (ch. xiii. 7.) to whom it was given to make
   war with the saints, and to overcome them, was (ch. xiii. 5.) to
   continue forty and two months, [381] (still the very same period of
   time,) and to have (ch. xiii. 7, 8.) power over all kindreds, and
   tongues, and nations, so that all that dwell upon the earth should
   worship him: Is it credible, or possible, that ignorant and
   enthusiastical writers should, by mere chance, hit upon such
   coincidences of [occult] numbers? especially since St John could not
   possibly take the numbers from Daniel, if he understood Daniel to mean
   nothing more than the short persecution of Antiochus. And if he did
   understand Daniel to mean a much longer, and greater, and more remote
   tyranny, which John himself prophesied of as in his time still future;
   then the wonder is still infinitely greater that in those early times,
   when there was not the least footstep in the world of any such power as
   St John distinctly describes, (but which now is very conspicuous, as I
   shall presently observe more particularly,) it should ever enter the
   heart of man to conceive so much as the possibility of such a power,
   sitting, not upon the pavilion of heathen persecutors, but expressly (2
   Thess. ii. 4.) in the temple and upon the seat of God himself.

   But these prophecies, which either relate to particular places, or
   depend upon the computation of particular periods of time, are (as I
   said) of such a nature as that they cannot be judged of but by persons
   skilled in history. There are some others more general, running through
   the whole Scripture, and obvious to the consideration of the whole
   world.

   For instance; it was foretold by Moses that when the Jews forsook the
   true God, they should (Deut.xxviii. 25.) be removed into all the
   kingdoms of the earth; should be (Levit. xxvi. 33.) scattered among the
   heathen, (Deut. iv. 27.) among the nations, (Deut. xxviii. 64.) among
   all people from the one end of the earth, even unto the other, should
   there be (Deut. iv. 37.) left few in number among the heathen, and
   (Levit. xxvi. 39.) pine away in their iniquity in their enemies' lands;
   and should (Deut. xxviii. 37.) become an astonishment, a proverb, and a
   by-word among all nations; and that (Deut. xxviii. 65.) among these
   nations they should find no ease, neither should the sole of their foot
   have rest; but the Lord should give them a trembling heart, and failing
   of eyes, and sorrow of mind; and (Levit. xxvi. 36.) send a faintness
   into their hearts, in the lands of their enemies, so that the sound of
   a shaken leaf should chace them. Had any thing like this in Moses's
   time ever happened to any nation? Or was there in nature any
   probability that any such thing should ever happen to any people? that,
   when they were conquered by their enemies, and led into captivity, they
   should neither continue in the place of their captivity, nor be
   swallowed up and lost among their conquerors, but be scattered among
   all the nations of the world, and hated by all nations for many ages,
   and yet continue a people? Or could any description of the Jews,
   written at this day, possibly be a more exact and lively picture of the
   state they have now been in for many ages, than this prophetic
   description given by Moses more than 3000 years ago?

   The very same thing is in like manner continually predicted through all
   the following prophets; that God would (Jer. ix. 16. Ezek. iv. 13.)
   scatter them among the heathen; that he would (Jer. xv. 4. xxiv. 9.
   xxix. 18. xxxiv. 17.) cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
   earth; that he would (Ezek. v. 10, 12.) scatter them into all the
   winds, and (Ezek. xx. 23. xxii. 15.) disperse them through the
   countries of the heathen; that he would (Amos, ix. 9.) sift them among
   all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve; that (Jer. xxiv. 9.
   xxix. 18) in all the kingdoms of the earth, whither they should be
   driven, they should be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse,
   and an astonishment, and an hissing; and that they should (Hos. iii.
   4.) abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a
   sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without
   teraphim. And here concerning the predictions of Ezekiel, it is
   remarkable in particular that they being spoken (See Ezek. i. 1. iii.
   11. xi. 24.) in the very time of the Babylonian captivity, it is
   therefore evident, from the time of his prophesying, as well as from
   the nature and description of the thing itself, that he must needs be
   understood of that latter (Tobit, xiv. 5.) "captivity into all places,"
   which was to happen after the "fulfilling the time of that age" wherein
   God was first to "bring them again" (out of the Babylonian captivity)
   "into the land where they should build a temple," but not like to that
   which afterwards (after their final return) should "be built for ever
   with a glorious building." The fore-cited prophecies (I say) must of
   necessity be understood of that wide and long dispersion which in the
   New Testament also is expressly mentioned by (Luke xxi. 24) our
   Saviour, and by (Rom. xi. 25.) St Paul.

   It is also, further, both largely and distinctly predicted as well by
   Moses himself, as by all the following prophets: that, notwithstanding
   this unexampled dispersion of God's people, (Levit. xxvi. 44.) yet, for
   all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, God will not
   destroy them utterly; but (Deut. xxx. 1, 2, 3, 4.) when they shall call
   to mind among all the nations whither God has driven them, and shall
   return unto the Lord, he will turn their captivity, and gather them
   from all the nations,--from the utmost parts of heaven,--(Deut. iv.
   30.) even in the latter days: That (Jer. xxx. 11.) though he makes a
   full end of all other nations, yet will he not make a full end of them;
   but (Isa. x. 21, 22. vi. 13. Jer. xxiii. 3. Ezek. vi. 8, 9.) a remnant
   of them shall be preserved, and return out of all countries whither God
   has driven them: That he (Amos, ix. 9.) will sift the house of Israel
   among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the
   least grain fall upon the earth: That (Isa. xi. 11.-16. xxvii. 13.) the
   Lord shall set his hand again the second time, to recover the remnant
   of his people,--and shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
   assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of
   Judah, from the four corners of the earth: For (Isa. xliii. 5, 6. Jer.
   xvi. 15. xxiii. 7, 8. xxxi. 8-12. xxxii. 37, &c. Ezek. xi. 15, 16, 17.
   xx. 41. xxviii. 25. xxxiv. 12, 13. xxxvi. 24. xxxvii. 21. xxxix. 27,
   28, 29.) I will bring thy seed from the east, saith the Lord, and
   gather thee from the west; I will say to the north, give up; and to the
   south, keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the
   ends of the earth: (Isa. xlix. 22. lx. 8, 9, 10. lxvi. 20.) Behold I
   will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the
   people, and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters
   shall be carried upon their shoulders: (Isa. liv. 7, and the whole
   chapter.) For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercy
   will I gather thee; in a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a
   moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee. And
   that these prophecies might not be applied to the return from the 70
   years' captivity in Babylon, (which moreover was not a dispersion into
   all nations,) they are expressly referred to the latter days, not only
   by (Deut. iv. 30.) Moses, but by (Hos. iii. 4, 5.) Hosea, who lived
   long after, (for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
   king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice: afterward they
   shall return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king, and
   shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter days;) and by
   Ezekiel, who lived in the captivity itself, (Ezek. xxxviii. 8. xii. 14,
   16.) after many days [speaking of those who should oppose the return of
   the Israelites,] thou shalt be visited, in the latter years thou shalt
   come into the land;--upon the people that are gathered out of the
   nations;--in that day, when my people of Israel dwelleth safely,--thou
   shalt come up against them,--it shall be in the latter days. These
   predictions therefore necessarily belong to that age, when (Luke xxi.
   24.) the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled, and (Rom. xi. 25,
   29.) the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. And that, through all the
   changes which have happened in the kingdoms of the earth, from the days
   of Moses to the present time, which is more than 3000 years, nothing
   should have happened to prevent the possibility of the accomplishment
   of these prophecies, but, on the contrary, the state of the Jewish and
   Christian nations at this day should be such as renders them easily
   capable, not only of a figurative, but even of a literal completion in
   every particular, if the will of God be so; this (I say) is a miracle,
   which hath nothing parallel to it in the phenomena of nature.

   Another instance, no less extraordinary, is as follows. Daniel foretels
   (Dan. vii. 23.) a kingdom upon the earth, which shall be divers from
   all kingdoms, (ver. 7.) divers from all that were before it, (ver. 19.)
   exceeding dreadful, (ver. 23.) and shall devour the whole earth: That,
   among the powers into which this kingdom shall be divided, there shall
   arise one power (ver. 24.) divers from the rest, who (ver.8, 8. 20.)
   shall subdue unto himself three of the first powers, and he shall have
   (ver. 8. 20.) a mouth speaking very great things, and a look more stout
   than his fellows. He shall (ver. 21.) make war with the saints, and
   prevail against them; (ver. 25.) And he shall speak great words against
   the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and
   think to change times and laws; and they shall be given into his hand,
   for a long season; even till (ver. 26. 27.) the judgment shall sit,
   and--the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of
   the saints of the Most High. (Dan. xi. 36. &c.) He shall exalt himself
   and magnify himself above every God, and shall speak marvellous things
   against the God of Gods;--Neither shall he regard the God of his
   fathers, (the God of Gods, as in the foregoing verse,) nor the desire
   of women, (forbidding to marry, 1 Tim. iv. 3.) nor regard any God; for
   he shall magnify himself above all: And in his estate shall he honour
   [382] the God of forces; and a God [383] whom his fathers knew not
   shall he honour.--Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a
   strange God, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory; and he
   shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.
   Suppose now all this to be spoken by Daniel, of nothing more than the
   short persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes; which that it cannot be I
   have shown above: But suppose it were, and that it was all forged after
   the event; yet this cannot be the case of St. Paul, and St. John, who
   describe exactly a like power, and in like words; speaking of things to
   come in the latter days, of things still future in their time, and of
   which there was then no footsteps, no appearance in the world. The day
   of Christ, saith St. Paul, (2 Thess. ii. 3, &c.) shall not come, except
   there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the
   son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is
   called God, or that is worshipped; so that he, as God, [384] sitteth in
   the temple of God, showing himself that he is God: Whose coming is
   after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying
   wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness. Again, (1 Tim
   iv. 1, &c.) the spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
   some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and
   doctrines of devils; [385] --forbidding to marry, and commanding to
   abstain from meats, &c. St John, in like manner, prophesies of a wild
   beast, or tyrannical power, to whom was given (Rev. xiii. 2, 5, 6, 7,
   8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17.) great authority, and a mouth speaking great
   things, and blasphemies; and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against
   God: And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
   overcome them; and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues,
   and nations; and all that dwell upon the earth, shall worship him.--And
   he that exerciseth his power before him,--doth great wonders,--and
   deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, by the means of those miracles
   which he had power to do.--And he causeth--that no man might buy or
   sell, save he that had the mark of the name of the beast. And the kings
   of the earth (Rev. xvii. 13, 15, 17.) have one mind, and shall give
   their power and strength unto the beasts;--even peoples, and
   multitudes, and nations, and tongues.--For God hath put in their hearts
   [in the hearts of the kings,] to fulfil his will, and to agree, and
   give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be
   fulfilled. The name of the person, in whose hands the (Rev. xvii. 3,
   7.) reins or principal direction of the exercise of this power is
   lodged, is (Rev. xvii. 5.) mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of
   harlots, and abominations of the earth: (Ver. 2.) With whom the kings
   of the earth [386] have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of
   the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication: And
   she herself is (Rev. xvii, 6.) drunken with the blood of the saints,
   and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: And (Rev. xviii. 23, 24.)
   by her [387] sorceries are all nations deceived: And in her is found
   the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that are slain upon
   the earth. And this person, [the political person,] to whom these
   titles and characters belong, is (Rev. xvii. 18.) that great city,
   (standing (ver. 9) upon seven mountains,) which reigneth over the kings
   of the earth.

   If in the days of St Paul, and St John, there was any footstep of such
   a sort of power as this in the world; or if there ever had been any
   such power in the world; or if there was then any appearance of
   probability that could make it enter into the heart of man to imagine
   that there ever could be any such kind of power in the world, much less
   in (2 Thess. ii. 4.) the temple or church of God; and if there be not
   now such a power actually and conspicuously exercised in the world; and
   if any picture of this power drawn, after the event, can now describe
   it more plainly and exactly than it was originally described in the
   words of the prophecy; then may it with some degree of plausibleness be
   suggested that the prophecies are nothing more than enthusiastic
   imaginations.

   Thirdly; Of the testimony of our Saviour's disciples as an evidence of
   the truth of the Christian revelation. The chief evidence of the facts
   on which the truth and certainty of the Christian revelation depend, to
   us who live now at this distance of time, is the testimony of our
   Saviour's followers; which, in all its circumstances, was the most
   credible, certain, and convincing evidence that ever was given to any
   matter of fact in the world.

   To make the testimony of our Saviour's followers a sufficient evidence
   to us in this case, there can be required but these three things: What
   things are requisite to make the testimony of our Saviour's disciples a
   complete evidence. 1. That it be certain the apostles could not be
   imposed upon themselves: 2. That it be certain they neither had nor
   could have any design to impose upon others: And, 3. That it be certain
   their testimony is truly conveyed down to us unto this day. All which
   things are indeed abundantly certain, and clear enough to satisfy any
   reasonable and unprejudiced person.

   For 1. That the apostles could not be imposed upon themselves. That the
   apostles could not be imposed upon themselves, is evident from what has
   been already said concerning the nature, and number, and publicness, of
   our Saviour's miracles: They conversed from the beginning with our
   Saviour himself; they heard with their ears, and saw with their eyes;
   they looked upon, and they handled with their hands of the word of
   life, as St John expresses it, (1 John, i. 1.) They saw all the
   prophecies of the Old Testament precisely fulfilled in his life and
   doctrine, his sufferings and death: They saw him confirm what he
   taught, with such mighty and evident miracles, as his bitterest and
   most malicious enemies could not but confess to be supernatural, even
   at the same time that they obstinately blasphemed the Holy Spirit that
   worked them: They saw him alive after his passion, by many infallible
   proofs; he appearing, not only to one or two, but to all the eleven,
   several times, and once to above five hundred together. And this, not
   merely in a transient manner, but they conversed with him familiarly
   for no less than forty days, and at last they beheld him ascend visibly
   into heaven; and soon after they received the Spirit, according to his
   promise. These were such sensible demonstrations of his being a teacher
   sent from heaven, and, consequently, that his doctrine was an immediate
   and express revelation of the will of God, that, if the apostles, even
   though they had been men of the weakest judgments and strongest
   imaginations that can be supposed, could be all and every one of them
   deceived in all these several instances; men can have no use of their
   senses, nor any possible proof of any facts whatsoever, nor any means
   to distinguish the best attested truths in the world, from enthusiastic
   imaginations.

   2. That the apostles could have no design of imposing upon others. It
   is certain the apostles neither had nor could have any design of
   imposing upon others. This is evident both from the nature of the
   things they did and suffered, and from the characters of the persons
   themselves: They confirmed what they taught by signs and miracles; they
   lived according to the doctrine they preached, though manifestly
   contrary to all the interests and pleasures of this present world; and,
   which deceivers can never be supposed to do, they died with all
   imaginable cheerfulness and joy of mind, for the testimony of their
   doctrine and the confirmation of their religion. This, I say, is what
   deceivers can never possibly be supposed to do: For it is very
   remarkable the apostles did not lay down their lives for their
   opinions, (which enthusiasts may possibly be supposed to do,) but in
   attestation to facts of their own knowledge: They were innocent and
   plain men, that had no bad ends to serve, nor preferment to hope for in
   the world: Their religion itself taught them to expect, not dominion
   and glory, not the praise of men, not riches and honour, not power and
   ease, not pleasure nor profit,--but poverty and want, trouble and
   vexation, persecution and oppression, imprisonments, banishments, and
   death: These things are not the marks and tokens of impostors. Besides
   the success and event of their undertaking, that plain and illiterate
   men should be able to preach their doctrine to many different nations,
   of different languages, and prevail also in establishing the belief of
   it; that they should all agree exactly in their testimony, and none of
   them be prevailed upon, either by hopes or fears, to desert their
   companions, and discover the imposture, if there had been any; these
   things plainly show that their doctrine was more than human, and not a
   contrivance to impose upon the world. This argument is excellently
   urged by Eusebius: Is it a thing possible to be conceived, saith he,
   that deceivers and unlearned men, men that understood no other language
   but their mother tongue, [388] should ever think of attempting so
   extravagant a thing as to travel over all nations? and not only so, but
   that they should be able also to accomplish their design, and establish
   their doctrine in all parts of the world? Consider, moreover, how
   remarkable a thing it is, that they should in no respect disagree one
   from another in the account they gave of the actions of Christ. For if,
   in all questions of fact, and in all trials at law, and in all ordinary
   disputes, the agreement of several witnesses is always accounted
   sufficient to determine satisfactorily the matter in question; is it
   not an abundant evidence of the truth in this case, that twelve
   apostles, and seventy disciples, and innumerable other believers, have
   borne witness to the actions of Christ, with the most exact and perfect
   agreement among themselves; and not only so, but have endured also all
   kinds of torments, and even death itself, to confirm their testimony?
   Again, that illiterate men, saith he, [389] should preach the name of
   Christ in all parts of the world, some of them in Rome itself, the
   imperial city, others in Persia, others in Armenia, others in Parthia,
   others in Scythia, others in India, and the farthest parts of the
   world, and others beyond the sea, in the British isles: This I cannot
   but think to be a thing far exceeding the power of man, much more the
   power of ignorant and unlearned men, and still much more the power of
   cheats and deceivers. And again: No one of them, saith he, [390] being
   ever terrified at the torments and deaths of others, forsook his
   companions, or ever preached contrary to them, and detected the
   forgery. Nay, on the contrary, that one, who did forsake his master in
   his life-time, and betray him to his enemies, being self-condemned,
   destroyed himself with his own hands. And much more to the same
   purpose, may be found, excellently said by the same author, in the
   seventh chapter of the third book of his Demonstratio Evangelica.

   3. That the apostle's testimony had been truly conveyed down to us. It
   is very certain, that the apostles' testimony concerning the works and
   doctrine of Christ is truly and without corruption conveyed down to us,
   even unto this day; for they left this their testimony in their
   writings: Which writings have been delivered down to us by an
   uninterrupted succession, through all intermediate ages. Their books
   were all translated very early into several languages, and dispersed
   through all parts of the world; and have most of them been acknowledged
   to be the genuine writings of those whose names they bear, even by the
   bitterest enemies of Christianity in all ages. Passages, containing the
   most material doctrines, have been cited out of them by numberless
   authors, who lived in every age, from the very days of the apostles
   unto this time; so that there is no room or possibility of any
   considerable corruption, such as might in any wise diminish our
   certainty of the truth of the whole. In sum; there is no matter of fact
   in the world, attested in any history, with so many circumstances of
   credibility, with so many collateral evidences, and in every respect
   attended with so many marks of truth, as this concerning the doctrine
   and works of Christ.

   Of the authority of the books of Holy Scripture. And here, by the way,
   it is to be observed, that the peculiar authority which we attribute to
   the books of Holy Scripture contained in the New Testament, is founded
   in this; that they were written or dictated by the apostles themselves.
   The apostles were indued with the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost,
   at Pentecost: And this not only enabled them to preach the doctrine of
   Christ with power, but also effectually secured them from making any
   error, mistake, or false representation of it. And the very same
   authority, that by this singular privilege was added to their
   preaching, it is manifest, ought, for the same reason, to be equally
   attributed to their writings also. Now, all the books of the New
   Testament were either written by the apostles; or, which is the very
   same thing, approved and authorized by them. Most of the books were
   uncontrovertedly written by the apostles themselves, St Paul having
   been made one of that number by a commission from heaven, no less
   visible and sensible than that which was granted to the rest at
   Pentecost. And those books which were written by the companions of the
   apostles were either dictated, or at least approved and authorised by
   the apostles themselves. Thus, Eusebius expressly tells us, that St
   Peter reviewed and approved the gospel of St Mark, and that [391] it
   was this approbation that authorised it to be received by the churches.
   And Irenæus; that what St Mark wrote was dictated by St Peter; [392]
   and that the gospel of St Luke was only a transcript of St Paul's
   preaching. [393] And Tertullian in like manner; [394] St Mark was only
   St Peter's scribe, and St Luke St Paul's. And Eusebius; that St John
   [395] also reviewed the Gospels of St Mark and St Luke, and confirmed
   the truth of them. And, to mention no more, the same historian tells
   us, that (besides some smaller reasons drawn from some mistaken
   passages in the book itself) the chief reason why the authority of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews was questioned by some, was [396] because they
   thought it not to be written by St Paul himself.

   [381] There has prevailed among learned men a very important error as
   if the 1260 days, (or years) here spoken of, took their beginning from
   the rise of the tyranny here described: Whereas, on the contrary, the
   words of Daniel are express; that, not from the time of his rise, but
   after his having made war with the saints, and from the time of their
   being given into his hand, should be a time, and times, and the
   dividing of time, chap. vii. 24, 25. And St John no less expressly
   says, that the time, not of the two witnesses prophesying, (for in part
   of that time they had great power,) but of their prophesying in
   sackcloth, should be a thousand two hundred and threescore days, Rev.
   xi. 3. And the persecuted woman, after her flight, was to be actually
   in the wilderness, (and in her place there, of riches and honour,) a
   thousand two hundred and threescore days, chap. xii. 6. Wherefore also
   the forty and two months, (the very same period,) during which time
   power was given unto the wild beasts to continue, (in the original it
   is, poiesai, to do what he pleased, (Rev. xiii. 5.) evidently ought not
   to be reckoned from his rise, or from the time when the ten kings

Proposition XV.

   XV. Proposition XV. Lastly; They who will not, by the arguments and
   proofs before mentioned, be convinced of the truth and certainty of the
   Christian religion, and be persuaded to make it the rule and guide of
   all their actions, would not be convinced, (so far as to influence
   their practice and reform their lives,) by any other evidence
   whatsoever; no, not though one should rise on purpose from the dead to
   endeavour to convince them.

   That the evidence which God has afforded us of the truth of our
   religion is abundantly sufficient. From what has been said, upon the
   foregoing heads, it is abundantly evident that men are not called upon
   to believe the Christian religion without very reasonable and
   sufficient proof; much less are they [397] required to set up faith in
   opposition to reason; or to believe any thing for that very reason,
   because it is incredible. On the contrary, God has given us all the
   proofs of the truth of our religion, that the nature of the thing would
   bear, or that were reasonable either for God to give, or men to expect.
   And unless God should work upon men by such methods, as are wholly
   inconsistent with the design of religion and the nature of virtue and
   vice, which we are sure he will never do, nothing could have been done
   more than has already been done, to convince men of the truth of
   religion, and to persuade them to embrace their own happiness. And
   indeed no reasonable man can fail of being persuaded by the evidence we
   now have. For if, in other cases, we assent to those things as certain
   and demonstrated, which, if our faculties of judging and reasoning do
   not necessarily deceive us, do upon the most impartial view appear
   clearly and plainly to be true; there is the same reason why in moral
   and religious matters we should look upon those things likewise to be
   certain and demonstrated, which, upon the exactest and most deliberate
   judgment we are capable of making, do appear to us to be as clearly and
   certainly true, as it is certain that our faculties do not necessarily
   and unavoidably deceive us, in all our judgments concerning the nature
   of God, concerning the proper happiness of man, and concerning the
   difference of good and evil. And if, in other cases, we always act
   without the least hesitation, upon the credit of good and sufficient
   testimony, and look upon that man as foolish and ridiculous, who
   sustains great losses, or lets slip great opportunities and advantages
   in business, only by distrusting the most credible and well-attested
   things in the world; it is plain there is the same reason why we should
   do so also in matters of religion. So that unless our actions be
   determined by some other thing than by reason and right judgment, the
   evidence which we have of the great truths of religion ought to have
   the same effect upon our lives and actions as if they were proved to us
   by any other sort of evidence that could be desired.

   That the cause of men's unbelief is not want of better evidence to
   prove the great truths of religion. It is true, the resurrection of
   Christ, and his other mighty works, must, after all, be confessed not
   to be such ocular demonstrations of the truth of his divine commission
   to after generations, as they were to those men who then lived, and saw
   him, and conversed with him. But since the matters of fact are as
   clearly proved to us, as it is possible for any matter of fact, at that
   distance of time, to be; since the evidence of this is as great, and
   greater, than of most of those things on which men venture the whole of
   their secular affairs, and on which they are willing to spend all their
   time and pains: Since (I say) the case is thus: He that will rather
   venture all that he can possibly enjoy, or suffer; he that will run the
   hazard of losing eternal happiness, and falling into eternal misery,
   rather than believe the most credible and rational thing in the world,
   merely because he does not see it with his eyes, it is plain that that
   man does not disbelieve the thing because he thinks the evidence of it
   not sufficiently strong, but because it is contrary to some particular
   vice of his, which makes it his interest that it should not be true;
   and for that reason he might also have disbelieved it though he had
   seen it himself. Men may invent what vain pretences they please, to
   excuse their infidelity and their wickedness; but certainly that man
   who can despise the authority both of reason and scripture in
   conjunction; who can elude the plainest evidence of matter of fact; who
   can be deaf to all the promises and kind admonitions of the Gospel, and
   to all the threatenings and terrible denunciations of the wrath of God,
   made known in good measure by the light of nature, and confirmed by the
   addition of express revelation; certainly (I say) that man must have
   some other reason for his unbelief than the pretended want of
   sufficient evidence. Did men follow the unprejudiced judgment of their
   own minds, and the impartial dictates of natural reason, the least
   possibility of obtaining eternal happiness, or the least suspicion of
   falling into endless misery, would immediately determine them to make
   it the great study and business of their lives to obtain the one and to
   avoid the other. If then we see men act directly contrary to this
   natural principle, and almost wholly neglect these things, not only
   when there is a fair appearance and probability of their being true,
   which the light of nature itself affords; but also when there is all
   reasonable evidence given of their being certainly true, by express
   revelation in the Gospel, is it not very plain that such men are
   governed, not by reason and the force of evidence, but by some other
   very different cause of their actions?

   But that wickedness and ungoverned lusts are the only causes of
   obstinate infidelity. What that cause is, is very apparent from the
   lives and actions of most of those persons who pretend want of evidence
   to be the ground of their infidelity. Their lusts, their appetites,
   their affections are interested: They are lovers of vice and
   debauchery, and slaves to evil habits and customs; and therefore they
   are not willing to discern the evidence which would compel them to
   believe that which yet they cannot believe with any comfort so long as
   they resolve not to part with their beloved vices. Their hearts and
   affections are habitually fixed upon things here below; and therefore
   they will not attend to the force of any argument that would raise
   their affections to things above. They are enslaved to the sensual
   pleasures and sinful enjoyments of earth; and therefore they will not
   hearken to any reasonable conviction which would persuade them to
   relinquish these present gratifications for the future and more
   spiritual joys of heaven. The love of this present world has blinded
   their eyes; [398] and therefore they receive not the things of the
   spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto them: Neither can they
   know them, because they are spiritually discerned. In a word, the true
   and only reason why men love darkness rather than light, is, because
   their deeds are evil.

   And so long as men are under the dominion of their lusts, they would
   not be convinced, though the evidence of religion was even much
   stronger than it is. And this reason affords a sufficient account
   indeed why men should be very unwilling to believe the doctrines of
   Christianity. If they are resolved not to reform their lives, it is no
   wonder they care not to discern the evidence of those truths which must
   needs make them very uneasy in the midst of the enjoyment of all their
   sinful pleasures. In this case, were the proofs of the truth of our
   religion much stronger than they are, or than they can be imagined or
   desired to be, yet still these men would be in the very same case, and
   perpetually want stronger and stronger evidence. It is true, many men,
   who now are conscious and willing to acknowledge that they act contrary
   to all the reasonable evidence and convictions of religion, are
   nevertheless very apt to imagine within themselves, that if the great
   truths of religion were proved to them by some stronger evidence, they
   should by that means be worked upon to act otherwise than they do: But
   if the true reason why these men act thus foolishly, is not because the
   doctrines of religion are not sufficiently evidenced, but because they
   themselves are, without allowing themselves time for consideration,
   hurried away by some unruly passions to act directly contrary to all
   reason and evidence; it is plain (unless God should irresistibly compel
   them) they might well continue to act as they do, though the evidence
   of these things were really greater than it is. They are willing fondly
   to imagine, that if they had lived in our Saviour's time; if they had
   heard his preaching, and seen his miracles; if they had had the
   advantage of beholding those mighty works which he performed for the
   proof of his divine commission, as the Jews then had;--they should not,
   like them, have rejected the counsel of God against themselves, but
   with all cheerfulness have believed his doctrine, and embraced his
   religion. They fancy they should immediately have become disciples of
   Christ; and that the truths which he taught would have had a most
   powerful influence upon the whole course of their lives. And if their
   hearts and affections were not set upon this world, more than upon the
   next; if they valued not the present sinful enjoyments of sense above
   the expectation of the glory that shall be revealed, most certainly
   they would do the same now. But if their hearts be set upon earthly
   things, and their passions be stronger than all the arguments of
   reason; if they do indeed so love the pleasures of sin now, as that
   they cannot persuade themselves, by all the motives of religion, to
   live like Christians, we need not doubt to affirm, that they might very
   well have been in the same case though they had lived in our Saviour's
   time. The Jews are a notorious and standing instance, how far
   prejudice, envy, pride, and affection, are able to prevail over the
   strongest convictions. When our Saviour began to preach that he was
   sent from God to instruct them in their duty, they required a sign of
   him, and they would believe him; but when he had worked so many
   miracles, that even the world itself could not contain the books if
   they should all be written, they persisted still in their infidelity.
   When they saw him hanging upon the cross, and thought themselves secure
   of him, they said, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
   believe him: (Matt. xxvii. 42.) But when he arose out of the grave,
   wherein he had lain three days, which was a much greater and more
   convincing miracle, they grew more hardened and obstinate in their
   unbelief.

   Nay, not even tho' one should rise on purpose from the dead to convince
   them. Others there are, who imagine that if they could but be convinced
   of the truth of another world, by the appearance of one sent directly
   from that unknown state, they would immediately become new creatures.
   But if God should satisfy their unreasonable demands, by sending one on
   purpose from the dead to convince them, there is little room to doubt,
   but as they harkened not to Moses and the prophets, to Christ and his
   apostles, so neither would they be persuaded by one rising on purpose
   from the dead. They might indeed be at first surprised and terrified at
   the appearance of so unusual and unexpected a messenger: But as wicked
   men upon a bed of sickness, at the amazing approach of death and
   eternity, resolve, in the utmost anguish of horror and despair, to
   amend their lives and forsake their sins; but as soon as the terror is
   over, and the danger of death past, return to their old habits of sin
   and folly;--so it is more than probable it would be in the present
   case. Should God send a messenger from the dead, to assure men of the
   certainty of a future state, and the danger of their present
   wickedness, as soon as the fright was over, and their present terrible
   apprehensions ceased, it is by no means impossible or improbable that
   their old vicious habits and beloved sins should again by degrees
   prevail over them. Some there are, in our present age, who pretend to
   be convinced of the being of spirits, by the powerful demonstration of
   their own senses; and yet we do not observe that their lives are more
   remarkably eminent for exemplary piety, than other good men's, who,
   being convinced by the rational evidence of the gospel, go on in a
   sober, constant, and regular exercise of virtue and righteousness.

   It is not therefore for want of sufficient evidence That therefore to
   make men judge rightly of the evidence of religion, it is absolutely
   necessary, in the first place, that, laying aside prejudice, lust, and
   passion, they become impartially willing to embrace all truth, and to
   obey all reasonable obligations which shall at any time be made known
   to them. that men disbelieve the great truths of religion; but plainly
   for want of integrity, and of dealing ingenuously and impartially with
   themselves, that they suffer not the arguments of religion to have that
   weight and influence upon them, which in the judgment of right reason
   they ought manifestly to have. So long as men permit their passions and
   appetites to over-rule their reason, it is impossible they should have
   due apprehensions in matters of religion, or make any right and true
   judgment concerning these things. Men that are strongly biassed and
   prejudiced even in worldly affairs, it is well known how hard and
   difficult it is for them to judge according to reason, and to suffer
   the arguments and evidences of truth to have their due weight with
   them. How much more in matters of religion, which concern things future
   and remote from sense, must it needs be, that men's present interests,
   lusts, and passions, will pervert their judgment, and blind their
   understandings! Wherefore, men that pretend to be followers of right
   reason, if they will judge truly of the reasonableness and credibility
   of the Christian revelation, it is absolutely necessary that, in the
   first place, in order to that end, they become impartially willing to
   embrace whatever shall, upon the whole, appear to be agreeable to
   reason and truth, and grounded upon good evidence, without interesting
   their lusts and appetites in the judgment; and that, before all things,
   they resolve to be guided in all their actions by whatever rule shall
   at any time be well proved to them to be the will of God. And when they
   have put themselves into this temper and frame of mind, then let them
   try if they can any longer reject the evidence of the gospel. If any
   man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of
   God. (Johnvii. 17.) For, them that are meek, God will guide in
   judgment; (Ps. xxv. 8.) and such as are gentle, them he will teach his
   way.

   That men of such a disposition would think it their greatest wisdom to
   be truly religious, even tho' the evidences of religion were much less
   than they are. Indeed, men that are of this good disposition, willing
   to be governed by reason, and not prejudiced by lusts and vicious
   appetites, could not but give their assent to the doctrines of
   Christianity, upon account of the very intrinsic excellency and
   reasonableness of the things themselves, even though the external
   evidence of their certainty had been much less than it at present is.
   Nay, were there hardly any other evidence at all, than barely the
   excellency and reasonableness, and natural probability of the great
   truths of religion, together with the consideration of the vast
   importance of them; yet even in that case it would be infinitely wisest
   and most agreeable to reason, for men to live according to the rules of
   the gospel. And though their faith extended no further than only to a
   belief of the possibility of the truth of the Christian revelation, yet
   even this alone ought in all reason to have weight enough to determine
   reasonable creatures to live soberly, righteously, and godly. For is it
   not plainly most reasonable, as an ancient writer expresses it, [399]
   if each of the opposite opinions were equally doubtful and uncertain,
   yet by all means to embrace and entertain that which brings some hope
   along with it, rather than that which brings none? For on one side of
   the question there is no danger at all of incurring any calamity, if
   that which we believe and expect should at last prove false; but, on
   the other side, there is the greatest hazard in the world, the loss of
   eternal life, if the opinion which unbelievers rely upon should at last
   prove an error. And again: [400] What say ye, O ye ignorant men, ye men
   of miserable and most deplorable folly? Can ye forbear fearing within
   yourselves that at least those things may possibly prove true which ye
   now despise and mock at? Have ye not at least some misgivings of mind,
   lest possibly that which ye now perversely and obstinately refuse to
   believe, ye should at last be convinced of by sad experience, when it
   will be too late to repent. Nor is this the judgment of Christian
   writers only, but also of the wisest and most considerate heathens. We
   ought to spare no pains, saith Plato, [401] to obtain the habits of
   virtue and wisdom in this present life; for the prize is noble, and the
   hope is very great. And Cicero: [402] They have gained a great prize
   indeed who have persuaded themselves to believe, that, when death
   comes, they shall perish utterly: What comfort is there; what is there
   to be boasted of in that opinion? And again: If after death, saith he,
   as some little and contemptible philosophers think, [403] I shall be
   nothing, yet there is no danger that when we are all dead those
   philosophers should laugh at me for my error.

   But this is not our case. God has afforded us, as has been largely and
   particularly shown in the foregoing discourse, many and certain proofs
   of the truth of our religion; even as certain as any matter of fact is
   capable of having. And we now exhort men to believe, not what is barely
   possible, and excellent and probable, and of the utmost importance in
   itself, but what moreover they have all the positive evidence and all
   the reason in the world to oblige them to believe.

   That God may require us to take notice of certain things, and to
   inquire into them and consider them, at our peril. To conclude: No man
   of reason can pretend to say but God may require us to take notice of
   some things at our peril, to inquire into them, and to consider them
   thoroughly. Any pretence of want of greater evidence will not excuse
   carelessness or unreasonable prejudices, when God has vouchsafed us all
   that evidence which was either fit for him to grant, or reasonable for
   men to desire; or indeed which the nature of the thing itself to be
   proved was capable of.

THE REVEREND DR CLARKE,

    FROM A GENTLEMAN IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE:

    RELATING

TO THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE FOREGOING
SERMONS;

WITH THE DOCTOR'S ANSWERS.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE FIRST LETTER.

   "Reverend Sir,"

   "I suppose you will wonder at the present trouble from one who is a
   perfect stranger to you, though you are not so to him; but I hope the
   occasion will excuse my boldness. I have made it, sir, my business,
   ever since I thought myself capable of such sort of reasoning, to prove
   to myself the being and attributes of God: And being sensible that it
   is a matter of the last consequence, I endeavoured, after a
   demonstrative proof, not only more fully to satisfy my own mind, but
   also, in order to defend the great truths of natural religion, and
   those of the Christian revelation which follow from them, against all
   opposers; but must own with concern, that hitherto I have been
   unsucessful; and though I have got very probable arguments, yet I can
   go but a very little way with demonstration in the proof of those
   things. When first your book on those subjects (which, by all, whom I
   have discoursed with, is so justly esteemed,) was recommended to me, I
   was in great hopes of having all my inquiries answered; but since, in
   some places, either through my not understanding your meaning, or what
   else I know not, even that has failed me, I almost despair of ever
   arriving to such a satisfaction as I aim at, unless by the method I now
   use. You cannot but know, sir, that of two different expressions of the
   same thing, though equally clear to some persons, yet, to others, one
   of them is sometimes very obscure, though the other be perfectly
   intelligible: Perhaps this may be my case here; and could I see those
   of your arguments, of which I doubt, differently proposed, possibly I
   might yield a ready assent to them. This, sir, I cannot but think a
   sufficient excuse for the present trouble; it being such an one as I
   hope may prevail for an answer, with one who seems to aim at nothing
   more than that good work of instructing others."

   "In your Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God Prop. VI.
   [edit. 2d, p. 69 and 70,] you propose to prove the infinity or
   omnipresence of the self-existent being. The former part of the proof
   seems highly probable, but the latter part, which seems to aim at
   demonstration, is not to me convincing. The latter part of the
   paragraph is, if I mistake not, an entire argument of itself, which
   runs thus; to suppose a finite being to be self-existent, is to say
   that it is a contradiction for that being not to exist, the absence of
   which may yet be conceived without a contradiction; which is the
   greatest absurdity in the world. The sense of these words [the absence
   of which] seems plainly to be determined, by the following sentence, to
   mean its absence from any particular place. Which sentence is to prove
   it to be an absurdity; and is this; for if a being can, without a
   contradiction, be absent from one place, it may, without a
   contradiction, be absent from another place, and from all places. Now,
   supposing this to be a consequence, all that it proves is, that if a
   being can, without a contradiction, be absent from one place, at one
   time, it may without a contradiction be absent from another place, and
   so from all places, at different times; (for I cannot see, that if a
   being can be absent from one place at one time, therefore it may
   without a contradiction be absent from all places at the same time, i.
   e. may cease to exist.) Now, if it proves no more than this, I cannot
   see that it reduces the supposition to any absurdity. Suppose I could
   demonstrate, that any particular man should live a thousand years; this
   man might, without a contradiction, be absent from one, and from all
   places, at different times; but it would not from thence follow that he
   might be absent from all places at the same time, i. e. that he might
   cease to exist. No; this would be a contradiction, because I am
   supposed to have demonstrated that he should live a thousand years. It
   would be exactly the same, if, instead of a thousand years, I should
   say, for ever; and the proof seems the same, whether it be applied to a
   self-existent or a dependent being. What else I have to offer is in
   relation to your proof that the self-existent being must of necessity
   be but one: Which proof is as follows, in Prop. VII, [edit. 2d. p.
   74,]--to suppose two or more different natures existing of themselves,
   necessarily and independent from each other, implies this plain
   contradiction; that each of them being independent from the other, they
   may either of them be supposed to exist alone; so that it will be no
   contradiction to imagine the other not to exist, and consequently
   neither of them will be necessarily existing. The supposition indeed
   implies, that since each of these beings is independent from the other,
   they may either of them exist alone, i. e. without any relation to, or
   dependence on the other; but where is the third idea, to connect this
   proposition and the following one, viz. so that it will be no
   contradiction to imagine the other not to exist? Were this a
   consequence of the former proposition, I allow it would be
   demonstration, by the first corollary of Prop. III, [2d ed. p. 26;] but
   since these two propositions [they may either of them be supposed to
   exist alone,] and [so that it will be no contradiction to imagine the
   other not to exist,] are very widely different; since likewise it is no
   immediate consequence, that because either may be supposed to exist
   independent from the other, therefore the other may be supposed not to
   exist at all; how is what was proposed, proved? That the propositions
   are different, I think is plain; and whether there be an immediate
   connexion, every body that reads your book must judge for themselves. I
   must say, for my own part, the absurdity does not appear at first
   sight, any more than the absurdity of saying that the angles below the
   base in an isosceles triangle are unequal; which, though it is
   absolutely false, yet I suppose no one will lay down the contrary for
   an axiom; because, though it is true, yet there is need of a proof to
   make it appear so.

   "Perhaps, it may be answered, that I have not rightly explained the
   words, to exist alone;' and that they do not mean only to exist
   independent from the other; but that existing alone means that nothing
   exists with it. Whether this or the other was meant, I cannot
   determine; but, whichever it was, what I have said will hold. For if
   this last be the sense of those words, [they either of them may be
   supposed to exist alone;] it indeed implies that it will be no
   contradiction to suppose the other not to exist. But then I ask, how
   come these two propositions to be connected: That, to suppose two
   different natures existing of themselves, necessarily and independent
   from each other, implies that each of them may be supposed to exist
   alone in this sense? which is exactly the same as I said before, only
   applied to different sentences. So that if existing alone be understood
   as I first took it, I allow it is implied in the supposition; but
   cannot see that the consequence is, that it will be no contradiction to
   suppose the other not to exist. But if the words existing alone,' are
   meant in the latter sense, I grant, that if either of them may be
   supposed thus to exist alone, it will be no contradiction to suppose
   the other not to exist. But then I cannot see, that to suppose two
   different natures existing, of themselves, necessarily and independent
   from each other, implies that either of them may be supposed to exist
   alone in this sense of the words, but only that either of them may be
   supposed to exist without having any relation to the other, and that
   there will be no need of the existence of the one in order to the
   existence of the other. But though, upon this account, were there no
   other principle of its existence, it might cease to exist; yet, on the
   account of the necessity of its own nature, which is quite distinct
   from the other, it is an absolute absurdity to suppose it not to exist.

   "Thus, sir, I have proposed my doubts, with the reasons of them: In
   which, if I have wrested your words to another sense than you designed
   them, or in any respect argued unfairly, I assure you it was without
   design. So I hope you will impute it to mistake. And, if it will not be
   too great a trouble, let me once more beg the favour of a line from
   you, by which you will lay me under a particular obligation to be,
   what, with the rest of the world, I now am,

   "Reverend Sir,

   Your most obliged Servant, &c."

   Nov. 4. 1713.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST LETTER.

   "Sir,"

   "Did men who publish controversial papers, accustom themselves to write
   with that candour and ingenuity with which you propose your
   difficulties, I am persuaded almost all disputes might be very amicably
   terminated, either by men's coming at last to agree in opinion, or at
   least finding reason to suffer each other friendly to differ.

   "Your two objections are very ingenious, and urged with great strength
   and acuteness. Yet I am not without hopes of being able to give you
   satisfaction in both of them. To your first, therefore, I answer:
   Whatever may, without a contradiction, be absent from any one place at
   any one time, may also, without a contradiction, be absent from all
   places at all times. For, whatever is absolutely necessary at all, is
   absolutely necessary in every part of space, and in every point of
   duration. Whatever can at any time be conceived possible to be absent
   from any one part of space, may, for the same reason, [viz. the
   implying no contradiction in the nature of things,] be conceived
   possible to be absent from every other part of space at the same time,
   either by ceasing to be, or by supposing it never to have begun to be.
   Your instance about demonstrating a man to live 1000 years, is what (I
   think) led you into the mistake; and is a good instance to lead you out
   of it again. You may suppose a man shall live 1000 years, or God may
   reveal and promise he shall live 1000 years; and, upon that
   supposition, it shall not be possible for the man to be absent from all
   places in any part of that time. Very true; but why shall it not be
   possible? Only because it is contrary to the supposition, or to the
   promise of God; but not contrary to the absolute nature of things,
   which would be the case if the man existed necessarily, as every part
   of space does. In supposing you could demonstrate a man should live
   1000 years, or one year, you make an impossible and contradictory
   supposition. For though you may know certainly, (by revelation,
   suppose,) that he will live so long, yet this is only the certainty of
   a thing true in fact, not in itself necessary: And demonstration is
   applicable to nothing but what is necessary in itself, necessary in all
   places and at all times equally.

   "To your second difficulty, I answer: What exists necessarily, not only
   must so exist alone, as to be independent of any thing else; but (being
   self-sufficient,) may also so exist alone as that every thing else may
   possibly (or without any contradiction in the nature of things) be
   supposed not to exist at all; and consequently, (since that which may
   possibly be supposed not to exist at all, is not necessarily existent,)
   no other thing can be necessarily existent. Whatever is necessarily
   existing, there is need of its existence in order to the supposal of
   the existence of any other thing; so that nothing can possibly be
   supposed to exist, without presupposing and including antecedently the
   existence of that which is necessary. For instance; the supposal of the
   existence of any thing whatever, includes necessarily a presupposition
   of the existence of space and time; and, if any thing could exist
   without space or time, it would follow that space and time were not
   necessarily-existing. Therefore, the supposing any thing possibly to
   exist alone, so as not necessarily to include the presupposal of some
   other thing, proves demonstrably that that other thing is not
   necessarily-existing; because, whatever has necessity of existence,
   cannot possibly, in any conception whatsoever, be supposed away. There
   cannot possibly be any notion of the existence of any thing, there
   cannot possibly be any notion of existence at all, but what shall
   necessarily pre-include the notion of that which has necessary
   existence: And consequently the two propositions which you judged
   independent are really necessarily connected. These sorts of things are
   indeed very difficult to express, and not easy to be conceived but by
   very attentive minds: But to such as can and will attend, nothing (I
   think) is more demonstrably convictive."

   "If any thing still sticks with you in this, or any other part of my
   books, I shall be very willing to be informed of it; who am,"

   "Sir, your assured Friend and Servant,

   "S. C."

   Nov. 10, 1713.

   "P. S. Many readers, I observe, have misunderstood my second general
   proposition; as if the words [some one unchangeable and independent
   being] meant [one only--being,] whereas the true meaning, and all that
   the argument there requires, is, [some one at least.] That there can be
   but one, is the thing proved afterwards in the seventh proposition."
     __________________________________________________________________

THE SECOND LETTER.

   "Reverend Sir,"

   "I have often thought that the chief occasions of men's differing so
   much in their opinions, were, either their not understanding each
   other; or else, that instead of ingenuously searching after truth, they
   have made it their business to find out arguments for the proof of what
   they have once asserted. However, it is certain there may be other
   reasons for persons not agreeing in their opinions; and where it is so,
   I cannot but think, with you, that they will find reason to suffer each
   other to differ friendly; every man having a way of thinking, in some
   respects, peculiarly his own.

   "I am sorry, I must tell you, your answers to my objections are not
   satisfactory. The reasons why I think them not so are as follow:

   "You say; whatever is absolutely necessary at all, is absolutely
   necessary in every part of space, and in every point of duration.' Were
   this evident, it would certainly prove what you bring it for; viz. that
   whatever may, without a contradiction, be absent from one place at one
   time, may also be absent from all places at all times. But I do not
   conceive that the idea of ubiquity is contained in the idea of
   self-existence, or directly follows from it, any otherwise than as
   whatever exists must exist somewhere. You add; whatever can at any time
   be conceived possibly to be absent from any one part of space, may, for
   the same reason [viz. the implying no contradiction in the nature of
   things] be conceived possibly to be absent from every other part of
   space at the same time. Now, I cannot see, that I can make these two
   suppositions for the same reason, or upon the same account. The reason
   why I conceive this being may be absent from one place, is, because it
   doth not contradict the former proof [drawn from the nature of things,]
   in which I proved only that it must necessarily exist. But the other
   supposition, viz. that I can conceive it possible to be absent from
   every part of space at one and the same time, directly contradicts the
   proof that it must exist somewhere; and so is an express contradiction.
   Unless it be said, that as, when we have proved the three angles of a
   triangle equal to two right ones, that relation of the equality ofits
   angles to two right ones will be wherever a triangle exists; so, when
   we have proved the necessary existence of a being, this being must
   exist everywhere. But there is a great difference between these two
   things; the one being the proof of a certain relation, upon supposition
   of such a being's existence with such particular properties; and
   consequently, wherever this being and these properties exist, this
   relation must exist too. But, from the proof of the necessary existence
   of a being, it is no evident consequence that it exists everywhere. My
   using the word demonstration, instead of proof, which leaves no room
   for doubt, was through negligence, for I never heard of strict
   demonstration of matter of fact.

   "In your answer to my second difficulty, you say; whatsoever is
   necessarily-existing, there is need of its existence, in order to the
   supposal of the existence of any other thing. All the consequences you
   draw from this proposition I see proved demonstrably; and consequently,
   that the two propositions I thought independent are closely connected.
   But how, or upon what account, is there need of the existence of
   whatever is necessarily-existing, in order to the existence of any
   other thing? Is it as there is need of space and duration, in order to
   the existence of any thing; or is it needful only as the cause of the
   existence of all other things? If the former be said, as your instance
   seems to intimate, I answer, space and duration are very abstruse in
   their natures, and, I think, cannot properly be called things, but are
   considered rather as affections which belong, and, in the order of our
   thoughts are antecedently necessary, to the existence of all things.
   And I can no more conceive how a necessarily-existing being can, on the
   same account or in the same manner as space and duration are, be
   needful in order to the existence of any other being, than I can
   conceive extension attributed to a thought; that idea no more belonging
   to a thing existing, than extension belongs to thought. But if the
   latter be said, that there is need of the existence of whatever is a
   necessary being, in order to the existence of any other thing; only as
   this necessary being must be the cause of the existence of all other
   things; I think this is plainly begging the question; for it supposes
   that there is no other being exists, but what is casual, and so not
   necessary. And on what other account, or in what other manner than one
   of these two, there can be need of the existence of a necessary being
   in order to the existence of any thing else, I cannot conceive.

   "Thus, sir, you see I entirely agree with you in all the consequences
   you have drawn from your suppositions; but cannot see the truth of the
   suppositions themselves.

   "I have aimed at nothing in my style but only to be intelligible; being
   sensible that it is very difficult (as you observe) to express one's
   self on these sorts of subjects, especially for one who is altogether
   unaccustomed to write upon them.

   "I have nothing at present more to add, but my sincerest thanks for
   your trouble in answering my letter, and for your professed readiness
   to be acquainted with any other difficulty that I may meet with in any
   of your writings. I am willing to interpret this as somewhat like a
   promise of an answer to what I have now written, if there be any thing
   in it which deserves one. I am,

THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND LETTER.

   "Sir,"

   "It seems to me, that the reason why you do not apprehend ubiquity to
   be necessarily connected with self-existence, is, because, in the order
   of your ideas, you first conceive a being, (a finite being, suppose;)
   and then conceive self-existence to be a property of that being; as the
   angles are properties of a triangle, when a triangle exists: Whereas,
   on the contrary, necessity of existence, not being a property
   consequent upon the supposition of the things existing, but
   antecedently the cause or ground of that existence; it is evident this
   necessity being not limited to any antecedent subject, as angles are to
   a triangle; but being itself original, absolute, and (in order of
   nature) antecedent to all existence, cannot but be everywhere, for the
   same reason that it is anywhere. [404] By applying this reasoning to
   the instance of space, you will find, that by consequence it belongs
   truly to that substance whereof space is a property, [405] as duration
   also is. What you say about a necessary being existing somewhere,
   supposes it to be finite; and being finite, supposes some cause which
   determined that such a certain quantity of that being should exist,
   neither more or less: And that cause must either be a voluntary cause,
   or else such a necessary cause, the quantity of whose power must be
   determined and limited by some other cause. But in original absolute
   necessity, antecedent (in order of nature) to the existence of any
   thing, nothing of all this can have place; but the necessity is
   necessarily everywhere alike.

   "Concerning the second difficulty, I answer, that which exists
   necessarily is needful to the existence of any other thing; not
   considered now as a cause, (for that indeed is begging the question)
   but as a sine qua non; in the sense as space is necessary to every
   thing, and nothing can possibly be conceived to exist without thereby
   presupposing space: Which, therefore, I apprehend to be a property or
   mode of the self-existent substance; and that, by being evidently
   necessary itself, it proves that the substance, of which it is a mode,
   must also be necessary; necessary both in itself, and needful to the
   existence of any thing else whatsoever. Extension indeed does not
   belong to thought, because thought is not a being; but there is need of
   extension to the existence of every being, to a being which has or has
   not thought, or any other quality whatsoever.

THE THIRD LETTER.

   "Reverend Sir,"

   "I do not very well understand your meaning, when you say that you
   think, in the order of my ideas I first conceive a being, (finite
   suppose,) to exist, and then conceive self-existence to be a property
   of that being. If you mean that I first suppose a finite being to
   exist, I know not why; affirming necessity of existence to be only a
   consequent of its existence; and that, when I have supposed it finite,
   I very safely conclude it is not infinite; I am utterly at a loss upon
   what expressions in my letter this conjecture can be founded. But if
   you mean that I first of all prove a being to exist from eternity, and
   then, from the reasons of things, prove that such a being must be
   eternally necessary, I freely own it. Neither do I conceive it to be
   irregular or absurd; for there is a great difference between the order
   in which things exist, and the order in which I prove to myself that
   they exist. Neither do I think my saying a necessary being exists
   somewhere, supposes it to be finite; it only supposes that this being
   exists in space, without determining whether here, or there, or
   everywhere.

   "To my second objection, you say: That which exists necessarily, is
   needful to the existence of any other thing, as a sine qua non; in the
   sense space is necessary to every thing, which is proved (you say) by
   this consideration, that space is a property of the self-existent
   substance; and, being both necessary in itself, and needful to the
   existence of every thing else; consequently the substance of which it
   is a property must be so too. Space, I own, is in one sense a property
   of the self-existent substance; but, in the same sense, it is also a
   property of all other substances. The only difference is in respect to
   the quantity. And since every part of space, as well as the whole, is
   necessary; every substance consequently must be self-existent, because
   it hath this self-existent property; Which since you will not admit for
   true, if it directly follows from your arguments, they cannot be
   conclusive.

   "What you say under the first head, proves (I think,) to a very great
   probability, though not to me with the evidence of demonstration: But
   your arguments under the second I am not able to see the force of.

   "I am so far from being pleased that I can form objections to your
   arguments, that, besides the satisfaction it would have given me in my
   own mind, I should have thought it an honour to have entered into your
   reasonings, and seen the force of them. I cannot desire to trespass any
   more upon your better employed time; so shall only add my hearty thanks
   for your trouble on my account, and that I am, with the greatest
   respect,

   "Reverend Sir,

   Your most obliged humble Servant."

THE ANSWER TO THE THIRD LETTER.

   "Sir,"

   "Though, when I turn my thoughts every way, I fully persuade myself
   there is no defect in the argument itself, yet, in my manner of
   expression, I am satisfied there must be some want of clearness when
   there remains any difficulty to a person of your abilities and
   sagacity. I did not mean that your saying a necessary being exists
   somewhere, does necessarily suppose it to be finite, but that the
   manner of expression is apt to excite in the mind an idea of a finite
   being, at the same time that you are thinking of a necessary being,
   without accurately attending to the nature of that necessity by which
   it exists. Necessity absolute, and antecedent (in order of nature) to
   the existence of any subject, has nothing to limit it; but, if it
   operates at all, (as it must needs do,) it must operate (if I may so
   speak,) everywhere and at all times alike: Determination of a
   particular quantity, or particular time or place of existence of any
   thing, cannot arise but from somewhat external to the thing itself. For
   example; why there should exist just such a small determinate quantity
   of matter, neither more nor less, interspersed in the immense vacuities
   of space, no reason can be given; nor can there be any thing in nature
   which could have determined a thing so indifferent in itself, as is the
   measure of that quantity, but only the will of an intelligent and free
   agent. To suppose matter, or any other substance, necessarily-existing
   in a finite determinate quantity, in an inch-cube for instance, or in
   any certain number of cube-inches and no more, is exactly the same
   absurdity as supposing it to exist necessarily, and yet for a finite
   duration only; which every one sees to be a plain contradiction. The
   argument is likewise the same in the question about the original of
   motion: Motion cannot be necessarily-existing, because, it being
   evident that all determinations of motion are equally possible in
   themselves, the original determination of the motion of any particular
   body this way rather than the contrary way, could not be necessary in
   itself, but was either caused by the will of an intelligent and free
   agent, or else was an effect produced and determined without any cause
   at all, which is an express contradiction; as I have shown in my
   Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God.

   "To the second head of argument I answer: Space is a property (or mode)
   of the self-existent substance, but not of any other substances. All
   other substances are in space, and are penetrated by it, but the
   self-existent substance is not in space, nor penetrated by it, but is
   itself (if I may so speak) the substratum of space, the ground of the
   existence of space and duration itself. Which (space and duration)
   being evidently necessary, and yet themselves not substances, but
   properties or modes, show evidently that the substance, without which
   these modes could not subsist, is itself much more (if that were
   possible) necessary. And as space and duration are needful, (i. e. sine
   qua non,) to the existence of every thing else; so, consequently, is
   the substance to which these modes belong in that peculiar manner which
   I before mentioned.

THE FOURTH LETTER.

   "Reverend Sir,"

   "Whatever is the occasion of my not seeing the force of your
   reasonings, I cannot impute it to (what you do) the want of clearness
   in your expression. I am too well acquainted with myself to think my
   not understanding an argument a sufficient reason to conclude that it
   is either improperly expressed, or not conclusive, unless I can clearly
   show the defect of it. It is with the greatest satisfaction, I must
   tell you, that the more I reflect on your first argument the more I am
   convinced of the truth of it; and it now seems to me altogether
   unreasonable to suppose absolute necessity can have any relation to one
   part of space more than to another; and, if so, an absolutely-necessary
   being must exist everywhere.

   "I wish I was as well satisfied in respect to the other. You say, all
   substances, except the self-existent one, are in space, and are
   penetrated by it: All substances, doubtless, whether body or spirit,
   exist in space; but when I say that a spirit exists in space, were I
   put upon telling my meaning, I know not how I could do it any other way
   than by saying such a particular quantity of space terminates the
   capacity of acting in finite spirits at one and the same time, so that
   they cannot act beyond that determined quantity. Not but that I think
   there is somewhat in the manner of existence of spirits in respect of
   space, that more directly answers to the manner of the existence of
   body; but what that is, or of the manner of their existence, I cannot
   possibly form an idea. And it seems (if possible) much more difficult
   to determine what relation the self-existent being hath to space: To
   say he exists in space, after the same manner that other substances do,
   (somewhat like which I too rashly asserted in my last,) perhaps would
   be placing the Creator too much on a level with the creature; or,
   however, it is not plainly and evidently true: And to say the
   self-existent substance is the substratum of space, in the common sense
   of the word, is scarce intelligible, or at least is not evident. Now,
   though there may be an hundred relations distinct from either of these,
   yet how we should come by ideas of them I cannot conceive. We may
   indeed have ideas to the words, and not altogether depart from the
   common sense of them, when we say the self-existent substance is the
   substratum of space, or the ground of its existence: But I see no
   reason to think it true, because space seems to me to be as absolutely
   self-existent as it is possible any thing can be: So that, make what
   other supposition you please, yet we cannot help supposing immense
   space, because there must be either an infinity of being, or (if you
   will allow the expression) an infinite vacuity of being. Perhaps it may
   be objected to this, that though space is really necessary, yet the
   reason of its being necessary, is its being a property of the
   self-existent substance, and that it being so evidently necessary, and
   its dependence on the self-existent substance not so evident, we are
   ready to conclude it absolutely self-existent, as well as necessary;
   and that this is the reason why the idea of space forces itself on our
   minds, antecedent to, and exclusive of (as to the ground of its
   existence) all other things. Now this, though it is really an
   objection, yet it is no direct answer to what I have said, because it
   supposes the only thing to be proved, viz. that the reason why space is
   necessary is its being a property of a self-existent substance; and
   supposing it not to be evident that space is absolutely self-existent,
   yet, while it is doubtful, we cannot argue as though the contrary were
   certain and we were sure that space was only a property of the
   self-existent substance. But now, if space be not absolutely
   independent, I do not see what we can conclude is so; for it is
   manifestly necessary itself, as well as antecedently needful to the
   existence of all other things, not excepting, (as I think) even the
   self-existent substance.

   "All your consequences, I see, follow demonstrably from your
   supposition, and, were that evident, I believe it would serve to prove
   several other things as well as what you bring it for: Upon which
   account, I should be extremely pleased to see it proved by any one;
   for, as I design the search after truth as the business of my life, I
   shall not be ashamed to learn from any person, though at the same time
   I cannot but be sensible that instruction from some men is like the
   gift of a prince; it reflects an honour on the person on whom it lays
   an obligation.

THE ANSWER TO THE FOURTH LETTER.

   "Sir,"

   "My being out of town most part of the month of January, and some other
   accidental avocations, hindered me from answering your letter sooner.
   The sum of the difficulties it contains, is (I think) this: That it is
   difficult to determine what relation the self-existent substance has to
   space. That, to say it is the substratum of space, in the common sense
   of the word, is scarce intelligible, or, at least, is not evident; that
   space seems to be as absolutely self-existent as it is possible any
   thing can be: And that its being a property of the self-existent
   substance, is supposing the thing that was to be proved. This is
   entering indeed into the very bottom of the matter, and I will
   endeavour to give you as brief and clear an answer as I can.

   "That the self-existent substance is the substratum of space, or space
   a property of the self-existent substance, are not perhaps very proper
   expressions, nor is it easy to find such: But what I mean is this: The
   idea of space (as also of time or duration,) is an abstract or partial
   idea, an idea of a certain quality or relation, which we evidently see
   to be necessarily-existing; and yet, which (not being itself a
   substance,) at the same time necessarily presupposes a substance,
   without which it could not exist; which substance, consequently, must
   be itself (much more, if possible,) necessarily-existing. I know not
   how to explain this so well as by the following similitude: A blind
   man, when he tries to frame to himself the idea of body, his idea is
   nothing but that of hardness. A man that had eyes, but no power of
   motion or sense of feeling at all, when he tried to frame to himself
   the idea of body, his idea would be nothing but that of colour. Now,
   as, in these cases, hardness is not body, and colour is not body; but
   yet, to the understanding of these persons, those properties
   necessarily infer the being of a substance, of which substance itself
   the persons have no idea: So space to us is not itself substance, but
   it necessarily infers the being of a substance, which affects none of
   our present senses; and, being itself necessary, it follows that the
   substance which it infers, is (much more) necessary.

THE FIFTH LETTER.

   "Reverend Sir,"

   "You have very comprehensively expressed in six or seven lines, all the
   difficulties of my letter, which I should have endeavoured to have made
   shorter, had I not been afraid an improper expression might possibly
   occasion a mistake of my meaning. I am very glad the debate is come
   into so narrow a compass; for I think now it entirely turns upon this,
   whether our ideas of space and duration are partial, so as to
   presuppose the existence of some other thing. Your similitude of the
   blind man is very apt, to explain your meaning, (which I think I fully
   understand;) but does not seem to come entirely up to the matter. For,
   what is the reason that the blind man concludes there must be somewhat
   external, to give him that idea of hardness? It is because he supposes
   it impossible for him to be thus affected, unless there were some cause
   of it; which cause, should it be removed, the effect would immediately
   cease too; and he would no more have the idea of hardness, but by
   remembrance. Now, to apply this to the instance of space and duration;
   since a man, from his having these ideas, very justly concludes that
   there must be somewhat external, which is the cause of them;
   consequently should this cause (whatever it is) be taken away, his
   ideas would be so too: Therefore, if what is supposed to be the cause
   be removed, and yet the idea remains, that supposed cause cannot be the
   real one. Now, granting the self-existent substance to be the
   substratum of these ideas, could we make the supposition of its ceasing
   to be, yet space and duration would still remain unaltered; which seems
   to show that the self-existent substance is not the substratum of space
   and duration. Nor would it be an answer to the difficulty, to say that
   every property of the self-existent substance is as necessary as the
   substance itself, since that will only hold while the substance itself
   exists: For there is implied, in the idea of a property, an
   impossibility of subsisting without its substratum. I grant the
   supposition is absurd: But how otherwise can we know whether any thing
   be a property of such a substance, but by examining whether it would
   cease to be, if its supposed substance should do so: Notwithstanding
   what I have now said, I cannot say that I believe your argument not
   conclusive; for I must own my ignorance, that I am really at a lose
   about the nature of space and duration. But did it plainly appear that
   they were properties of a substance, we should have an easy way with
   the atheists; for it would at once prove demonstrably an eternal,
   necessary, self-existent being; that there is but one such, and that he
   is needful in order to the existence of all other things: Which makes
   me think that though it may be true, yet it is not obvious to every
   capacity; otherwise it would have been generally used as a fundamental
   argument to prove the being of God.

   "I must add one thing more, that your argument for the omnipresence of
   God seemed always to me very probable. But being very desirous to have
   it appear demonstrably conclusive, I was sometimes forced to say what
   was not altogether my opinion; not that I did this for the sake of
   disputing, (for besides the particular disagreeableness of this to my
   own temper, I should surely have chosen another person to have trifled
   with;) but I did it to set off the objection to advantage, that it
   might be more fully answered. I heartily wish you as fair treatment
   from your opponents in print, as I have had from you; though I must
   own, I cannot see, in those that I have read, that unprejudiced search
   after truth which I would have hoped for.

THE ANSWER TO THE FIFTH LETTER.

   "Sir,"

   "In a multitude of business, I mislaid your last letter; and could not
   answer it till it came again to my hands by chance. We seem to have
   pushed the matter in question between us, as far as it will go; and,
   upon the whole, I cannot but take notice, I have very seldom met with
   persons so reasonable and unprejudiced as yourself, in such debates as
   these.

   "I think all I need say in answer to the reasoning in your letter is;
   that your granting the absurdity of the supposition you were
   endeavouring to make, is consequently granting the necessary truth of
   my argument. If space and duration remain, [406] even after they are
   supposed to be taken away; and be not (as it is plain they are not)
   themselves substances, then the substance, [407] on whose existence
   they depend will necessarily remain likewise, even after it is supposed
   to be taken away; which shows that supposition to be impossible and
   contradictory.

   "As to your observation at the end of your letter, that the argument I
   have insisted on, if it were obvious to every capacity, should have
   more frequently been used as a fundamental argument for a proof of the
   being of God, the true cause why it has been seldom urged, is, I think,
   this; that the universal prevalency of Cartes's absurd notions,
   (teaching that matter [408] is necessarily infinite and necessarily
   eternal, and ascribing all things to mere mechanic laws of motion,
   exclusive of final causes, and of all will, and intelligence, and
   divine providence from the government of the world;) hath incredibly
   blinded the eyes of common reason, and prevented men from discerning
   him in whom they live, and move, and have their being. The like has
   happened in some other instances. How universally have men, for many
   ages, believed that eternity has no duration at all, and infinity no
   amplitude? Something of the like kind has happened in the matter of
   transubstantiation and (I think) in the scholastic notion of the
   trinity, &c.

THE ANSWER TO A SIXTH LETTER,

  BEING PART OF A LETTER WRITTEN TO ANOTHER GENTLEMAN, WHO HAD PROPOSED SEVERAL
  OF THE SAME OBJECTIONS WITH THE FOREGOING.

   Sir,

   You will give me leave, without any preface or apology, to propose
   directly the best answer I can to the objections you have offered.

   There are but two ways by which the being, and all or any of the
   attributes of God can possibly be proved. The one, a priori, the other
   a posteriori.

   The proof a posteriori [409] is level to all men's capacities; because
   there is an endless gradation of wise and useful phenomena of nature,
   from the most obvious to the most abstruse; which afford (at least a
   moral and reasonable) proof of the being of God, to the several
   capacities of all unprejudiced men, who have any probity of mind: And
   this is what (I suppose) God expects (as a moral governor,) that moral
   agents should be determined by.

   The proof a priori is (I fully believe) strictly demonstrative, but
   (like numberless mathematical demonstrations,) capable of being
   understood by only a few attentive minds, because it is of use only
   against learned and metaphysical difficulties. And, therefore, it must
   never be expected that this should be made obvious to the generality of
   men, any more than astronomy or mathematics can be.

   This being premised in general, I proceed to particulars.

   Concerning the notion of self-existence I explain myself thus: Of every
   thing that is, there is a reason which now does, or once or always did,
   determine the existence rather than the non-existence of that thing. Of
   that which derives not its being from any other thing, this reason, or
   ground of existence (whether we can attain to any idea of it or no,)
   must be in the thing itself: For though the bare proof, by
   ratiocination, that there cannot but exist such a being, does not
   indeed give us any distinct notion of self-existence, but only shows
   the certainty of the thing; yet when once a thing is known, by
   reasoning a posteriori, to be certain, it unavoidably follows that
   there is in nature a reason a priori, (whether we can discover it or
   no,) of the existence of that which we know cannot but exist. Since,
   therefore, in that which derives not its being from any other thing,
   the ground or reason why it exists rather than not exists, must be in
   the thing itself, and it is a plain contradiction to suppose its own
   will, by way of efficient cause, to be the reason of its existence, it
   remains that absolute necessity (the same necessity that is the cause
   of the unalterable proportion between 2 and 4,) be, by way of formal
   cause, the ground of that existence. And this necessity is indeed
   antecedent, though not in time, yet in the order of nature, to the
   existence of the being itself: Whereas, on the contrary, its own will
   is, in the order of nature, subsequent to the supposition of the
   existence of the being; and therefore cannot be the formal cause of
   that existence.

   Nothing can be more absurd than to suppose that any thing (or any
   circumstance of any thing) is, and yet that there be absolutely no
   reason why it is, rather than not. It is easy to conceive that we may
   indeed be utterlyignorant of the reasons, or grounds, or causes of many
   things. But, that any thing is; and that there is a real reason in
   nature why it is, rather than is not; these two are as necessarily and
   essentially connected as any two correlates whatever, as height and
   depth, &c.

   The scholastic way of proving the existence of the self-existent being,
   from the absolute perfection of his nature, is husteron troteron; for
   all or any perfections presuppose existence, which is petitio
   principii. But bare necessity of existence does not presuppose, but
   infer existence. That which exists by absolute necessity of nature will
   always (whether you will or no) be supposed or included in any possible
   idea of things, even where you never so expressly endeavour to exclude
   it; just as the proportion between 2 and 4 remains included in the very
   terms wherein any man would endeavour expressly to deny it.

   To exist at all, and to exist everywhere, are one and the very same
   thing, where the cause or ground of the existence is not either
   confined to, or operates only in, some particular place. For 2 and 4 to
   have at all a certain proportion to each other, and to have that same
   proportion everywhere, is the very same thing; and the like is true of
   every thing that is necessary in itself. To suppose (as you suggest)
   that the self-existent being may be limited by its own nature, is
   presupposing a nature, or limiting quality: Whereas, in this case, here
   must nothing be presupposed; no nature, no quality whatsoever, but what
   arises (and consequently everywhere alike) from a necessity absolute in
   itself, and antecedent (in the order of our ideas) to any nature,
   place, quality, time, or thing whatsoever.

   When I say that necessity, absolutely such in itself, has no relation
   to time or place; my meaning is, that it has no relation to, or
   dependence upon, any particular time or place, or any thing in any
   particular time or place; but that it is the same in all time, and in
   all place. What you mean by time and place being finite, I understand
   not: The schoolmen's notion of time's depending on the motions or
   existence of the material world, is as senseless as the supposing it to
   depend on the turning or not turning of an hour-glass. The same also is
   true of place.

   Infinite space is infinite extension; and eternity is infinite
   duration. They are the two first, and most obvious, and simple ideas
   that every man has in his mind. Time and place are the sine qua non of
   all other things, and of all other ideas. To suppose either of them
   finite, is an express contradiction in the idea itself. No man does or
   can possibly imagine either of them to be finite; but only, either by
   non-attention, or by choice, he attends perhaps to part of his idea,
   and forbears attending to the remainder. All the difficulty that has
   ever arisen about this matter, is nothing but dust thrown by men's
   using words (or rather sounds only) in their philosophy, instead of
   ideas. And the arguments drawn from the jargon of the schoolmen, will
   equally prove every axiom in Euclid to be uncertain and unintelligible.

   They who remove the idea of infinity, (or of a being whose attribute
   infinity is,) by supposing space to be nothing but a relation between
   two bodies, are guilty of the absurdity of supposing that which is
   nothing to have real qualities. For the space which is between two
   bodies is always unalterably just what it was; and has the very same
   dimensions, quantity, and figure, whether these, or any other bodies be
   there, or anywhere else, or not at all; just as time or duration is the
   same, [410] whether you turn your hour-glass, or no; or whether the sun
   moves, or stands still; or whether there was or was not any sun, or any
   material world at all.

   The schoolmen's distinctions about spirits existing in ubi, and not in
   loco, are mere empty sounds, without any manner of signification.

   To set bounds to space, is to suppose it bounded by something which
   itself takes up space, and that is a contradiction: Or else that it is
   bounded by nothing, and then the idea of that nothing will still be
   space, which is another contradiction. Beings which exist in time, and
   in space, (as every finite thing must needs do,) presuppose time and
   space: But that being, whose existence makes duration and space, must
   be infinite and eternal, because duration and space can have no bounds.
   Not that duration and space are the formal cause of that existence,
   but, that necessary attributes do necessarily and inseparably infer or
   show to us a necessary substance; of which substance itself we have no
   image, because it is the object of none of our senses: But we perceive
   its existence by its effects, and the necessity of that existence by
   the necessity of certain attributes, and by other arguments of reason
   and inference. To suppose space removed, destroyed, or taken away,
   amounts to the absurd supposition of removing a thing away from itself:
   That is, if in your imagination you annihilate the whole of infinite
   space, the whole infinite space will still remain: and if you
   annihilate any part of it, that part will still necessarily remain, as
   appears by the unmoved situation of the rest: And to suppose it divided
   or divisible, amounts to the same contradiction.

   The objection of immensity being inconsistent with spirituality and
   simplicity, arises merely from the jargon of the schoolmen, who (in
   order to help out transubstantiation,) have used themselves to speak of
   this and of many other things in phrases which had no meaning or ideas
   belonging to them: By denying the real immensity and the real eternal
   duration of God, they, in true consequence, (though it is reasonable to
   suppose they saw not that consequence,) denied his being. The immensity
   of space, (it being throughout absolutely uniform and essentially
   indivisible,) is no more inconsistent with simplicity than the uniform
   successive flowing of the parts of duration (as you most rightly
   observe,) are inconsistent with simplicity. There is no difficulty at
   all in this point, but a mere prejudice, and false notion of
   simplicity.

   As to spirituality; the individual consciousness of the one immense
   being is as truly one as the present moment of time is individually
   one, in all places at once: And the one can no more properly be said to
   be an ell or a mile of consciousness, (which is the sum of your
   objection,) than the other can be said to be an ell or a mile of time.
   This suggestion seems to deserve particular consideration.

   To the objection, that the supposing God to be really and substantially
   omnipresent, is supposing him to be the soul of the world, I answer:
   This is a great mistake. For the word soul signifies a part of a whole,
   whereof body is the other part; and they, being united, mutually affect
   each other as parts of the same whole. But God is present to every part
   of the universe, not as a soul, but as a governor; so as to act upon
   every thing in what manner he pleases, himself being acted upon by
   nothing.

   What you suggest about space having no parts, because it is infinite,
   is a mere quibble indeed, and has nothing in it. The meaning of parts,
   (in questions of this nature,) is separable, compounded, un-united
   parts, such as are the parts of matter; which, for that reason, is
   always a compound, not a simple substance. No matter is one substance,
   but a heap of substances: And that I take to be the reason why matter
   is a subject incapable of thought; not because it is extended, but
   because its parts are distinct substances, un-united, and independent
   on each other; which (I believe) is not the case of other substances.
   The kinds of substance may perhaps be more and more different from each
   other, than we, (at present,) for want of more senses, are aware of.
   Matter and spirit is no other division than matter and not matter; just
   as if one should divide the species of animals into horses and not
   horses.

   As to the question, why absolute necessity will not admit of the
   existence of two distinct independent beings, as well as of different
   attributes and properties in one independent being, I answer; absolute
   necessity, in which there is nowhere any variation, cannot be the
   ground of existence of a number of finite beings, however agreeing and
   harmonious, because that (viz. number, or finiteness,) is itself a
   manifest difformity or inequality. But it may be the ground or
   existence of one uniform infinite being: The different attributes of
   which one uniform being are not a variety of parts, or an
   un-uniformness, (if I may so speak) of the necessity by which it
   exists, but they are all and each of them attributes of the whole,
   attributes of the one simple infinite being; just as the powers of
   hearing and seeing are not inequalities or difformities in the soul of
   man; but each of them powers of the whole soul.

   As to the last argument you refer to, my meaning therein is this; that
   it is a contradiction to suppose two (or more) necessarily-existing
   beings, because each of them, by the supposition, being independent,
   and sufficient to itself, though the other were supposed not to exist,
   they thereby each of them mutually destroy the supposed necessity of
   the other's existence, and, consequently, neither of them indeed will
   be necessary or independent. For instance; if matter, or spirit, or any
   other substance, could as possibly be conceived to exist without that
   in which they all exist, as that in which they all exist can be
   conceived to exist without them, then there would be
   necessary-existence on neither part.

   As to the question concerning the possible plurality of infinites; it
   is certainly true that the infinity of space neither excludes finite
   bodies nor finite spirits, nor infinite body, nor infinite spirit. But
   it excludes every thing of the same kind, whether finite or infinite;
   which is all that my argument requires. There can be but one infinite
   space, and but one infinite time, and but one infinite spirit, (taking
   spirit to mean a particular positive distinct substance, and not the
   mere negative non-matter, of which there may be innumerable kinds;) and
   if matter could be infinite, there could likewise be but one infinite
   body, and so on. For one infinite, in all dimensions, exhausts always
   the whole possibility of that kind, though it excludes not others.

   The ubi of spirits being their perception only; and the omnipresence of
   God being his infinite knowledge only, are mere words, without any
   sense at all: And, by the like confusion, any thing may be said to be
   any thing, and we have in us no principles of knowledge at all, nor any
   use either of words or ideas.

THE ANSWER TO A SEVENTH LETTER,

  CONCERNING THE ARGUMENT a priori.

   "To the Reverend Dr***

   "Your objection against arguing at all a priori, concerning the
   existence and perfections of the first cause, is what many learned men
   have indeed stuck at. And it being evident that nothing can be prior to
   the first cause, they have therefore thought it sufficient to say that
   the first cause exists "absolutely without cause;" and that therefore
   there can be no such thing, as reasoning or arguing about it a priori
   at all. But if you attend carefully you will find this way of speaking
   to be by no means satisfactory. For though it is indeed most evident,
   that no thing, no being, can be prior to that being which is the first
   cause and original of all things, yet there must be in nature a ground
   or reason, a permanent ground or reason of the existence of the first
   cause: Otherwise its existence would be owing to, and depend upon mere
   chance. And all that could be said upon this head would amount to this
   only; that it exists, because it exists; that it therefore does and
   always did exist, because it does and always did exist: Which the
   followers of Spinoza will, with equal strength of reason, affirm
   concerning every substance that exists at all.

   "If the idea of an eternal and infinite nothing were a possible idea,
   and not contradictory in itself; the existence of the first cause would
   not be necessary: [411] And if the existence of the first cause was not
   necessary, it would be no contradiction to suppose it either not to
   have existed in time past, or to cease to exist at any time to come.
   The existence therefore of the first cause is necessary; necessary
   absolutely and in itself. And therefore that necessity is, a priori,
   and in the order of nature, the ground or reason of its existence. For
   that which exists necessarily, or in the idea of which existence and
   necessity are inseparably and necessarily connected, must either
   therefore be necessary, because it exists, or else it must therefore
   exist because its existence is necessary. If it was therefore
   necessary, because it existed, then, for the same reason, every thing
   that exists would exist necessarily; and either every thing or nothing
   would be the first cause. On the contrary, if the first cause does
   therefore exist, because its existence is necessary, then necessity is
   the ground or reason or foundation of that existence; and the existence
   does not infer, (that is a priori, or in the order of nature and
   consequence, antecede) the necessity of existing; but the necessity of
   existing does on the contrary infer, (that is, a priori, or in the
   order of nature, antecede) the supposition of the existence; which is
   what I proposed to prove.

   "The argument a posteriori is indeed by far the most generally useful
   argument; most easy to be understood, and in some degree suited to all
   capacities; and therefore it ought always to be distinctly insisted
   upon. But forasmuch as atheistical writers have sometimes opposed the
   being and attributes of God by such metaphysical reasonings as can no
   otherwise be obviated than by arguing a priori; therefore this manner
   of arguing also, is useful, and necessary in its proper place.

   The eternity of God can no otherwise be proved, than by considering, a
   priori, the nature of a necessary or self-existent cause. The temporary
   phenomena of nature prove indeed demonstrably, a posteriori, that there
   is, and has been from the beginning of those phenomena, a being of
   power and wisdom sufficient to produce and preserve those phenomena.
   But that this first cause has existed from eternity, and shall exist to
   eternity, cannot be proved from those temporary phenomena; but must be
   demonstrated from the intrinsic nature of necessary-existence. If the
   first cause exists "absolutely without any ground or reason of
   existence;" it might as possibly in times past, without any reason,
   have not existed; and may as possibly in times to come, without any
   reason, cease to exist. Can it be proved, a posteriori, that the first
   cause of all things will exist to-morrow? Or can it be proved any
   otherwise, than by showing that necessity is a certain ground of future
   as well as of present existence? And if so, then the ground, or reason,
   upon which the first cause now does, and hereafter always will, and
   cannot but exist, is the very same ground or reason upon which he
   always did exist: And, consequently, it cannot with truth be affirmed
   that the first cause exists "absolutely without any ground or reason of
   existence." It is true, indeed, there is no antecedent reason why
   necessity is necessity. It is in itself essentially immediate; and it
   is absurd to suppose that it can be perceived otherwise than
   immediately and intuitively. Yet, I think, it is not an absurd question
   to ask, why that which is now a necessary being must equally in all
   past time have been, and in all future time continue to be, a necessary
   being? And the answer to that question will express fully all that I
   mean, by affirming the necessity to be the ground or reason of the
   existence. When atheistical writers affirm that the material universe,
   and every existing substance in particular, was eternal "absolutely
   without any ground or reason of existence;" can this assertion be
   confuted by him who shall himself affirm that God was eternal
   absolutely without any ground or reason of existence? Or can it be any
   other way confuted at all, than by showing that something must be
   necessarily-existent, (else nothing would ever have existed;) and that
   that which is necessarily-existent, cannot possibly be either finite or
   moveable, or at any time capable of any alterations, limitations,
   variations, inequalities, or diversifications whatsoever, either in
   whole, or in part, or in different parts, either of space or time?

   In like manner, the infinity or immensity or omnipresence of God, can
   no otherwise be proved than by considering, a priori, the nature of a
   necessary or self-existent cause. The finite phenomena of nature prove
   indeed demonstrably, a posteriori, that there is a being which has
   extent of power and wisdom sufficient to produce and preserve all these
   phenomena. But that this author of nature is himself absolutely immense
   or infinite, cannot be proved from these finite phenomena, but must be
   demonstrated from the intrinsic nature of necessary existence. If the
   first cause exists "absolutely without any ground or reason of
   existence," it may as possibly be finite as infinite; it may as
   possibly be limited as be immense. It may as possibly, in other places,
   without any reason, not exist, as it does, without any reason, exist in
   those places where the phenomena of nature prove that it does exist.
   Can it be proved, a posteriori, that that governing wisdom and power,
   which the phenomena of nature in this material world demonstrate to be
   present here, must therefore be immense, infinite, or omnipresent? Must
   be present likewise in those boundless spaces, where we know of no
   phenomena or effects to prove its existence? Or can the immensity and
   omnipresence of the first cause be at all proved any other way than by
   showing that necessity of existence is capable of no limitation; but
   must for the same reason be the ground of immense or omnipresent
   existence, as it is the ground or foundation of any existence at all?

   Again; the unity of God, (which, I think has always been allowed to be
   a principle of natural religion, otherwise St Paul could not justly
   have blamed the heathen as inexcusable, in that they did not like to
   retain God in their knowledge, and that, when they knew God, they
   glorified him not as God: The unity of God, I say,) can no otherwise be
   demonstrated, than by considering, a priori, the nature of a necessary
   or self-existent cause. The phenomena of nature which come within the
   reach of our observation, prove indeed demonstrably that there is a
   supreme author and director of that nature, or of those phenomena,
   whereof we have any knowledge. But that this supreme author and
   governor of nature, or of these phenomena, is likewise the supreme
   author and governor of universal nature; cannot be entirely proved by
   our partial and imperfect knowledge of a few phenomena in that small
   part of the universe which comes within the reach of our senses; but
   must be demonstrated from the intrinsic nature of necessary existence.
   If the first cause exists "absolutely without any ground or reason of
   existence," it is altogether as possible, and as probable, and as
   reasonable, to suppose that there may, without any reason, exist
   numberless finite independent coexistent first causes (either of like
   nature and substance to each other, or of different nature and
   substance from each other,) in different parts of the immense universe;
   as that there should, without any reason, exist one only infinite,
   immense, omnipresent, first cause, author and governor of the whole.

   That there is, and cannot but be one, and one only, such first cause,
   author and governor of the universe; is (I conceive) capable of strict
   demonstration, including that part of the argument which is deduced a
   priori The subject of the question is no trifle. If any sober-minded
   man is persuaded, he can find any flaw in that demonstration, or cares
   not to examine it, lest any of its consequences should prove
   inconsistent with some other notions he may perhaps through prejudice
   have imbibed, I should be very thankful to him to show how the unity of
   God (the first principle of natural religion) can at all be proved by
   reason a posteriori only.

   Some such considerations as these, (I suppose) they were, or others of
   the like nature, which moved Mr Limborch to write thus to Mr Locke:
   "Argumentum desiderat vir magnificus, quo probetur ens, cujus
   existentia est necessaria, tantum posse esse unum, et quidem ut id
   argumentum à necessitate existentia desumatur, et a priori (ut in
   scholis loquuntur,) non a posteriori concludat; hoc est, ex natura
   necessariæ existentiæ probatur eam pluribus non posse esse communem."
   To which Mr Locke replies; "Les theologiens, les philosophes, et
   Descartes luy-meme, supposent l'unité de Dieu, sans la prouver." After
   which, having suggested his own thoughts, he thus concludes. "C'est la,
   selon moy, une preuve a priori, que l'Etre eternel independent n'est
   qu'un."

   "To argue, therefore, a priori concerning the existence and attributes
   of the first cause, is no absurdity. For though no thing, no being, can
   indeed be a priori to the first cause; yet arguments may, and must be
   drawn from the nature and consequences of that necessity, by which the
   first cause exists. Mathematical necessary truths are usually
   demonstrated a prioriand yet nothing is prior to truths eternally
   necessary. To confine, therefore, the use of term, argumentations above
   such things only as have other things prior to them in time, is on y
   quibbling about the signification of words.

   "To the objection, that an attribute cannot be the ground or reason of
   the existence of the substance itself, which is always on the contrary
   the support of the attributes, I answer; that, in strictness of speech,
   necessity of existence is not an attribute, in the sense that
   attributes are properly so styled; but it is, [sui generis,] the ground
   or foundation of existence, both of the substance and of all the
   attributes. Thus, in other instances, immensity is not an attribute, in
   the sense that wisdom, power, and the like, are strictly so called; but
   it is [sui generis,] a mode of existence both of the substance and of
   all the attributes. In like manner; eternity, is not an attribute or
   property in the sense that other attributes, inhering in the substance,
   and supported by it are properly so called; but it is [sui generis,]
   the duration of existence, both of the substance and of all the
   attributes. Attributes or properties, strictly so called, cannot be
   predicated one of another. Wisdom cannot properly be said to be
   powerful; or power to be wise. But immensity is a mode of existence,
   both of the divine substance and of all the attributes. Eternity is the
   duration of existence, both of the divine substance, and of all the
   attributes. And necessity is the ground, or reason, or foundation of
   existence both of the divine substance, and of all the attributes.

       putant, efficere ut ea quæ ex ejus natura sequi diximus; hoc est,

       dicerent quod Deus potest efficere, ut, ex natura trianguli, non
       sequatur ejus tres angulos æquales esse duobus rectis.--Ego me
       satis clare ostendisse puto, a summa Dei potentia, omnia necessario
       effluxisse, vel semper eadem necessitate sequi; eodem modo ac, ex
       natura trianguli, ab æterno et in æternum sequitur ejus tres
       angulos æquari duobus rectis.: [710]1
     * Angusta admodum est circa nostra tantummodo commoda, lætitiæ
       matria; sed eadem erit amplissima, si aliorum omnium felicitas
       cordi nobis sit. Quippe hæc ad illam eandem habebit proportionem,
       quam habet immensa beatitudo Dei, totiusque humani generis, ad

       eique invido et malevolo, fortunæ bona possint suppeditare.: [711]1

       existentia est necessaria, tantum posse esse unum, et quidem ut id
       argumentum à necessitate existentia desumatur, et a priori (ut in

       organum proprium; et premendo, (mediantibus nervis et membranis,)

       nascitur cordis resistentia et contra-pressio seu antitupia: [719]1
     * Collitur autem, non taurornm opimis corporibus contrucidatis, nec
       auro argentove suspenso, nec in thesauros stipe infusa; sed pia et
       recta voluntate.: [720]1
     * Concludendum est, legem naturæ semper et ubique obligare in foro
       interno, sive conscientia, non semper in foro externo, sed tum
       solummodo, cum secure id fieri possit.: [721]1

       pactitia tantum, id est, artificiosa.: [722]1

       paucissimis Dei verbis tam placidum, quam ovem, reddam. Da

       aut præstare, si velit, potest?: [733]1

       malum: [734]1

     * Denique nequis obligationem legum naturalium arbitrariam et
       mutabilem a nobis fingi suspicetur, hoc adjiciendum censui;
       virtutum exercitium, habere rationem medii necessarii ad finem,
       (seposita consideratione imperii divini,) manente rerum natura tali
       qualis nunc est. Hoc autem ita intelligo, uti agnoscunt plerique
       omnes, additionem duarum unitatum duabus prius positis, necessario
       constituere numerum quaternarium; aut, uti praxes geometricæ et
       mechanicæ, problemata proposita solvunt immutabiliter; adeo ut nec

       contrarium constituere posse.: [736]1
     * Deorum providentia mundus administratur; iidemque consulunt rebus
       humanis; neque solum universis, verum etiam singulis.: [737]1
     * Detrahere aliquid alteri, et hominem hominis incommodo suum augere

       rebus externis.: [738]1

     * Deus ex solis suæ naturæ legibus, et a nemine coactus, agit.:
       [742]1
     * Deus non est æternitas vel infinitas, sed æternus et infinitus; non
       est duratio vel spatium, sed durat et adest. Durat semper, et adest
       ubique; et, existendo semper et ubique, durationem et spatium,
       æternitatem et infinitatem, constituit. Cum unaquæque spatii
       particula sit semper, et unumquodque durationis indivisibile
       momentum, ubique; certè rerum omnium fabricator ac Dominus, non
       erit nunquam nusquam omnipræsens est, non per virtutem solam, sed
       etiam per substantiam; nam virtus sine substantia subsistere non
       potest. In ipso continentur et moventur universa, &c.: [743]1
     * Deus non magis dici potest ex libertate voluntatis agere, quam dici
       potest ex libertate motus et quietis agere.: [744]1
     * Dictamina divini intellectus sanciuntur in leges apud ipsum
       valituras, per immutabilitatem harum perfectionum: [745]1
     * Dignæ itaque sunt, quæ propter intrinsecam sibi perfectionem
       appetantur, etiam si nulla esset naturæ lex, quæ illas imperaret.:
       [746]1
     * Doctrina alia, quæ obedientiæ civili repugnat, est, quicquid faciat
       civis quicunque contra conscientiam suam, peccatum esse.: [747]1
     * Dubitari non potest, quin Deus, qui ita naturalem rerum omnium
       ordinem constituit, ut talia sint actionum humanarum consequentia
       erga ipsos auctores, fecitque ut ordinaria hæc consequentia ab
       ipsis præsciri possint, aut summa cum probabilitate expectari,
       voluerit hæc ab iis considerari, antequam ad agendum se
       accingerent; atque eos his provisis velut argumentis in legum
       sanctione contentis determinari.: [748]1
     * Ea, quæ vis, ut potero, explicabo; nec tamen quasi Pythius Apollo,
       certa ut sint et fixa quæ dixero, sed ut homunculus unus è multis,
       probabilia conjectura sequens. Ultra enim quò progrediar, quam ut
       verisimilia videam, non habeo.: [749]1
     * Eadem est duratio seu perseverantia existentiæ rerum; sive motus
       sint celeres, sive tardi, sive nulli.: [750]1
     * Eadem est mensura boni malique, quæ mensura est veri falsique in
       propositionibus pronuntiantibus de efficacia motum ad rerum aliarum
       conservationem, et corruptionem facientium.: [751]1
     * Epicurum verbis reliquisse Deos, re sustulisse.: [752]1
     * Errant ergo velut in mari magno, nec quo ferantur intelligunt; quia
       nec viam cernunt nec ducem sequuntur.: [753]1
     * Est autem unus dies bene et ex preceptis tuis actus, peccanti
       immortalitati anteponendus.: [754]1
     * Est quidem vera lex, recta ratio naturæ congruens, diffusa in
       omnes, constans, sempiterna, quæ vocet ad officium jubendo;
       vetando, a fraude deterreat.----Huic legi nec abrogari fas est,
       neque derogari ex hac aliquid licet, neque tota abrogari potest.
       Nec vero aut per senatum aut per populum solvi hac lege possumus:
       [755]1
     * Est similitudo quædam inter id, quod in vita communi vocatur
       injuria, et id quod in scholis solet appellari absurdum.
       Quemadmodum enim is, qui argumentis cogitur ad negationem
       assertionis quam prius asseruerat, dicitur redigi ad absurdum;
       eodem modo is, qui præ animi impotentia facit vel omittit id quod
       se non facturum vel non omissurum pacto suo ante promiserat,
       injuriam facit; neque minus in contradictionem incidit, quam qui in
       scholis reducitur ad absurdum.--Est itaque injuria, absurditas,
       quædam in conversatione, sicut absurditas, injuria quædam est in
       disputatione.: [756]1
     * Est, inquit Cicero, philosophia paucis contenta judicibus,
       multitudinem consulto ipsa, fugiens.----Maximum itaque argumentum
       est, philosophiam quod neque ad sapientiam tendere, neque ipsam
       esse sapientiam, quod mysterium ejus, barba tantum celebratur et
       pallio.: [757]1
     * Et primum quidem omni antiquitate, &c.: [758]1
     * Etiam extra regimen civile, a malis omnigenis simul consideratis
       tutior erit, qui actibus externis leges naturæ constantissime
       observabet; quam qui, juxta doctrinam Hobbianam, vi aut insidiis
       alios omnes conando præoccupare, securitatem sibi quæsiverit.:
       [759]1
     * Etsi nihil nimis oportet confidere. Movemur enim sæpe aliquo acutè
       concluso, labamus mutamusque sententiam clarioribus etiam in rebus;
       in his est enim aliqua obscuritas.: [760]1
     * Eum mundi casum relatum in arcanis vestris habetis.: [761]1
     * Ex cæteris philosophis, nonne optimus et gravissimus quisque
       confitetur, multa se ignorare; et multa sibi etiam atque etiam esse
       discenda?: [762]1
     * Ex his sequitur injuriam nemini fieri posse, nisi ei quocum initur
       pactum. : [763]1
     * Ex his sequitur, injuriam nemini fieri posse, &c.: [764]1
     * Ex his sequitur, injuriam nemini fieri posse, nisi ei quocum initur
       pactum.: [765]1
     * Ex his sequitur, injuriam nemini fieri posse, nisi ei quocum initur
       pactum.----Siquis alicui noceat, quocum nihil pactus est, damnum ei
       infert, non injuriam.----Etenim si is qui damnum recipit, injuriam
       expostularet; is qui fecit sic diceret, quid tu mihi? quare facerem
       ego tuo potius, quam meo libitu? &c. In qua ratione, ubi nulla
       intercesserunt pacta, non video quid sit quod possit reprehendi.:
       [766]1
     * Ex necessitate Divinæ Naturæ, infinita infinitis modis (hoc est,
       omnia quæ sub intellectum infinitum cadere possunt,) sequi debent.:
       [767]1
     * Ex necessitate divinæ naturæ infinita infinitis modis seque
       debent.: [768]1
     * Ex necessitate divinæ naturæ, infinita infinitis modis (hoc est,
       omnia quæ sub intellectum infinitum cadere possunt,) seque debent.:
       [769]1
     * Ex necessitate divinæ naturæ, infinita infinitis modis sequi
       debent: [770]1
     * Ex necessitate divinæ naturæ, infinita infinitis modis sequi
       debent.: [771]1
     * Ex quo efficitur, hominem naturæ obedientem, homini nocere non
       posse.: [772]1
     * Ex quo intelligitur, sensionis immediatam causam esse in eo, quod
       sensionis organum primum et tangit et premit. Si enim organi pars
       extima prematur; illa cedente, premetur quoque pars quæ versus
       interiora illi proxima est; et ita propagabitur pressio, sive motus
       ille, per partes organi omnes, usque ad intimam.--Quoniam autem
       motui ab objecto per media ad organi partem intimam propagato, fit
       aliqua totius organi resistentia sive reactio, per motum ipsius
       organi internum naturalem; fit propterea conatui ab objecto,
       conatus ab organo contrarius. Ut, cù m conatus ille ad intima,
       ultimus actus sit eorum qui fiunt in actu sensionis; tum demum ex
       ea reactione aliquandiu durante, ipsum existant phantasma; quod,
       propter conatum versus externa, semper videtur tanquam aliquid
       situm extra organum.: [773]1
     * Formam ipsam, et tanquam faciem honesti, quæ si oculis cerneretur,
       mirabiles amores, ut ait Plato, excitaret sui.: [774]1
     * Hæc autem in opinione existimare, non in natura ponere, dementis
       est. Nam nec arboris nec equi virtus, quæ dicitur, in opinione sita
       est, sed in natura.: [775]1
     * Harum sententiarum quæ vera sit, Deus aliquis viderit; quæ
       verisimillima, magna quæstio est.: [776]1
     * Has tamen imagines [mortuorum,] loqui volebant; quod fieri nec sine
       lingua, nec sine palato, nec sine faucium, laterum, pulmonum vi et
       figura potest. Nihil enim animo, (speaking of such as attributed to
       spirits the same power, and senses only, as they saw men indued
       with in this present state,) videre poterant: ad oculos omnia
       referebant. Magni autem ingenii est, revocare mentem a sensibus, et
       cogitationem a consuetudine abducere.: [777]1
     * Hinc sequitur, Deum non operari ex libertate voluntatis.: [778]1
     * His et talibus adductus Socrates, nec patronum quæsivit ad judicium
       capitis, nec judicibus supplex fuit, et supremo vitæ die, de hoc
       ipso multa disseruit; et paucis ante diebus, cum facile posset
       educi e custodia, noluit.----Ita enim censebat, itaque disseruit,
       duas esse vias, duplicesque cursus animorum, e corpore excedentium,
       &c.: [779]1
     * Hoc exigit ipsa naturæ ratio, quæ est lex divina et humana, cui
       parere qui velit, nunquam committet ut alienum appetat, et id, quod
       alteri detraxerit, sibi assumat.: [780]1
     * Hoc tamen non magis tollit consensum hominum de generali natura
       boni, ejusque partibus vel speciebus præcipuis, quam levis vultuum
       diversitas tollit convenientiam inter homines in communi hominum
       definitione, aut similitudinem inter eos in partium principalium
       conformatione et usu. Nulla gens est quæ non sentiat actus Deum
       diligendi, &c.--nulla gens quæ non sentit gratitudinem erga
       parentes et benefactores, toti humano generi salutarem esse. Nulla
       temperamentorum diversitas facit ut quisquam non bonum esse sentiat
       universis, ut singulorum innocentium vitæ, membra, et libertas
       conserventur.: [781]1
     * Hominem esse quasi partem quandam civitatis et universi generis
       humani, eumque esse conjunctum cum hominibus humana quadam
       societate.: [782]1
     * Homines hominum causa sunt generati, ut ipsi inter se alii aliis
       prodesse possint.: [783]1
     * Homines inter se de honoribus et dignitatibus perpetuo contendunt,
       sed animalia illa [apes et formicæ] non item. Itaque inter homines
       invidia, odium, bellum, &c.: [784]1
     * Homines libertatis et dominii per naturam amatores.: [785]1
     * Honestum intelligimus, quod tale est, ut, detractâ omni utilitate,
       sine ullis præmiis fructibusque, per seipsum possit jure laudari.:
       [786]1
     * Idemque dici possit de uniformitate illa, quæ est in corporibus
       animalium, viz. necessario fatendum est intelligentia et consilio
       fuisse effectam.: [787]1
     * Iis quorum potentiæ resisti non potest, et per consequens Deo
       omnipotenti, jus dominandi ab ipsa potentia derivatur.: [788]1
     * Illud breve vitæ reliquum nec avide appetendum sensibus, nec sine
       causa deserendum est; vetatque Pythagoras injussu imperatoris, id
       est, Dei, de præsidio et statione vitæ decedere.: [789]1
     * Illud vero nonne summæ vanitatis, quod ante mortem familiares suos
       rogavit, ut Æ sculapio gallum, quem voverat, pro se sacrarent?:
       [790]1
     * Immo adversarii, [qui negant, ex necessitate divinæ naturæ, omnia
       necessario fluere,] Dei omnipotentiam negare videntur. Coguntur
       enim fateri, Deum infinita creabilia intelligere quæ tamen nunquam
       creare poterit: Nam alias; si scilicet omnia, quæ intelligit
       crearet, suam, juxta ipsos, exhauriret omnipotentiam, et se
       imperfectum redderet. Ut igitur Deum perfectum statuant, eo
       rediguntur, ut simul statuere debeant ipsum non posse omnia
       efficere, ad quæ ejus potentia se extendit.: [791]1
     * Impellimur autem natura, ut prodesse velimus quamplurimis.: [792]1
     * Imperii sui memoriam magnitudine operum gestiens propagare,
       ambitiosum quondam apud Hierosolymam templum, quod post multa et
       interneciva certamina obsidente Vespasiano posteaque Tito ægrè est
       expugnatum, instaurare sumptibus cogitabat immodicis; negotiumque
       maturandum Alypio dederat Antiochensi, qui olim Britannias
       curaverat, pro præfectis. Cù m itaque rei idem instaret Alypius,
       juvaretque provinciæ rector; metuendi globi flammarum prope
       fundamenta crebris assultibus erumpentes fecere locum exustis
       aliquoties operantibus inaccessum; hocque modo, elemento
       destinatius repellente, cessavit inceptum.: [793]1
     * In judicio de bonitate harum rerum, æque omnes ubique convenirunt,
       ac omnia animalia in motu cordis et arteriarum pulsu, aut omnes
       homines in opinione de nivis candore et splendore solis.: [794]1
     * In mente nulla est absoluta sive libera voluntas; sed mens ad hoc
       vel illud volendum determinatur a causa, quæ etiam ab alia
       determinata est, et hæc iterum ab alio, et sic in infinitum.:
       [795]1
     * In omni honesto, nihil est tam illustre, nec quod latius pateat,
       quam conjunctio inter homines hominum, et quasi quædam societas et
       communicatio utilitatum, et ipsa charitas generis humani; quæ nata
       a primo satu, quo a procreatoribus nati diliguntur,----serpit
       sensim foras, cognationibus primum,----deinde totius complexu
       gentis humanæ.: [796]1
     * In regno naturali, regnandi et puniendi eos qui leges suas violant,
       jus Deo est a sola potentia irresistibili.: [797]1
     * In statu naturali, unicuique licebat facere quæcunque et in
       quoscunque libebat.: [798]1
     * Inclusos [philosophos] in angulis, facienda præcipere, quæ ne ipsi
       quidem faciunt qui loquuntur, linguæ et quoniam se a veris actibus
       removerunt, apparet eos exercendæ causa, vel advocandi gratia,
       artem ipsam philosophiæ reperisse.: [799]1
     * Inter animalia illa bonum publicum et privatum idem est.--Homini
       autem in bonis propriis nihil tam jucundum est, quam quod alienis
       sunt majora.: [800]1
     * Ita principem legem illam et ultimam, mentem esse omnia ratione aut
       cogentis aut vetantis Dei.: [801]1
     * Ita sit, ut si ab illa rerum summa, quam superiù s comprehendimus,
       aberraveris; omnis ratio intereat, et ad nihilum omnia
       revertantur.: [802]1
     * Ita sit, ut si ab illa rerum summa, quam superius comprehendimus,
       aberravercs, omnis ratio intereat, et ad nihilum omnia
       revertantur.: [803]1
     * Itaque et sensioni adhæret proprie dictæ, ut ei aliqua insita sit
       perpetua phantasmatum varietas; ita ut aliud ab alio discerni
       possit. Si supponemus enim esse hominem, oculis quidem claris,
       cæterisque videndi organis recte se habentibus compositum, nullo
       autem alio sensu præditum, eumque ad eandem rem eodem semper colore
       et specie sine ulla vel minima varietate apparentem obversum esse;
       mihi certe, quicquid dicant alii, non videre videretur.--Attonitum
       esse, et fortasse aspectare eum, sed stupentem dicerem, videre non
       dicerem. Adeo sentire semper idem, et non sentire, ad idem
       recidunt.: [804]1
     * Itaque patet quod, si Hobbiana ratiocinatio esset valida, omnis
       simul legum civilium obligatio collaberetur; nec aliter fieri
       potest quin earum vis labefactetur ab omnibus principiis, quæ legum
       naturalium vim tollunt aut minuunt; quoniam his fundatur et
       regiminis civilis auctoritas ac securitas, et legum a civitatibus
       latarum vigor.: [805]1
     * Itaque si vir bonus habeat hanc vim, ut, si digitis concrepuerit,
       possit in locupletum testamenta nomen ejus irrepere, hac vi non
       utatur, ne si exploratum quidem habeat id omnino neminem unquam
       suspicaturum.----Hoc qui admiratur, is se, quis sit vir bonus,
       nescire fatetur.: [806]1
     * Item illud ex institutis pontificum et aruspicum non mutandum est,
       quibus hostiis immolandum cuique Deo.: [807]1
     * Jam vero stultissimum illud; existimare omnia justa esse, quæ scita
       sint in populorum institutis aut legibus. Etiamne si quæ sunt
       tyrannorum leges, si triginta illi Athenis leges imponere
       voluissent, aut si omnes Athenienses delectarentur tyrannicis
       legibus, num idcirco hæ leges justæ haberentur?: [808]1
     * Jus et omne honestum, sua sponte est expetendum. Etenim omnes viri
       boni, ipsam æquitatem et jus ipsum amant.: [809]1
     * Justos natura esse factos;----tantam autem esse corruptelam malæ
       consuetudinis, ut ab ea tanquam igniculi extinguantur a natura
       dati, exorianturque et confirmentur vitia contraria.: [810]1
     * Legem civilem, quæ non sit lata in contumeliam Dei (cujus respectu
       ipsæ civitates non sunt sui juris, nec dicuntur leges ferre, &c.):
       [811]1
     * Legem neque hominum ingeniis excogitatam, neque scitum aliquod esse
       populorum, sed æternum quiddami, quod universum mundum regat.:
       [812]1
     * Lex naturalis est pactis standum esse, sive fidem observandam
       esse.: [813]1
     * Lex naturalis omnes leges civiles jubet observari.: [814]1
     * Lex quæ seculis omnibus ante nata est, quam scripta lex ulla, aut
       quam omnino civitas constituta.: [815]1
     * Licet concurrant plebeii omnes philosophi, (sic enim ii qui à
       Platone et Socrate et ab illa familia dissident, appellandi
       videntur;) non modo nihil unquam tam eleganter explicabunt, sed ne
       hoc quidem ipsum quam subtiliter conclusum sit intelligent.: [816]1
     * Licet et Marcus quod edidit, Petri adfirmetur, cujus interpres
       Marcus; nam et Lucæ digestum, Paulo adscribere solent.: [817]1
     * Locis supra citatis: [818]1
     * Lucas, sectator Pauli, quod ab illo prædicabatur Evangelium, in
       libro condidit.: [819]1
     * Manifestum est rationem nullam esse lege prohibendi noxas tales,
       nisi agnoscant tales actus, etiam antecedenter ad ullam legem, mala
       esse.: [820]1
     * Marcus, discipulus et interpres Petri, quæ à Petro annuntiata
       erant, edidit.: [821]1
     * Mens ad hoc vel illud volendum determinatur a causa, quæ etiam ab
       alia determinata est, et hæc iterum ab alia, et sic in infinitum.:
       [822]1
     * Mens humana non potest non judicare, esse longè credibilius, quod
       eadem constantissima voluntas, à qua hominibus datum est esse,
       pariter mallet ipsos porro esse et valere, hoc est, conservari et
       felicitate frui, quam illo deturbari de statu, in quo ipsos
       collocavit----Sic scilicet e voluntate creandi, cognoscitur
       voluntas conservandi tuendique homines. Ex hac autem innotescit
       obligatio, qui tenemur ad inserviendum eidem voluntati notæ.:
       [823]1
     * Mentem hominis, quamvis eam non videas, ut Deum non vides, tamen,
       ut Deum agnoscis ex operibus ejus, sic ex memoria rerum, et
       inventione, et celeritate motus, omnique pulchritudine virtutis,
       vim divinam mentis agnoscito.: [824]1
     * Mihi autem non videtur de ulla unquam re esse dicendum, ipsam a Deo
       fieri non posse. Cum enim omnis ratio veri et boni ab ejus
       omnipotentia dependeat; ne quidem dicere ausim, Deum facere non
       posse ut mons sit sine valle, vel ut unum et duo non sint tria; sed
       tantum dico, talia implicare contradictionem in meo conceptu. Quod
       idem etiam de spatio, quod sit plane vacuum, &c.: [825]1
     * Motus nihil generat præter motum.: [826]1
     * Moveantur partes spatii de locis suis, et movebuntur (ut ita dicam)
       de seipsis.: [827]1
     * Multis signis natura declarat quid velit;--obsurdescimus tamen,
       nescio quomodo, nec audimus.: [828]1
     * Nam dum cometæ moventur in orbibus valde eccentricis, undique; et
       quoquoversum in omnes coeli partes; utique nullo modo fieri potuit
       ut cæco fato tribuendum sit; quod planetæ in orbibus concentricis
       motu consimili ferantur eodem omnes.--Tam miram uniformitatem in
       planetarum systemate, necessario fatendum est intelligentia et
       consilio fuisse effectam.: [829]1
     * Nam quoniam Deus jus ad omnia habet, et jus Dei nihil aliud est
       quam ipsa Dei potentia, hinc sequitur, unamquamque rem naturalem
       tantum juris ex natura habere, quantum potentiæ habet.: [830]1
     * Nam si, consensu omnium philosophorum, sapientiam nemo assequitur;
       in summis malis omnes sumus, quibus vos optimè consultum à Diis
       immortalibus dicitis. Nam ut nihil interest utrum nemo valeat, an
       nemo possit valere; sic non intelligo quid intersit, utrum nemo sit
       sapiens, an nemo esse possit.: [831]1
     * Nam stoliditas inveniri quæ inanior potest, quam mala esse nulla
       contendere, et tanquam malos perdere et condemnare peccantes?:
       [832]1
     * Nam ut vera et falsa, ut consequentia et contraria, sua sponte, non
       aliena, judicantur: sic constans et perpetua ratio vitæ, quæ est
       virtus; itemque inconstantia, quod est vitium; sua natura
       probatur.: [833]1
     * Natura dedit unicuique jus in omnia. Hoc est; in statu merè
       naturali, sive antequam homines ullis pactis sese invicem
       obstrinxissent, unicuique licebat facere quæcunque et in quoscunque
       libebat; et possidere, uti, frui omnibus, quæ volebat et poterat.:
       [834]1
     * Naturam finem nullum sibi præfixum habere; et omnes causas finales,
       nihil nisi humana esse figmenta.: [835]1
     * Nec potest cujus quam jus seu libertas ab ulla lege relicta eo
       extendere, ut liceat oppugnare ea, quæ aliis eadem lege imperantur
       facienda.: [836]1
     * Nec quid defendere debeant, scientes; nec quid refutare.
       Incursantque passim sine delectu omnia quæ asserunt, quicunque
       dissentiunt.: [837]1
     * Nec sequor Magos Persarum, quibus auctoribus Xerxes inflammâ sse
       templa Græciæ dicitur, quod parietibus includerent Deos, quorum hic
       mundus omnis templum esset et domus. Melius Græci atque nostri,
       qui, ut augerent pietatem in Deos, easdem illos, quas nos urbes
       incolere voluerunt.: [838]1
     * Nec si, regnante Tarquinio, nulla erat Romæ scripta lex de stupris,
       idcirco non contra illam legem sempiternam Sextus Tarquinius vim
       Lucretiæ attulit. Erat enim ratio profecta a rerum natura, et ad
       recte faciendum impellens, et a delicto avocans; quæ non tum
       denique incipit lex esse, cum scripta est, sed tum cum orta esset;
       orta autem simul est cum mente divina.: [839]1
     * Nemini dubium esse debet, quin avidius ferrentur homines natura,
       sua si metus abesset, ad dominationem quà m ad societatem.: [840]1
     * Nemo unquam vir magnus sine divino afflatu fuit.: [841]1
     * Neque aliud est quidquam cur incredibilis his animorum videatur
       æternitas, nisi quod nequeunt qualis sit animus vacans corpore
       intelligere, et cogitatione comprehendere.: [842]1
     * Neque enim an honorificè de Deo sentiendum sit neque an sit
       amandus, timendus, colendus, dubitari potest. Sunt enim hæc
       religionum per omnes gentes communia.: [843]1
     * Neque enim an honorifice de Deo sentiendum sit, neque an sit
       amandus, timendus, colendus, dubitari potest. Sunt enim hæc
       religionum, per omnes gentes communia.----Deum eo ipso, quod
       homines fecerit rationales, hoc illis præcepisse, et cordibus
       omnium insculpsisse, ne quisquam cuiquam faceret, quod alium sibi
       facere iniquum duceret.: [844]1
     * Nescio quomodo, dum lego, assentior, cum posui librum, et mecum
       ipse de immortalitate animorum cæpi cogitare, assensio omnis illa
       elabitur.: [845]1
     * Nihil est de quo minus dubitare possit, quam et honesta expetenda
       per se, et, eodem modo, turpia per se esse fugienda.: [846]1
     * Nihil est unum uni tam simile, tam par, quam omnes inter
       nosmetipsos sumus. Quod nisi depravatio, &c. sui nemo ipse tam
       similis esset, quam omnes sunt omnium.: [847]1
     * Nihil est unum uni tam simile, tam par, quam omnes inter
       nosmetipsos sumus. Quod, si depravatio consuetudinum, si opinionum
       vanitas, non imbecillitatem animorum torqueret, et flecteret
       quocunque cæpisset; sui nemo ipse tam similis esset, quam omnes
       sunt omnium;--et coleretur jus æque ab omnibus.: [848]1
     * Nisi enim Deus is, cujus hoc templum est omne quod conspicis, istis
       te corporis custodiis liberaverit; hue tibi aditus patere non
       potest.----Quare et tibi et piis omnibus retinendus est animus in
       custodia corporis; nec injussu ejus, a quo ille est nobis datus, ex
       hominum vita migrandum est; munus humanum assignatum a Deo
       defugisse videamini.: [849]1
     * Non enim mihi est vita mea utilior, quam animi talis affectio,
       neminem ut violem commodi mei gratia.: [850]1
     * Non enim temerè , nec fortuito sati et creati sumns; sed profecto
       fuit quædam vis, quæ generi consuleret humano; nec id gigneret aut
       aleret, quod cum exantlavisset omnes labores, tum incideret in
       mortis malum sempiternum.: [851]1
     * Non enim virtus ipsa est summum bonum, sed effectrix et mater est
       summi boni, quoniam perveniri ad illud sine virtute non potest.:
       [852]1
     * Non purior ratio est, ex duobus incertis et in ambigua expectatione
       pendentibus, id potius credere, quod aliquas spes ferat, quam quod
       nullas? In illo enim periculi nihil est, si, quod dicitur imminere,
       cassum fiat et vacuum; in hoc, damnum est maximum (id est, salutis
       amissio,) si, cum tempus advenerit, aperiatur hoc fuisse
       mendacium.: [853]1
     * Nos e contrario, fontem indicavimus, e quo demonstrari potest,
       justitiam universalem, omnemque adeo virtutem moralem, quæ in
       rectore requiritur, in Deo præ cæteris refulgere, eadem planè
       methodo, qua homines ad eas excolendas obligari ostendemus.: [854]1
     * Nullas unquam rationes circa res naturales a fine: [855]1
     * Nullo alio modo, neque ordine, &c.: [856]1
     * Nunc parvulos nobis dedit igniculos, quos celeriter malis moribus
       opinionibusque depravatis sic restinguimus, ut nusquam naturæ lumen
       appareat.----Simul atque editi in lucem et suscepti sumus, in omni
       continuo pravitate, et in summa opinionum perversitate, versamur;
       ut pene cum lacte nutricis, errorem suxisse videamur. Cum vero
       parentibus redditi, deinde magistris traditi sumus; tum ita variis
       imbuimur erroribus, ut vanitati veritas, et opinioni confirmatæ
       natura ipsa cedat.----Cum vero accedit eodem, quasi maximus quidem
       magister, populus, atque omnis undique ad vitia consentiens
       multitudo, tum plane inficimur opinionum pravitate, a naturaque
       ipsa desciscimus.: [857]1
     * O præclarum diem, quum in illud animorum concilium cætumque
       proficiscar, et quum ex hac turba et colluvione discedam!: [858]1
     * Oculorum est in nobis sensus acerrimus, quibus sapientiam non
       cernimus; quà m illa ardentes amores excitaret sui, si videretur!:
       [859]1
     * Oculos ad videndum, dentes ad masticandum, herbas et animantia ad
       alimentum, solem ad illuminandum, mare ad alendum pisces, &c.:
       [860]1
     * Omnes inter se naturali quadam indulgentia et benevolentia
       contineri.: [861]1
     * Omnes qui naturam divinam aliquo modo contemplati sunt, Deum esse
       corporeum negant: [862]1
     * Omnia ex necessitate naturæ divinæ determinata sunt, non tantum ad
       existendum, sed etiam ad certo modo existendum et operandum;
       nullumque datur contingens.: [863]1
     * Omnis substantia est necessaria infinita.: [864]1
     * Omnium adversus omnes, perpetuæ suspiciones,----Bellum omnium in
       omnes.: [865]1
     * Opinio eorum qui docent, peccare subditos, quoties mandata
       principum suorum, quæ sibi injusta videntur esse, exsequuntur; et
       erronea est, et inter eas numeranda, quæ obedientiæ civili
       adversantur.: [866]1
     * Opinionum commenta delet dies, naturæ judicia confirmat.: [867]1
     * Optimi quique permulta ob eam unam causam faciunt, quia decet quia
       rectum, quia honestum est etsi nullum consecuturum emolumentum
       vident.: [868]1
     * Ordo partium spatii est immutabilis; moveantur hæ de locis suis, et
       movebuntur (ut ita dicam) de seipsis.: [869]1
     * Pacti violatio: [870]1
     * Pari sane ratione (ac in arithmeticis operationibus) doctrinæ
       moralis veritas fundatur in immutabili cohærentia inter felicitatem
       summam quam hominum vires assequi valent, et actus benevolentiæ
       universalis.: [871]1
     * Pari sane ratione [ac in arithmeticis operationibus] doctrinæ
       moralis veritas fundatur in immutabili cohærentia inter felicitatem
       summam quam hominum vires assequi valent, et actus benevolentiæ
       universalis.: [872]1
     * Pater futuri seculi: [873]1
     * Per corpus intelligimus quamcunque quantitatem longam, latam, et
       profundam, certa aliqua figura terminatum; quo nihil absurdius de
       Deo, ente scilicet absolute infinito, dici potest.: [874]1
     * Per substantiam intelligo id quod in se est et per se concipitur;
       hoc est, id cujus conceptus non indiget conceptu alterius rei a quo
       formari debeat.: [875]1
     * Percrebuerat Oriente toto vetus et constans opinio esse in fatis,
       ut Judæa profectirerum potirentur.: [876]1
     * Percrebuerat Oriente toto vetus et constans opinio, esse in fatis,
       ut Judæâ profecti rerum potirentur.: [877]1
     * Phantasma est sentiendi actus.: [878]1
     * Placet suapte natura, adeoque gratiosa virtus est, ut insitum etiam
       sit malis probare meliores.: [879]1
     * Planetarum densitates fere sunt, ut radices diametrorum apparentium
       applicatæ ad diametros veros, hoc est, reciproce ut distantiæ
       planetarum a sole, ductæ in radices diametrorum apparentium.
       Collocavit igitur Deus planetas in diversis distantiis a sole, ut
       quilibet, pro gradu densitatis, calore solis majore vel minore
       fruatur.: [880]1
     * Platonis documenta quamvis ad rem multum conferant, tamen parum
       habent firmitatis ad probandam et implendam veritatem.: [881]1
     * Pluribus persuasio inerat, antiquis sacerdotum libris contineri, eo
       ipso tempore fore, ut valesceret Oriens, profectique Judæâ rerum
       potirentur.: [882]1
     * Pluribus persuasio inerat, antiquis sacerdotum libris contineri, eo
       ipso tempore fore, ut valesceret Oriens, profectique Judæa rerum
       potirentur.: [883]1
     * Porro ipsa virtus, cum sibi bonorum culmen vendicet humanorum, quid
       hie agit nisi perpetua bella cum vitiis; nec exterioribus, sed
       interioribus; nec alienis, sed plane nostris et propriis?----Absit
       ergo, ut quamdiu in hoc bello intestino sumus, jam nos
       beatitudinem, ad quam vincendo volumus pervenire, adeptos esse
       credamus.: [884]1
     * Præclarum nescio quid adepti sunt, qui didicerunt se, cum tempus
       mortis venisset, totos esse perituros.----Quid habet ista res aut
       lætabile aut gloriosum?: [885]1
     * Præter Deum nulla dari neque concipi potest substantia.: [886]1
       [887]2
     * Præter Deum nulla dari, neque concipi potest substantia.: [888]1
     * Præter Deum nulla dari, neque concipi potest substantia. : [889]1
     * Præterea nihil apud eos certi est, nihil quod à scientia
       veniat;----et nemo paret, quia nemo vult ad incertum laborare.:
       [890]1
     * Prima et fundamentalis lex nuturæ est, quærendam esse pacem, ubi
       haberi potest, &c.: [891]1
     * Profecto eos ipsos, qui se aliquid certi habere arbitrantur,
       addubitare coget doctissimorum hominum de maxima re tanta
       dissensio.: [892]1
     * Profecto omnis istorum disputatio, quanquam uberrimos fontes
       virtutis et scientiæ contineat, tamen collata cum horum [qui
       rempublicam gubernant] actis perfectisque rebus, vereor ne non
       tantum videatur attulisse negotiis hominum utilitatis, quantum
       oblectationem quandam otii.: [893]1
     * Puto implicare contradictionem ut mundus sit finitus.: [894]1
     * Puto implicare contradictionem, ut mundus [meaning the material
       world] sit finitus.: [895]1
     * Puto implicare contradictionem, ut mundus sit finitus: [896]1
     * Quæ qualitates omnes nominari solent sensibiles, et sunt in ipso
       objecto nihil aliud præter materiæ motum, quo objectum in organa
       sensuum diversimode operatur. Neque in nobis aliud sunt, quam
       diversi motus. Motus enim nihil generat præter motum.: [897]1
     * Quæ si oculis cerneretur, mirabiles amores, ut ait Plato, excitaret
       sui.: [898]1
     * Quæ si tanta potentia est stultorum sententiis atque jussis, ut
       eorum suffragiis rerum natura vertatur cur non sanciunt, ut quæ
       mala perniciosaque sunt, habeantur pro bonis ac salutaribus?:
       [899]1
     * Quæ vis non modo senior est quam ætas populorum et civitatum, sed
       æqualis illius coelum atque terras tuentis et regentis Dei. Neque
       enim esse mens divina sine ratione potest, nec ratio divina non
       hanc vim in rectis pravisque sanciendis habere.: [900]1
     * Quæro an a Deo fieri potuisset ut mundus esset finitus?: [901]1
     * Quæro si duo sint, quorum alter optimus vir, æquissimus, summa
       justitia, singulari fide, alter insigni scelere et audacia; et si
       in eo sit errore civitas, ut bonum illum virum, sceleratum,
       facinorosum, nefarium putet; contra autem qui sit improbissimus,
       existimet esse summa probitate ac fide; proque hac opinione omnium
       civium, bonus ille vir vexetur, rapiatur, manus ei denique
       auferantur, effodiantur oculi, damnetur, vinciatur, uratur,
       exterminetur, egeat; postremò jure etiam optimo omnibus miserrimus
       esse videatur: Contra autem, ille improbus laudetur, colatur, ab
       omnibus diligatur, omnes ad eum honores, omnia imperia, omnes opes,
       omnes denique copiæ conferantur, vir denique optimus omnium
       æstimatione, et dignissimus omni fortuna judicetur; Quis tandem
       erit tam demens qui dubitet utrum se esse malit?: [902]1
     * Quam summam, quia philosophi non comprehenderunt, nec veritatem
       comprehendere potuerunt, quamvis ea ferè , quibus summa ipsa
       constat, et viderint et explicaverint. Sed diversi ac diversè illa
       omnia protulerunt, non annectentes nec causas rerum, nec
       consequentias, nec rationes; ut summam illam, quæ continet
       universa, et compingerent et complerent.: [903]1
     * Quasi ego id curem, quid ille aiat aut neget: Illud quæro, quid et
       consentaneum sit dicere, qui, &c.: [904]1
     * Quasi vero intelligant qualis sit in ipso corpore.--Mihi quidem
       naturam animi intuenti, multo difficilior occurrit cogitatio,
       multoque obscurior, qualis animus in corpore sit, quam qualis cum
       exierit.: [905]1
     * Quem vero astrorum ordines, quem dierum noctiumque vicissitudines,
       quem mensium temperatio, quemque ea quæ gignuntur nobis ad
       fruendum, non gratum esse cogant; hnnc hominem omnino numerare qui
       decet?: [906]1
     * Qui autem a Deo quidem factum fatentur, non tamen eum volunt
       temporis habere, sed suæ creationis initium; ut, modo quodam vix
       intelligibili, semper sit factus. : [907]1
     * Qui autem civium rationem dicunt habendam, externorum negant;
       dirimunt hi communem generis humani societatem; qua sublata,
       justitia funditus tollitur.: [908]1
     * Quicquid concipimus in Dei potestate esse, id necessario est.:
       [909]1
     * Quicunque unquam effectus productus sit, productus est a causa
       necessaria. Nam quod productum est, causam habuit integram, hoc
       est, omnia ea quibus suppositis effectum non sequi intelligi non
       possit: ea vera causa necessaria est.: [910]1
     * Quid dicitis, O nescii, etiam fletu et miseratione dignissimi? ita
       non tam extimescitis, ne sorte hæc vera sint, quæ sunt despectui
       vobis et præbent materiam risus? nec saltem vobiscum sub obscuris
       cogitationibus volvitis, ne, quod hoc die credere obstinata
       renuitis perversitate, redarguat serum tempus, et irrevocabilis
       pnitentia castiget?: [911]1
     * Quid ergo? nihilne illi [philosophi] simile præcipiunt? Imo
       permulta, et ad verum frequenter accedunt. Sed nihil ponderis
       habent illa præcepta, quia sunt humana, et auctoritate majori, id
       est, divina illa carent. Nemo igitur credit, quia tam se hominem
       putat esse qui audit, quam est ille qui præcipit.: [912]1
     * Quid multa? Sic mihi persuasi, sec sentio; quum tanta celeritas
       animorum sit, tanta memoria præteritorum, futurorum providentia,
       tot artes, tantæ scientiæ, tot inventa; non posse eam naturam, quæ
       res eas contineat, esse mortalem.: [913]1
     * Quidam ad magnificas voces excitantur, et transeunt in affectum
       dicentium, alacres vultu et animo. Rapit illos instigatque rerum
       pulchritudo.----Juvat protinus quæ audias, facere. Afficiuntur
       illi, et sunt quales jubentur, si illa animo forma permaneat, si
       non impetum insignem protinus populus honesti dissuasor excipiat.
       Pauci illam quam conceperant mentem, domum perferre potuerunt.:
       [914]1
     * Quis Pullum Numitorem, Fregellanum Proditorem, quanquam reipublicæ
       nostræ profuit, non odit?: [915]1
     * Quis est enim, aut quis unquam fuit, aut avaritia tam ardente aut
       tam effrænatis cupiditatibus, ut eandem illam rem, quam adspici
       scelere quovis velit, non multis partibus malit ad sese, etiam omni
       impunitate proposita, sine facinore, quam illo modo pervenire?:
       [916]1
     * Quo confesso, confitendum est eorum consilio mundum administrari.:
       [917]1
     * Quod actio justa vel injusta sit, a jure imperantis provenit. Reges
       legitimi quæ imperant, justa faciunt imperando; quæ vetant, vetando
       faciunt injusta.: [918]1
     * Quod autem corpus animæ per se? quæ materia? ubi cogitatio illi?
       quomodo visus? auditus? aut qui tangit? qui usus ejus? aut quod
       sine his bonum?: [919]1
     * Quod et præterita teneat, et futura provideat, et complecti possit
       præsentia; hæc divina sunt. Nec invenietur unquam, unde ad hominem
       venire possint, nisi a Deo.: [920]1
     * Quod præter Deos negat scire quenquam, scit ipse, utrum melius sit,
       nam dixit antè . Sed suum illud, nihil ut affirmet, tenet ad
       extremum.: [921]1
     * Quod si extitisset aliquis qui veritatem sparsam per singulos, per
       sectasque diffusam, colligeret in unum, ac redigeret in corpus, is
       profecto non dissentiret à nobis. Sed hoc nemo facere, nisi veri
       peritus ac sciens, potest. Verù m autem non nisi ejus scire est,
       qui sit doctus a Deo.: [922]1
     * Quod si extitisset aliquis, qui veritatem sparsam per singulos per
       sectasque diffusam, colligeret in unum ac redigeret in corpus, is
       profecto non dissentiret a nobis. Sed hoc nemo facere, nisi veri
       peritus ac sciens, potest. Verum autem non nisi ejus scire est, qui
       sit doctus a Deo.: [923]1
     * Quod si in hoc error, quod animos hominum immortales esse credam,
       libenter erro; nec mihi hunc errorem, quo delector, dum vivo,
       extorqueri volo.: [924]1
     * Quod si jus regnandi habeat Deus ab omnipotentia sua, manifestum
       est obligationem ad præstandum ipsi obedientiam, incumbere
       hominibus propter imbecillitatem.: [925]1
     * Quod si populorum jussis, si principum decretis, si sententiis
       judicum, jura constituerentur; jus esset latrocinari, jus
       adulterare, jus testamenta falsa supponere, si hæc suffragiis aut
       scitis multitudinis probarentur. Quæ si tanta potentia est
       stultorum sententiis atque jussis, ut eorum suffragiis rerum natura
       vertatur; cur non sanciunt ut quæ mala perniciosaque sunt,
       habeantur pro bonis ac salutaribus, aut cur, cum jus ex injuriâ lex
       facere possit, bonum eadem facere; non possit ex malo?: [926]1
     * Quod verè dicimus, etiamsi a nullo laudetur, laudabile esse
       natura.: [927]1
     * Quum autem dicit Porphyrius, in primo de Regressu Animæ libro,
       nondum receptum in unam quandam sectam quæ universalem viam animæ
       contineat liberandæ, nondumque in suam notitiam eandem viam
       historiali cognitione perlatum, procul dubio confitetur, esse
       aliquam, sed nondum in suam venisse notitiam. Ita ei non sufficebat
       quicquid de anima liberanda studiosissime didicerat, sibique, vel
       potius aliis, nosse ac tenere videbatur. Sentiebat enim adhuc sibi
       deesse aliquam præstantissimam auctoritatem, quam de re tanta sequi
       oporteret.: [928]1
     * Rector seu causa prima rationalis, cujus voluntate res ita
       disponuntur, ut hommibus satis evidenter indicetur, actus quosdam
       illorum esse media necessaria ad finem ipsis necessarium; vult
       homines ad hos actus obligari, vel hos actus imperat.: [929]1
     * Regni divini naturalis jus derivatur ab eo, quod divinæ potentiæ
       resistere impossibile est.: [930]1
     * Regulas boni et mali, justi et injusti, honesti et inhonesti, esse
       leges civiles; ideoque quod legislator præceperit, id pro bono,
       quod vetuerit, id pro malo habendum esse.: [931]1
     * Res nullo alio modo neque alio ordine a Deo produci potuerunt quam
       productæ sunt.: [932]1
     * Res nullo alio modo, neque alio ordine, a Deo produci potuerant
       quam productæ sunt.: [933]1
     * Res nullo alio modo, neque alio ordine, a Deo produci potuerunt
       quam productæ sunt.: [934]1
     * Res nullo alio modo, neque alio ordine, a Deo produci potuerunt,
       quam productæ sunt.: [935]1
     * Res, nullo alio modo, neque alio ordine, a Deo produci potuerunt
       quam productæ sunt.: [936]1 [937]2
     * Satis enim nobis, (si modo aliquid in philosophia profecimus,)
       persuasum esse debet, si omnes Deos hominesque celare possimus,
       nihil tamen avare, nihil injuste, nihil libidinose, nihil
       incontinenter esse faciendum.: [938]1
     * Scio fuisse philosophos quosdam, eosdemque viros doctos, qui
       corpora omnia sensu prædita esse sustinuerunt. Nec video, si natura
       sensionis in reactione sola collocaretur, quomodo refutari possint.
       Sed etsi, ex reactione etiam corporum aliorum, phantasma aliquod
       nasceretur, illud tamen, remoto objecto, statim cessaret. Nam nisi
       ad retinendum motum impressum, etiam remoto objecto, apta habeant
       organa, ut habent animalia; ita tantum sentient, ut nunquam
       sensisse se recordentur.--Sensioni ergo, quæ vulgo ita appellatur,
       necessario adhæret memoria aliqua, &c.: [939]1
     * Scio fuisse philosophos quosdam, eosdemque viros doctos, qui
       corpora omnia sensu prædita esse sustinuerunt; nec video, si natura

       sensisse se recordentur.--Sensioni ergo, quæ vulgo ita appellatur
       necessario adhæret memoria aliqua, &c.: [940]1
     * Securitatis viam meliorem habet nemo anticipatione.: [941]1
     * Sed hæc eadem num censes apud eos ipsos valere, nisi admodum
       paucos, a quibus inventa, disputata, conscripta sunt? Quotus enim
       quisque philosophorum invenitur, qui sit ita moratus, ita animo ac
       vita constitutus, ut ratio postulat; qui disciplinam suam non
       ostentationem scientiæ, sed legem vitæ putet, qui obtemperet ipse
       sibi, et decretis suis pareat? videre licet multos, libidinum
       servos, &c.: [942]1
     * Sed me nemo de immortalitate depellet.: [943]1
     * Sed mundum quidem fuisse semper, philosophia auctor est; conditore
       quidem Deo, sed non ex tempore. : [944]1
     * Sed perturbat nos opinionum varietas, hominumque dissensio. Et qua
       non idem contingit in sensibus, hos natura certos, putamus; illa,
       quæ aliis sic, aliis secus, nec iisdem semper uno modo videntur,
       ficta esse dicimus. Quod est longe aliter.: [945]1
     * Sed si vel causa id efficeret, certissime philosopharentur, et
       quamvis non posset divinis testimoniis illa defendere, tamen
       seipsam veritas illustraret suo lumine.: [946]1
     * Sequitur ergo, legibus illis, non occides, non mæchabere, non
       furabere, parentes honorabis; nihil aliud præcepisse Christum, quam
       ut cives et subditi suis principibus et summis imperatoribus in
       quæstionibus omnibus circa meum, tuum, suum, alienum, absolute
       obedirent.: [947]1
     * Sequitur, soum Deum esse causam liberam.: [948]1
     * Si cui durum hoc videbitur, illum rogo ut tacita cogitatione
       considerate velit, si essent duo omnipotentes, uter utri obedire
       obligaretur. Confitebitur, credo, neutrum neutri obligari. Hoc si
       verum est, verum quoque est quod posui, homines ideo Deo subjectos
       esse, quia omnipotentes non sunt.: [949]1
     * Si ergo generatus [est mundus;] ad id effectus est, quod ratione
       sapientiaque comprehenditur, atque immutabili æternitate
       continetur. Ex quo efficitur, ut sit necesse hunc quem cernimus
       mundum, simulacrum æternum esse alicujus æterni. : [950]1
     * Si immortalis natura animi est, Et sentire potest secreta a corpore
       nostro; Quinque (ut opinor) eam faciundum est sensibus auctam: --At
       neque seorsum oculi, &c. : [951]1
     * Si impossibile sit singulis, omnes et omnia sibimet subjicere;
       ratio quæ hunc finem proponit singulis, qui uni tantum contingere
       potest, sæpius quam millies proponeret impossibile, et semel tantum
       possible.: [952]1
     * Si is qui summum habet imperium, seipsum, imperantem dico,
       interficere alicui imperet, non tenetur. Neque parentem, &c. cù m
       filius mori quam vivere infamis atque exosus malit. Et alii casus
       sunt, cum mandata facta inhonesta sunt, &c.: [953]1
     * Si nemo sciturus, nemo ne suspicaturus quidem sit, quum aliquid
       divitiarum, potentiæ, dominationis, libidinis causa feceris; si id
       Diis hominibusque futurum sit semper ignotum, sisne facturus?:
       [954]1
     * Si nihil existimat contra naturam fieri, hominibus violandis; quid
       cum eo disseras, qui omnino hominem ex homine tollat?: [955]1
     * Si quæratur an obediendum civitati sit, si imperetur Deum colere
       sub imagine, coram iis quid id fieri honorificum esse putant, certè
       faciendum est.: [956]1
     * Si res alterius naturæ potuissent esse, vel alio modo ad operandum
       determinari, ut naturæ ordo alius esset: ergo Dei etiam natura alia
       posset esse quam jam est.: [957]1
     * Si res alterius naturæ potuissent esse, vel alio modo ad operandum
       determinari; ut naturæ ordo alius esset: Ergo Dei etiam natura alia
       posset esse quam jam est.: [958]1
     * Si sine causa gignimur, si in hominibus procreandis providentia
       nulla versatur, si casu nobismetipsis ac voluptatis nostræ gratia
       nascimur; si nihil post mortem sumus; quid potest esse tam
       supervacuum, tam inane, tam vanum, quam humana res est, quam mundus
       ipse?: [959]1
     * Si tales nos natura genuisset, ut eam ipsam intueri et perspicere,
       eâ que optimâ duce cursum vitæ conficere possemus; haud esset sanè
       quod quisquam rationem et doctrinam requireret. Nunc vero, &c.:
       [960]1
     * Si tamen lex civilis jubeat invadere aliquid, non est illud furtum,
       adulterium, &c.: [961]1
     * Sin mortuus, ut quidam minuti philosophi censent, nihil sentiam,
       non vereor ne hunc errorem meum mortui philosophi irrideant.:
       [962]1
     * Sint licet perhonesti;--sed audire deposcimus quot sint aut fuerint
       numero.----Unus, duo, tres.----At genus humanum non ex bonis
       pauculis, sed ex cæteris omnibus æstimari convenit.: [963]1
     * Solebam ipse quidem, cum aliis plurimis antequam dominii jurisque
       omnis originem universaliter et distincte considerassem; dominium
       Dei, in creationem velut integram ejus originem, resolvere. Verum
       quoniam, &c.----in hanc tandem concessi sententiam, dominium Dei
       esse jus vel potestatem ei a sua sapientia et bonitate, velut a
       lege, datam ad regimen eorum omnium quæ ab ipso unquam creata
       fuerint vel creabuntur.----Nec poterit quisquam merito conqueri,
       dominium Dei intra nimis angustos limites hac explicatione
       coerceri; qua hoc unum dicitur, illius nullam partem consistere in
       potestate quicquam faciendi contra finem optimum, bonum commune.:
       [964]1
     * Spes unicuique securitatis conservationisque suæ in eo sita est, ut
       viribus artibusque propriis proximum suum, vel palam vel ex
       insidiis, præoccupare possit.: [965]1
     * Substantiam corpoream quæ non nisi infinita concipi potest, nulla
       ratione natura divina indignam esse dici potest.: [966]1
     * Tiberio imperitante, per procuratorem Pontium Pilatum, supplicio
       affectus erat.: [967]1
     * Totam igitur veritatem, et omne divinæ religionis arcanum
       philosophi attigerunt. Sed aliis refellentibus, defendere id, quod
       invenerant, nequiverunt; quia singulis ratio non quadravit; nec ea
       quæ vera senserant, in summam redigere potuerunt.: [968]1
     * Tui ergo te, Cicero, libri arguunt, quam nihil a philosophia disci
       possit ad vitam. Hæc tua verba sunt, mihi autem non modo ad
       sapientiam cæci videmur, sed ad ea ipsa, quæ aliqua ex parte cerni
       videantur, hebetes et obtusi.: [969]1
     * Tum illud effici, quod quibusdam incredibile videatur, sit autem
       necessarium, ut nihil sese plus quam alterum diligat.: [970]1
     * Una substantia non potest produci ab alia: [971]1
     * Una substantia non potest produci ab alia substantia: [972]1
     * Una substantia non potest produci ab alia substantia.: [973]1
       [974]2
     * Unaquæque volitio non potest existere, neque ad operandum
       determinari, nisi ab alia causa determinetur, et hæc rursus ab
       alia, et sic porro in infinitum.: [975]1
     * Unaquæque volitio non potest existere, neque ad operandum
       determinari; nisi ab alia causa determinetur, et hæc rursus ab
       alia; et sic porro in infinitum.: [976]1
     * Unicuique licebat facere quæcunque libebat.: [977]1
     * Universaliter autem verum est, quod non certius, fluxus puncti
       lineam producit aut additio numerorum summam, quam quod
       benevolentia effectum præstat bonum.: [978]1
     * Universaliter et in omnibus obedire obligamur.: [979]1
     * Ut enim omittam vim et naturam Deorum, ne homines quidem censetis,
       nisi imbecilli essent, futuros beneficos et benignos fuisse.:
       [980]1
     * Ut naturæ lumen nusquam appareat.: [981]1
     * Ut partium temporis ordo est immutabilis, sic etiam ordo partium
       spatii. Moveantur hæ de locis suis, et movebuntur (ut ita dicam) de
       seipsis.: [982]1
     * Utinam tam facilè vera invenire possem, quam falsa convincere.:
       [983]1
     * Vetat enim dominans ille in nobis Deus, injussu hinc nos suo
       demigrare. Cum verò causam justam Deus ipse dederit, ne ille medius
       fidius vir sapiens, lætus ex his tenebris in lucem illam
       excesserit; nec tamen illa vincula carceris ruperit; leges enim
       vetant; sed tanquam a magistratu, aut ab aliqua potestate legitima,
       sic a Deo evocatus, atque emissus, exirit.: [984]1
     * Video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor.: [985]1
     * Virtutis et vitiorum, sine ulla divina ratione, grave ipsius
       conscientiæ pondus est.: [986]1
     * Vitia de mercede sollicitant; avaritia pecuniam promittit: luxuria
       multas ac varias voluptates; ambitio purpuram et plausum; et ex hoc
       potentiam, et quicquid potentia ponit.: [987]1
     * Voluntas ad Dei naturam non magis pertinet quam reliqua naturalia;
       sed ad ipsam eodem modum sese habet, ut motus et quies.: [988]1
