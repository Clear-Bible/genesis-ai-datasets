INTRODUCTION

   Yet another series of hymns from the Greek Office Books. Some of them
   are translations or renderings, more are centos, but most are
   suggestions, or based upon the Greek. To quote from the author's
   preface to his third series:--"In process of reading, thoughts linked
   themselves to the memory, and echoes of music--much of it surpassingly
   sweet--lingered, and from those echoes and thoughts the centos and
   suggestions have been formed. The phrases containing the thoughts, and
   the echoes repeating the music, have been woven together to form the
   fabric which is shown here." And again, from the [1]Introduction to his
   fourth series:--"The Greek has been used as a basis, a theme, a motive;
   oriental colour, and, it is to be hoped, some of the oriental warmth,
   has been preserved. Now and again an oriental figure is retained, and
   to those who have any knowledge of the worship of the Eastern Church,
   it must be obvious that the peculiar themes of her praise are in
   abundant evidence." These extracts accurately describe the contents of
   the greater part of this volume.

   It is in their suggestiveness that the chief attraction of Greek hymns
   lies. By the ordinary process of translation a hymn is reproduced in
   its excessive symbolism and multiplicity of metaphor, and the result in
   our matter-of-fact language is incongruity. The harmony which it
   presents in the original language and setting, and the combined effect
   of symbol and metaphor, are in most cases lost, and discord is the
   result. It is by capturing the subtle suggestion of the original, and
   utilising it to the best advantage, that the value of the Greek hymn is
   made appreciable. That this is the general conviction is evidenced by
   the fact that none of Dr. Neale's work is so popular, and rightly so,
   as the hymns, "[2]Art thou weary, art thou languid?" and "[3]O happy
   band of pilgrims," and neither of these hymns is a translation: both
   are merely suggestions from the Greek.

   In no hymns is this suggestiveness more felt than in those for the
   morning and evening, which are found in many of the Offices. The Greek
   hymn writers took time to watch the sun rise and set. The glow of early
   dawn spreading and brightening; the clouds fringed with purple and
   gold; the glowing shafts chasing the retreating darkness--this morning
   vision awakened in them thoughts which have inspired meditative minds
   in all ages, but which it is enriching to have expressed in the
   peculiarly suggestive manner of the Greek Christian poet. As with the
   sunrise, so with the sunset. The morning and evening give buoyancy and
   restfulness to Greek hymnody, and clothe the work of its choicest
   singers with a brightness and varying beauty which are the abiding
   characteristics of those seasons.

   But if one would realise in the greatest possible degree the wealth of
   Greek praise, he must acquaint himself with the Offices for Passiontide
   and Easter, as they are contained in the Triodion and Pentecostarion.
   There the Christ, in all the humiliation of His manhood, bearing the
   burden of fallen humanity to the Cross, is presented to us in a guise,
   if not attractive, certainly fascinating and pregnant in suggestion;
   while the Resurrection victory is proclaimed in Easter song in tones
   the gladdest, sweetest, and most triumphant in the whole range of Greek
   hymnody; for it is in Easter song that the Greek Church excels.

   By its objectiveness, the Greek hymn enables us to do for ourselves
   what our less wholesome subjective hymns aim at doing for us, and not
   always successfully. It presents the picture, and if the worshipper be
   not hopelessly blind, he sees it, and the impression is made upon the
   mind and heart, with the desired result in varying degrees. It is this
   that makes the Greek hymn so suggestive. Hence it is that the hymn
   which is the result of a reminiscence of the Greek is usually
   subjective. We are under no temptation to reproduce the writer's words
   and figures. The outline fades, but the impression remains and
   possesses the mind, and it is that that is given. So there is
   inspiration in Greek hymnody for every mind capable of inspiration.

   What we cannot understand is that this treasure-house of song, and of
   inspiration to singing, should be so persistently ignored, and should
   still attract so few capable workers. Practically it remains almost
   unexplored, notwithstanding that enough has been brought to light to
   awake desire for more. Had we treated the hymnody of the Latin Church,
   and the Church of the Reformation in Germany, after this fashion, our
   praise would have suffered incalculably. But we have made the praise of
   those Churches our own, by the work of a band of devoted translators,
   while practically ignoring that of the Church of the Apostles. The
   present writer, in his [4]Introduction to The Hymns of the Holy Eastern
   Church, has suggested a few possible causes of this state of matters,
   but none of them is sufficient, nor all of them combined. When once we
   overcome our indifference to a great past to which we owe so much, and
   disabuse our minds of an uncatholic localism, an interest in the Church
   of the East and her worship will possess us--but not till then. We want
   hymn writers of the first rank, who have the necessary knowledge of the
   language, to venture into the unexplored region, to cull its choicest
   flowers, and bring them back to adorn the temple of the Living God;
   and, fired with the inspiration which a sojourn there must give, to
   send forth in new dress and fresh attractiveness the glorious truths
   which are the possession of the Church of God in all ages, but which
   our modern hymnody is in danger of reiterating with stale monotony.

   From the Table which the author has been at the trouble to prepare, it
   will be seen that there are only forty-one hymns from the Greek in
   common use. The blame for such a deplorable condition of things lies at
   the door of the Christian Church of our time, which has failed, by its
   hymn writers who had the needful equipment, to make those hymns
   available to a greater extent; and partly at the door of compilers of
   hymnals, who have not sufficiently made use of the material which is
   available.

   What, then, are the available sources when compilers ask for Greek
   hymns for their compilations? The first really masterly contribution to
   our English hymnody from Greek sources was that made by Dr. Neale. With
   his work as a whole in relation to the Greek Church, we have nothing to
   do here. Early attracted to the Greek Office Books, he set himself to
   introduce the hymns with which they are embellished to the notice of
   his fellow-countrymen. So well was his task performed, that in a very
   short time the best of them were appropriated by the Church for her
   praise, and to the present day they hold a secure place in all our best
   hymnals. In 1862, he published [5]Hymns of the Eastern Church, which
   contains about sixty pieces--his complete contribution to English
   hymnody from the Greek, and a very substantial contribution indeed, far
   surpassing anything that has been done until very recently. About the
   same time, or a little later, Dr. Littledale drew the attention of the
   Church to the Greek Offices by his Offices from the Service Books of
   the Holy Eastern Church (1863), and he also prepared a few metrical
   translations of hymns, which may be found in The People's Hymnal
   (1867). Dr. Littledale's renderings--which are, needless to say, very
   true--are in most cases graceful and winning, and do not deserve the
   neglect which they have suffered. Mr. W. Chatterton Dix, a considerable
   name in hymnody, would seem to have been stirred to follow the pioneers
   as closely as possible; for while he made no entirely original
   contribution from the Greek, he worked upon some of Dr. Littledale's
   prose translations, putting them into graceful metrical form. This he
   did to a considerable extent, but the result is, as might be
   anticipated, artificial, and lacking the spirit which a thorough
   acquaintance with the original alone can give. Mr. Dix's work can be
   seen in the Lyra Messianica (1865), where about a dozen of his metrical
   renderings find a place. These, too, have all been allowed to lie
   unused. The Rev. Allen W. Chatfield did good service by rendering much
   of the poetry of the early Greek Christian poets, which had been
   compiled by MM. Christ and Paranikas (Anthologia Graeca Carminum
   Christianorum, 1871). The hymns in that collection are not found in the
   Greek Service Books, with the exception of a few by [6]St. John of
   Damascus; but from the renderings which were made by Mr. Chatfield, and
   published by him in 1876 under the title, [7]Songs and Hymns of the
   Earliest Greek Christian Poets, Bishops, and Others, a few very
   beautiful centos have been formed, notably one beginning "[8]Lord
   Jesus, think on me," which has been included in no fewer than five
   permanent hymnals, as may be seen from the Table. The Rev. Gerald
   Moultrie, who prepared renderings from several languages, contributed a
   few from the Greek, but only a few. The best is his rendering of the
   midnight hymn, "[9]Behold, the Bridegroom cometh in the middle of the
   night." From that time till now, very little attention has been given
   to the Greek Offices, until we come to the Rev. R. M. Moorsom, whose
   intensely catholic instincts led him to use the gift he possessed in
   the service of the praise of the Church, to which he contributed
   twenty-two pieces from eastern sources--[10]Renderings of Church Hymns
   (1901). Two of these have already found a place in the revised edition
   of Church Hymns (1903) and of Hymns Ancient and Modern (1904). In the
   recently published [11]English Hymnal, three new names of translators
   from the Greek are to be found--Rev. T. A. Lacey, Mr. Athelstan Riley,
   and Mr. C. W. Humphreys. Their contributions are few, but we do not
   know to what extent they may yet pursue the work.

   Giving the most generous estimate, there could not, till very recently,
   have been more than 150 hymns from the Greek available for the use of
   compilers of hymnals. To that number, however, are now to be added 108
   translations and 153 centos and suggestions by the present author--261
   pieces in all. That work of this kind is welcomed and readily
   appropriated, is evidenced by the fact that, although his first series
   was published so recently as eight years ago, several of the hymns have
   been included in most of the hymnals compiled or revised since then,
   both in this country and in America.

   The Table will show at a glance to what extent available material has
   been taken advantage of by hymnal compilers. The twelve principal
   hymnals compiled or revised since 1892 have been collated, and the
   Greek hymns contained in each set forth. It will be seen that there are
   only forty-one of these hymns in common use. A gratifying feature is
   that the most recently prepared collections contain the greatest
   number. The Methodist Hymn Book contains four--the smallest number;
   [12]The English Hymnal, twenty-four--the greatest number. The most
   popular hymns of the forty-one are, "[13]Art thou weary?" and "[14]The
   day is past and over," which are included in all the twelve hymnals;
   and "[15]O happy band of pilgrims" and "[16]The day of Resurrection,"
   which appear in eleven and nine of the twelve respectively. A
   noteworthy circumstance, as already stated, is that two of the most
   popular hymns are not renderings in the proper sense, but merely
   suggestions--"Art thou weary?" and "O happy band of pilgrims"--an
   indication of the direction in which successful effort must be made in
   dealing with Greek hymnody by those competent to do so.

   Is it too much to hope for, in the interests of congregational praise,
   that more attention will be given to the contents of the Greek Office
   Books in the future than has been given to them in the past? But
   intending students must have ready access to them. Where are they to be
   found? Unless it is resolved to purchase them, which may be done
   through a bookseller in Athens or Constantinople, search will probably
   be made for them in vain in our libraries. They are to be found in the
   Bodleian Library, and in the library of St. John's College, Oxford, and
   also in the library of Cambridge University; but it is doubtful if the
   library of any other university or theological school in England
   possesses them. We, in Scotland, are even less fortunate. A year ago,
   the writer was unaware of the existence of a set of the Greek Service
   Books, other than his own, in Scotland. Last year, the Library
   Committee of Glasgow University purchased a complete set, and her
   students may now acquaint themselves with the contents as they feel
   inclined. Will Edinburgh, St. Andrews, and Aberdeen follow the example
   of Glasgow? And will our theological schools do the same? And when that
   has been done, will our professors of theology suggest to their
   students that it might be worth their while to dip into their contents?
   In this way, the fact of the existence of these books would be kept
   before the minds of those from whose number interpreters of their hymns
   are most likely to come, and some hope be reasonably entertained of a
   growing acquaintance with them as time passes. Meanwhile, the density
   of ignorance of even well informed men, on the subject of the Greek
   Church generally, is disheartening, while to our ordinary worshippers
   it is little more than a name, if even that.

   The hymns in this, and in former volumes, have been prepared in the
   hope that they may be of service in the public worship of the Three-One
   God, and hymnal compilers who may be attracted to them, and who may
   deem them suitable for their purpose, are at liberty to make use of
   them without the payment of any fee, but on the following simple
   conditions:--(1) Permission must be asked, and a formal acknowledgment
   made in the hymnal when published. This is not always done. In a recent
   case, an historical error was set afoot which may cause future
   hymnologists some trouble to rectify, and which would certainly have
   been obviated had this common courtesy been observed. (2) The text of
   the hymns must not be tampered with in the very slightest particular:
   they must be printed exactly as they appear in the author's collection.
   If compilers wish to omit any verse or verses, permission to do so must
   be asked. (3) The author expects that a copy of the hymnal containing
   his work will be sent to him on publication.

BIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL

   The following Notes have reference only to those Hymn Writers of the
   Greek Church whose work is represented by English versions in the
   Hymnals collated in the foregoing Table, and which are consequently, to
   some extent, in common use. They are only twelve in number, and account
   for thirty of the forty-one hymns. The authorship of the remaining
   eleven is unknown.
     __________________________________________________________________

BIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL

  St. Clement of Alexandria

   Clemens, Titus Flavius (Clemens Alexandrinus), St. Clement of
   Alexandria. This remarkable man was born either at Athens or
   Alexandria, but the exact date of his birth is uncertain. He was a
   philosopher and theologian, and lived in the end of the second and
   beginning of the third century. He was well versed in Greek science,
   and being attracted by the teaching of Christianity, he set himself to
   investigate its truth. Wherever an exponent of the new religion could
   be found, Clement sought him out to learn more from his lips. With this
   end in view, he travelled over Greece, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, and the
   East. Among all his teachers, he expressly mentions Pantaenus, by whom
   he was induced to embrace Christianity. When Pantaenus, who was head of
   the Catechetical School at Alexandria, died, Clement succeeded him as
   its head, and continued to work there as an exponent of Christianity,
   from 190 to 203 (?) He attracted numerous pupils, so great was his fame
   as a teacher, some of whom rose to distinction in later years. Among
   these may be mentioned Origen, and Alexander who ultimately became
   Bishop of Jerusalem. When the persecution under Severus broke out,
   Clement, with others professing the Christian faith, fled. Of his
   subsequent life very little is known.

   A peculiarity of Clement's teaching was that, when he embraced
   Christianity, he did not abandon his eclectic system of philosophy,
   afterwards called Neo-Platonism, and always utilized heathen
   antiquities, when, with their help, he could throw light upon Christian
   doctrine.

   Clement's works are published as part of the [84]Anti-Nicene Christian
   Library (1867). The one we have to do with here is The Instructor, or
   Paedagogus, in which he gives advice and instruction on questions of
   morality. Appended to this work is the poem Stomion polon adaon, which
   was first translated by Dr. H. M. Dexter in 1846, as "[85]Shepherd of
   Tender Youth." The original, which is a dithyrambic ode to the Saviour,
   is a curious production. Here is a literal rendering of the latter part
   of the ode:--"Guide [us] Shepherd of rational sheep; guide unharmed
   children, O Holy King, along the footsteps of Christ; O Heavenly Way,
   Perennial Word, Immeasurable Age, Eternal Light, Fount of Mercy,
   Performer of Virtue; noble [is the] life of those who hymn God, O
   Christ Jesus, heavenly milk of the sweet breasts of the graces of the
   Bride pressed out of Thy wisdom. Babes nourished with tender mouths,
   filled with the dewy wisdom of the rational pap, let us sing together
   simple praises, true hymns to Christ [our] King, holy fee for the
   teaching of life." From this string of epithets several translators
   have, with remarkable ingenuity, woven very attractive versions.

   Clement is interesting to hymnologists as having been the author of
   this earliest extant versified Christian hymn. He died early in the
   third century.

  St. Gregory Nazianzen

   Gregory of Nazianzus, son of Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzus in
   Cappadocia, and life-long friend of Basil, Bishop of Caesarea, was born
   at a village near Nazianzus, 325 A.D. He was early taught the truths of
   Christianity by his mother, and passed into the school of Carterius at
   Caesarea, who subsequently became the head of the monasteries of
   Antioch, and teacher of Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople. He took
   up the priestly office at the earnest request of his father, and for
   some time was helpful to the aged Bishop.

   The times in which Gregory lived were trying times. The orthodox
   Christians clung to the creed of Nicea, and their champions did valiant
   battle with the Arians. As an advocate and exponent of evangelical
   truth, Gregory was summoned to Constantinople in 379, and as Bishop of
   that See, adorned the high office with gifts and graces as brilliant as
   they were rare. But he was not the man for such a prominent position at
   a time so eventful. Hilary, the "Hammer of the Arians," could keep the
   heretics at bay, and accomplish in the Latin Church what Gregory failed
   to do in the Greek Church--maintain his position and his cause against
   all comers. For one thing, the retiring disposition of Gregory made him
   shrink from the din of conflict, and his high ideals weakened his
   hopefulness. The result was that he abandoned the position, and retired
   to Nazianzus in 381. Deprived by death of his life-long friend and
   brother, Caesarius, he retired from the world, and penned those poems,
   some of which are among the treasures of the Church catholic.

   Gregory is better known as a theologian than as a poet, although his
   verses exceed in number thirty thousand. They are found in the second
   volume of the Benedictine Edition of his works, which was published in
   Paris in 1842. A selection can be seen in Daniel's Thesaurus
   Hymnologicus, and in the Anthologia Graeca, Carminum Christianorum.

  Synesius

   Synesius was born about 375 A.D. In many particulars he was an
   outstanding man. His pedigree is said to have extended through
   seventeen centuries, and to have included the names of the most
   illustrious. Not only was he of noble lineage, he was also a man of
   high character and brilliant attainments. He was versed in the
   Neo-Platonic philosophy, and his Christianity has been called in
   question by no less an authority than Mosheim; but how anyone can read
   his [86]odes and doubt the reality of his Christianity, even in the
   fullest sense of the term as including belief in the Divinity of Christ
   and in His Resurrection, is difficult to understand. He certainly was a
   good man, and knew Christ, and loved Him. His writings prove that; and
   in 410, though reluctantly, he became Bishop of Ptolemais. Very little
   of his poetry has come down to us, but that little is of the highest
   order. His hymns are not found in the Greek Offices. He died 430 A.D.

  Justinian I.

   Justinian I. (Flavius Anicius Justinianus), Emperor of the Eastern
   Roman Empire, was born at Tauresium, the modern Kustenje, on the Black
   Sea, 11th May, 483 A.D. He was educated at Constantinople, and
   succeeded his uncle, Justin I., 527. The crowning misfortune of his
   life was his marriage to Theodora, a professional actress, who, along
   with Antonina--wife of his friend and victorious general,
   Belisarius--was responsible for most of the unhappiness of his life.
   His reign was a most eventful one. His victories over the Persians in
   the East, and the Goths and Vandals in Italy, were numerous. At the
   outset of his reign, Justinian was orthodox, but, under the influence
   of Theodora, he gradually veered round to the monophysite error. It was
   at her instigation that he attempted to coerce the monophysites into
   orthodoxy--an attempt which ended in the faction fight of the
   hippodrome, in which thirty thousand were killed.

   Justinian was the founder of that style of architecture called
   Byzantine, the distinctive features of which are the Greek cross and
   the cupola. He adorned Constantinople and other cities of his dominions
   with costly and magnificent churches. In Constantinople alone he built
   twenty-seven--one of these being St. Sophia, which stands to-day a
   monument to his enterprise. The St. Sophia of Julian had been destroyed
   by fire in the insurrection of 532. The re-building occupied six years,
   and gave work to about ten thousand men, who were paid at the close of
   each day. It cost the equivalent of £13,000,000. "I have vanquished
   thee, O Solomon!" was Justinian's pardonable exclamation at its
   completion.

   The crowning glory of Justinian's reign, however, and a lasting
   monument to his genius, was the Corpus Juris Civilis, or body of civil
   law, which he executed. By that great work he gave the Roman law, which
   has formed the groundwork of the civil law of all civilized peoples, a
   definite code.

   Justinian died 565, at the age of eighty-two, having reigned for
   thirty-eight years. He was a man of great business capacity,
   resourceful and energetic. He was, moreover, a man of much learning,
   which he applied to good purpose, but his religious bigotry, and the
   evil influence of Theodora, marred his good qualities.

   The Hymn of Justinian is found in the liturgies of St. Mark and St.
   James, and is generally attributed to him. Whether he himself composed
   it, or whether it bears his name for some other reason, there is no
   means at hand to determine. It is believed to have been his own
   composition. In a literal translation it runs thus:--

   "Only Begotten Son, and Word of God, Immortal Who didst vouchsafe for
   our salvation to take flesh of the Holy Mother of God and ever Virgin
   Mary, and didst without change become man, and wast crucified, Christ
   our God, and by death didst overcome death, being One of the Holy
   Trinity, and glorified together with the Father and the Holy Ghost,
   save us."

   This hymn has been rendered into English verse, "[87]O Word Immortal of
   Eternal God," by T. A. Lacey, and appears in [88]The English Hymnal.

  St. Andrew of Crete

   St. Andrew of Crete was born 660 A.D., in the city of Damascus. For the
   reason that he embraced the monastic life at Jerusalem, he is sometimes
   called St. Andrew of Jerusalem. In his early life he revealed an
   unchristian lack of decision for truth which has not tended to sweeten
   his memory. He was raised to the Archiepiscopate of Crete by the
   usurper Philippicus, called Bardanes, who had been raised to the throne
   by his army--although he was only its general--after the murder of
   Justinian II. As Archiepiscopate, he agreed to act as a deputy at the
   pseudo synod of Constantinople, which met in 712 under the auspices of
   Philippicus, and there condemned the decisions of the former Council,
   of which he had been a member. The Monothelite heresy, which taught
   that our Lord had only one will as He had but one nature, was there
   restored. Andrew, however, abandoned his error in later life. He died
   in the island of Hierissus, in the Aegean Sea, about 730 A.D.

   To what extent his hymns appear in the Service Books it is difficult to
   discover. His authorship of certain of the earlier canons is
   undisputed. He wrote also many Idiomela. His Great Canon, or, as the
   Greeks delight to term it, "The King of Canons," is in use at Mid Lent.
   It is an ambitious composition of about three hundred stanzas, in which
   numerous scriptural examples are used to inspire a spirit of penitence.
   Some of the stanzas are attractive. Dr. Neale, in his [89]Hymns of the
   Eastern Church, gives a few from the beginning of the canon. The
   stichera for Thursday of Holy Week, beginning, "[90]O the Mystery
   passing wonder," are included in The New Office Hymn Book.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Sophronius

   Sophronius was Patriarch of Jerusalem early in the seventh century.
   Specimens of his poetical work can be seen in the third volume of
   Daniel's Thesaurus. A few of his Idiomela are found in the Menaea, and
   also in the Horologion. If we except the hymn rendered by John Keble,
   "Hail, gladdening Light," and which has been attributed to
   him--although Athenogenes of Cappadocia, who suffered martyrdom under
   Diocletian c. A.D. 200, and is said to have sung the hymn while the
   flames encircled him, shares the honour in the Greek Church--none of
   his hymns have been translated into English. That hymn, phos hilaron
   hagias doxes, is quoted by St. Basil in the fourth century, and then as
   of unknown authorship. The likelihood is, therefore, that it is one of
   the earliest Christian hymns, possibly of the second century. It is
   used as a vesper hymn in the Greek Church, and as such finds a place in
   the Service Books. It has been often translated, and in John Keble's
   version is one of the best known hymns from the Greek Offices.
     __________________________________________________________________

  St. Anatolius

   Very little is known of Anatolius. Dr. Neale gives the date of his
   death as 458 A.D. In this he is mistaken, and would seem to be
   identifying him with a patriarch of that name who succeeded Flavius in
   449. From the fact that a letter from him exists addressed to
   [91]Joseph of the Studium (eighth century), and also that he celebrates
   the martyrs who suffered in the sixth and seventh centuries, his date
   cannot be earlier than the beginning of the eighth century.

   His hymns, which number about one hundred, are found in the Menaea and
   Octoechus. Several of them were rendered by Dr. Neale, and are included
   in [92]Hymns of the Eastern Church; and a few by Dr. Littledale can be
   seen in his Offices of the Holy Eastern Church. "[93]The day is past
   and over," and "[94]Fierce was the wild billow," are both, in the
   original, the work of Anatolius, and are well known in their attractive
   renderings by Dr. Neale.
     __________________________________________________________________

  St. John of Damascus

   John of Damascus is by far the most prominent, and most poetical of all
   the Greek Christian poets. The exact date of his birth is unknown, but
   he died c. 780 A.D. the last of the theologians of the Greek Church. He
   dwelt for many years in Damascus, his native city, a valiant champion
   of orthodoxy against all opponents. His influence on Greek hymnody was
   immense, and he was held in high esteem by the Greek Church for his
   work in that department. The Octoechus, which contains the Ferial
   Office, was largely the work of John. There his canons are found which
   are perhaps his greatest work in hymnody. The canons under the name of
   John Arklas are usually attributed to St. John, and also those under
   the name of John the Monk. John, in company with [95]Cosmas his
   foster-brother, retired eventually to the monastery of St. Sabas, in
   Palestine, where he spent a life of devotion, and sang those Christian
   hymns which have cheered and inspired so many generations of Christians
   in the East. There he penned the "Golden Canon" for Easter Day, which
   breathes the glorious hopes of the Resurrection. He lived, it is
   believed, to extreme old age, dying at the close of the year 780.
     __________________________________________________________________

  St. Cosmas, the Melodist

   St. Cosmas, surnamed the Melodist, was foster-brother of [96]John of
   Damascus, to whom he was attached by closest bonds of friendship. He
   retired with the famous theologian and hymn writer, to the monastery of
   St. Sabas, in Palestine, where he spent his leisure in the composition
   of hymns, many of which found their way, along with those of John of
   Damascus, into the Greek Offices. There he also shared the work
   connected with the preparation of The Octoechus with his
   foster-brother. To what extent his hymns found a place in the Greek
   Offices, it is difficult to say. If all those bearing his name are
   accepted as his, then his contribution is a fairly large one. He is
   represented by canons on The Nativity, The Epiphany, The
   Transfiguration, and Palm Sunday; also by sundry other pieces. His
   poetry, although it is said they composed in friendly rivalry, cannot
   bear comparison with that of St. John, in any particular. It has,
   however, qualities which claim for it the appreciative reference which
   [97]Dr. Neale bestows upon it.

   Cosmas became Bishop of Maiuma, near Gaza, in 743, and died about 760.
   He is commemorated by the Greek Church on October 14th.
     __________________________________________________________________

  St. Joseph of the Studium

   Joseph of the Studium, sometimes designated The Hymnographer, was born
   on the island of Sicily, in the end of the eighth century, or the
   beginning of the ninth. It has been disputed whether indeed the double
   designation belongs to one person. Into that question we have no
   occasion to enter here. Up to the present time we have had no evidence
   to prove that the Hymnographer was not of the Studium, and that the
   hymns of St. Joseph, which are so much in evidence in the Service
   Books, are not the work of one writer.

   St. Joseph left Sicily in 830 A.D., and at Thessalonica embraced the
   monastic life. Removing later to Constantinople, he entered the
   monastery of the Studium. There he devoted himself to hymn writing. He
   was by far the most voluminous writer of hymns of the Greek Church, his
   verses exceeding in number those of [98]St. Gregory of Nazianzus. There
   are nearly two hundred canons from his pen in the Menaea, and when we
   consider that each canon is made up of eight odes, to say nothing of
   the accompanying contakia, it is easy to gauge the extent of his work
   in that one class of composition. Like most other voluminous writers,
   however, his quality is not of the best. Many of the canons are
   exceedingly poor, and reflect little credit on the writer. "[99]Stars
   of the morning, so gloriously bright," a cento by Dr. Neale, gives a
   very good sample of his use of figure. "[100]Far from Thy heavenly
   care," a contakion after the sixth ode of the canon for Septuagesima,
   perhaps owes more to the translator than at first sight appears. St.
   Joseph died, 883.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Theoctistus

   Theoctistus was a friend of [101]St. Joseph, and was a monk at the
   Studium at Constantinople in the latter part of St. Joseph's residence
   at that famous monastery, about the middle of the ninth century. Very
   little is known about Theoctistus, and the only hymnodical work which
   can be attributed to him with certainty, is a very attractive canon in
   the Parakletike, called The Supplicant Canon of Theoctistus to Jesus. A
   cento from that canon beginning "[102]Jesus, name all names above," is
   in common use.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Metrophanes of Smyrna

   Metrophanes, Bishop of Smyrna in the latter part of the ninth century,
   was one of the minor poets of the Greek Church. He composed several
   canons in honour of the Blessed Trinity, which find a place in the
   Octoechus. Very little of his work has been translated. Dr. Neale gives
   a cento from one of the canons in his [103]Hymns of the Eastern Church,
   which is repeated in [104]The English Hymnal, "[105]O Unity of
   Threefold Light." Metrophanes died about 910 A.D.

   I

   Our highest thought of God is vain;

   Whate'er of knowledge we may know,

   Our darkened minds but darker grow,

   We ne'er can to the light attain.


   II

   Beyond the mountain tops that rise,

   Still higher altitudes appear;

   Climb as we may, we come not near

   The peaks that pierce the azure skies.


   III

   Beyond the farthest stretch of mind,

   The wisdom of our God extends;

   We touch the love that never ends,

   And only know that it is kind.


   IV

   We cannot gaze upon the sun,

   Save through the mists from earth that rise;

   God's glory only meets our eyes

   When veiled in the Incarnate One.


   V

   Yea, none but God His love can know,

   Nor can The Christ that love express;

   The gift is ever something less,

   Than is the love the gift would show.


   VI

   Our minds, our hearts, our spirits fail

   In all our searching God to find;

   We only know that He is kind,

   And nought that knowledge can assail.


   VII

   No soul can rise to God, alone,

   The height divine we cannot reach;

   Do Thou, O Christ, our blindness teach,

   Until we know as we are known.

   Awaits the rising sun;

   Awake, my soul, to life awake!

   Inspired with hope, thy task o'ertake,

   And fill the day begun.


   II

   O Light, beyond our utmost light,

   To Whom our day is as the night,

   Our sun a feeble star;

   Lead me to where Thy glories rise,

   Beyond the earth, beyond the skies,

   On fairer fields afar.


   III

   Thou art the Light, Eternal Christ,

   Whose glory at the first sufficed

   To fire the endless spheres;

   Night has no more abiding place,

   Before the brightness of Thy face

   The darkness disappears.


   IV

   O that a searching ray might shine

   Within this darkened soul of mine,

   And bid my night depart!

   Then would the joy of life abound,

   And summer music ever sound

   Within my joyless heart.

   O God of love, to Thee we raise

   Our early song of gladsome praise.


   II

   There, on the flower-bespangled sod,

   The petals open to the sun;

   And feathered songsters sing to God,

   And hail the cheerful day begun:

   With theirs, our early songs unite,

   To praise our God Who gives the light.


   III

   Morn of a better day, we sing

   Thy praise, O Christ, Whose wondrous grace

   Can brightness to our darkness bring,

   And scatter night before Thy face:

   Now let our morning praise arise,

   A glad accepted sacrifice.


   IV

   O let our life a morning know,--

   The promise of a better day;

   And set our night-chilled hearts aglow,

   And fill them with Thy joy, we pray:

   Then shall our praise to Thee arise,

   A glad accepted sacrifice.


   V

   Sun of our life, O Christ, art Thou;

   No clouds depress when Thou art near;

   Come with Thy radiant beauty now,

   And let that morn of joy appear:

   Glad shall our songs of praise arise

   When morn is shining in our skies.

Cathismata of the Resurrection


   I

   Gone is the glowing orb of day,

   The hues of sunset fade away,

   And all the world is still;

   The starlight sparkles to the sight,

   As fall the curtains of the night

   On every vale and hill.


   II

   O God, 'twas night when, all too soon,

   The dark eclipsed the light at noon;

   And men, convulsed with dread,

   The Cross upon the hill descried

   On which the God-man groaned and died,

   With shame upon His head.


   III

   And night prevailed with dismal gloom

   While, 'prisoned in the awful tomb,

   The Christ in stillness lay:

   But every night a morn precedes,

   And darkness into brightness leads,--

   And dawned the glorious day.


   IV

   O God, in mercy, grant that we

   The Resurrection light may see

   When death's still night is past;

   And to the risen Christ arise,

   While morning fills th' eternal skies

   With glory that shall last.


   V

   Gone is the glowing orb of day,

   The hues of sunset fade away,

   And dark the night descends;

   In Thy fair realm there is no gloom,

   The radiant day is never done;

   They need no candle to illume,

   Nor wait the rising of the sun.


   III

   No morning ushers in the day,

   Nor evening marks its slow decline;

   There Thou art sun, and shinest aye,

   And all the light and joy are Thine.


   IV

   Eternal Light, Eternal Day,

   No eve obscures, no darkness hides;

   But clear the noon-tide shines alway,

   For there Thy presence aye abides.


   V

   Come at this hour, O Light divine,

   As daylight fades, and night is nigh,

   And in our souls with radiance shine,

   As Thou art wont in realms on high.

   The sun has reached his western goal,

   And night winds hush the world to rest;

   Be still, and worship God, my soul,

   Who through the day thy life hath blest.


   II

   To God thy Maker, thanks accord,

   For life, and hope, and every good,

   And all the comfort of the Word

   Incarnate, for the spirit's food.


   III

   Ah! night is dark when clouds of guilt

   The shrinking soul with fears distress,--

   Call on the Christ Whose blood was spilt,

   And all thy guiltiness confess.


   IV

   Then let me rest in calm repose,--

   Secure in Him, my rest is sweet;

   The fears of night no dread impose,

   If I have worshipped at His feet.


   V

   O Christ, Who art my Light, I pray,

   Keep Thou my soul till morning shine;

   Then, brighter than the orb of day,

   Illume my path with light divine.

   The longing eyes that sought the light

   Are filled with glad amaze,

   As, from the depths of brooding night,

   The morning meets their gaze;

   O weary night! its hours are past,

   And morning light hath dawned at last.


   II

   O Christ, Who in the heart of God,

   Eternal, did'st repose;

   Whom to proclaim to earth abroad,

   The seer and prophet rose;

   Now comes to earth, Incarnate Word,

   To tell the love of God our Lord.


   III

   Now hearts respond that, mute before,

   In night and silence dwelt,--

   Who longed, in worship, to adore

   A love they never felt;

   For night is gone, and silence rings,

   And every heart responsive, sings.


   IV

   Hail, Christ of God! Anointed One,

   From sin's dark night to free;

   Thou art the One-begotten Son

   Whom ages longed to see;

   O weary night, its hours are past,

   And morning light hath dawned at last.

   O Despotou philanthropias!


   I

   O Love supreme, exceeding broad,

   Great source of love, the love of God,

   Outreaching all we know;

   High as the heavens where glories shine,

   Far towers that mighty love divine,

   And deep as hell below.


   II

   God looked from heaven on man's estate,

   To view our need exceeding great,

   And all our loss and shame;

   And God Incarnate came to earth,

   The Godman by mysterious birth,

   And bore our sinful name.


   III

   He walked the earth, but all unknown;

   In vain the love of God was shown,

   For sinners spurned His grace;

   And while He pled, they mocking cried,

   "Away, let Him be crucified,"

   And mocked Him to His face.


   IV

   They raised Him up 'twixt earth and sky,

   And left the Godman there to die,

   In all His suffering sore;

   And ere He died, the prayer was made

   That guilt might not on men be laid,

   For all the ill He bore.


   V

   O love supreme, so broad, so high!

   Here, prostrate, at the Cross I lie,

   But I adore and praise;

   For me, for me, Thy blood was spilt,

   Mine is the sin, and mine the guilt--

   O God, my guilt erase.

   A band of herdsmen tarried late,

   Through hours of night disconsolate;

   Around, the snow lay glistening white,

   And stars o'erhead were shining bright;

   O favoured shepherds, there shall rise

   A brighter star in yonder skies.


   II

   Whence comes this glory, brighter far

   Than light that shines from midnight star?

   An angel from the Lord appears,

   And lo! their minds are filled with fears;

   O favoured shepherds, wherefore fear?

   The messenger of God is here.


   III

   "O band of herdsmen, list! I bring

   Glad tidings of a promised King;

   Go, in a manger ye shall find

   The new-born Saviour of mankind;"

   O favoured shepherds, such surprise!

   To see the Christ in mean disguise.


   IV

   Then stood the herdsmen all amaze,

   For heaven with glory was ablaze;

   And choirs of angels, clad in white,

   Awoke with song the silent night;

   O favoured shepherds, ye were blest,

   To hear that heavenly song exprest.


   V

   To God be glory," thus they sang,

   While earth and heaven with music rang;

   "And peace abounding henceforth dwell

   With those on earth who please me well;"

   O favoured shepherds, night is past,

   And morn, bright morn, is come at last.


   VI

   O band of herdsmen, long ago,

   That song was sung on earth below,

   Now myriad hosts uplift the strains

   That first awoke on Bethlehem's plains;

   O favoured shepherds, round the throne,

   The angel's song is now your own.

   Hope to the lost, among the wilds forlorn,

   Far from their home, by prickly tangle torn;

   Straight to the eye the path ascending lies,

   Clear in the light that fills the morning skies.

   Kurie, e en pollais hamartias.

   This Idiomelon, the original of which may be seen at p. 384 of the
   Athens edition of the Triodion, bears the title, poiema Kassiannes
   Monaches ("A poem of Kassia the Recluse"). It is still sung on
   Wednesday of Holy Week.

   Kassia had been chosen as consort by the Emperor Theophilos the
   Iconoclast (A.D. 829-843), son of Michael II. the Stammerer, and when
   she was brought into his presence, the Emperor greeted her, exclaiming,
   "Woman is the source of all evil;" to which Kassia replied, "And also
   of all good." Trifling as the circumstance may seem, it roused the
   anger of the monarch, and the match was broken off.

   Thereupon Kassia devoted herself to religion, and founded a nunnery, in
   which she remained till her death. In the quiet and seclusion of her
   life, she wrote many idiomela, which are scattered over the Greek
   Office Books, chiefly The Menaea.

   None of her poetry, so far as the present writer has been able to
   discover, has ever been rendered into English. Certainly this, which is
   one of the finest of her idiomela, appears here for the first time in
   English verse. It is brimful of pathos and tinged with melancholy,
   without doubt traceable to the sad experiences of her life. May it not
   be that in the second line of the first stanza there is a suggestion of
   her own name? k?sia (kasia) is sometimes written kassia (kassia), the
   sweet herb. The sweetness of cassia had been changed to the bitterness
   of myrrh.


   I

   Burdened with sin, more, Lord, than I can tell,

   I bear the myrrh with those that loved Thee well;

   And to the grave lamenting, lo, I bring,

   For this last solemn rite, my offering.


   II

   The love of sin, ah, that it should be so,

   That held my truant spirit long ago,--

   That love of sin my foolish heart hath found,

   And moonless night now circles me around.


   III

   O Thou, Who by the clouds that drape the sky,

   Bearest the waters of the sea on high,

   Accept the offering of my bitter tears,

   From springs that issue in a night of fears.


   IV

   O Thou, Who mad'st the heavens of old to bow,

   Incline Thine ear and hear Thy servant now,

   And let my sighing and my grievous moan,

   Enter Thine ear, O God, my God alone.


   V

   Prostrate I fall, and in my worship meet,

   Would kiss amid my tears Thy stainless feet,

   And wipe them with my hair, that by Thy grace,

   I with the penitent may take my place.


   VI

   To Thy fair Paradise, when eve has come,

   Take Thou Thy servant in Thy mercy home;

   From fear of Judgment, and from evil free,

   There let me dwell for evermore with Thee.

   Till, past the glowing gates, The Christ

   Is lost to mortal sight.


   II

   And now amid the bliss of heaven,

   The Father's throne He shares;

   And gems of radiant beauty deck

   The sparkling crown He wears.


   III

   Remember, Lord, Thy promise made,

   When hearts in sadness pined,

   And send the Comforter to soothe

   The sorrows of mankind;


   IV

   And as the lingering ages pass,

   To teach the souls of men,

   That they may hail the Christ when He

   In glory comes again.


   V

   All praise to Thee, Eternal God,

   And to the Son be given,

   Whose glory, darkly veiled on earth,

   Now fills the light of heaven;


   VI

   And to the Holy Comforter,

   By Whom our lives are blest,

   Be praise, by every waiting heart,

   For evermore expressed.

   See the King of kings ascending

   To His throne of power again;

   Who in humble garb descending,

   Came to dwell with lowly men.


   II

   Glad the angel hosts adoring

   Fling the golden gates aside;

   Mortals, view the Victor soaring,

   Heaven receives the Lord with pride.


   III

   Strike your harps, ye choirs supernal;

   Lift your songs of welcome now;

   For, behold your King eternal

   Comes with laurels on His brow.


   IV

   Gone the sorrow and the sighing;

   All the anguish and the pain;

   Gone the weakness and the dying,--

   Choirs immortal, raise the strain;


   V

   Hallelujah! endless glory

   To the King of Glory give;

   Mortals, heed the gladsome story,

   Christ is risen, and thou may'st live.

   Now let the gates be lifted up,

   That Christ may enter in,

   Who drank for man the bitter cup,

   And crushed the power of sin;

   He enters, lo! a Victor brave,

   Triumphant from the yawning grave.


   II

   Did death and hell their power unite

   To hold their prize? in vain;

   For morn awoke upon the night,

   And death and hell were slain;

   All hail the Victor from the grave,

   Who rose from death our souls to save.


   III

   Now let the Christ His right assume,--

   The throne of high renown;

   No more do thorns His temples fret,

   He wears a regal crown;--

   Up, myriad hosts, your praises bring,

   And laud the All-victorious King.


   IV

   To God the Father, God the Son,

   And God the Spirit blest,

   Be glory while the ages run,

   By angel hosts exprest;

   And souls from death's dark bondage won,

   By Christ, the All-victorious Son.

   On the throne of God I gaze;--

   Sparkling are the gems abounding,

   Sweet the harps and viols sounding;

   See the palms of victory wave,--

   'Twas the Christ the triumph gave.


   II

   Lo, He sits in glory now,

   Thorns no longer clutch his brow,--

   Glory, laud, and honour bringing,

   Choirs of the redeemed are singing,--

   Thus the King enthroned they greet,

   And their crowns are at His feet.


   III

   Past, the life He lived below,

   Gone the weariness and woe;

   Now the painful strife is ended,

   Christ a victor hath ascended,

   Sin and death are bound with chains,

   And the King Immortal reigns.


   IV

   Ah! Good Lord, when life is past,

   Bring me to such bliss at last;

   Where love wakens gleams of gladness,

   In the eyes that wept for sadness;--

   Where the weary rest, and praise

   Christ, the Victor King, always.

   Who rose to reign from Olivet.

   That ever loved, and loves always,

   I

   When Jesus at the feast reclined,

   And sad disciples sorrowed most,

   He gave, to soothe their troubled mind,

   The promise of the Holy Ghost.


   II

   "I will not leave you," thus He spake,

   "As orphans here alone to dwell;

   With you My sure abode I'll make,

   And all your loneliness dispel."


   III

   And when amid the clouds of heaven,

   Th' ascending Lord to sight was lost;

   The promised Gift of Christ was given

   Upon the hallowed Pentecost.


   IV

   He came upon a rushing wind,

   The faint apostles to inspire;

   And on their waiting band declined,

   In form of cloven tongues of fire.


   V

   And as the Spirit utterance gave,

   Their tongues expressed the thought inspired;

   And faltering, timid hearts were brave,

   And fainting souls with zeal were fired.


   VI

   O Spirit, Gift of Christ adored,

   Our need behold, in power descend;

   And, as was promised by our Lord,

   Abide our Comforter, and Friend.

   The sin our subtle hearts conceal;

   And when we humbly guilt confess,

   Let penitence our souls possess.

   Shine on the Cross in sin's dark night,

   And there reveal the Christ of God,

   Bruised for our sin beneath the rod.

   Where Christ the pilgrim soul befriends;

   I

   O Lord of mercy, at Thy gate

   I loudly knock though coming late,

   And seek to enter in;

   Noon passed with all its promise clear,

   The day declined, now night is here--

   Forgive, O Lord, my sin.


   II

   I wandered while the daylight shone,

   Nor thought until the light had flown

   How far my feet had strayed;

   I said, "My wanderings I'll control,"

   But while the world sang to my soul,

   I sinfully delayed.


   III

   O let me in--I see the light,

   Its golden arrows pierce the night,

   But all without is drear,

   And cold, and chill; O night winds, bear

   The burden of my heart-born prayer,

   And bring it to His ear.


   IV

   I hear the music and the song,

   The laughter of the gleeful throng

   That fill the festal hall;

   The night dews fall, I've journeyed far--

   O wilt Thou not the gate unbar,

   In answer to my call?


   V

   Thou sought'st, O Lord, the wandering child,

   By wood and stream, and moorland wild,

   When Thou on earth did'st dwell;

   The fold, secure, was left behind,

   That Thou might'st seek the lost, and find

   Whom Thou did'st love so well.


   VI

   Yea, 'tis Thy voice! the gate unbar,--

   O let me in, I've travelled far,

   The midnight wind is chill;

   O Christ, what means the silent dread?

   Why is the voice of gladness dead,

   And all within so still?


   VII

   Yea, 'tis His voice--Thy servant hears,

   Speak, Lord! "Depart?" O night, and fears!

   O deepest, darkest woe!

   "Depart, for thou hast come too late,

   The day is gone, and closed the gate,

   Hence from My presence go!"

   That stream of bliss can never fail

   That has its source in heaven.


   V

   "Thou art my portion," saith my soul,

   I have no want denied,

   For from the bounties of Thy grace

   Are all my needs supplied.

   I

   My soul doth wait on God,

   From Him my help proceeds;

   His mercy is exceeding broad,

   To overtake my needs.


   II

   He gives His pardoning grace,

   When I my sin confess;

   Nor ever hides from me His face

   In my distressfulness.


   III

   The Spirit of all power,

   Most freely He bestows;

   And I am strong in evil hour,

   When pressed by direst foes.


   IV

   O, He has gifts in store,

   More rich than wealth commands;

   And when His pity I implore,

   He fills my empty hands.


   V

   God, Thou art good and kind,

   And full of tender grace;

   Have me forever in Thy mind,

   Nor hide from me Thy face.

   I

   The burden of my sin was great,

   My soul with pain was crushed;

   And every voice of promise sweet,

   Was for the moment hushed.


   II

   Dark clouds come rolling o'er my head,

   And quick the night came down;--

   O Christ, if Thine was pain like this,

   Thorns were a fitting crown.


   III

   O night without, and night within,

   And doubt, and fear, and dread;

   And all my folly and my sin,

   Before my eyes were spread.


   IV

   And not a hand to still my pain,

   And not a voice to bless;--

   O Christ, did all Thy pain and woe

   Give anguish like to this?


   V

   A morning comes when night is past,

   A calm when storms are spent;

   And healing to my wounded soul,

   My God in mercy sent.


   VI

   I saw the Cross upon the hill,

   I felt the dark come down;--

   The anguish of His wounded soul,

   The stinging of the crown.


   VII

   And as I looked, the morning grew,

   The calm of morn was mine;

   For ah! the anguish that He bore,

   My troubled soul, was thine.

   I

   Bowed with grief and anguish low,

   Weary with the clouded way;

   Soul of mine, to Christ I'll go,

   All my grief before Him lay:

   Tell Him, 'neath the willow shade,

   Ah! too long my stay is made.


   II

   Is there joy by Babel's streams,--

   Mute the harp on willow hung,

   Ne'er a sunglint or a beam,

   Heart, as well as harp unstrung?

   Soul of mine, awake! arise!

   Seek the sunland and the skies.


   III

   There the palms in triumph wave,

   And the stream life giving flows;

   Up, my soul, be strong, be brave,

   After night the morning glows,

   For the willow's weeping shade

   Marks the place where vows are made.


   IV

   Sprigs of willow, leaves of palm,

   Days of grief, and hours of song;

   Nights of storm and morning calm,

   Come alternate all life long;

   Soul of mine, the shade of woe

   Leads to where the palm leaves grow.


   V

   Lead me, O Thou Christ of God,

   Where the willows weeping sigh;

   Safe the way that Thou hast trod,

   E'en with dangers lurking nigh,--

   Past the willows and the grave,

   To the land where palm trees wave.


   VI

   Willows by earth's waters weep,

   Palm trees wave beneath its sun;

   Christ, my wandering footsteps keep,

   Till my pilgrimage is done,

   Where no willow marks a grave,

   And the palms triumphant wave.

   For Thou hast taught my soul to sing.

   O God, unerring wisdom, Thou,

   And on that love recline;--

   For Thou hast taught my soul to sing.

   'Tis not by word Thy love is shown,--

   A priceless Gift was given,

   When Jesus left the Father's throne,

   And stooped to earth from heaven;--

   My God, to Thee my praise I bring,

   For Thou hast taught my soul to sing.


   IV

   Thus shall my praise be comely, Lord,

   And like Thy love divine,

   When gift shall far surpass my word,

   And life with praise combine;--

   For Thou hast taught my soul to sing.

   And when the work was ended,

   And Christ to God returned,

   The Holy Ghost descended

   In cloven tongues that burned;

   And spake them to the hearts of men.

  APPENDIX

   A copy of the draft of The Church of Scotland Mission Hymn Book,
   compiled by a committee, and sanctioned by last General Assembly for
   publication, has come into the writer's hands, too late to be collated
   for the foregoing Table. The Hymn Book, which is intended for use at
   Mission services--both those of a permanent Mission, and those of
   Mission-weeks, including Guild, and Missionary, and other special
   services, for which The Church Hymnary and The Scottish Hymnal do not
   make sufficient provision--contains 338 hymns, and 18 metrical Psalms
   and Paraphrases, all of which, so far as one can judge from a casual
   survey, and without the music, seem suitable for the purpose to which
   the book will be devoted.

   The noteworthy particular in connection with this Collection, and that
   which demands this reference to it, is the fact that, here for the
   first time in the history of Scottish hymnody, we have something
   approaching a satisfactory representation of hymns from the Greek; and
   it is not lacking in significance that the book to include so many,
   should be a Mission Hymn Book. No one who has studied Scottish hymnody
   will miss the significance of this fact. If the Greek Church, which is
   variously characterised by its critics, be a non-missionary Church, it
   can at least supply hymns, if not for the ordinary services of the
   sanctuary, then for Mission services. Such, at any rate, would seem to
   be the conviction of the compilers of The Mission Hymn Book.

   The thirteen hymns from the Greek contained in this book, the first
   lines of which are given below, include three which are presented for
   use for the first time, viz., (g) (i) (n), increasing the number of
   Greek hymns in common use from forty-one (as shewn by the [106]Table on
   pages 20-23) to forty-four.

   (a) [107]Art thou weary, art thou languid?
          (Based upon the Greek) tr. Dr. Neale.

   (b) [108]Behold the Bridegroom cometh
          (Midnight Office) tr. G. Moultrie.

   (c) [109]Christian, dost thou see them?
          ([110]St. Andrew of Crete) tr. Dr. Neale.

   (d) [111]Far from Thy heavenly care
          ([112]St. Joseph of the Studium) tr. Dr. Brownlie.

   (e) [113]God of all grace, Thy mercy send
          (Litany of the Deacon) tr. Dr. Brownlie.

   (f) O brightness of the Eternal Father's face
          ([114]Sophronius) tr. E. W. Eddis.

   (g) O may my soul, uncrushed by care
          ([115]Synesius) tr. Dr. Brownlie.

   (h) [116]O Saviour, in Thy pitying grace
          ([117]Theoctistus) tr. R. M. Moorsom.

   (i) [118]Our hearts to heaven upraising
          (Morning service, Horologion) tr. Dr. Brownlie.

   (k) [119]Safe home, safe home in port
          (Based upon the Greek) tr. Dr. Neale.

   (l) [120]Stars of the morning
          ([121]St. Joseph) tr. Dr. Neale.

   (m) [122]Those eternal bowers
          ([123]St. John of Damascus) tr. Dr. Neale.

   (n) [124]When glory crowned the mountain top
          (Based upon the Greek) tr. Dr. Brownlie.
