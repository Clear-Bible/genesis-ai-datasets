   Ezekiel 13:1-3

   1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

   1. Et fuit sermo Iehovae ad me, dicendo,

   2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy,
   and say you unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear you
   the word of the LORD;

   2. Fili hominis, prophetiza contra prophetas Israel prophetizantes, et
   dic prophetizantibus ex corde suo, Audite sermonem Iehovah.

   3. Thus says the Lord GOD, Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow
   their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

   3. Sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, Vae super prophetas stultos [1] qui
   ambulant post spiritum suum: et non viderunt.


   He speaks of the exiled prophets, as will be evident from the context:
   for among the captives there were those who assumed the name of God,
   boasting themselves endowed with the prophetic spirit: but meanwhile
   they intruded into the office, and then vainly boasted in their
   deceptions. But the end which they proposed to themselves was to
   promise the people a speedy return, and so to will the favor of the
   multitude. For the captives were already almost broken-hearted by
   weariness: and seventy years was a long period. When therefore they
   heard of returning after three years, they easily suffered themselves
   to be deceived by such blandishments. But although God is so vehemently
   enraged against those impostors, it does not therefore follow that when
   he charges them with their crime, he absolves the people, or even
   extenuates their fault. Nor could the people object that they were
   deceived by those falsehoods, since they willingly and knowingly threw
   themselves into the snare. They were not destitute of true prophets;
   and God had distinguished his servants from false prophets by
   well-known marks, so that no one could mistake except willfully.
   (Deuteronomy 13:3.) But in the midst of light they blinded themselves,
   and so God suffered them to be deceived. But that was the just reward
   of their pride, since they could not be subject to God and his
   servants. Then when they thought enticements, as is evident from many
   passages, God also gave the reins to Satan, that there should be a
   lying spirit in the mouth of all the prophets. Micah reproves them
   because they desired prophets to be given them who should promise large
   grape-gatherings and a plentiful harvest, (Micah 2:11;) meanwhile, when
   God chastised them severely, they roared and were tumultuous. We see,
   therefore, that while God inveighs so sharply against false prophets,
   the people's fault was not diminished; but rather each thought thus to
   reason with himself -- if God spares not our prophets, what better have
   we to hope for?

   When therefore the Prophet turns his discourse to [2]the false
   prophets, there is no doubt of his intention to reprove the whole
   people for attending to such fallacies while they despised the true
   doctrine, and not only so, but even rejected it with fury. Say
   therefore to the prophets of Israel while prophesying, say to those
   prophesying out of their own hearts. Here he concedes the name of
   prophets of Israel to those who thrust themselves forward, and rashly
   boasted that they were commanded to utter their own imaginations, or
   what the devil had suggested. For then indeed no others thought to have
   been lawfully reckoned prophets, unless divinely chosen. But because
   the wicked seized upon this title, they are often called prophets,
   though God's Spirit is a complete stranger to them: but the gift of
   prophecy can only flow from that one fountain. This great struggle then
   happened when the prophets, or those who assumed the title, engaged
   with hostility among themselves: for we are commanded to acquiesce in
   God's truth alone: but when he is offered to us instead of truth, what
   can we do but fluctuate and at length engage in conflict? There is no
   doubt, then, that weak minds were thus vehemently shaken when they saw
   contests and dissension's of this kind between prophets. At this day
   God wishes to prove the fidelity of his people by such an experiment,
   and to detect the hypocrisy of the multitude. For, as Paul says, there
   must be heresies, that those who are approved may be made manifest. (1
   Corinthians 11:19.) God therefore does not rashly permit so much
   license to Satan's ministers, that they should petulantly rise up
   against sound doctrine: nor yet without a cause does he permit the
   Church to be torn asunder by diverse opinions, and fictions to grow so
   strong sometimes, that truth itself is buried under them: he wishes
   indeed in this way to prove the constancy of the pious, and at the same
   time to detect the lightness of hypocrites who are tossed about by
   every wind. Meanwhile, if the contention which we now perceive between
   those who boast themselves pastors of the Church disturbs us, let this
   example come to mind, and thus novelty will not endanger our
   faithfulness. What we suffer the ancients have experienced, namely, the
   disturbance of the Church by intestine disputes, and a similar tearing
   asunder of the bond of unity.

   Next, God briefly defines who the false prophets are; namely, those who
   prophesy out of their own hearts: he will afterwards add, they have
   seen nothing, they only boast in the name of God, and yet they are not
   sent by him. The same thing is expressed in various ways, but I shall
   treat other forms of speech in their own places. Here, as I have said,
   we may readily decide at once who are the true and who the false
   prophets: the Spirit of God pronounces every one who prophesies from
   his own heart to be an impostor. Hence nothing else remains but for the
   prophets faithfully to utter whatever the Spirit has dictated to them.
   Whoever, therefore, has no sure testimony to his vision, and cannot
   truly testify that he speaks from God's mouth and by the revelation of
   his Spirit, although he may boast in the title of prophet, yet he is
   only an impostor. For God here rejects all who speak from their own
   heart. And hence we also gather the extreme vanity of the human mind:
   for God puts a perpetual distinction between the human mind and the
   revelation of his Spirit. If this be so, it follows that what men utter
   of themselves is a perverse fiction, because the Spirit of God claims
   to himself alone, as we have said, the office of showing what is true
   and right. It follows --

   Woe to, the foolish or disgraceful prophets nvl, nebel, signifies "a
   vile person," "a castaway," just as nvlh, nebeleh, means "foulness,"
   "crime," "wickedness," although nvl, nebel, is oftener taken for folly,
   and I willingly embrace this sense as it is generally received. He
   calls false prophets foolish, because they doubtless fiercely insulted
   the true servants of God -- just like upstarts puffed up with wonderful
   self-conceit; for the devil, who reigns in them, is the father of
   pride: hence they carry themselves haughtily, arrogate all things to
   themselves, and wish to be thought angels come down from heaven. And
   when Paul speaks of human fictions, he grants them the form of wisdom.
   (Colossians 2:23.) Hence there is no doubt that these pretenders of
   whom Ezekiel speaks were held in great esteem, and so, when swollen
   with bombast, they puffed forth surprising wisdom; but meanwhile the
   Holy Spirit shortly pronounces them fools: for whatever pleases the
   world under the mask of wisdom, we know to be mere folly before God.

   Now he adds, who walk after their own spirit, without seeing any thing:
   that is, when no vision has been given them. Ezekiel explains himself
   more clearly, or rather the Spirit who spoke through him. As,
   therefore, he has lately condemned all who prophesy out of their own
   mind or heart, -- for the noun "heart" is here used for "intellect," as
   in other places, -- as, therefore, the Spirit has lately condemned all
   such, so he says that those who walk after their own spirit wickedly
   abuse the prophetic office. He here alludes to the prophetic gift when
   he speaks of "spirit." For, because they might object that false
   prophets did not speak from their own heart, but had secret
   revelations, he concedes to them the use of the word "spirit" by a
   rhetorical figure, [2] and thus refutes their boasting, as if Ezekiel
   had said that those fictitious revelations are mere fancies: they have
   indeed something in them more than common, but still they are fanatics.
   This then is the sense of the word "spirit." Meanwhile there is no
   doubt that he repeats what he lately saw, and the contrast removes all
   doubt. Without seeing any thing, says he: thus vision is opposed to the
   human heart and spirit; but what is vision but a supernatural gift?
   When, therefore, God raises his servants above the capacity of human
   ability, and makes them discern what no mortal power can bestow, that
   is a vision; and if a vision is removed, nothing will remain but the
   spirit or heart of man. Hence those who cannot really show that their
   utterance is evidently inspired, shall be compelled to confess that
   they speak of their own minds. It follows --

   [1] Or, "disgraceful." -- Calvin.

   [2] Calvin uses the Greek word katachrestikos, meaning in rhetoric the
   use of a word in a sense different from its natural one. Catachresis is
   the grammatical term, implying the use of terms in their "non-natural"
   sense. The French has "neantmoins que ce soit improprentent."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 13:4

   4. O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

   4. Tanquam vulpes in locis solitaries prophetae tui, Israel, fuerunt.


   Hence Ezekiel exposes the snares of the false prophets. The ten tribes
   had been dispersed, just as if a field or a vineyard had been removed
   from a habitable neighborhood into desert regions, and foxes held their
   sway there instead. For they have many hiding-places; they insinuate
   themselves through hedges and all openings, and so break into the
   vineyard or field, and lay waste its fruits. Such, as I have said, was
   the condition of the people from the time of its dispersion. While the
   Israelites dwelt at home, they were in some way retained within their
   duty, as if fortified by certain ramparts. At Jerusalem, too, the high
   Priest presided over spiritual trials, that no impious doctrine should
   creep in: but now, since the people were so dispersed, greater license
   was given to the false prophets to corrupt the people, since the
   miserable exiles were exposed to these foxes; for they were liable to
   injuries just as if desert regions surrounded them. Being thus
   destitute of protection, it was easy for foxes to enter by clandestine
   arts, and to destroy whatever good fruits existed. Meanwhile Ezekiel
   obliquely reproves the people's carelessness. Although they were
   dispersed, and were so open to the snares of the false prophets, yet
   they thought to have been attentive and cautious, and God would
   doubtless have afforded them aid, as he promises to his people the
   spirit of discretion and judgment whenever they need it. (1 Corinthians
   12:10.) But when the Israelites were wandering exiles, and attention to
   the law no longer flourished among them, it came to pass that foxes,
   meaning their false prophets, easily entered. Whence it follows that
   the people were not free from faults, since they exposed themselves to
   the snares of these false prophets. It follows --

   Ezekiel 13:5

   5. You have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for
   the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.

   5. Non ascendistis ad rupturas [3] neque sepiverunt sepem super domum
   Israel ad standum in praelio in die Iehovae.


   Hence he pursues the same sentiment, but presses the false prophets
   harder. He has said generally that they were sacrilegious, making a
   false use of God's name when speaking entirely in their own. He now
   separates them by another mark from the approved and faithful servants
   of God, namely, they had not gone up into the breach, nor built up a
   hedge to protect the house of Israel, that they might stand in the
   battle in the day of Jehovah. This verse is variously explained: some
   refer what is here said to prayer; others twist it according to
   different imaginations, but I restrict it to their teaching. [4]
   Ezekiel not only blames their inner and hidden perfidy, he not only
   strikes their minds, so as to convince them that they had no desire for
   piety, and no zeal for God's glory, but he shows that their teaching
   must be altogether rejected, because they did not propose to themselves
   the right object. But what is the mark at which all God's servants
   thought to aim? Surely to consult the public safety; and when they see
   signs of God's wrath, to meet them, and prevent the urgent calamity.
   These impostors saw the people not only impious, but rebellious, so
   that there was no hope of their repentance. On the other hand, they saw
   God threatening; and although they were blind, yet they could behold
   the signs of God's reproaching vengeance. Hence it was their duty to go
   up to the breaches. Hence, also, we understand what the Prophet means
   by "breaches," namely, as an approach is open to an enemy to storm a
   city when a breach is made in the wall, so also, when the iniquity of
   the people overflows like a deluge, a rupture is already made, by means
   of which God's wrath is able to penetrate immediately, and to lay
   everything waste till it is reduced to nothing.

   As often, then, as we see God offended by the people's wickedness, let
   us learn that a breach has been made, as if we had been destined to
   destruction. Hence those who desire to discharge the office of teaching
   faithfully ought to hasten to the breach, to recall the people from
   their impiety, and to exhort them to repentance. Thus the wall becomes
   restored, because God is appeased, and we are able to rest in quietness
   and security. What follows has the same object -- they have not
   restored the hedge. For when a people breaks through all rights, and
   violates God's law, it is just as if they laid themselves bare in every
   part from the protection of God, as Moses reproves them when speaking
   of the molten calf: Behold, says he, this day you are naked; that is,
   because they had hurled themselves into destruction. (Exodus 32:25.) So
   the Prophet says that these traitors did not run up to restore the
   hedge when the house of Israel was exposed to robbers, thieves, and
   wild beasts, because it was no longer protected by the hand of God.
   What follows has the same object, that they should stand in the battle
   in the day of the Lord; that is, to oppose themselves to God's
   vengeance. This relates to prayers, when mention is made of Phinehas,
   in Psalm 106:30, and also in the same psalm, Psalm 106:23, where it is
   said of Moses, Unless Moses had stood in the breach to turn away God's
   wrath. Here also, as I have said, the Prophet looks rather to doctrine.
   For here he sharply rebukes the folly of false prophets who had
   promised wonderful things. Now, when God approached in earnest, all
   their prophecies vanished: he says, therefore, they stood not in the
   battle in the day of Jehovah; for, if they had diligently exhorted the
   people to repentance, those sinners had reconciled God to themselves:
   for we turn aside his judgment beforehand when we turn to him in time,
   as Paul teaches. (1 Corinthians 11:31.) If, therefore, the people had
   been thus diligently advised, they had stood in the battle; that is,
   their teaching would have been a bulwark against the breaking out of
   God's wrath to destroy them utterly. Now, therefore, we see the meaning
   of Ezekiel, namely, to show how the fallacies of the false prophets
   could be perceived, since by their blandishments and flatteries they
   destroyed the people,. Now it follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] Or, "breaks." -- Calvin.

   [4] CEeolampadius takes a different view: he says, "principibus et
   prophetis juxta quadrat: eorum est animam ponere pro ovibus contra
   pseudoprophets." he then quotes John 10, "Vident lupum venientem et
   fugiunt." The remainder of his comment on this verse is worthy of
   perusal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 13:6

   6. They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith:
   and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that
   they would confirm the word.

   6. Viderunt vanitatem, divinarunt mendacium, dicentes, dicit Iehovah,
   et non misit eos Iehovah: et sperare fecerunt [5] ad stabihendum
   sermonem.


   Here again he pronounces generally that those false prophets were vain,
   and this assertion depends upon the principle that they had spoken from
   their own heart or spirit, for nothing false or vain can proceed from
   God. It follows, therefore, that they are here condemned of vanity and
   lying, because they dared falsely to use the name of God when they
   uttered nothing but their own dreams. He now confirms what we saw in
   the last verse, when he says, they hoped to establish their word. Hence
   they puffed up the people with vain hope, when they said that God would
   not be so severe as to exact continual punishment of the holy and elect
   nation. True prophets also often recall sinners to the mercy of God,
   and magnify it so, that those who wrestle with despair may not doubt
   God's long-suffering, since he is said to be slow to anger, and
   inclined to reconciliation; and his pity endures for a life, while his
   anger passes away in a moment. (Numbers 14:18; Psalm 103:8, and Psalm
   30:5.) True prophets indeed act thus; but they join two members which
   must not be separated, otherwise God himself would be, as it were,
   dissipated. [6] Hence, when true prophets exhort sinners to hope and
   predict God's freeness to pardon, they likewise discourse about
   penitence; they do not indulge sinners, but rouse them, nay, wound them
   sharply with a sense of God's anger, so as in some way to stir them up,
   since God's mercy is set before us for that end, that by it we may seek
   life. Hence we must be dead in ourselves; but false prophets sever
   between the two, and divide God, as it were, in half, since they speak
   only of his freeness to forgive, and declare his clemency to be set
   before all, while they are profoundly silent about repentance. Now,
   therefore, we see why the Prophet here reproves these traitors [7] who
   abused the name of God, since they made the people to hope. Without
   hope, indeed, the sinner could not be animated to seek God: but they
   promised peace, as he will say directly, when there was no peace.
   Therefore let us proceed with the exposition.

   Ezekiel 13:7

   7. Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
   divination, whereas you say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not
   spoken?

   7. An non visionem vanitatis vidistis? et divinationem mendacii locuti
   estis? Et loquentes [8] dicit Iehovah: ego non fueram locutus?


   Here God shows why he had formerly pronounced that they brought forward
   nothing but vanity and falsehood, namely, because they used his name
   falsely, and out of light created darkness; for by the feint of
   speaking in God's name, they darkened men's minds. That sacred name is,
   as it were, a fount of splendor, so as far to surpass the light of the
   sun; nay, whatever light exists, is made apparent and refulgent by it.
   But, as I have said, the servants of Satan turn light, into darkness,
   because they audaciously boast that God has said so. This passage and
   similar ones show us how diligently we ought to guard against Satan's
   fallacies. This is their astounding boldness to bring forward God's
   name while they so wantonly trifle with his judgments. For to boast
   that God has spoken is as if we wished, by impious profanation,
   purposely to draw him into a dispute. For how can God bear us to turn
   his truth into lie? But there have been impostors in all ages who have
   thus thoughtlessly flown in the face of God. We are not surprised at
   the heathen doing so; but in the chosen people, it was certainly an
   incredible prodigy and an intolerable disgrace, when they had access to
   all heavenly doctrine for the guidance of their conduct, and when God
   was daily calling forth prophets, as he had promised by Moses, to see
   these impious dogs who barked so, and you pretended so proudly to speak
   in God's name. (Deuteronomy 18:15-18.) Admonished, then, by this
   caution, let us be on our guard when we see Satan's servants endued
   with such arrogance. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] Verbally, that is, "by saying." -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 13:8-9

   8. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and
   seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.

   8. Propterea sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, eo quod locuti estis
   vanitatem, et vidistis mendacium, [9] propterea ecce ego contra eos,
   dicit Dominator Iehovah.

   9. And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that
   divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither
   shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither
   shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am
   the Lord GOD.

   9. Et erit manus mea contra prophetas qui vident vanitatem, et qui
   divinant mendacium: in consilio populi mei non erunt, et in scriptura
   [10] domus Israel non scribentur: et ad terram Israel non redibunt: et
   cognoscitis quod ego Dominator Iehovah.


   Here at length he begins to pronounce judgment against the false
   prophets. Hitherto, under the form of a complaint, he shows how
   wickedly they had corrupted and profaned his sacred name: then how
   impiously they had rendered prophecies contemptible by their lies, and
   how cruel they were to the people whose safety ought to be their first
   care, and how they drew on the miserable to destruction. For after God
   has so narrated their sins, he now denounces punishment; and, first,
   generally he says that he was their adversary. This clause is by no
   means superfluous, since such carelessness would not have besotted the
   impious, unless they thought themselves free from all dealings with
   God; hence they utterly reject all fear and sin with freedom. But this
   could not happen, unless they determined that God either sleeps, or
   does not behold human affairs or trifles as they do. Since, therefore,
   false prophets very licentiously corrupt God's word, when they pretend
   it to be a pleasant sport; God, on the other hand, pronounces Himself
   their adversary; as if he said, your contest shall not be with men, but
   I will be the avenger of so wicked a profanation of my name.

   Besides, he afterwards points out the punishment; my hand, says he,
   shall be against the prophets. For although God threatens to become an
   adversary to the reprobate, yet this is not sufficient to terrify them,
   they are so stupid. But it is necessary to use another stimulus,
   namely, that God should display his power. This is the reason why he
   now adds, his hand should be against the false prophets. The hand is
   sometimes taken for a blow: but because God sees the impious torpid
   amidst their sins, he says that he would not only be their enemy and an
   avenger of his glory, but he brings forward his own hand into the
   midst. It follows, they shall not be in the counsel of my people. Some
   explain the noun svd, sod, more subtlety than they need for that
   experience of God which is offered to the elect for their salvation.
   But this explanation is forced, for they are deceived in thinking that
   the Prophet's meaning is different in the second clause, where he adds,
   they shall not be written in the list of the house of Israel: he
   repeats the same thing in different words: in the first place he had
   said, they should not be in the secret of the people: for svd, sod,
   signifies a secret, but it is taken for counsel: they shall not be
   therefore in the assembly of the people: afterwards he adds, they shall
   not be in the catalogue of the house of Israel. He mentions a
   catalogue, because judges and others elected to any office were written
   in a list. We see, therefore, what the Prophet intends -- for I am
   compelled to break off here -- namely, that those impostors who wished
   to enjoy the prophetic title, were altogether without the Church, since
   God had cast them off.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since we are so torpid in our vices that
   excitements are daily necessary to rouse us up, first, that our
   destined pastors may faithfully call us to repentance; then, that we in
   our turn may be so attentive to their exhortations, and so suffer
   ourselves to be condemned, that we may be our own judges: Grant also,
   that when you chastise us severely, the taste of thy paternal goodness
   may never be so lost to us, so that a way may always be open to us to
   seek reconciliation in Jesus Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Thirty-Fifth.

   We explained yesterday what the Prophet meant when he pronounces that
   the impostors who deceived the people should not be in the counsel of
   the pious nor in their catalogue, and we said that this was twice
   repeated. Now the question arises, did the Prophet speak of the secret
   election of God, or only of an external state? For although these
   traitors were at the greatest distance from the Church, yet we know
   that they boasted in a common title like Ishmael, who, until he was
   cast out of his father's house, proudly boasted in his right of birth.
   (Genesis 21:9.) And at this day, we see how the Papists claim to
   themselves the name of "the Church," since they pretend to the
   perpetual succession: and truly we are compelled to confess that the
   ordinary ministry is with them. But because they have tyrannically
   abused their power, and have altogether overthrown that method of
   governing the Church which the Lord had appointed, we may safely laugh
   at their boastings. [11] There was the same haughtiness in the false
   prophets of old, who asserted that they held no mean rank among the
   people, because they were created prophets by God. Hence, therefore, we
   gather that these words are not used of any external state, because a
   place among the elect people was always conceded to them. Without
   doubt, then, we must understand the contrast between the true members
   of the Church and hypocrites, who pretend to the name of God. And for
   this reason it is said in Psalm 15:2, as well as Psalm 24:4, that not
   all who go up to the mount of God have a perpetual seat there, unless
   they are pure in heart and hand. The sum of the whole then is, although
   false prophets thunder forth their boasts with inflated cheeks, and
   claim the prophetic name, yet they thought not to be reckoned in that
   rank, as they are altogether without the elect people.

   But a second question arises out of this. If the Prophet denies their
   right to be included in the council of the pious, he ought not to speak
   in the future tense: because as God's election is eternal, so his sons
   were written in the book of life before the creation of the world. But
   he says they shall not be written, and this seems absurd. But Ezekiel
   here [3]accommodates his language to the usual custom of mankind. The
   language of the psalm is harsher: let them be blotted from the book of
   life, since they are not written among the just. (Psalm 69:28.) For it
   cannot happen that he who is once written in the book of life can ever
   be blotted out. But in the second clause the Prophet explains himself
   -- that they be not written with the just; that is, that they be not
   written in the catalogue of the just. So also Ezekiel now says: they
   shall not be in the secret of my people, and they shall not be written
   in the writing of the house of Israel: because for a time they seemed
   to be in the number of the pious: hence a change of expression is here
   used, but only in accommodation to the rudeness of our mind.

   This passage is useful in this sense. The Holy Spirit admonishes us
   that it is not sufficient to suppose men members of the Church because
   the greater number seem to excel others, just as the chaff is above the
   wheat and suffocates it: thus hypocrites bury the sons of God whose
   number is small, while they shine forth in their own splendor, and
   their multitude makes them seem exclusively worthy of the title of the
   Church. Hence let us learn to examine ourselves, and to search whether
   those interior marks by which God distinguishes his children from
   strangers belong to us, viz., the living root of piety and faith. This
   passage also teaches that nothing is more formidable than to be
   rejected from God's flock. For no safety is to be hoped for, except as
   God collects us into one body under one head. First, all safety resides
   in Christ alone; and then we cannot be separated from Christ without
   falling away from all hope of safety: but Christ will not and cannot be
   torn from his Church with which he is joined in all indissoluble knot,
   as the head to the body. Hence, unless we cultivate unity with the
   faithful, we see that we are cut off from Christ: hence I said that
   nothing was more to be feared than that separation of which mention is
   here made. On the other hand, it is said in Psalm 106:4, Remember me, O
   God, in thy good will towards thy people: visit me with thy salvation.
   When the author of the Psalm prays in this way, he at the same time
   acknowledges that our true and solid happiness is placed in the Lord's
   embracing us with the rest of the faithful. For God's good will towards
   his people is that fatherly kindness by which he embraces his own
   elect. If, therefore, God thinks us worthy of that fatherly favor, then
   we have a sure confidence of safety.

   Afterwards he adds, And they shall not return to the land of Israel:
   and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. Ezekiel here places an outward
   mark as the sign of reprobation, since, while a free return was
   permitted to others, these were excluded. Hence Ezekiel signifies that
   God's anger would be manifest in the case of false prophets by their
   exclusion from the benefits common to the people. For when God shall
   open the door, and promulgate an edict concerning a free return: they
   shall remain exiles, and shall never enjoy that native country to which
   they boasted that they should in a short time return. He confirms then
   by an outward symbol what he has already said about reprobation. For
   although many died in exile who were real members of the Church, as
   Daniel and his allies, and many others, yet., as far as these deceivers
   were concerned, it was a sure sign of their rejection that they boasted
   of their speedy return to their country. Since, therefore, they were
   deprived of that advantage, God openly shows that they were unworthy of
   being reckoned among the elect people. It follows --

   Ezekiel 13:10-11

   10. Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace;
   and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed
   it with untempered, morter:

   10. Propterea et propterea [12] quod deceperunt populum meum dicendo,
   pax et non erat pax: et ipse aedificavit parietem, et ecce ipsi
   leverunt ipsum insipido.

   11. Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall
   fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones,
   shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.

   11. Dic ad linentes insipido, cadet: [13] erit pluvia vel imber
   inundans: et dabo lapides grandinis, [14] et spiritus turbinum vel
   tempestatum scindet vel disrumpet


   Here Ezekiel pursues the same metaphor which he had used with a very
   slight difference, for there is such an agreement that the connection
   is apparent between the former and the present sentence. He had said
   that the false prophets did not go up to the breaches, and did not
   restore the hedges of the house of Israel: we have explained these
   words thus -- teachers who discharge their duties honestly and
   sincerely are like builders, who, if they see a breach in a wall,
   instantly and carefully repair it: they are like gardeners who do not
   allow either a field or a vineyard to be exposed to wild beasts. As,
   then, he had formerly said that these false prophets did not go up to
   the breach through their not being affected by the dispersion of the
   people, but knowingly and willingly betrayed the people's safety
   through open and gross perfidy; so also he now says, that they built a
   wall indeed, but without mortar. The word tphl, thephel, "untempered,"
   is variously explained, but I doubt not the Prophet meant sand without
   lime. Jerome thinks it to be mortar without chaff; but my view is
   better, namely, that they built only in appearance; and in this the
   image which the Prophet now uses differs from the preceding one. He had
   said before, they did not go up to the breach; he now grants them more
   -- that they really built; but it is easy to reconcile the two
   assertions: since they did not go up to the breach to provide safety
   for the people; and yet they feigned themselves anxious, and seemed as
   if they wished to restore the ruins. But while the Prophet merely
   grants their intention, he adds that they were bad builders, just as if
   any one should heap together a quantity of sand, and moisten it with
   water, yet it would profit him nothing; for the sand disperses by
   itself, and grows solid by lime alone, and thus becomes cement.
   Therefore the Prophet means that those impostors accomplish nothing
   seriously; and when they show great anxiety and care, that is in vain,
   because they only heap up sand and dust when they ought to temper the
   mortar with sand and lime. We understand then how these two places
   mutually agree: because, even because they have deceived my people:
   this is without a figure. Now he adds figuratively, they have built up
   a wall, but they have daubed it only with untempered mortar, that is,
   sand.

   The kind of fallacies are now mentioned: because they said, Peace, when
   there was no peace. We yesterday reminded you that impostors have
   something in common with God's true servants, just as Satan transforms
   himself into an angel of light. (2 Corinthians 11:14.) We know that all
   the prophets were always messengers of peace: now this agrees chiefly
   with the good news, How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the
   gospel of peace. (Isaiah 52:7; Romans 10:15.) Whenever God commends his
   own word, he adds its character of peace. For when he is justly at
   enmity with us, there is one way of reconciliation and remission of
   sin. This springs from the preaching of the gospel. The prophets
   formerly discharged this duty; and when these impostors strove to
   deceive the people, they stripped off their masks and deceived the
   simple through the difficulty of discerning between themselves and the
   true servants of God. And yet, as we said yesterday, no one could be
   deceived except through their own fault. For God, indeed, offers us
   peace, and invites us to reconciliation by his own prophets; but on
   this condition, that we make war with our own lusts. This, then, is one
   way of being at peace with God by becoming enemies to ourselves, and
   fighting earnestly against the depraved and vicious desires of the
   flesh. But how do false prophets preach peace? Why! so that miserable
   and abandoned men may sleep in the midst of their sins. We must
   diligently attend, then, to this difference, that we may safely embrace
   the peace which is offered us by true prophets, and be on our guard
   against the snares of those who fallaciously flatter us with peace,
   because under promise of reconciliation they foment hostilities between
   God and ourselves.

   How, then, can it happen that we can be at rest while God is opposed to
   us? Thou shalt say, therefore, to those who daub with untempered
   mortar, it shall fall. Here the Spirit signifies that the false
   prophets should be subject to the greatest ridicule, when they shall be
   convicted by the event, and their is shall be proved by clear proof.
   Hence, also, we may gather the utility of the doctrine which Paul
   teaches, that we must stand bravely when God gives the reins to
   impostors to disturb or disperse the Church. They shall not proceed any
   further, says he. (2 Timothy 3:9.) He says elsewhere in the same
   epistle, (2 Timothy 3:13,) They shall wax worse and worse; that is, as
   far as God pleases to be patient with them. But meanwhile the end is at
   hand, when the Lord shall shame all the impious false prophets, and
   detect their ignorance, rashness, and audacity, because they dared to
   use his name in offering peace to the reprobate. Thou shalt say,
   therefore, the wall shall fall. He speaks here of doctrine. There shall
   be an overflowing shower, says he -- a desolating rain. Here the Spirit
   signifies that there shall be a violent concussion which shall disperse
   all the artifices of the false prophets, and detect their frauds, when
   the Lord should bring on the Chaldaeans, and deliver the city to them.
   Hence the same meaning is intended by the shower, by stones, by the
   rush of a whirlwind, but it was necessary to express the same thing in
   many ways, because the Israelites had grown torpid through their
   fallacies, and willingly seized upon what the false prophets said --
   that God would be propitious to them. After he had mentioned the
   shower, he goes on to hailstones. The more probable reading is, Ye, O
   great hailstones, shall fall; unless perhaps it is better to take the
   verb tphlnh, thephelneh, transitively, as I am inclined to do, ye shall
   make fall. This apostrophe is emphatic, because God addresses the
   stones themselves, and thereby obliquely reproves the sloth of those
   who thought to escape in safety through their blandishments. When God,
   therefore, addresses the stones, he doubtless reproaches the Israelites
   for hardening themselves so completely. He adds the violence of
   whirlwinds, or of tempests, in the same sense. The violence of the
   whirlwinds, then, shall break down or overthrow the wall. In
   conclusion, Ezekiel teaches that the doctrine of the false prophets had
   no need of any other refutation, that the arrival of the Chaldaeans,
   and their boasting, is like a storm and whirlwind to devastate the
   whole land: and thus he derides those praters who used their tongues so
   audaciously: he says that those strangers should come to refute these
   lies, not by words only, but by a violent attack. It follows --

   [12] The repetition is emphatic. -- Calvin.

   [13] The copula is superfluous. -- Calvin.

   [14] Others translate "and you hailstones shall fall;" others take it

   "they shall fall," or "cause to fall." -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 13:12

   12. Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where
   is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?

   12. Et ecce cadet paries, [15] annon dicetur ad vos, ubi litura [16]
   quam levistis.


   He confirms the last sentence, namely, that the false prophets would be
   a laughing-stock to all when their prophecies and divinations came to
   nothing, for the event would show them to be liars. For when the city
   was taken it sufficiently appeared that they were the devil's ministers
   of deceit, for they were trained in wickedness and boldness when they
   put forth the name of God. Now the Prophet teaches that a common
   proverb would arise when the wall fell; for by saying, shall it not be
   said to them, he signifies that their folly and vanity would be
   completely exposed, so that this proverb should be everywhere current
   -- where is the daubing with which you daubed it? It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [15] That is, "when the wall shall have fallen:" we must understand the
   adverb "when." -- Calvin.

   to be litio; but although good Latin authors do not use the word litura
   here for "daubing," yet we express it ubi litura. -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 13:13

   13. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy
   wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine
   anger, and great hailstones in my fury, to consume it

   13. Propterea sic dicit Dominator Iehovah. Cadere faciam [17] spiritum
   tempestatum in ira mea: et imbre inundans in ira mea: et erit imber
   inundans in ira mea, [18] et lapides grandinis in excandescentia ad
   consumptionem.


   He still pursues the same sentiment; but he says he will send forth
   storms and hail, and a whirlwind. He formerly spoke of hail, and
   showers, and violent storms; but he now says, that those winds, storms,
   and showers should be at hand to obey him. We see, therefore, that this
   verse does not differ from the former, unless in God's showing more
   clearly that he would send forth storms, whirlwind, and hail to
   overthrow the empty building which the false prophets had raised. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [17] This is the same word which he had formerly used, but it is here
   taken in another sense: he had formerly said, "And the spirit of
   tempests shall break or cut;" but he now says, "I will make it cut or
   break forth;" so that the sense is clearer -- "therefore I will make it
   break forth." -- Calvin.

   [18] The original words for ira are different. We may translate chmh,
   chemneh, "burning wrath" -- "therefore in my burning wrath I will make
   the whirlwind break forth." -- Calvin
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 13:14

   14. So will I break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered
   morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof
   shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the
   midst thereof: and you shall know that I am the LORD.

   14. Et evertam parietem quem levistis insipido, et projiciam in terram,
   et discooperietur fundamentum ejus, et cadet: et consumemini in medio
   ejus: et cognoscetis quod ego Iehovah.


   This verse ought to be united with the other: God says, I will throw
   down the wall. For the false prophets had acquired so much favor, that
   their boasting was as much esteemed as an oracle. Hence the people were
   persuaded that what even these impostors dreamt was uttered by God.
   Since, therefore, they had so bound men's minds to themselves, the
   Prophet was obliged to inveigh vehemently against those impostures,
   since he would not have succeeded by simple language. This language,
   indeed, may seem superfluous; but if any one considers how greatly
   these miserable exiles were deluded by the false prophets, he will
   easily acknowledge that God does not repeat the same thing so often in
   vain: as in this place he brings forward nothing new; but he so
   inculcates what we have already seen as to confirm it. I will pull
   down, therefore, the wall which you have daubed with untempered mortar,
   and I will lay it low on the ground, and its foundation shall be
   uncovered, or discovered. Here the Prophet signifies that God would so
   lay bare the fallacies of those who had deceived the people with vain
   hopes, that no disguise should remain for them, but their disgrace
   should be plain to every one. Now, such was the shamelessness of these
   impostors, that if they were convicted on one point, yet they did not
   desist on that account, but took credit to themselves if anything
   turned out more fortunately than they could expect, [19] as if they had
   not prophesied in vain, while a single thing came true. Since,
   therefore, the impious so turned their backs when God detected their
   folly, the Prophet adds, that the false prophets would have nothing
   left, because God will not only overthrow whatever they seemed to
   build, but he will uncover even the foundations, so that the people may
   understand that there was not a scruple or the least particle of truth
   in them.

   And it shall fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. He had
   just said that it should be ruinously consumed: hailstones, he said,
   should fall to consume it; by which word he understood that the final
   slaughter should be so severe that no hope should be left. For as long
   as Jerusalem stood, the Israelites always look forward to a return. But
   when they saw the kingdom not only weakened, but utterly destroyed, the
   temple overthrown, and the city ruined, whenever they heard of their
   dreadful dispersion, not the slightest remnant of hope survived. Now
   this consumption is transferred to the false prophets. As that
   consumption was final, and without a gleam of hope, ye shall be
   consumed, says he, in the midst of it, and ye shall know that I am
   Jehovah. He does not inculcate this particular so often in vain; but he
   inveighs with indignation against the wicked audacity of the false
   prophets, who dared so petulantly to oppose themselves to the true
   servants of God, and to assume his name, and to trifle with him like
   children. Such is the prodigious madness of mortals who dare to set
   themselves against God: for this reason, he says, they shall at length
   perceive with whom they have to do. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] Calvin's Latin is very cramped here. The French translation
   paraphrases it thus: "Mais ils repliqueront qu'il se pourra bien faire
   qu'il leur sera eschappe quelque chose mal a propos."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 13:15

   15. Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that
   have daubed it with untempered morter; and will say unto you, The wall
   is no more, neither they that daubed it;

   15. Et complebo excandescentiam meam in pariete et linentem ipsum
   insipido: et dicam illis non est paries, et non sunt qui leverunt
   ipsum.


   If the inveterate obstinacy of the people had not been known to us,
   Ezekiel would seem too verbose, since he might have said in a few words
   what he explains at such length. But if we bear in mind the perverse
   and refractory disposition of the people, we shall find that there was
   need of such continual repetition, I will fulfill, says he, my burning
   wrath upon the wall; that is, I will show how detestable and
   destructive to my people was this doctrine. Hence God fined up his
   anger on the wall, when he reduced to nothing all the lies of the false
   prophets: afterwards also he attacked them, since the mark of disgrace
   was attached to their characters, and this rendered their doctrine
   detestable: afterwards, says he, I will say, There is no wall; those
   who daubed it are not. When God speaks thus, he means that he will
   suffer the false prophets to triumph among the people for only a short
   time. For even to the destruction of the city and temple they always
   withstood God's servants with a bold forehead, as if they would thrust
   their horns against God and his announcements. Let us observe, then,
   that while Jerusalem was standing, the appearance of a wall existed;
   for there was the prop of false doctrine, and the people fed willingly
   on such deceits. Their daubing, therefore, stood till it vanished with
   the ruin of the city, and then their vanity was proved, for God took
   vengeance on these insolent triflers. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 13:16

   16. To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem,
   and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, says the
   Lord GOD.

   16. Prophetae Israel prophetarunt de Hierusalem, et viderunt ei
   visionem pacis, et non est pax, dicit Dominator Iehovah.


   He now concludes this discourse, and shows what he had hitherto
   intended by a building badly cemented, by using sand without lime. The
   prophets of Israel prophesied concerning Jerusalem. Here he does not
   mean false prophets, with whom Jeremiah was continually contending, but
   those who in exile still hardened the wretched. While they thought to
   make use of the occasion, and so to humble the people who had been so
   grievously wounded by the hand of God, they stirred them up to pride,
   as we have formerly seen. Our Prophet was obliged to strive with them
   for the comfort of his exiles, for he was peculiarly sent to the
   captives, as we have said, although the advantage of his prophecies
   also reached Jerusalem. The prophets, those of Israel, that is, the ten
   tribes dispersed in different directions, prophesied concerning
   Jerusalem. Why then did they not rather predict a happy result? For
   they were reduced to extremes, and meanwhile promised victory to the
   Jews. And they saw a vision, for it, says he. This clause seems opposed
   to another, in which the Prophet says that they saw nothing. How, then,
   do these two things agree -- to see a vision, and yet to see nothing'?
   What he now says as to seeing a vision refers to their false boasting.
   For they were altogether without the Spirit of God, nor did they
   possess any revelation. Yet when they boasted themselves to be endowed
   with the Spirit, and many had faith in their words, the Prophet
   concedes to them the name of a vision, although there was none, by
   accommodation. He says, therefore, that they saw a vision, that is,
   that they boasted in one since they professed to be spiritual. As at
   this time the Papists deny that they utter anything out of their own
   minds, and say that they have all those fictions, by which they
   adulterate all piety, from the Holy Spirit; so these prophets said they
   were spiritual: and as far as the title is concerned, the Prophet
   grants what in reality he disallows when he adds, there was no peace
   when they said there was peace. Hence it appears that a vision was in
   their mouth united with sacrilegious boldness: yet there was no vision;
   because, if God had manifested anything by his Spirit, he would really
   have proved it as he says by Moses. (Deuteronomy 18:22.) Since, then,
   there was no peace, but the final overthrow of the city was at hand, it
   is easily collected that they saw nothing, but made false use of that
   sacred name of vision to acquire confidence for themselves. As to his
   saying there is no peace, it extends to the future. They promised peace
   by saying that the siege of the city was to be raised, and prosperity
   to await the Jews. But God, on the other hand, pronounces there should
   be no peace, because it will shortly be evident that Jerusalem is
   devoted to utter destruction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since we do not cease to provoke thee by our sins,
   that we may at length consider our wretched condition, unless you
   govern us by thy Spirit, and subject us to thyself in true obedience:
   and may we so desire to be reconciled to thee, that we may not flatter
   ourselves, but being altogether humbled and emptied of self, may we fly
   to thy mercy with a true feeling of piety: and so find what is prepared
   for us in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   Ezekiel 13:17-18

   17. Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of
   thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou
   against them,

   17. Et tu fliesi hominis, pone faciem tuam contra filias populi tui,
   quae prophetant ex corde suo: et propheta contra eas.

   18. And say, Thus saith, the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew
   pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every
   stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye
   save the souls alive that come unto you?

   18. Et dices, sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, Vae consuentibus pulvillos
   super omnes cubitos manus, et facientibus pepla [20] super caput omnis
   staturae ad venandum animas: in animas venabimini a populo meo, [21] et
   animas quae vobis sunt [22] vivificabitis.


   WE may gather from this passage that Satan's lies were not spread among
   the people so much by men as by women. We know that the gift of
   prophecy is sometimes though rarely allowed to women, and there is no
   doubt that female prophets existed whenever God wished to brand men
   with a mark of ignominy as strongly as possible. I say as much as
   possible, because the sister of Moses enjoyed the prophetic gift, and
   this never ceased to the reproach of her brother. (Exodus 15:20.) But
   when Deborah and Huldah discharged the prophetic office, (Judges 4:4,
   and 2 Kings 22:14,) God doubtless wished to raise them on high to shame
   the men, and obliquely to show them their slothfulness. Whatever may be
   the reason, women have sometimes enjoyed the prophetic gift. And this
   is the meaning of Joel's second chapter, (Joel 2:28,)Your sons shall
   see visions and your daughters shall prophesy. There is no doubt that
   the Spirit transfers to the kingdom of Christ what had been customary
   among the ancient people. For we know that Christ's kingdom is
   described, or rather depicted, under the image of that government which
   God formerly held under the law. Since, then, certain women were gifted
   with the prophetic spirit, Satan, according to his custom, abused this
   under a false pretense. We know that he always emulates God and
   transforms himself into an angel of light, because if he were to show
   himself openly, all would instantly flee from him: hence he uses God's
   name deceptively, to ingratiate himself among the simple and
   incautious. And he not only sends forth false prophets to scatter
   abroad their lies and impostures, but he turns even females to the same
   injurious use.

   Here we see how anxiously we ought to guard against any corruption
   which may creep in to contaminate the pure gifts of God. But this
   contest seems not to have been sufficiently honorable to the servant of
   God; for it was almost a matter of shame when they engaged with women.
   We know that those who desire praise for their bravery do not willingly
   engage with unequal antagonists who have no strength to resist; since
   there is no praise in a victory when it is too easy: so also Ezekiel
   could put away from him this undertaking, since it was unworthy of the
   prophetic office. Hence it appears, that God's servants cannot
   faithfully discharge the duties assigned to them, unless they strive to
   remove all impediments. This then is the condition of all those to whom
   God assigns the office of teaching, that they may oppose all false
   doctrines and errors, and never consider or wish for great praise from
   their victory: it should suffice them to assert God's truth against all
   Satan's devices. Thus we see Paul strove with a workman (Demetrius),
   (Acts 19:24,) and that was all but ridiculous: and truly he might seem
   not sufficiently to regard his dignity; for from the time when he saw
   secret things which it was not lawful for him to utter, and was carried
   up to the third heaven, (2 Corinthians 12:4,) when he engages in a
   contest with a craftsman, he seems to forget that dignity to which God
   had raised him. But we must remember the reason which I have mentioned,
   that as the duty of teaching is assigned to God's servants, so they are
   appointed as his avengers and defenders of the doctrine of which they
   are heralds. Hence if, so to speak, fleas were to come out of the earth
   and rail at sound doctrine, none who are influenced by a desire of
   edification will hesitate to contend even with those fleas. Thus the
   Prophet's modesty is conspicuous, because by God's command he turns to
   these weak women to refute even them.

   It is said, then, woe to those who sew pillows or cushions; it is the
   same thing -- to all armholes, and to those who make covers for the
   head of every stature. There is no doubt that by these tricks they
   deluded the minds and eyes of the simple. It is evident from the law
   that some ceremonies are useful, since God commands nothing
   superfluous; but Satan by his cunning turns everything useful to man's
   destruction. Meanwhile we must remark that false prophets were always
   immoderately fond of outward signs; for since they have nothing
   substantial to offer, they have need of ostentation to dazzle all eyes.
   This then is the reason why men and women who intend to deceive, always
   heap together a number of ceremonies. Hence Ezekiel says, that those
   women had sown together pillows, and he adds, for all armholes. Whence
   it appears that they laid them under the armpits of those by whom they
   were consulted, although he afterwards seems to hint that they
   themselves reclined upon these pillows. But now he is treating of the
   people. The ancients were accustomed when they reclined at table to
   have cushions under their arms, though this is not our habit. But there
   is no doubt that they wished to represent a kind of sleep, like the
   foolish who consult oracles, and think themselves in ecstasies, and
   snatched away beyond all thoughts of this world. Then they had veils or
   coverings which they put over their heads. In this way imposture
   flourished with the Roman augurs; for they veiled their head when they
   wished to begin their incantations. Livy says, that the augur stood at
   the threshold with his head covered, and uttered these words, "O
   Jupiter, hear;" [23] so that it is probable that veils covered the
   heads of those who wished to consult God, that they might be as it were
   separated from the world, and no longer look upon human things, but
   have only spiritual eyesight. With this view these women used such
   ceremonies that wretched men thought themselves caught up above the
   world, and all earthly thoughts being laid aside, they dozed so as to
   receive the oracles, and at the same time had the head covered to avoid
   everything which might call them off and distract them, and to be
   wholly intent on spiritual meditations.

   As to his saying, upon all arms, and upon the head of every stature. I
   doubt not that the Prophet teaches by these words that these women
   exercised a promiscuous trade, making no distinctions, but, gratifying
   all without choice, so long as they brought their money in their hands,
   as we shall by and by see. Hence this mark of universality ought to be
   noticed emphatically, because these women did not attend to the
   disposition with which persons came, but only grasped at their reward,
   and thus the gate was as open to all as that of the market-place. For
   shops are open to all, since all are expected to promote profit and
   make bargains, and merchants by their allurements entice as many as
   they can to purchase their goods. So also veils were provided for all
   heads and cushions for all arms, for there was no difference except in
   reference to profit from these profane and base transactions. With
   regard to the word "stature," the opinion of those who think it used,
   because the women ordered those who consulted the oracles to stand,
   appears to me forced, and not in accordance with the Prophet's
   intention. I have no doubt that, the Prophet uses the word for "age,"
   or person, as others correctly interpret it; as if he had said, that
   they made no difference between old and young, tall and short, but
   prostituted their answers to all from whom they looked for gain.

   It afterwards follows, Is it not to hunt souls? Here God reproves one
   crime, but he will shortly add another, namely, the profanation of his
   sacred name. But he here speaks only of the death of souls, as if he
   said that the women laid those snares to deceive wretched souls. And
   because Ezekiel was commanded to, prophesy against them, he here
   addresses them more vehemently -- Will ye hunt the souls of my people?
   It is literally the souls which belong to my people; but it will be
   more simple to receive it thus -- will ye hunt the souls of my people,
   and will ye give life to your own souls, unless any one wishes to
   interpret it so as to make the Prophet repeat the same thing twice. For
   the souls of the people were also their own. For as we shall afterwards
   see, no one is deceived by the devil unless he offers himself of his
   own accord, and entangles himself in his snares on purpose. Since then
   it is always true that wretched men who catch at vain oracles devote
   themselves to the devil and his ministers, hence the passage may be
   explained in this way. But the sense which I have proposed is more
   simple, namely, that these women must not be yielded to because they
   have hunted the souls of the people; as if the Prophet had said, the
   people are precious to God, who has undertaken the care of them. Thus
   then he reasons; such is your audacity, nay, even fury, that you doubt
   not to seize upon God's people: since therefore your impiety is so
   licentious and bold, will God suffer you to rage with impunity against
   the souls of which he is the guardian? Lastly, he signifies that
   punishment is prepared for the women who ensnare God's people, because
   although those who are deceived are worthy of death, yet God will still
   exact punishment of Satan's ministers who have endeavored to despoil
   him of his rights. It, follows --

   Ezekiel 13:19

   19. And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and
   for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save
   the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that
   hear your lies?

   19. Et profanastis me erga populum meum in pugillis hordeorum [24]
   propter frusta [25] panis: ut occidaris animas quae non moriebantur, et
   ad vivificandum animas quae non vivebant, decipiendo populum meum
   audientes mendacium. [26]


   Here God accuses these women of a double crime; one crime was that
   which I have mentioned, cruelly to destroy the souls which were sacred
   to God, and hence were destined to be saved; but he added a more
   atrocious crime -- that of sacrilege, because they had abused the name
   of God to deceive. Nothing is less tolerable than when [4]God's truth
   is turned into a lie, because this is like reducing him to nothing. God
   is truth; if, therefore, that is abolished, what else will remain
   behind? God will be, as it were, a dead specter. Hence the Prophet, in
   God's name, complains of both: ye have profaned me, says he, before my
   people. For as the gift of prophecy was a rare and remarkable pledge of
   God's love and paternal anxiety towards the Israelites, so when that
   gift was corrupted, the name of God was at the same time polluted. For
   God was never willing to be disjoined from his word, because he is
   himself invisible, and never appears otherwise than in a mirror. Hence
   God's glory, and sanctity, and justice, and goodness, and power, ought
   to shine in the gift of prophecy; but when that gift is contaminated,
   we see how such a disgrace becomes a reproach against God. In this way
   his holiness is defiled, his justice, virtue, and fidelity, are
   corrupted, and his very existence called in question. So it is not
   without cause that God pronounces his own name to be polluted. Then he
   adds, among the people. And this circumstance increases the crime,
   since God's name was profaned where he wished it to be peculiarly
   worshipped; for it was also profaned among the Gentiles: but since God
   had never made himself known there, their profanation was the less
   detestable. But, because God erected his throne among the people of
   Israel, and wished his glory to shine there, we see how sacrilege
   increases, while his name is profaned in that sanctuary which he had
   chosen. This is one crime.

   But he also adds, on account of handfuls of barley and pieces of bread.
   Here God shows how much and how basely he was despised by those
   females, who sold their prophecies for a piece of bread or a few grains
   of barley which any one could hold in his hand. If they had demanded a
   great reward, their insatiable avarice would not have extenuated their
   crime; but their impiety is the rather discovered, when on account of a
   small reward they so prostituted themselves and the name of God. They
   boasted themselves to be the organs of the Holy Spirit: but when by
   this mask they deceived the people, injustice was done to the Holy
   Spirit, since for so paltry a reward they vainly boasted in their
   prophecies. They prostituted even God himself: and in fine, this was
   just as if; being corrupted by a small bribe of no value, they did not
   treat God's name with sufficient respect to be withheld from the crime
   by the slightest of the recompense. A comparison will make the matter
   clearer. If a person is tempted by a moderate reward to the
   perpetration of any crime and refuses, and then when he is offered a
   far more valuable reward, and thus yields to the temptation, this shows
   that his will was upright, though not sufficiently firm. But if any
   one, for a single farthing, undertakes to do what he is ordered, and
   refuses no crime, this shows his readiness to all sorts of wickedness.
   If a girl rejects bribes when she knows her modesty to be assailed, but
   yet yields for a large reward, here, as I have said, virtue struggles
   with vice; but if she prostitutes herself for a morsel of bread, here
   she manifests that depravity which all abominate. This, then, is God's
   intention, when he says that these women traded in their lies for
   handfuls of barley and pieces of bread. If any one objects that
   prophecies were anciently saleable, since it was customary with the
   people to offer the prophets rewards, I answer, that the women are not
   condemned merely for receiving either the handful of barley or the
   piece of bread, but because they did not hesitate to corrupt God's
   truth for a trifling gain, and then to turn it into a lie. The Prophet
   afterwards points out the nature of their deceit, for it would not have
   been sufficient to blame these women generally, unless Ezekiel had
   pointed with his finger at their pestiferous impostures.

   Now, therefore, he says, that they slew the souls which were not dying,
   and kept alive the souls which were not living. We have said before,
   that by this mark the true and righteous servants of God were
   distinguished from impostors. For the servants of God, who faithfully
   discharge the duty enjoined upon them, kill and make alive: for God's
   word is life, and brings health to lost mankind; but is a savor of
   death unto death in those who perish, as Paul says. (2 Corinthians
   2:15, 16.) Hence it is true that prophets who faithfully and properly
   discharge their duty both kill and make alive: but they give life to
   the souls which are to be freed from death, and slay the souls which
   are devoted to destruction; for they denounce eternal death to all
   unbelievers unless they repent; and whatever they bind on earth is also
   bound in heaven. (Matthew 18:18.) Their teaching, therefore, is
   effective for destruction, as also Paul elsewhere teaches. We have at
   hand, says he, vengeance against every high thing which exalts itself
   against Christ, (2 Corinthians 10:5, 6.) Hence honest teachers are
   armed by God's vengeance against all unbelievers who remain obstinate:
   but they convey life to those who repent, since they are messengers of
   reconciliation; nay, they reconcile men to God when they offer Christ
   to them as our peace, and by whom the Father is propitious to us.
   (Ephesians 2:16.) When false prophets desire to rival God's servants,
   they omit the principal part, namely, faith and repentance; hence it
   happens that they proclaim life to souls already adjudged to
   destruction; for they give life to the reprobate who are hardened in
   contempt of God by their flatteries; for they do not require of men
   either faith or penitence, but only a reward. Hence also it happens
   that they slay the souls which ought not to die, namely, because
   nothing is prouder or more cruel than these false prophets. For they
   fulminate according to their pleasure, and sink even to the lowest hell
   the whole world when no hope of profit appears.

   Here then we see the vices of these women of whom Ezekiel treats so
   pointedly out, that no one need be any longer deceived by them except
   through his own fault. Hence also we gather a perpetual rule in
   examining doctrine, lest the deceits of Satan should surprise us for
   the word of God. Let us learn, then, that the prophetic word is
   life-giving to us, if we are dissatisfied with our sins, and fly to
   God's pity with true and serious penitence; for all souls are slain who
   do not receive this kind of life; and whoever compares the papacy with
   that corruption which Ezekiel describes to us, will see that, although
   Satan has many methods of deceiving men, yet they will always be
   discovered like himself. Ezekiel spoke of veils and cushions. We see
   many rites exhibited in the papacy, so that the incredulous, being
   snatched as it were out of the world, are not only delirious, but
   suffer themselves to be drawn in any direction like cattle by the
   grossest impostures. But in their teaching we perceive what Ezekiel
   condemns, namely, that they give life to souls devoted to death, and
   slay souls which thought to be kept alive. For what is the meaning of
   their immense heap of laws, except to bury wretched consciences? For
   any one who wishes to satisfy the laws of the papacy from his heart,
   must cut himself to pieces, so to speak, through his whole life. We now
   perceive with what intent our Prophet will elsewhere say that
   legislators of this kind are implacable, since they remit nothing, and
   exact all their conditions with the utmost rigor. Hence it happens that
   these miserable souls perish, because despair oppresses them and
   overwhelms them in the deep. Meanwhile we see how they give life to
   souls subject to death, since; pardon is prepared for adulterers,
   robbers, manslayers, and all criminals, if they only buy themselves
   off, as popish priests and monks pretend that God is appeased by
   satisfactions and prayers. Hence they thrust expiation's of no value
   upon God; and, to speak more correctly, trifles and follies, which do
   not deceive even children, they call expiation's, as if God could
   change his nature. Hence we must diligently remark this passage, that
   we may know how to distinguish between true and false prophets, and may
   not despise the test which the Prophet puts before us.

   He says, in deceiving my people by listening to a lie. He accuses some
   of lying, and others of willingly embracing is. For the noun kzv,
   kezeb, which is repeated, is derived from the same root. Here, again,
   God undertakes the cause of his people; for though they were all worthy
   of being drawn into exile by Satan, yet when God took care of them, it
   was like snatching them out of Satan's hand, and claiming them as his
   own peculiar people. This is one point. But meantime these wretches are
   deprived of all excuse for seeking false oracles. For the Prophet
   pronounces them deceived because they listened to vanity, that is,
   because they wished to be deceived, since it was entirely their own
   fault, and they could not in any way throw it off. It is true they were
   deceived under false pretenses through the abuse of the prophetic name,
   and hence their vision was obscured by a darkened cloud; but still they
   thought to have gone to the fountain, for no opening would have been
   found for Satan if they had been properly fortified: for God had
   surrounded them with ramparts by giving them a law to protect them from
   all fallacies. Since, then, they thus exposed themselves of their own
   accord, it is not surprising if God allowed them to be deceived.

   Ezekiel 13:20

   20. Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your
   pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will
   tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls
   that ye hunt to make them fly.

   20. Propterea sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, Ecce, ego ad vestros
   pulvillos quibus vos venamini illic animas ad volandum; et lacerabo eos
   desuper brachiis vestris, et eruam animas quas vos venamini, animas ad
   volandum.


   Here Ezekiel begins to threaten those women with what would shortly
   happen, namely, that God would not only render them contemptible, but
   also ridiculous, before the whole people, that their delusions and
   impostures might sufficiently appear. This is the Prophet's intention,
   as we shall afterwards see; but the Prophet is verbose in this
   denunciation. God therefore says, that he is an enemy to those
   cushions, that is, to those false ceremonies which were like cloaks to
   deceive miserable men: hence he says, that those souls were a prey. He
   uses the comparison from hunting: ye have hunted, says he, the souls of
   my people. And this is the meaning of the word used immediately
   afterwards for flying. This word phrch, pherech, signifies also "to
   flourish;" but I here willingly subscribe to the opinion of all who
   interpret it to fly: unless the paraphrast is right in translating it
   "to perish;" for he thought the Prophet was speaking metaphorically, as
   if he meant that those souls were ensnared, and so vanished away. But I
   do not think this quite suitable, since it is more probable that the
   Prophet is speaking of their lofty speculations. For we know that false
   prophets boasted in this artifice, when they either raise, or pretend
   they raise, men's minds aloft, and curious men desire this only; and
   hence it happens that the doctrines of the Law and the Gospel are
   insipid to them, because subtleties alone delight them. And we see at
   this day how many embrace the follies of Dionysius [27] about the
   celestial hierarchy, who treat all the prophets, and even Christ
   himself, as of no value. Hence the Prophet says, that these women
   hunted the souls of the people, because they had snares prepared in
   which they entangled all who were subject to their impostures and
   fallacies. Yet, in my opinion, he also alludes to birds. When,
   therefore, he has said that all impostures were Satan's method of
   hunting souls, he now adds obliquely another simile, that all false
   prophecies are so many allurements to catch birds. The sense of the
   passage now appears clear. Behold, therefore, says he, God will arise
   against your cushions, by which you have hunted birds to make them fly;
   that is, when you promised wonderful revelations those wretched dupes
   whom their own curiosity urged on were deceived by such enticements.
   Afterwards he adds, I will free them from your arms, and I will let go
   the souls which you have hunted to make them fly, says he. He repeats
   again what we have already said about deep speculations, by the
   sweetness of which false prophets are accustomed to entice all fools
   who cannot be content with true doctrine, nor be wise with sobriety.
   Meanwhile it is by no means doubtful that God here speaks peculiarly of
   his elect, who were left among the people. For although they were but
   few, God was unwilling for them to perish: and for this reason he
   announces that he would be their avenger, and undeceive them, whether
   they had been already entrapped, or were just surrounded by these
   allurements. Since, then, he uses the same word, we gather from this
   that the phrase cannot be used indiscriminately. For God suffers many
   to perish, as he says by the Prophet Zechariah, "Let what perishes
   perish," (Zechariah 9:9); but meanwhile he rescued a small number as
   the remnant of his choice, as Paul says. (Romans 11:5.)

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, since you show us that our salvation is so
   precious in thy sight, that through our ingratitude we may not cast
   away this testimony of thy favor, but be anxious to listen to thy
   instructions: Grant also, that being gifted by thee with the spirit of
   discretion, we may not be exposed to capture as a prey; but may we be
   so ruled by the light of thy word that we may hold on in the right way,
   till after our allotted time is finished we may arrive at that happy
   repose which is laid up for us in heaven through Christ our Lord. --

   Ezekiel 13:21

   21. Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your
   hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall
   know that I am the LORD.

   21. Et conscindam pepla vestra, [28] et eruam populum meum e manibus
   vestris: et non erunt amplius in manibus vestris in praedam: et
   cognoscetis quod ego Iehovah.


   What the Prophet had said concerning the pillows he now pronounces of
   the veils, by which they were accustomed to cover either their own
   heads, or those of the persons who consulted them. The conclusion is,
   that God would put an end to such follies. For the people were so
   fascinated by these silly things, that it became necessary to strip
   away these masks, since these women were always ready to deceive. He
   adds also, that he would do that for the benefit of his own people. We
   have said that this ought not to be extended generally to all the sons
   of Abraham according to the flesh. For God suffered almost all to
   perish, as he had said by Isaiah:

   "Even if thy people had been as the sand of the sea-shore, a remnant
   only shall be saved," (Isaiah 10:22.)

   When, therefore, God speaks here concerning his own people, this
   sentence ought to be restricted to the elect: as when it is said in the
   psalm, How soft and kind is God to his people Israel; and then he adds
   by way of correction, to those who are upright in heart, (Psalm 73:1,)
   Since many boasted themselves to be Israelites who are very unlike
   their father, and through being degenerate deprived themselves of that
   honor: hence the Prophet restricts God's goodness peculiarly to the
   elect who are upright in heart, after he had spoken of the whole
   people. Although Ezekiel did not distinctly express what we have cited
   from the psalm, yet the sense is the same; and this is easily gathered
   from the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 11:5,
   6), where God sets before us the remnant preserved according to God's
   gratuitous election. For the same sense it is added, that they should
   no longer be for a prey. We have said how these women hunted these
   wretched souls, not only for purposes of gain, but also because Satan
   abused their fallacies. So, therefore, it happened that these souls
   were enticed to their destruction. For this reason God pronounces that
   they should no longer be their prey. And he repeats what he had already
   said, ye shall know that I am Jehovah. Here God brings before us his
   power, because we know how safely hypocrites allude his sacred name;
   and this easily appears in the boldness and licentiousness of these
   women. Hence God here threatens them: he says that they should feel at
   length who had spoken, since they ridiculed Ezekiel and his other
   servants. There is, then, a silent antithesis between God and the
   prophets; not that God separates himself from his servants; for the
   truth, of which they are ministers and heralds, is an indissoluble bond
   of union between them; but the language is adapted to the senses of
   those with whom the Prophet treats. Now, since these women were so
   wanton, he says that he was not despised by them, but God himself. It
   follows --

   [28] Or, "I will tear." -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 13:22-23

   22. Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom
   I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he
   should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:

   22. Quia contristastis cor justi mendacio, [29] et ego non
   contristaveram ipsum; [30] et roborastis manus impii, ut non
   converteretur a via sua mala, vivificando ipsum.

   23. Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for
   I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am
   the LORD.

   23. Propterea mendacium non videbitis, et divinationem non divinabitis
   amplius: et eruam populum meum e manu vestra: et scietis quod ego
   Iehovah.


   He explains in other words what we saw yesterday: but the repetition
   adds to the weight of the matter. The Prophet therefore shows that he
   had a just cause of complaint, because the women so deceived the
   people. He says now that they made the heart of the righteous sad, and
   strengthened the hands of the wicked: the sentiment is the same, though
   the words are changed. He had previously said that they gave life to
   those devoted to death, and slew those destined to life; but now he
   shows more clearly the meaning of killing the soul that should not, or
   ought not to die, when the heart of the righteous is made sorrowful. By
   the righteous he means those whom the false prophets inspired with
   causeless terror. But why, it is asked, does he say that the righteous
   are grieved, since we have formerly taught that no others were deceived
   unless those who spontaneously throw themselves into the snares and
   traps of Satan? I answer, that the false prophets thundered so, and
   their lies were so spread about here and there as to involve the
   simple: for they scatter their threats so as to reach all men. Hence
   they wound weak consciences; as at this day when the lies of Satan fly
   about; by which true religion is corrupted, many simple ones are
   frightened, for they are destitute of judgment, and do not distinguish
   whether God threatens, or man vaunts himself rashly.

   We see, then, how false prophets cause the righteous sorrow, when they
   suggest scruples, and, under the penalty of mortal sin, denounce first
   one thing and then another: then they deprive them of confidence in
   God's favor, and strike them with various terrors, as we discern
   clearly in the papacy of this very day. Let us take that one point
   which is with them without controversy, that our confidence springs
   from our works, and hence that we cannot determine whether God is
   propitious to us or not., and thus they overthrow all assurance of
   faith. They retain, indeed, the name of faith, but meantime they wish
   wretched consciences to vacillate and be turned about with disquiet,
   since no one can know whether he can invoke God as a father. [31] That
   confidence which Paul says is common to all Christians, they call
   presumption and rashness. (Ephesians 3:12.) We see, then, how that
   point not only grieves the righteous, but disturbs innocent
   consciences: for a series of traditions is afterwards added, and the
   penalty of eternal death is always annexed. hence it happens that those
   who wish to worship God in any other way, when they are thus rendered
   spiritless, know not which way to turn: hence also they lose all fear
   of God, since no one can seriously reverence God unless he who feels
   him to be easily entreated, as we learn from Psalm 130:6.

   We now understand what the Holy Spirit means when he reproves the women
   because they made the heart of the righteous sad. It is added, but I
   was unwilling to grieve them. For God's faithful servants often inspire
   terror, but only when necessary. For they cannot otherwise subdue those
   who exult in their lusts, and they cannot bring them to obedience
   unless they overcome them with fear. Hence even true prophets and
   evangelists cause pain, as Paul says: If I have caused you sorrow, I do
   not repent of it: for so I thought to do: for there is salutary grief.
   (2 Corinthians 7:8.) Besides, true prophets do not afflict men for
   nothing; they only cause anxiety in the minds of those whom God wishes
   to grieve: hence they do not fabricate the material for sorrow and pain
   in their own brain, but receive it from God's mouth and the spirit of
   revelation. Hence the word righteous is used, and falsely is added, by
   which particle the severity which true prophets are often compelled to
   use is distinguished from the roughness, or rather savage rudeness, of
   false prophets. For as I have said, they frighten wretched consciences.
   But by what right? by transferring God's power to themselves; just as
   at the present day the Pope with swelling cheeks thunders forth that
   himself and his throne are apostolic, and therefore infallible. Since,
   therefore, false prophets thus contend by fallacies, the simple are
   overcome by fear.

   It is now added, that they strengthened the hands of the impious
   (literally, of the impious man in the singular). When the Prophet spoke
   of the righteous, he used the word heart: he now uses the word hand,
   and not without reason. For the false terrors in which the false
   prophets indulged, penetrate even to the intimate affections, and as
   each is affected by the fear of God, so he becomes afraid of those
   threats which he hears uttered in God's name. We see, then, that it was
   said with very good reason that the mind of the righteous was sadly
   grieved; and now when he says that he had strengthened the hands of the
   impious, he means that audacity was added, so that not only the wicked
   always remain obstinate against God, but they break out in unbridled
   license, and hesitate not openly to violate God's law: for
   strengthening the hands is more than grieving the mind. For it may and
   it does happen, that a man may swell with pride and contempt of God,
   and yet modesty may hinder him from basely contaminating himself with
   many crimes. But when the hands themselves are engaged in
   licentiousness, all evils are heaped together. Now, therefore, we
   understand the reason of this difference. In fine, Ezekiel means that
   the impious had been hardened by the blandishments of these women, so
   as not only to despise God in their minds, but to bear witness through
   their whole life, that they were openly and confessedly erecting the
   standard of war against God. In this sense, then, he says, that they
   had strengthened the hands of the impious.

   He adds, that he should not be converted. Here he more clearly defines
   how those souls which were devoted to death [32] were kept alive, since
   such confidence was set before them as to lull and stupefy their
   consciences. He does not say, then, that the hands of the impious were
   strengthened, as in a conspiracy of the wicked one often assists
   another, as if they mutually bound their hands together. But the
   Prophet now speaks in another sense, namely, that these women so
   hardened the wicked that they went on securely in their wickedness, and
   made a laughing-stock of God and his law. You have strengthened the
   hands that they should not be converted: but how? by affording them
   life. Hence we gather that men cannot be humbled otherwise than by
   placing death before them, because all willingly indulge themselves,
   and hypocrisy is so ingrained in us by natural corruption, that every
   one readily persuades himself that all things will turn out well.
   Unless, therefore, death is presented before our eyes, and God himself
   appears as a judge to destroy us, we remain like ourselves, and proceed
   to still greater audacity. The Prophet signifies this when he says,
   that by giving life to the impious the false prophets strengthened
   their hands, and opposed their repentance altogether. How so? When the
   sinner thinks God propitious to him, he is not anxious about
   reconciliation, but abuses God's forbearance, and is daily rendered
   bolder, until at last he puts off all sense of fear. Hence this is the
   true preparation for conversion, when the sinner is slain; that is,
   acknowledges himself liable to the judgment of God, and takes a
   formidable view of his wrath. When, therefore, he sees himself lost,
   then he begins to think of conversion; but when men sleep over their
   sins, as I have said, they persist till they arrive at constant apathy,
   as Paul says when he remarks that they have no longer any sense of
   sorrow. (Ephesians 4:19.)

   It follows, you shall not see a lie any more. He has hitherto explained
   the reason why God grew so warm against these women, because they
   destroyed miserable souls either by their cruelty or their flatteries,
   and thus were like false prophets: now he adds, you shall not see a lie
   any more. This ought not to be understood as if God promised these
   women a sound mind, so that they should cease to hurt the people by
   their lies: but he confirms the sentiment previously expressed, namely,
   that they should be subject to the taunts of all men, as boys
   themselves acknowledge that what they boasted to be oracles were mere
   imposture. It is just as if he had said -- I will make you ashamed, so
   that hereafter you may be deprived of the use of the prophetic name, as
   you have hitherto used it. Although these women persisted in their
   madness, yet they saw vanity no more, since it became openly apparent
   that those wretched ones who trusted in them were deceived. Lastly,
   this thought to be adapted not to any change of feeling in these women,
   but rather to a failure in the effect. It is just as if any one were to
   say to a foolish fellow boasting himself to be a Lawyer or a physician,
   -- I will take care that you profit no more as either a Lawyer or a
   physician; and yet that foolish person should not be able to put away
   the opinion which he had ever formed of his own skin. But this is said,
   because the mere vanity of his boasting should be evident to all. So
   also God now speaks. This addition has the same meaning: you shall not
   divine divination any more. And yet there is no doubt that they desired
   by all means to invent new prophecies, and to boast in new revelations:
   but they were despised, because God had detected their lies when
   Jerusalem was taken, and the people dragged into exile: then because
   they promised the people a speedy return, when the same God refuted
   them by prolonging their exile. When, therefore, any one suffers the
   just penalty of his impiety, then the vanity of those women was
   detected: in this way they ceased to divine. He repeats -- I will free
   my people from your hand: and you shall know that I am Jehovah. Since I
   have lately explained this phrase I now pass it by. It follows --

   CHAPTER 14
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 14:1-3

   1. Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before
   me.

   1. Et venerunt ad me viri ex senioribus Israel, et sederunt coram facie
   mea. [33]

   2. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

   2. Et fuit sermo Iehovae ad me, dicendo,

   3. Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and
   put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be
   inquired of at all by them?

   3. Fili hominis, viri isti ascendere fecerunt idola sua super cor suum,
   et offendiculum iniquitatis suae posuerunt coram facie sua. An
   quaerendo quaerar ipsis? [34]


   Here Ezekiel relates an event worthy of notice. For this was not a mere
   vision, but a real transaction, since some of the elders of Israel came
   to him for the sake of consultation. He says that he sat, as men who
   are perplexed and astonished by evils are accustomed to do, when they
   see no remedy. The gesture then which the Prophet describes was a sign
   of anxiety and despair. A person wishing for an answer is said to sit
   before another; but since it is probable that they disputed among
   themselves about beginning, and did not immediately discover how they
   should commence, hence they became anxious to consult the Prophet.
   Ezekiel, indeed, might be touched and softened by pity when he saw them
   seeking God in this way. For this was a sign of repentance when they
   turned to the true and faithful servant of God. But since they had no
   sincerity, the Prophet is warned in time against supposing them to come
   with cordiality. Hence God instructs his servant not to give way with
   too much facility when he sees old men coming to be disciples. But he
   shows their hypocrisy, because superstition still reigned in their
   hearts; nay, they desired openly to violate God's law, and they did not
   disguise this feeling whenever occasion offered. First, he says they
   have set up idols in their hearts; by which words he means that they
   were addicted to superstition, so that idols obtained a high rank in
   their hearts; as Paul exhorts the faithful, that the peace of God which
   passes all understanding may obtain the rule in their hearts
   (Philippians 4:7; Colossians 3:15); so on the other hand the Prophet
   says that these men had given supreme sway to idols. And again an
   implied comparison must be remarked between God and idols. For God has
   erected the seat of his empire in our hearts: but when we set up idols,
   we necessarily endeavor to overthrow God's throne, and to reduce his
   power to nothing. Hence the most heinous crime of sacrilege is here
   shown in those old men who caused idols to rise above their hearts. For
   hence it follows that all their senses were drowned in their
   superstitions.

   He adds, they placed the stumblingblock of their iniquity before his
   face. By this second clause he signifies their hardness and
   perverseness; as if he had said, although the doctrine of the law was
   put before their eyes, yet they had no regard for piety, and despised
   even God's threats, as if he were not going to be their judge. When,
   therefore, the sinner is not moved by any admonitions, and is more than
   convicted of his impiety, and is compelled, whether he will or not, to
   suffer God's anger, and yet afterwards despises it, he is said to put
   the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face. For many slide
   away by error and thoughtlessness, because they do not think they can
   attempt anything against God. But here Ezekiel expresses that there was
   a gross contempt of God in these old men, and even a professed
   rebellion against him. Now he asks, Shall I by inquiring be inquired of
   by them? Some translate, Shall I, when consulted or asked, answer them?
   But this comment seems to me too remote from the mind of the Prophet;
   and it is probable that they thought this to be the sense, because they
   could not understand what else the Prophet meant. But God shows that
   this was like a wonder, since these old men dared to break forth, and
   to pretend to have some desire to inquire the truth. Hence their
   impudence is shown here, because they did not hesitate to place
   themselves before God's servant, and to pretend a regard for piety when
   they had none. God says, therefore, can it be done? For this question
   expresses the absurdity of the thing, and that for the above mentioned
   purpose, that their wickedness may be the more apparent in their daring
   to insult the face of God. For what else is it than openly to reproach
   God when impure men approach him, and wish to become partakers of his
   counsel? Meanwhile they show by their whole life that they are most
   inveterate enemies of the whole heavenly doctrine. Afterwards it
   follows --

   [34] Or, "by them." -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 14:4

   4. Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
   GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his
   heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face,
   and cometh to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him that cometh
   according to the multitude of his idols;

   4. Propterea loquere ad ipsos, et dic illis: sic Dominator Iehovah, vir
   vir, domo Israel, [35] ascendere fecerit idola sua super cor suum, et
   offendiculum iniquitatis suae posuerit coram facie sua: et venerit ad
   prophetam: ego Iehovah respondebo huic [36] secundum multitudinem
   idolorum ejus. [37]


   Here God seems to treat those hypocrites too indulgently who pretend to
   ask his advice and yet despise his counsel. But God here rather
   threatens what would be destructive to the wicked than promises
   anything which they ought to expect. It is indeed a singular testimony
   of God's grace when he answers us: for prophecy is an image of God's
   paternal anxiety towards us and our salvation. But sometimes prophecy
   only ends in destruction; and this is but an accident. Although,
   therefore, God's word by itself is naturally to be greatly desired, yet
   when God answers as a judge, and takes away all hope of pardon and
   pity, no taste of his favor can then be perceived. Thus this passage
   must be understood. God pronounces that he would answer, but whom? The
   reprobate, and those who tauntingly inquired of the Prophet what they
   should do. When he answers them, he only shows himself the avenger of
   their perfidy; and thus his answer contains nothing else but the
   fearful judgment which hangs over all the reprobate. For God does not
   here impose a perpetual law on himself; for he does not always act in
   the same way towards all the reprobate, but says that those impious
   ones should feel that they shall not profit by their cunning and
   artifices, since they shall find the difference between God and Satan:
   for they were accustomed to lies, and had itching ears; hence they
   wished to have some pleasing and flattering answer from the servant of
   God, since the false prophets gratified their inclinations. What then
   does God say? I will answer them, but far otherwise than they either
   wish or desire: for I will answer them according to the multitude of
   their idols: for they bring with them the material for their own
   condemnation: hence they shall take back nothing from me but the seal
   of that condemnation which is already placed upon their hearts, and
   appears on their hands. In fine, God here laughs at the foolish
   confidence of those who inquire about future events of his prophets;
   but meanwhile they have their heart bound up with superstitions, so as
   openly to show their gross impiety: hence he says, that he would answer
   them, not as they thought, but as they deserved.

   impious when they consulted him, but according to the multitude of
   their idols, that is, as they deserved." -- Calvin. The Hebrew word to
   which Calvin here refers is, vh, beh, which is so entirely Syriac, that
   Eichhorn says the Masoretes wished to corrupt it to v', ba. It is
   wanting in two MSS. Newcombe quotes the authority of Kennicott for
   reading, v', ba, though Houbigant treats it as a barbarism. The Chaldee
   interpretation is perhaps preferable. Rosenmfiner discusses the point
   fully. See also Cappell. Crit. Sac., volume 1. Edit. Hal.

   Ezekiel 14:5

   5. That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they
   are all estranged from me through their idols.

   5. Ut deprehendam domum Israel in corde ipsorum, quia alienarunt se
   [38] a me in suis idolis omnes.


   He shows God's object in being unwilling to dismiss without an answer
   the hypocrites who still impiously trifled with him. He says, that I
   may seize the house of Israel in their heart. It is yet asked how the
   impious are seized, when God answers them neither according to the
   opinion of their mind nor their expectation, but pronounces what they
   dislike and fear most grievously. I reply, that the impious are
   answered when they are driven to madness, and God thus extracts from
   them what was formerly hidden in their own hearts. He says, therefore,
   that their impiety may be manifest to all, I will answer them. For as
   long as God spares the impious, they endeavor to soothe him by a kind
   of flattery; but when they see that they take nothing by their false
   blandishments, then they roar, nay, bellow furiously against God: thus
   they are caught in their own hearts: that is, all their former
   dissembling is made bare, so that all may easily perceive that there
   never was a spark of piety in their hearts. God, therefore, bears
   witness that his answers would be of this kind, that he may take the
   house of Israel in their hearts; that is, that his severity may draw
   out into the light what was formerly hidden; for the word of God is a
   two-edged sword, and examines all the sentiments of men. (Hebrews
   4:12.) Some are so slain by this sword that they grow wise again; but
   others are stung with fury when they see that they must engage with the
   power of God; therefore they are seized in their own hearts when God
   twists from them what they would willingly have kept always hidden.
   Since they have estranged themselves from me, literally, in their
   idols. This passage is explained in two ways, as we have said. Some
   say, because they separated themselves; but I approve of the other
   version, because they have alienated themselves, and we shall
   understand the point more clearly afterwards when the subject leads us
   to it. They alienated themselves, then, from God; that is, when they
   had utterly declined from God's law; yet, as long as this was
   concealed, they still wore their masks. The separation of which the
   Prophet here speaks seems to be referred to this pretense. Since, then,
   they so alienated themselves from me by their idols; that is, he says
   they are deceived in thinking that they cannot be discovered, and that
   their abominations, however foul they are, will remain secret. And this
   agrees with the last clause, namely, that he would seize the hypocrites
   in their own heart.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since we are so inclined to all kinds of vices,
   that we may be restrained by the power of thy Spirit: then that we may
   be attentive to the teaching which sounds continually in our ears, so
   that we may persevere in the pure worship of thy name; and thus being
   strengthened against the cunning of the wicked, may we be upheld in our
   weakness, and preserved from all error, until we finish our course, and
   arrive at the goal which is proposed to us in Christ Jesus our Lord. --
   Amen.

   Ezekiel 14:6

   6. Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD;
   Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces
   from all your abominations.

   6. Propterea die ad domum Israel, Sic dicit Dominator Iehovah,
   revertimini et redire facite ab idolis vestris, et a cunctis
   abominationibus vestris redire facite [39] facies vestras.


   Now God shows why he had threatened the false prophets and the whole
   people so severely, namely, that they should repent; for the object of
   God's rigor is, that, when terrified by his judgments, we should return
   into the way. Now, therefore, he exhorts them to repentance. Hence we
   gather the useful lesson, that whenever God inspires us with fear, he
   has no other intention than to humble us, and thus to provide for our
   salvation, when he reproves and threatens us so strongly by his
   prophets, and in truth is verbally angry with us, that he may really
   spare us. But the exhortation is short, that they may be converted and
   turned away from their idols, and may turn their faces from all their
   abominations. When he uses the word hsyvv, heshibev, in the second
   clause, some understand "wives;" but this is frigid: others think the
   verb transitive, but yet impersonal, thus make yourselves return: this
   also is harsh. [40] I have no doubt that the Prophet here exhorts the
   Israelites that each should desire to reconcile himself to God, and at
   the same time bring others with him. As many were mutually the authors
   of evils to each other, he now orders them to do their utmost to bring
   back others with them: and surely this is a true proof of our
   repentance, when we are not only converted to God one by one, but, when
   we stretch forth our hand to our brethren, and recall them from error;
   especially if they have wandered away through our fault, we must take
   care to make up for the injury by at least equal diligence. The sense
   therefore of the Prophet is, first, that, the Israelites should repent;
   next, that one should assist another to repentance, or that they should
   mutually unite in the pursuit of piety, just as each was previously
   corrupted by his companion and brother. This seems to be the full
   meaning. Besides, this series must be remarked: because many show zeal
   in seizing others, and stretching out the hand to free them from error;
   but they themselves never think of repenting. But the Holy Spirit here
   shows us the true method of proceeding, when he commands us to repent,
   and then extends our desires to our brethren who have need of our
   exhortations. At length he adds, withdraw your faces, or turn away from
   all your abominations. A part is here put by the Prophet for the whole,
   since turning away the face means the same as withdrawing all the
   senses. Since, therefore, they had been almost affixed to their own
   abominations to which they had cast their eyes, and were completely
   intent upon them, he orders them to turn away their faces, so as to bid
   them farewell. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [39] Or, "turn away?." -- Calvin.

   [40] Calvin has not explained the difficulty which he raises. The verb
   "return" is in Hiphil, and thought to have a case following it.
   Houbigant reads it in Hophal, and Newcombe prefers to understand
   "yourselves." Rosemuller, as usual, is very explanatory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 14:7

   7. For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
   sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up
   his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity
   before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning
   me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:

   7. Nam quisquis, domo Israel, et e peregrino qui peregrinatur apud
   Israelem, et separatus fuerit [41] de post me (ad verbum), et ascendere
   fecerit idola sua super cor suum, et offendiculum iniquitatis suae
   posuerit coram facie sua, et venerit ad Prophetam ad inquirendum ipsum
   ex me, [42] ego Iehovah respondebo ei in me (vel per me).


   Ezekiel again returns to threats, because exhortations was not
   sufficiently effectual with such hardened ones; for we have seen that
   they were obdurate in their vices and almost like untamed beasts. For
   unless God's judgment had been often set before them, there had been
   but small fruit of teaching and exhortation. This then is the reason
   why God here sets before them his vengeance: a man, a man, says he, or
   a stranger who sojourns among Israel. When he adds strangers, he
   doubtless speaks of the circumcised who professed to be worshipers of
   the true God, and so submitted to the law as to refrain from all
   impieties. For there were two kinds of strangers, those who transacted
   business there, but were profane men, continuing uncircumcised. But
   there were others who were not sprung from the sacred race, and were
   not indigenous to the soil, but yet they had been circumcised, and as
   far as religion was concerned, had become members of the Church; and
   God wishes them to be esteemed in the same class and rank as the sons
   of Abraham. The law shall be the same for the stranger and the
   home-born, wherever the promise is concerned, (Numbers 15:15,16,) and
   the same sentiment is repeated in many places. Thus the word foreigners
   is now to be explained. But this circumstance exaggerates the crime of
   the chosen people. For if any one settled in the land of Canaan and
   embraced God's law, this was an accidental event: but the Israelites
   were by nature heirs of eternal life, for the adoption was continued
   through successive ages. Since then they were born sons of God, it was
   the more disgraceful to depart from his worship. And so when Ezekiel
   here gravely rebukes the strangers, he shows how much more atrocious
   the crime was in the case of those who were bound by a more sacred bond
   to the worship of God. He says, and he was separated from after me. The
   Prophet yesterday said mly, megneli, from near or from towards me: here
   he more clearly expresses declension, when men reject the teaching of
   the law, and openly show that they pay no obedience to God. For he is
   said to follow God or to walk after him, who proposes to himself God as
   a guide, and is devoted to his precepts, and holds on in the way
   pointed out by him. Thus by the obedience of faith we follow God or
   walk after him: so we recede from him when we reject his law, and are
   openly unwilling to bear his yoke any longer. Hence he shows of what
   kind the separation of the people or of individuals from God is,
   namely, when they refuse to follow his law. The Israelites indeed
   wished God always to remain united to them, but they made the divorce,
   although they denied it: hence the Prophet cuts away from them
   beforehand this prop of backsliding, when he says that they separated
   from God by not following him.

   At length he repeats what we saw yesterday, he who caused his idols to
   ascend unto his heart, he who placed the stumblingblock of his iniquity
   before his face, that is, was drowned in his own superstitions, so that
   his idols bore sway in his heart: lastly, he who is so forward in
   audacity that he did not conceal his wish to oppose the Almighty: if
   any one, says he, came to a prophet to inquire of him in me, or my
   name, I will answer him. He confirms what we saw yesterday, that he
   could no longer bear the hypocrites who deluded themselves so proudly.
   And certainly when they openly worshipped idols, and were fined with
   many superstitions, what audacity and pride it was to consult true
   prophets? It is much the same as if a person should want only insult
   and rail at a physician, and not only load him with reproaches, but
   even spit in his face: and should afterwards go and ask his advice,
   saying, "What do you advise me to do? How must I be cured of this
   disease?" Such pride could not be borne between man and man. How then
   will God permit such reproaches to go unpunished? For this reason he
   says that he would answer, but after his own manner, as if he had said
   -- they seek flatteries, but I will answer in myself: that is, in my
   natural character. I will not change it according to their pleasure,
   for they change my character by their fictions, but they are deceived:
   they profit nothing when they expect me to answer according to their
   views: I will answer, says he, in myself; that is, they shall feel that
   the answer proceeds from me, and they shall have no reason for thinking
   that my servants will be submissive to them, as they are accustomed to
   abuse the false prophets whom they buy for reward, because they are
   venal. For when any one is venal he is compelled to flatter like a
   slave. For there is no freedom but in a good and upright conscience.
   Hence God here separates his servants from impostors who make a trade
   of their flatteries. Now it follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [41] "It cannot be otherwise translated here: the word is nzr, nezer,
   which we yesterday saw might be derived from zvr, zor, to be estranged.
   There is no doubt about the sense, he who has been separated.'" --
   Calvin.

   [42] That is, "through me, or to inquire of him in or by me, or through
   my name." -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 14:8

   8. And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign
   and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and
   ye shall know that I am the LORD.

   8. Et penam ficiem meam in viro illo, [43] et ponam illum [44] in
   signum et proverbia et excidem eum e medio populi mei: et cognoscetis
   quod ego Iehovah.


   Here God adds, that the execution of his wrath would be ready when the
   prophet had denounced it. For profane men always fabricate for
   themselves empty treaties, and when God threatens they say that it is
   only thunder without lightning. Since the prophetic threats moved the
   reprobate either nothing or but little, so God now shows that he would
   not only answer what they did not wish to hear, but they should
   perceive by its effect how truly he had spoken. And this ought to be
   understood from the last sentence; for when God answers by himself, he
   neither is nor strikes the air with threatening words, but denounces
   what he determined to fulfill and accomplish in his own time. For God
   never answers in himself without joining the effect with the prophecy.
   But hypocrites are too stupid to acknowledge this, unless a clearer
   explanation was afforded. This then is the reason why the Prophet
   brings a message respecting the effect.

   He says, I will put my face upon that man: when God speaks openly
   against us, this is sufficient for our destruction; but he wished to
   express more in this case, namely, that prophets were the heralds of
   his wrath, and that hypocrites should be admonished about the penalties
   which await them, and even now hang over them, since his hand is
   stretched out against them. He is said to place his face against
   another who rises against him, or descends to a contest and engages
   hand to hand. So also God pronounces that he would be an adversary to
   all the reprobate who thus endeavored to elude him. He says, I will
   place him for a sign and a proverb. He marks the heaviness of the
   punishment by these words: for God sometimes chastises the faults of
   men, but after a common and accustomed manner. But when punishment
   excites the wonder of all and is like a portent, then God puts forth
   the sign of his wrath in no common fashion, as they say. The Prophet
   then means this, and hence at the same time admonishes us how
   detestable a crime it is to decline from the pure worship of God. For
   God chastises thefts and lewdness, drunkenness, deceits, and rapines:
   but not always so rigorously that the punishment is remarkable, and
   turns the minds of all towards itself. Hence from the greatness of the
   punishment the atrocity of the crime is made known. He now adds, for
   proverbs. This phrase is taken from the law, as the prophets who are
   the interpreters of Moses make use of words from it. (Deuteronomy
   28:37.) When any remarkable slaughter occurs it is said to be for a
   proverb, as all persons usually boast when speaking of any slaughter,
   that none is equal to it or more horrible. But, msl, meshel, is also
   used for a disgrace: as if he had said, it should not only be material
   for remark among the whole people, but their name should be subject to
   reproach and contempt. At length he adds, I will cut him off from my
   people. This is most severe of all, for even the hope of pity is taken
   away. A person may be a wonder for a time: then his calamity may be the
   subject of vulgar taunts and proverbs: and yet God is still exorable,
   and may not cut him off from his people. But when any one is cut off
   from God's people, his safety is already beyond hope. It is not in vain
   that this sentence is so often repeated, you shall know that I am
   Jehovah, says he, since we even formerly saw hypocrites always put a
   veil before them, since they think they have only to do with the
   prophets, and thus they despise mortals with security. Hence God here
   inscribes his name on his word, that they may know that he has spoken,
   and may experience the effect of his words by his hand. It follows --

   Ezekiel 14:9

   9. And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the
   LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon
   him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

   9. Et Propheta cum deceptus fuerit, et locutus fuerit sermonem: ego
   Iehovah decepi prophetam eum: et extendam manum meam super ipsum, et
   delebo illum e medio populi mei Israel.


   Here God meets that foolish thought in which many minds are rapt up.
   When they had their own impostors at hand, they thought that all God's
   threats could be repelled as it were by a shield. Jeremiah and Ezekiel
   threaten us, say they, but we have others to cheer us with good hope:
   they promise that all things shall be joyful and prosperous to us:
   since, therefore, only two or three deprive us of the hope of safety,
   and others, and those, too, far more numerous, promise us security, we
   have no need to despair. Since they thus oppose their impostors to the
   true prophets, and imagine a kind of conflict, in which imposture
   prevails and God's truth is vanquished, he says there is no reason why
   the flatteries of the false prophets should deceive you. For if you say
   that they bear also the prophetic name and office, I reply, that they
   err through your fault; for I deceive them because your impiety
   deserves it. This may as yet be obscure, but I will endeavor to explain
   it by a familiar example. At this time we see that many through sloth
   withdraw themselves from all fear, and promise themselves freedom from
   punishment, while they reject all care for God. O, say they, what have
   I to do with religion? for this only occasions me trouble; whoever
   wishes to give himself up seriously to God amidst, these dissension's
   and divisions will enter a labyrinth. Since, therefore, many think
   themselves free from fault, even if they reject God, this doctrine may
   be turned against them. There are, indeed, at this day dissension's in
   religion which disturb many; but do you think that this happens rashly:
   Oh! we know not which party to follow: inquire; for God has not so
   given the rein to Satan and his ministers, that the Church is
   disturbed, and men are mutually opposed by chance. But when this
   happens by the just judgment of God, it is certain that no one can be
   deceived unless of his own accord. For the Prophet takes that principle
   from Moses, whenever false prophets come forth, that this is a proof of
   faithfulness and of sincere piety. Thy God tries thee, says Moses,
   whether you love him. (Deuteronomy 8:3.) Since, therefore, no false
   prophet arises without the just judgment of God, and since God wishes
   to distinguish between sincere worshipers and hypocrites, it follows
   that no one can be excused on this pretext, of differing opinions which
   arise by wise ordination. For since God wishes to make an experiment,
   as I have said, concerning his servants and sons, and since false
   prophets so mingle all things, and involve the clear daylight in
   darkness, no one who truly and heartily seeks God shall be entangled
   among their snares.

   But Ezekiel will proceed still further, as I have previously hinted,
   namely, that all impostures and errors do not spring up rashly, but
   proceed from the ingratitude of the people itself. For if they had not
   so willingly given themselves up to the false prophets, God would
   doubtless have spared them. But, since false prophets abounded on every
   side, and were so plentiful everywhere, hence it may be understood
   that, the people were worthy of such impostures. Now then we perceive
   the meaning of the Holy Spirit when God pronounces that he is the
   author of all the error which the false prophets were thus scattering
   abroad. For it is not sufficient to observe merely the sound of the
   words, and then to illicit the substance of the prophetic teaching; but
   we must attend to the Spirit's purpose. I have already explained why
   the Prophet says this, namely, that the Israelites should cease to turn
   their backs according to their custom, saying, that if they remained in
   doubt amidst various opinions, this ought not to be imputed to them as
   a crime. For he answers, that the false prophets only took this
   license, because the people deserved to be blinded: and in fine, he
   says that Satan's lies multiplied not at random or at the will of men,
   but because God repays a graceless and perfidious people with a just
   recompense. So Paul says that error has a divine efficacy, when men
   prefer embracing a lie to the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12), and do
   not submit themselves to God, but rather shake off his yoke. Now,
   therefore, whoever wishes to excuse himself under the pretext of
   simplicity for not acquiescing in God's word, this answer is at hand --
   that all things are thus mingled by God's just decree. Since,
   therefore, Satan eclipses the light whenever clouds are scattered to
   disturb the weak, we here find God to be the author of it, since man's
   impiety deserves it. For the Prophet does not here discourse profanely
   about God's absolute power, as they say; but when he brings forward
   God's name, he takes it for granted that God is not delighted with such
   disturbance, when false prophets seize upon his name. It is certain,
   then, that God does not delight in such deception; but the cause must
   be thought, as we shall soon see: the cause is not always manifest; but
   without controversy this is fixed, that God punishes men justly, when
   true religion is so rent asunder by divisions, and truth is obscured by
   falsehood.

   We must hold, then, that God does not rage like a tyrant, but exercises
   just judgment. Besides, this passage teaches us that neither impostures
   nor deceptions arise without God's permission. This seems at first
   sight absurd, for God seems to contend with himself when he gives
   license to Satan to pervert sound doctrine: and if this happens by
   God's authority, it seems perfectly contradictory to itself. But let us
   always remember this, that God's judgments are not without reason
   called a profound abyss (Psalm 36:6), that when we see rebellious men
   acting as they do in these times, we should not wish to comprehend what
   far surpasses even the sense of angels. Soberly, therefore, and
   reverently must we judge of God's works, and especially of his secret
   counsels. But with the aid of reverence and modesty, it will be easy to
   reconcile these two things -- that God begets, and cherishes, and
   defends his Church, and confirms the teaching of his prophets, all the
   while that he permits it to be torn and distracted by intestine broils.
   Why so? He acts thus that he may punish the wickedness of men as often
   as he pleases when he sees them abuse his goodness and indulgence. When
   God lights up the flame of his doctrine, this is the sign of his
   inestimable pity; when he suffers the Church to be disturbed, and men
   to be in some degree dissipated, this is to be imputed to the
   wickedness of men. Whatever be the explanation, he pronounces that he
   deceived the false prophets, because Satan could not utter a single
   word unless he were permitted, and not only so, but even ordered; while
   God exercises his wrath against the wicked.

   In another sense Jeremiah says that he was deceived (Jeremiah 20:7). I
   am deceived, but you Jehovah have deceived me: for there he speaks
   ironically. For when ungodly men boasted that so many of his prophecies
   were delusive, and derided him as a foolish and misguided man, he says,
   If I am deceived, you, O Lord, have deceived me. We see, then, that by
   false irony he reproves the petulance of those who despised his
   prophecies; and finally, he shows that God was the author of his
   teaching. But in this place God pronounces without a figure that he
   deceived the false prophets. If any one now objects, that nothing is
   more remote from God's nature than to deceive, the answer is at hand.
   Although the metaphor is rather rough, yet we know that God transfers
   to himself by a figure of speech what properly does not belong to him.
   He is said to laugh at the impious; but we know that it is not
   agreeable to his nature to ridicule, to laugh, to see, and to sleep.
   (Psalm 2:4; Psalm 37:13.) And so in this place, I confess, there is an
   improper form of speaking; but the sense is not doubtful -- that all
   impostures are scattered abroad by God -- since Satan, as I have said,
   can never utter the slightest word unless commanded by God. But the
   kind of deceit which will solve this difficulty for us is described in
   the sacred history. For when Ahab had a great crowd of false prophets,
   Micah alone stood firm, and faithfully discharged his duty to God: when
   brought before king Ahab, he immediately blows away their boastings --
   Behold! all my prophets predict victory: he answers -- I saw God
   sitting on his throne; and when all the armies of heaven were collected
   before him, God inquired, Who shall deceive Ahab? And a spirit offered
   himself, namely, a devil, and said, I will deceive him, because I will
   be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. God answers,
   Depart, and thus it shall be. (1 Kings 22; 2 Chronicles 18.) Afterwards
   it follows, Therefore the Lord put a lie in the mouth of all those
   prophets. Here he distinctly shows us the manner in which God maddens
   the false prophets, and deceives them, namely, since he sends forth
   Satan to fill them with his lies. Since, then, they are impelled by
   Satan, the father of lies, what can they do but lie and deceive? The
   whole of this, then, depends on the just judgments of God, as this
   place teaches. God, therefore, does not deceive, so to speak, without
   an agency, but uses Satan and impostors as organs of his vengeance. If
   any one flies to that subtle distinction between ordering and
   permitting, he is easily refuted by the context. For that cannot be
   called mere permission when God willingly seeks for some one to deceive
   Ahab, and then he himself orders Satan to go forth and do so. But the
   last clause which I have quoted takes away all doubt, since God put a
   lie in the mouth of the prophets, that is, suggested a lie to all the
   false prophets. If God suggests, we shall see that Satan flies forth
   not only by his permission to scatter his impostures; but since God
   wished to use his aid, so he afforded it on this condition and to this
   end. But we shall leave the rest for the next lecture.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since we are so prone to error, that thy truth may
   always shine upon us amidst the darkness of this world: Grant, also,
   that we may gaze upon it with open eyes, and subject ourselves to thee
   with true docility, so that being governed by both thy Word and thy
   Spirit, we may fulfill our course, and at length arrive at that happy
   rest, which your only begotten Son has prepared for us. Amen.

   Lecture Thirty Ninth.

   WE saw in the last lecture with what intention God permits so much
   license to the false prophets to deceive the people. For men would
   desire to throw the fault of their errors on God, if he did not meet
   their rashness. But God has pronounced in this place, that his judgment
   is just, since the exiles as well as the Jews remaining in the city
   were equally blind. Hence we must understand that there was no cause
   for excuse when God's hand was against an impious and wicked people. He
   now adds, that he would be an avenger in destroying the false prophets
   from the midst of the people. This seems at first sight not to be in
   accordance with justice, that God should impel and precipitate men into
   error, and then exact punishment of them: and as I have said, men think
   themselves free from blame, if God blinds them, casts them into a
   reprobate state of mind, and even hurries them into impious desires.
   But I have already remarked that those act erroneously who estimate
   God's judgment by their own notions. For how small is the measure of
   our intelligence: for God's judgments are a profound abyss. (Psalm
   36:6.) Nothing therefore remains, except waiting for that day in which
   we shall see face to face the things which we now behold darkly and
   obscurely, as Paul says. (1 Corinthians 13:12.) Whatever may be the
   sense, God does rightly in deceiving the false prophets by way of
   punishing an impious people; and when he summons the false prophets to
   judgment, that also is free from blame. But if men are restive through
   their own rashness and audacity, God will free himself from all their
   calumnies. Wherefore let us diligently mark this passage where God
   pronounces that he is the deceiver; because however Satan may plot by
   his lies to abolish the truth, yet he can accomplish nothing unless God
   permit him, as we have already explained at full length. But when false
   prophets are dragged to punishment, they have no cause of expostulation
   with God and they profit nothing by their complaints, since their own
   consciences condemn them. They cannot object that they were compelled
   or drawn violently aside by God, since of their own accord and by their
   own efforts they endeavored to deliver wretched men to destruction by
   their lies. Since this is the case, God justly extends his hands to
   punish them, as he now says. But let us proceed to the next verse.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 14:10

   10. And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
   punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that
   seeketh unto him

   10. Et ferent iniquitatem suam, sicut iniquitas sciscitantis sic
   iniquitas Prophetae erit.


   Here what Ezekiel had partially touched upon is more clearly taught.
   For he had said, that at length false prophets should meet with
   punishment, but he now joins the whole people with them, and at the
   same time repels the empty pretenses by which men are always willing to
   conceal their fault. For when he mentions their iniquity by name, it is
   the same as forbidding them to turn their back any more. In this way,
   then, God removes all the cavils to which men usually resort, since
   they never pursue these tortuous paths without being conscious of their
   iniquity. For when God says that he is a searcher of hearts, he brings
   openly before us the secret feelings of mankind. As long as hypocrites
   have to deal with men, they easily delude them: and then they put on
   various disguises, by which they throw off the blame from themselves.
   But when God addresses them, his language necessarily penetrates to
   their hidden thoughts. Now therefore we understand the force of the
   words which God uses, they shall bear their iniquity

   He now adds, the iniquity of the inquirer shall be like that of the
   prophet. We have said that the sacred name of prophet is improperly
   transferred to impostors: but God often speaks thus by concession, and
   in this way a stumbling block occurs by which the weak are disturbed.
   For when they hear that deceivers, who not only obscure God's word but
   pervert it, proudly boast in their title, they are moved, and not
   without reason. For divine things ought seriously to move us to
   reverence, since prophets are organs of the Holy Spirit. Hence that man
   is worthy of such honor that no man ought to despise one who is
   reckoned a prophet. But because God tries his own people and blinds the
   reprobate, as we have said, when he sends them false prophets, in order
   that the faith of the pious should not faint when they hear that sacred
   name profaned, he says by concession -- well, they shall be called
   prophets -- but he does not mean that those shall be truly and really
   esteemed such who falsely claim to themselves that glory. Now let us
   come to the next clause, the iniquity of the inquirer shall be like
   that of the prophet. We have already spoken of the iniquity of those
   who, being led captive by the lies of Satan, endeavor to pervert both
   the worship and the pure doctrine of God. Since therefore they propose
   to contend with God, their iniquity is by no means excusable. But
   another question may arise concerning the people, which, although we
   have solved it before, yet it may be expedient to repeat it. He says,
   then, that those who had been deceived by the false prophets would be
   subject to punishment, that they may sustain the same penalty. This
   seems hard, as I have said: but the Prophet had previously taught that
   the people would be justly involved in the same punishment with the
   impostors, because they erred knowingly and willingly. For if they had
   cordially devoted themselves to God, and had suffered themselves to be
   ruled by his Spirit, and by the teaching of the law, they had doubtless
   been freed from all error. For God takes care of his own people, though
   he does not defend them from the insults of the ungodly, yet he
   fortifies them by the foresight and fortitude of his Spirit. Those who
   are deceived, receive the just reward of either their sloth or pride or
   ingratitude. For many scarcely deigned to inquire what the will of God
   was: others looked down as from an eminence on whatever was uttered in
   God's name: for through self-confidence they receive with difficulty
   any instruction but their own. Since then they were so unteachable,
   they are worthy of the reward which I have mentioned. Others again are
   ungrateful to God: for they stifle his instructions and the knowledge
   of heavenly things, and contaminate and pollute what is sacred; so that
   God justly joins the disciples with their masters when he revenges
   sacrilege as we see, since all sacred teaching is overthrown.

   But Ezekiel expresses more when he says, that the people had inquired.
   For they had counselors, who thereby gave a direct approbation to their
   employment. If they had been teachable they would not have betaken
   themselves so eagerly to the false prophets: hence the greater their
   diligence in this direction, the more their crime was apparent, since
   they purposely rejected God and his servants, by transferring
   themselves to the false prophets. We now understand the meaning of this
   sentence. It only remains that each of us should apply what is here
   said to his own profit. The Papists think themselves to be twice or
   thrice absolved if they have been deceived in any quarter. But, on the
   other hand, Christ exclaims -- If the blind lead the blind, it is not
   surprising if both fall into the ditch. (Matthew 15:14.) The reason is
   here expressed, because however those who are deceived show their
   simplicity, it is by no means doubtful that they flee from the light
   and desire the darkness by a crooked and perverse craving. Hence it
   happens that the iniquity of the inquirer is like that of the prophet.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 14:11

   11. That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be
   polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be
   my people, and I may be their God, says the Lord GOD.

   11. Ut non errent amplius domus Israel a me, [45] et non polluantur
   amplius in cunctis sceleribus suis: ut sint mihi in populum, et ego sim
   illis in Deum, dicit Dominator Iehovah.


   Here God shows that there was no other remedy, if he would recall to
   safety those who had almost perished, and at the same time he teaches
   that it is useful to the Church to chastise those who had so impiously
   declined from himself. Meanwhile it happens that God thunders, and
   exercises his judgments even to the extreme of rigor: meanwhile men do
   not repent but remain obstinate: nay, the punishment which God inflicts
   upon the reprobate sinks them into deeper destruction. How so? Those
   who harden themselves against the hand of God heap upon themselves
   severer punishments, since the reprobate do not submit to the yoke when
   God wishes to correct their hardness and obstinacy. But here God
   announces that he will not be so severe as not to consult for their
   safety. But this contradiction might disturb many, since God destined
   the people as well as the false prophets to destruction, for this seems
   to render his covenant vain. But he prevents this question, and says,
   since he should exact such severe penalties from the despisers of his
   word and from apostates, that rigor would be useful to the Church. Now
   we understand the meaning of the saying, the house of Israel shall not
   err any more: since otherwise their obstinacy was incurable: and unless
   God had seriously roused them up, they had never been brought back into
   the way of their own accord. Here therefore God obliquely rebukes the
   hardness of his people, because they could not be instructed except by
   punishment. For incorrigible indeed are those sons who, while their
   father cherishes and indulges them, despise him, and become worse by
   the indulgence. Of this then God now complains, that the children of
   Israel were so untractable that they could not bear destruction, unless
   he descended to the utmost rigor. For it was a very sad spectacle, that
   God's truth should be corrupted and adulterated by lies, and that the
   people, with those who imposed upon them, should utterly perish. But we
   now hear that there was but one remedy since the children of Israel
   were untameable, unless they were completely broken down. He now adds,
   from me: a phrase worthy of notice, for we here gather, that as soon as
   we bend ever so little from following God, we wander after errors: for
   we shall never hold on in the right way unless we follow God, that is,
   unless we are intent upon the end which he sets before us: and then
   unless our eyes are turned in the direction that he points out, lest we
   bend to either the right hand or the left. Thus we shall be beyond any
   danger of wandering if we, follow God: on the other hand, if our minds
   turn to either this side or that, and we are not retained in obedience
   to God alone, the Prophet teaches that we wander in error, and that
   this will at length turn out unhappily for us. When he speaks of the
   house of Israel, he does not embrace without exception those who spring
   from Jacob; for both the false prophets and those who consulted them
   were of Jacob's line, and had a name in that family. But we have
   already seen what was decreed concerning them, namely, that God would
   destroy them and blot them out from the midst of his people. We see
   then that they are not; comprehended under the offspring of Abraham or
   the house of Israel; but this is restricted to the remnant of the
   people whom God wished to spare. For we know that there was always some
   seed left, that the covenant which had been made with Abraham might be
   firm and sacred. This sentence then properly refers to the elect, who
   are called by Paul the remnant of grace. (Romans 11:5.) But God says
   that the example would be useful to the survivors, since the punishment
   of others would instruct them: and when they should see the false
   prophets perish, and should acknowledge God's remarkable judgment in
   their destruction, then they would profit by it. Now we understand what
   the Prophet means by the destruction of the false prophets and of those
   hypocrites who despised the true prophets, and prostituted themselves
   to be deceived by impostors: when God makes them an example of his
   wrath, the Prophet says that the house of Israel should receive
   advantage from their perishing, and profit by their utter ruin.

   Now he adds, And that they should not be polluted any more in all their
   wickedness. Here he purposely enlarges on their crime, that he may the
   more magnify the mercy of God; for if they had been only moderately
   guilty, his pardoning them had not been so remarkable. But the Prophet
   here pronounces them abandoned in sin, and does not condemn them for
   one sin but for many: he says they were polluted and contaminated in
   their crimes: and when God's mercy is extended to such as these, we
   discover with certainty how inestimable it is. Finally, let us learn
   from this passage, that God not only pardons men who transgress but
   lightly through want of thought and error, but that he is also merciful
   to the abandoned who are convicted of many iniquities. He says, that
   they may be my people and I may be their God. God had already adopted
   the whole seed of Abraham, and all were circumcised to a man: and thus
   they bore personally the testimony and covenant of God's paternal
   favor. Since, therefore, they were already God's people, and were
   considered as members of the Church, what can it mean that they shall
   be my people? For God seems here to promise them something new. But by
   this form of speech the Prophet marks their declension and manifests
   their deserts. For although God had thought them worthy of such honor
   as to reckon them among his elect people, yet they had cast themselves
   out by their own depravity. For since all religion among them was
   corrupt, God's worship was profaned, his whole law almost buried, and
   they were separated as far as possible from God, as we shall afterwards
   see. On the part of God the adoption remained firm: but here Ezekiel
   regards their condition if they would really look at it themselves,
   namely, as one of estrangement, since their own wickedness had cut them
   off: hence he speaks as of a new benefit when he says, they should be
   for a people when they repented.

   The second chapter of Hosea will help us to understand this more
   clearly, when it is said,

   "I will call them my people who are not my people,
   and her beloved who is not beloved." (Hosea 2:23.)

   For the Prophet was commanded to go into an improper house and to take
   an impure female and to beget sons: he says that a son was born to whom
   God gave the name l'my, lagnemi, it shall not be my people: and then
   when a daughter was born, she was unworthy of love. There Hosea
   signifies that the Jews were cut off from the sacred root, and he
   speaks not of one or two, but of the whole race; for they were neither
   God's people nor a beloved daughter. Afterwards when reconciled, they
   begin again to be God's people and a beloved daughter. Paul does not
   accommodate that sentence to the calling of the Gentiles rashly:
   (Romans 9:25,) namely, that there was no difference between Jews and
   Gentiles, since the former were rejected. Whatever it is, we see that
   those who had a place and a name among God's people, and whom he had
   chosen for himself, were cast off and had become strangers through
   their own fault. Thus they begin to be God's people afresh when they
   repent and God receives them to favor. The conclusion is, I will
   restore them afresh, that my covenant may be renewed in some way, that
   they may be my people as they formerly were; and I may be to them a
   God, since by their own backsliding they deserved to be treated as
   entire strangers. Besides, it is well to remember what we said
   elsewhere, that under these words is contained whatever belongs to
   solid happiness. For if God acknowledges us as his people, we are
   certain of our salvation, as when he pronounces that he will be our God
   while we call upon him as a father. But whoever shall call upon the
   name of the Lord shall be saved. (Joel 2:32; Acts 2:21; Romans 10:13.)
   Then we must remember that celebrated sentence of the Prophet Habakkuk,
   You art our God: we shall not die. (Habakkuk 1:12.) Lastly, we have
   nothing else to wish for towards the fullness of all good things and
   confidence in eternal life, than that God should reckon us among his
   people, so that there may be open to us a free access to him in prayer.

   Ezekiel 14:14

   14. Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they
   should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the
   Lord GOD.

   14. Et fuerint tres viri isti in medio ejus, Noe, Daniel, et Job, ipsi
   in justitia sua eripient [47] animas suas, dicit Dominator Iehovah.


   Here again God threatens the people of Israel with final destruction:
   but the words seem opposed, that God would be merciful and propitious
   to his people, and yet that no hope of pardon would be left. But we
   must remember the principle, that the prophets sometimes directed their
   discourse to the body of the people which was utterly devoted to
   destruction, since its wickedness was desperate; yet afterwards they
   moderated that rigor, when they turned to the remainder, which is the
   seed of the Church in the world, that God's covenant should not be
   extinguished, as we have already said. Hence, when we meet with this
   kind of contradiction, we know that God affords no hope to the
   reprobate, since he has decreed their destruction: so that language
   ought to be transferred to the body of the people which was already
   alienated, and like a putrid carcass. But when God mingles and
   intersperses any testimony of his favor, we may know that the Church is
   intended, and that he wishes a seed to remain, lest the whole Church
   should perish, and his covenant be abolished at the same time. The
   Prophet, therefore, as before, so also now, sets before himself the
   people desperate in wickedness, and says that they had no right to hope
   that God would act mercifully as usual, since necessity compelled him
   to put his hand for the last time to the destruction of the impious.
   This is the full meaning. We had a similar passage in Jeremiah
   (Jeremiah 15:1), where he said, If Moses and Samuel had stood before
   me, my mind is not towards this people; that is, it never could be that
   I should return to favor them, even if Moses and Samuel should
   intercede for them, and endeavor to obtain pardon by their own
   intercession. The papists foolishly distort this passage to prove that
   the dead intercede for us, for Moses and Samuel had been dead some
   time; but God says, Even if they should pray for the people, their
   prayers would be in vain. But this passage refutes that gross
   ignorance: for God is not here making a difference between the living
   and the dead; but it is a kind of personification, and of bringing back
   Moses and Samuel from the grave; as if he had said, Were they living at
   this time, and entreating for these wicked ones, I would never listen
   to them: for Ezekiel here mentions three, Noah, Job, and Daniel. But
   Daniel was then alive: he had been dragged into exile, and lived to a
   mature old age, as is well known. Then he expresses his meaning more
   clearly, by saying, if they had been in the midst of the city they had
   escaped in safety themselves, but they would not have prevailed for
   others. The whole meaning is, that God cuts off all hope of mercy from
   the abandoned people.

   We must remark the form of speech which is used: he relates four kinds
   of punishments by which men's crimes are usually avenged, and
   enumerates them distinctly. If I shall break the staff of bread, says
   he, because the land has revolted from me, and I shall send famine upon
   it, Daniel, Job, and Noah, shall preserve their own souls, but shall
   not profit others by their holiness: then he adds, if I shall send a
   sword, that is, if I shall follow up the impious by wars, even Daniel,
   and Job, and Noah, shall save their own souls, but they shall not
   intercede for others. He pronounces the same of pestilence and wild
   beasts. At length He reasons from less to greater. When I shall have
   punished any nation, says He, with famine, pestilence, and the sword,
   and wild beasts, how much less shall Daniel, Job, and Noah, prevail
   with me by their intercession? But God had condemned the house of
   Israel to all punishments, just as if he had poured all his curses like
   a deluge to destroy them. Hence He concludes that there is no reason
   for cherishing any hope of escape from these imminent dangers. Now then
   we comprehend the Prophet's meaning.

   Now let us come to the first kind of punishment. If the land, says he,
   acts wickedly against me, or conducts itself wickedly, cht', cheta, to
   act wickedly, but by prevaricating with prevarication. By these words
   the crime of perfidy is distinguished from error, because men often
   fall away and depart far from God through ignorance of the way which
   they thought to pursue. But here the Prophet condemns the people's
   defection through perfidy, as if he had said that they purposely, and
   by deliberate malice, were estranged from God, since they had been
   correctly taught how God ought to be worshipped. Although the Prophet
   speaks generally, yet he wished to show God's wrath to be of no
   ordinary kind: for God will often chastise men's sins by either
   pestilence, or sword, or famine, and yet will not be implacable. But he
   here speaks of a desperate people, and one already addicted to eternal
   destruction. He says, therefore, by prevaricating with prevarication;
   that is, by deceiving my confidence by open and gross perfidy.

   Again, and I will stretch forth, my hand upon it, and will break the
   staff of bread, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off from it
   man and beast. Here, as I have mentioned, he touches upon only one kind
   of punishment; for God is accustomed to take vengeance on men in four
   ways; and the prophets, as you have often heard, usually adopt the form
   of speech used by Moses. These four curses of God are everywhere
   related in the law, -- war, famine, pestilence, and the assault and
   savageness of wild beasts. Now the Prophet begins with hunger; but he
   points out the kind of hunger -- if God has broken the staff of bread.
   For sometimes, when he does not reduce men to poverty, yet he puffs up
   the bread, so that those who think to use it as nourishment do not
   gather any rigor from it. But the Prophet properly means it in this
   second sense, as we see in Ezekiel 4 and Ezekiel 5. The metaphor is in
   accordance with the word staff: for as the lame cannot walk unless they
   lean on a staff -- and tremulous old men need a similar support -- so
   by degrees men's strength vanish, unless new rigor is replaced by meat
   and drink. Bread is, therefore, like a staff which restores our
   strength when want has weakened it. We now come to the word breaking.
   How does God break the staff of bread? By withdrawing the nourishment
   which he had infused into it; for the virtue which we perceive in bread
   is not intrinsic: I mean this -- that bread is not naturally endued
   with the virtue of continuing and inspiring life within men; and why?
   Bread has no life in it: how then can any one derive life from it? But
   the teaching of the law has been marked: that man lives not by bread
   only, but by every word proceeding from God's mouth. (Deuteronomy 8:3.)
   Here Moses intends, that even if God has inserted the virtue of
   nourishment in bread, yet this is not to be so attributed to it as if
   it were inherent in it. What follows then? That as God breathes a
   secret virtue into the bread, it sustains and refreshes us, and becomes
   our aliment. On the other hand, God says that he breaks the virtue of
   the bread when he withdraws from it that virtue: because, as I have
   already said, when we taste bread, our minds ought to rise immediately
   to God, since men, if they cram themselves a thousand times, yet will
   not feel their life to be deposited in the bread. Therefore, unless God
   breathes into bread the virtue of nourishment, the bread is useless; it
   may fill us up, but without any profit. Now, then, we understand the
   meaning of this sentence, about which we shall have something more to
   say.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you shine so clearly upon us with the
   teaching of thy Gospel, in which thy Son reveals himself familiarly to
   us, -- Grant that we may not shut our eyes to this light, or turn them
   hither and thither by depraved curiosity, but may remain in simple
   obedience, until at length having passed through the course of this
   life, we may arrive at the fullness of light, when you will transform
   us into thy glory by the same -- your only-begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Lecture Fortieth.

   I have already partially explained the Prophet's design, when he says,
   if God has sent famine upon a land, and Job, Noah, and Daniel were in
   it, that they indeed should be safe, but that the land should perish,
   since he had determined to destroy it. Moreover, he described the kind
   of famine, when he said, when I shall have broken the staff of bread;
   because, though wheat should be plentiful, and men be prevented from
   starving, yet they would not be refreshed, since the bread would only
   burden them. On the whole, God means that famine, even if it arise from
   natural causes, proceeds from his judgments: for by continual rains the
   seed rots in the ground, and drought consumes all its juice and
   substance. Then, if hail devastates the sown fields, the causes of the
   ensuing famine are manifest. But it is necessary to look higher,
   because, as we are nourished by God's bounty, so we never suffer
   poverty unless when he withdraws his hand.

   Let us now come to the next verse. If these three men, the most just of
   all, had been in the land, they should only free their own souls. The
   exclusive particle is not expressed, but it is easy to gather the
   Prophet's sense from the context; as if he had said that God's decree
   was fixed when he had determined to afflict the land grievously. It is
   sometimes asked why Noah, Daniel, and Job are named, rather than
   Abraham, Jacob, or David, or any others. Those who wish to be precise
   guess various comments; namely, because Noah could not preserve the old
   world from the deluge, but only his sons an their wives. But this
   example does not suit: and as to the others, they say that Job did not
   preserve his own sons, since they were all consumed by the lightning.
   But the same thing happened to others. Thus Abraham was the common
   father of the people, and even he could not snatch his posterity from
   the wrath of God: nay, Jeremiah describes Rachel, though dead, weeping
   for her children, and refusing consolation because none of them
   survived. (Jeremiah 31:15.) We see, then, that this is cold. Others say
   that these three men had experienced three different kinds of life;
   that Noah, living before the deluge, had seen the horrible devastation
   of the whole earth, and yet the renovation of the world had followed:
   they say, also, that Job had flourished in prosperity, and then was
   deprived of all his goods and his children, and was so defiled by
   disease and filth as to be rather a carcass than a living man, and yet
   was restored like a captive from the enemy's hand. Daniel, again, had
   lived at Jerusalem, had been taken captive, and had lived there in
   exile; that he at length saw the beginning of the restoration of the
   people when that sudden change happened, and the Babylonian monarchy
   passed to the Persians. These things, at the first glance, seem to be
   clever; but whatever is affected is always cold and tame. Ezekiel here
   mentions these three men, simply because they first occurred to him.
   For we must remember that passage of Jeremiah which I quoted yesterday,
   (Jeremiah 15:1,)where it is said, If Moses and Samuel had stood before
   me, I should not have listened to them for the safety of the people. A
   question may arise, why Jeremiah names Moses and Samuel rather than any
   others? What will these clever speculators say? We see, therefore, that
   each of these things must not be so scrupulously beaten out, since it
   is enough to understand the general intention of the Holy Spirit. Three
   men, then, are placed here, whose holiness was celebrated. Daniel was
   then living: the others had been dead many ages ago; but the integrity
   of them all was universally manifest. It is then as if he had said,
   even if those should come who either are or have been most perfect
   among men, yet they would avail nothing in interceding for a land
   already devoted to destruction.

   But the Prophet's saying, they should be saved on account of their own
   righteousness, seems absurd: for no one can be found whose
   righteousness can stand before God's tribunal: for if God was to reason
   with men, every one must be found guilty, as the Scripture also often
   teaches, and experience most fully convinces us. Here the Prophet seems
   to extol too much the merit of works, when he attributes the person's
   freedom to his righteousness. But the solution is easy; namely, this
   righteousness of which mention is made ought not to be separated from
   gratuitous pardon, which reconciles men to God, so that their sins are
   not imputed to them: for as to some saying that they were justified by
   faith, this does not forward the inquiry; and besides that, it is
   forced. By their own righteousness shall they free their own souls,
   that is, say they, by their faith. But when God addresses Noah himself,
   (Genesis 7:1,) and says that he was found just through his piety, he
   does not mean that he was endued with faith; this would be nugatory.
   There is no doubt, then, that he commends sanctity and integrity in his
   servant; so also in this passage, under the word righteousness or
   justice, he implies the fear of God, in which all virtues are founded,
   and chastity and temperance, and whatever belongs to the rule of living
   holy and justly. But meanwhile this derogates nothing from the
   righteousness of faith; for the faithful are reckoned just before God,
   and their works are also reckoned just -- not by any inherent merit --
   not because they bring any perfection of that kind before God which may
   conciliate his favor, and in which they can stand; but because God
   pardons them indulgently through his own paternal clemency, and so
   approves their righteousness, which otherwise might be deservedly
   rejected. For example, Pinnehas was thought just when he avenged the
   reproach of the sanctuary. (Numbers 25:7, 8.) When inflamed with zeal,
   Pinnehas brought out of the midst the courtezan with her paramour; for
   this cause, as is said in the Psalm, (Psalm 106:31,) he was reckoned
   just. But that could not suffice for a man's righteousness, since one
   special act could not render a man just. Pinnehas, then, could not be
   reckoned just on that ground; but while his work was pleasing to God,
   for that reason it was just. But, on a serious inquiry, that work was
   also condemned as being infected with some fault, and so was not just
   in itself. But because God pardons his sons, as we have said, hence he
   accepts their works: so he acknowledges them also as just, and they do
   not obtain this by either their own worthiness or peculiar merits. For
   the beginning of the righteousness about which we are now speaking is a
   gratuitous reconciliation by which all the faults of the faithful are
   buried: whence it happens also that their integrity, although not
   perfect, is still pleasing to God. We see, therefore, that these things
   are easily reconciled; that men are freed by their righteousness, and
   yet that their temporal safety depends only on the mere pity of God:
   for when God's gratuitous favor has gone before, hence he seems to
   acknowledge as true righteousness which was in itself mutilated and but
   half complete. Now it follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 14:15-16

   15. If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil
   it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the
   beasts:

   15. Si bestiam malam transire fecero per terram, et orbaverit eam, et
   fuerit vastitas ut nemo transeat propter bestiam. [48]

   16. Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD,
   they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be
   delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

   16. Tres viri isti in medio ejus, vivo ego, dicit Dominator Iehovah, si
   filios et filias liberabunt: ipsi soli liberabuntur, et terra erit in
   vastitatem.


   Now he mentions the second kind of punishment. For we said that God's
   four scourges were here brought before us, which are more familiarly
   known to men through frequent use. They are hunger and wild beasts, war
   and pestilence. The Prophet has spoken of famine; he now comes down to
   wild beasts. This kind of scourge is rarely used in Scripture; for God
   more frequently mentions the sword, pestilence, and famine; but when he
   distinctly treats, of his scourges, he adds also savage beasts. Now
   therefore he says, if he had sent wild beasts to lay waste the land,
   and Noah, Job, and Daniel, had been in that land, they would be free
   from the common slaughter, but that their righteousness would not
   profit others. He expresses a little more clearly what he had spoken
   briefly and obscurely when he treated of the famine. If, says he, I
   shall cause an evil beast to pass through and injure the land, so as to
   lay it waste, that no one may pass through on account of the wild
   beasts, as I live, says he, if these three men shall free their sons
   and their daughters. This passage teaches what I lately touched upon
   about the famine, namely, that the beasts did not break in by chance to
   attack and rage against men, but that they are sent by God. Thus God
   follows out his judgments no less by means of lions, and bears, and
   tigers, than by rain and drought, the sword and the pestilence: and
   surely this may be understood, if we reflect upon the great savageness
   of these beasts; first, when hunger arouses them they are carried along
   by a ravenous impulse; and then, without the compulsion of necessity,
   they are hostile to the human race, and without doubt they would urge
   themselves on to tear to pieces all whom they met with, unless
   restrained by God's secret instinct. If, therefore, God restrains the
   wild beasts, thus also he sends them forth as often as it pleases him,
   to exercise their ferocity against mankind, and in this way to become
   his scourges. But here an oath is interposed that God may inspire
   confidence in his sentence, so God swears by his own life. This is the
   meaning of the phrase as I live; that is, I swear by my life. This is
   indeed spoken improperly, but elsewhere we have seen that God swears by
   his life; that is, just as if he swore by himself, because he has no
   greater by whom he can swear, as the Apostle says (Hebrews 6:13); and
   as often as we swear by the name of God we attribute the supreme power
   to him, and thus we profess our life to be in his hand, and he to be
   our only Judge. When, therefore, he swears by himself, he admonishes us
   at the same time that his name is profaned if we swear by any others:
   then he shows how much religion is to be exhibited in oaths. Let us
   follow, therefore, God's example, when our speech needs confirmation,
   by calling in a witness and judge: next, that we should not use his
   name rashly and falsely, but that our oath should be truly a testimony
   to our piety. But here in truth a question arises, -- How God can say
   that the land should perish which has been once subjected to wild
   beasts? For sometimes wild beasts have infected many regions, and God
   has immediately restrained them, and so their cruelty has passed away
   like a storm.

   Again, we knew that the prayer of the saints are not superfluous when
   they pray for others; but God seems here to deny what is clearly
   manifest. But the solution is easy. For since he does not inflict his
   judgments equably but variably, and at one time hastens punishments and
   at another suspends them: at one time punishes men's sins and at
   another delays doing so, he fixes for himself no sure law by which he
   is always bound, but he speaks of the land which he has destined to
   destruction. God therefore will strike one region with famine, another
   with war, a third with pestilence, a fourth with wild beasts, and yet
   he can mitigate his own rigor, and when men begin to be terrified, he
   can withdraw his hand. But if it has been once decreed that any land
   must perish, all the saints would run together in vain, because no one
   would be a fit intercessor to abolish that inviolable decree. We now
   understand the Prophet's intention, for he does not speak generally of
   any lands whatever, but he points out the very land which was devoted
   to final destruction. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [48] That is "beasts," for there is a change of number. -- Calvin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 14:17-18

   17. Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through
   the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:

   17. Vel gladium transire fecero super terram illam, et dixero gladio,
   Transi per terram, ut excidatur ex ea homo et jumentum.

   18. Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD,
   they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be
   delivered themselves.

   18. Et tres viri isti in medio ejus, vivo ego, dicit Dominator Iehovah,
   non liberabunt filios et filias, quia ipsi soli liberabuntur.


   The Prophet now descends to the third kind of punishment. Hence God
   says, if he send a sword upon a land, he cannot be entreated so as not
   to consume it utterly, neither will he admit any man's intercession,
   although the most holy dwell there, namely, Job, Noah, and Daniel. But
   the phrase used must be marked: if I shall say to the sword, pass
   through to exterminate and blot out the whole land, or cut off from it,
   both man and beast, because we here gather the great power of God's
   secret government. For we think that wars are stirred up at random: and
   as men are in agitation, so also we imagine war to be nothing but
   confusion and turbulence. But God governs even wars by his inestimable
   wisdom, and also men and their swords: men are enraged, their swords
   fly about in their hands, and they seem to go hither and thither at
   random by blind impulse. But God here announces that he permits swords
   to pass through a land, and to destroy both men and cattle. If he had
   said, after the language used in many places, that he would arm men, it
   would not have been very wonderful: for everywhere throughout the
   Prophets he calls the Chaldaeans and Assyrians executors of his
   judgment. Hence that sentence of Jeremiah, Cursed is he who has done
   God's work negligently. (Jeremiah 48:10.) But that work of God was the
   slaughter at Jerusalem. So also Nebuchadnezzar is called God's servant
   and minister when he laid waste Egypt, and God promises him the reward
   of his labor. (Ezekiel 29:20.) So here Ezekiel proceeds further, not
   only that the hands of men are directed as God wishes, but also that
   their swords listen to his secret command, so that they neither pass by
   nor strike any man or animal except as far as God pleases. But if God
   so commands the swords, let us know that whenever men rise up against
   us, that our patience is exercised and our sins chastised in this way:
   and that the impious are God's agents: and let us determine that we
   shall never profit by noise and resistance, since there is but one
   remedy, to humble ourselves under God's strong hand. Now the fourth
   kind of punishment follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 14:19-20

   19. Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon
   it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:

   19. Vel pestem immisero in terram illam, et effudero iracundiam meam
   super ipsam in sanguine ad perdendum [49] ex ea hominem et jumentum.

   20. Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
   GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but
   deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

   20. Et Noe, Daniel, et Job in medio ejus, vivo ego, dicit Dominator
   Iehovah, si filium et filium liberaverint: ipsi in justitia sua
   liberabunt animam suam.


   He now affirms of the fourth kind of punishment, what he has hitherto
   pronounced of the rest. He says, then, If I shall have sent a
   pestilence, and have devoted a land to devastation, that Job, Daniel,
   and Noah, should be safe if they dwelt there: but that their
   righteousness should not profit even their sons and their daughters.
   Nay, he seems to speak with greater restriction, since he has
   substituted the singular number for the plural: for he had just said,
   they shall not free either sons or daughters. He now says, not even a
   son or a daughter, that is, they shall not prevail with me by their
   intercession so much as to save from death even a single son or
   daughter. We must also remember what I have said, that God does not
   always act in the way related here: for he has manifold and various
   methods of carrying out his judgments. Hence it would not be just to
   impose a law not to liberate any one, and according to his own will
   either to hear or reject their prayers. But here he only means, that
   when he has determined to destroy a land, there is no hope of pardon,
   since even the most holy will not persuade him to desist from his wrath
   and vengeance. But now the conclusion follows --

   [49] Or, "to cut off." -- Calvin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 14:21-22

   21. For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore
   judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome
   beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?

   21. Quoniam sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, Quanto magis cum quatuor
   judicia mea mala, gladium, et famem, et bestiam malam, et pestem
   immisero contra Hierusalem ad excidendum ex ea hominem et animal?

   22. Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought
   forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you,
   and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted
   concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning
   all that I have brought upon it.

   22. Et ecce evasio in ea residua, [50] evasio egredientium, inquit
   nempe filii et filiae: ipsi egredientur ad vos: et videbitis vias
   ipsorum, et opera ipsorum: et consolationem sumetis super malo quod
   venire fecero super Hierusalem, super omni quod venire fecero super
   eam.


   He now reasons, as we said in the beginning, from the less to the
   greater. Hitherto he has said, If I shall have sent forth only one
   weapon to take vengeance upon men, no one will oppose my following out
   my decree: then he enumerated four weapons, one after another. Now he
   adds, What then, when I shall have heaped together all punishments, and
   not only shall have sent pestilence or sword or famine, but as it were
   when I have four armies prepared and drawn up, and shall command them
   to attack and destroy mankind, how shall even one person escape? If
   Job, Daniel, and Noah, cannot snatch away even their sons and daughters
   from a single scourge, how shall they snatch them from four at once! We
   see, then, that God here cuts away the false and specious hopes by
   which the false prophets deluded the miserable exiles when they
   promised them a return to their country, and daily proclaimed how
   impossible it was that the sacred city, the earthly dwelling-place of
   God, could be taken by the enemy, and the religion which God had
   promised should be eternal could perish. Since, therefore, the false
   prophets so deceived these miserable exiles, here God shows how greatly
   they erred while they cherished any hope in their minds; because he had
   not only held one kind of scourge over Jerusalem, but approached it
   with a whole heap of them to destroy and cut off both man and beast.
   This then is the full meaning.

   Now he says, If I shall have sent my four evil judgments. Here God
   calls his judgments evils, in the sense in which he says in Isaiah,
   that he creates good and evil, (Isaiah 45:7,) since immediately
   afterwards he expresses his meaning by saying life and death. Hence
   what is against us is here called evil, and so this epithet ought to be
   referred to our perceptions. For our natural common sense dictates that
   whatever is desirable and useful to us is good: food and life and peace
   are good, and whatever is conducive to life, and what we naturally wish
   for, we call good. So also, on the other hand, death and famine are
   evils: so are nakedness, want, and shame: why so? since we dread
   whatever is not useful to us; and because we fly from evils as soon as
   reason dawns. In fine, evil here is not opposed to justice and right,
   but, as I have said, to men's opinion and our natural senses. He now
   confirms what we before said, namely, that these are God's judgments
   when enemies rage against us, pestilence attacks us: poverty assails
   us, and wild beasts break in upon us. When therefore we suffer under
   these afflictions, let us learn immediately to descend into ourselves
   and to discover the cause why God is so angry with us. For if we turn
   our attention towards the sword, and pestilence, and famine, we are
   like dogs which gnaw and bite what is thrown at them, and do not regard
   the hand which threw it, but only vent their rage upon the stone. For
   such is our stupidity when we complain of famine being injurious to us,
   wild beasts troublesome, and war horrible. Hence this passage should
   always be borne in mind that, these are God's evil judgments, that is,
   scourges by which he chastises our sins, and thus shows himself hostile
   and opposed to us.

   He now adds, there shall be a remnant in that escape. They explain this
   verse parenthetically, as if God by way of correction engaged to act
   more mercifully towards that city, than if he struck any land with only
   one scourge. They explain it thus: although these four scourges should
   meet together, yet I will mitigate the rigor of my vengeance, since
   some shall go out safely, and reach even to you. Almost all agree in
   this sense; but when I weigh the Prophet's intention more accurately, I
   cannot subscribe to it: because God seems to me to confirm what he had
   said before, that he would be a just avenger of wickedness while he
   treats the Jews so harshly. To discover the most suitable sense, we
   must consider the condition of the exiles: it was surely worse than if
   they had been destroyed by a single death for they were dying daily;
   and at length, when cast out of the sacred land, they were like the
   dead. Hence that exile was more sorrowful than death, since it was
   better to be buried in the holy land than among the profane. Since,
   then, they had been mixed with dog's, it was no life to them to
   protract a wretched existence amidst constant languor; and if the hope
   of restoration had been taken away, concerning which we are not now
   treating, and to which not a single syllable applies, exile was by
   itself like death. Since, then, the Prophet here says, that some should
   be left, to escape, he does not mean that they should be safe: hence
   this is not a mitigation of their punishment. For as we saw before, and
   especially in Jeremiah, those who died quickly were less to be
   deplored. (Jeremiah 22:10.) Finally, when the Prophet here says that
   some should come to Babylon, he does not promise them pardon, as if God
   was propitious to them, or noticed them favorably; no such thing: for
   he speaks of the reprobate, and of those who bore on their forehead the
   manifest sign of their impiety, and show by their whole life that they
   are abandoned, and most worthy of final destruction.

   For he says, a departure of those who go forth shall come: sons as well
   as daughters shall come to you, says he, and you shall see their ways
   and their work: that is, you shall see that the men are so wicked, that
   their ungodliness shall compel you to confess the city to be worthy of
   perishing, and the people deserving destruction. For the word
   consoling, which the Prophet uses immediately afterwards, refers here
   to the acknowledgment of their wickedness appeasing the minds of those
   who formerly roared and murmured against God. Neither does he mean that
   consolation which, according to the common proverb, has many friends;
   but only the calm acknowledgment of God's just vengeance, in which the
   ten tribes acquiesced. For before they saw the state in which the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem were, they thought that God was too severe,
   and hence their outcry and complaint against God. The Prophet,
   therefore, now says, that the sight of your wickedness will bring you
   consolation; for you shall see that it could not be otherwise, and that
   you deserved such punishment: hence, when you have acknowledged your
   abandoned wickedness, you will regard my justice with peaceful and
   tranquil minds; and you will so finish and cease your complaints which
   now agitate your minds in different directions. The rest, to-morrow.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you daily exercise thy judgments in all
   parts of the world, and since many regions are harassed by pestilence
   and war, that so long as you spare us we may profit by the evils and
   slaughters of others: Grant, also, if thy scourges reach also unto us,
   that we may not be obstinate, but may submit ourselves to thy judgment,
   and being truly humble, may we seek pardon by the serious pursuit of
   piety, so that we may truly acknowledge thee; and may feel thee to be a
   propitious Father to us, until at length we enjoy thy love in thy
   heavenly kingdom, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Forty-First.

   WE said in yesterday's lecture, when the Lord pronounces that he would
   have some remnants when destroying Jerusalem, that this is no act of
   clemency, as if he had relaxed the rigor of his justice. For exile was
   not preferable to death, as we may collect from the context, since God
   does not use these words of his elect. For there is no mention of
   repentance, so that the cause of his vengeance would be conspicuous in
   their crimes. You shall see, therefore, and shall take comfort: because
   the exiles who were then in Chaldaea could not subscribe to the
   judgment of God. But when they saw their brethren of such abandoned
   morals, the review of their sins availed to their comfort, that is, to
   appease their minds. He repeats the same in the last verse of the
   chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 14:23

   23. And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their
   doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I
   have done in it, says the Lord GOD.

   23. Et consolabuntur vos, quia videbitis vias ipsorum et opera ipsorum:
   et scietis quod non frustra fecerim quaecunque feci in ea, dicit
   Dominator Iehovah.


   He now puts the verb for comforting in the third person, but in the
   same sense, because after the Jews shall have been led captive, they
   will bear sure and special marks of God's justice against their sins.
   This, then, is the consolation, as I explained it yesterday, while the
   exiles acknowledge that cruelty cannot be ascribed to God, as if he had
   exceeded moderation in exacting punishment; for the desperate
   wickedness of the people demanded it. But this passage contains a
   useful doctrine, since we collect from it that we are never tranquil in
   our minds unless when the greatest equity and justice appears in God's
   judgments, and become present to our minds. As long, therefore, as we
   do not acknowledge God to be severe in just cases, our minds must
   necessarily be disturbed and disarranged: hence the word "consolation"
   is opposed to those turbulent thoughts. But since nothing is more
   miserable than to be distracted and drawn hither and thither, and to be
   anxiously disturbed, let us learn that those profit most who acquiesce
   in God's judgments, although they do not perceive the reason of them,
   yet modestly adore them. But when God shows why he treats either us or
   others so severely, this is a special favor, since he offers us
   material for joy and tranquillity. Let us proceed.

   CHAPTER 15
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 15:1-5

   1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

   1. Et fuit sermo Iehovae ad me dicendo,

   2. Son of man, What is the vine-tree more than any tree, or than a
   branch which is among the trees of the forest?

   2. Fili hominis, quid erit [51] lignum vitis prae omni arbore rami [52]
   quae est inter arbores sylvae?

   3. Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin
   of it to hang any vessel thereon?

   3. An sumetur ex eo [53] lignum ad formandum, ut sit opus, vel an
   sument, [54] ex eo paxillum, ut suspendatur in eo omne vas? [55]

   4. Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both
   the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?

   4. Ecce in ignem traditur [56] ad consumptionem, duas extremitates ejus
   consumpsit ignis, et medium ejus exustum est, [57] an utile erit ad
   opus?

   5. Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less
   shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and
   it is burned?

   5. Ecce, cum esset integrum non factum fuit [58] ut esset opus: quanto
   magis postquam ignis consumpsit ipsum et exaruit [59] formabitur adhuc
   ut sit opus?


   The Prophet's intention is to humble the foolish confidence of the
   people, who boasted of the gratuitous kindness of God, as if they were
   naturally excellent: hence, also, their obstinacy against his threats
   was so great. For when the prophets reprove them sharply, they boasted
   against them the remarkable gifts by which they were divinely adorned:
   as if they had been so armed by God's benefits to resist his power, for
   we know that they were so blinded. Since, then, that disease had
   attacked the people, it is not surprising that the prophets in many
   places refute such folly. But the Prophet here uses a simile to show
   the Jews that they were not intrinsically but only accidentally
   excellent, since God had treated them as worthy of remarkable benefits.
   Since it is so, their arrogance is easily refuted, when they oppose
   their superiority to God, as if it were peculiar to them, and not God's
   special gift. But we must understand the simile which Ezekiel uses:
   what is the vine more than other trees of the woods? It is certain that
   the vine produces very good fruit, and therefore is preferred to other
   trees: the very flower of the vine has a most, delicious scent; but the
   fruit which it produces proves its excellence. For the wood of the vine
   is without elegance and shapeless: it does not attain to any thickness;
   it is slender, pliable, and twisted. In looking at a vine, it. seems
   scarcely worth numbering among shrubs: if compared with trees, it
   clearly has no value; but in the excellency of trees something is
   easily acknowledged which surpasses all vines. For when we cast our
   eyes upon a branching tree, we are struck with admiration, while the
   vine lies at, our feet. If, therefore, a tree is compared with the wood
   of the vine, it will be praised for its beauty, while the vine will be
   despised as a low and insignificant wood. Hence God collects that the
   Jews were in no respect more excellent than others, unless because they
   are planted by himself, as he says in many places in Isaiah, O my vine,
   I have planted thee. (Isaiah 5.) Then in the 80th Psalm: he brought his
   vine out of Egypt, and planted and propagated it even to the sea,
   (Psalm 80:9-12; Jeremiah 2:21.)

   Now we understand the Prophet's meaning, namely, that the Jews
   excelled, indeed, in privileges, but not in nature, nor yet by
   themselves, but by the gratuitous kindness of God: and if other nations
   were compared with them, they had greater dignity than the Jews. And we
   know that other nations flourished in arts and wealth, in population,
   in warlike valor, and in other respects: the profane nations were like
   lofty trees which grow up and attract all eyes to themselves. But the
   Jews were like a vine which, being planted by God's hand, deserved more
   praise than the trees of the wood which were fruitless. Ezekiel now
   carries on the comparison at, greater length: if the vine is torn up,
   can its wood, says he, be fitted to any use? it will not make beams or
   tables, or any vessels; it will not make a peg or a hook on which to
   hang a hat or cloak, or anything of the kind. Since, then, the wood of
   the vine is useless when torn from the soil, and is of no use but for
   burning, hence the Jews are made acquainted with their condition since
   their excellence and worthiness depend on the mere good pleasure of
   God: since, as he planted them, he can pluck them up in a moment; and
   when they have been torn up, they will be altogether useless, and will
   be cast into the fire, while trees are of some use. But, the Prophet
   proceeds another step: if a bundle of twigs were cast into the fire,
   and the two extreme parts were burnt up, and the middle made dry, that
   scorched part would be much less useful. For since fire penetrates to
   the very marrow, wood, which is half consumed, is reduced to powder by
   the touch alone: He afterwards accommodates what he had said about the
   vine to the city of Jerusalem; therefore let us go on to the rest of
   the context.

   Ezekiel 15:6

   6. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; As the vine-tree among the trees
   of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give
   the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

   6. Propterea sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, Quemadmodum lignum vitis in
   ligno sylvae, quod posuli [60] in ignem ad consumptionem, sic dedi
   habitatores Hierusalem.


   Here the Prophet shows that the citizens of Jerusalem were cast into a
   fire, by which they suffered various kinds of death: for although they
   were not immediately and entirely consumed, yet the extremities were
   burnt off. For the whole region was laid waste all around, and the
   kingdom of Israel was entirely cut off: Jerusalem remained like the
   middle portion of the bundle. But the inhabitants of Jerusalem were so
   worn down by adversity, that they were like a stick burnt at both ends.
   Since this was so, we here perceive their great stupidity in persisting
   in contumacy, although God had humbled them so in various ways. Now,
   therefore, we understand the meaning of this point. But the words of
   the Prophet must be explained, what shall be, or what is the wood of
   the vine compared with other wood? Some translate, with the palm
   branch; others, with the wild vine; but both of these are foreign to
   the mind of the Prophet: especially the wild vine cannot have any place
   here. As far as the palm is concerned, what reference is there to the
   palm branch in the midst of a wood? for palms are not planted in woods
   amidst lofty trees. But since the wood, zmvrh, zemoreh, signifies
   boughs as well as palms, it agrees best with the sense to speak of
   every tree as branching. What, therefore, is the vine in comparison
   with every branching tree which is among the trees of the forest? Here
   the Prophet brings before us fruitless trees, but yet those which
   attract our notice by their beauty: and so he implies, if the Jews wish
   to compare themselves with the profane nations, they are not superior
   in any worthiness or elegance which they have naturally and of
   themselves. This must be diligently noticed; although God sometimes
   adopts those who excel in ability and learning, in warlike prowess, in
   riches, and in power, yet he gathers his Church as much as possible
   from lowly-born men, in whom no great splendor is refulgent, that they
   may be objects of wonder to the world. For what end, then, does God do
   this? for he could fashion his own elect, that they may be completely
   perfect in every way. But since we are too inclined to pride, it is
   necessary that our infirmity should always be set before our eyes to
   teach us modesty. For if nothing in us reminded us of our weakness, our
   worthiness would blind us, or turn away our eyes from ourselves, or
   intoxicate us with false glory. Hence God wishes us to be inferior to
   the profane, that we may learn always to acknowledge as received from
   him whatever he has gratuitously conferred upon us, and not to arrogate
   anything to ourselves when our humility is so plainly set before our
   eyes. But as far as concerns the Jews, they were, as we have said, like
   a vine, because their excellence was not natural, but external. God had
   fashioned them, as it were, from nothing; and although they were
   adorned with many remarkable gifts, yet they could claim nothing from
   themselves.

   Shall there be taken, says he, any wood from it to fashion it for any
   work? God here shows that the Jews were deservedly preferred to others,
   because he had planted them with his hand; for if they had been pulled
   out of the earth, he shows that the wood would be useless, since it
   could not be used for any purpose. And Christ uses the same simile
   (John 15:1-7), when he shows that we have no root in us by nature, nor
   yet sap or moisture or rigor, since we are a vine planted by our
   heavenly Father. But if he roots us up, nothing remains for us but to
   be cast into the fire and utterly burnt. Lastly, God shows that the
   Jews should be viler than the nations, if he took away from them
   whatever he gave them; and he admonishes them that their state has no
   firmness unless through his goodwill towards them. For if the Prophet
   had only said, that whatever the Jews had they owed to God, and for
   this reason were bound to his liberality, yet they might still exalt
   themselves. But it is added in the second place, that they remained
   safe day by day, as far as God spares them, cherishes, defends, and
   sustains them. Therefore the Prophet means this when he says, Shall it
   be taken to form any work from it, or will they take it for a peg to
   hang any vessels upon it. Behold, says he, it was given for
   consumption, and its two ends were burnt up. Here, as I said, he points
   out various calamities by which the Jews were almost struck down,
   though not subdued. For they were hardened in their obstinacy; and
   although they were like burnt and rotten wood, yet they boasted
   themselves to be perfect through their adoption, and through the
   covenant which God had made with Abraham: they boasted themselves to be
   a holy race, and a royal priesthood. Yet God reproves their sloth when
   he says theirs was like burnt wood, when a bundle of twigs has been
   cast into the fire, and there is some remnant so injured by the smoke
   as to be deprived of its strength.

   Behold, says he, when it was whole could it be formed into any work!
   How much less after the fire has consumed it. Here we pursues the same
   sentiment. If any one should take any part of the bundle after the fire
   had dried it, could he fit it for any work? If he should take the twig
   when whole, it would not be fit to receive any shaping: how much less
   could the burnt wood be used for a peg or anything else. If, then, not
   even a peg can be found in the entire bundle, when the stem is like an
   ember through being parched by fire, how can it be turned to any use?
   Now follows the application: as I have given the wood of the vine among
   woods, says he: verbally, in the wood of the forest. Hence gather we
   what I formerly said about the branch, that it agrees with trees and is
   not put for the wild vine or the palm branch: for he now says, simply,
   amidst all the wood of the forest. But he says that the wood of the
   vine was among the wood of the forest -- not because vines are merely
   planted there, but this comparison is used: that is, among woods, or
   even among all the woods of the forest, because these trees are felled,
   and destined for buildings, or vessels are made from them, and all
   kinds of wooden furniture, as well as the materials of houses, are
   taken from trees. He says, therefore, that the wood of the vine is
   given among the wood, of the forest, that is, among the woods of the
   forest, since the twigs are burnt, as they cannot be rendered useful to
   men: so have I given, says he, the citizens of Jerusalem

   Now after we understand the Prophet's meaning, let us learn that the
   Holy Spirit so addressed the Jews formerly, that this discourse might
   profit us in these days. We must perceive, in the first place, that we
   are superior to the whole world, through God's gratuitous pity: but
   naturally we have nothing of our own in which to boast. But if we carry
   ourselves haughtily, through reliance on God's gifts, this arrogance
   would be sacrilege: for we snatch away from God his own praise, and
   clothe ourselves, as it were, in his spoils. But Paul, when he speaks
   of the Jews, shortly, but clearly, defines both sides: Do we excel?
   says he -- (for he there makes himself one with the people) -- Do we
   excel the Gentiles? says he, (Romans 3:1); by no means: for Scripture
   denounces us all to be sinners -- all to be, accursed. Since,
   therefore, we are children of wrath, he says, there is nothing which we
   can claim to ourselves over the profane Gentiles. After he has so
   prostrated all the pride of his own nation, he repeats again -- What?
   Are we not superior to others? Yea, we excel in every way. For the
   adoption, and the worship, and the law of God, and the covenant, confer
   upon us remarkable superiority, and such as we find nothing like it in
   the whole world. How do those things agree? That the Jews excel, and
   are to be preferred to others, and yet that they excel in nothing!
   namely, since they have nothing in themselves to cause them to despise
   the Gentiles, or boast themselves superior; hence their excellence is
   not in themselves but in God. And so, Paul here does not commend their
   virtues, but says that they excel by gratuitous adoption, because God
   made his covenant with Abraham, and they were to arise from the holy
   nations, because he instituted a fixed line of piety among them, in
   promising himself to be a Father to them; nay, he determined that
   Christ should spring from them, who is the life and light of the world.
   We see, then, the former privileges of the Jews: ours is the same in
   these days. As often as we are favored with God's gifts, by which we
   approach near him and overcome the world, we ought also to remember
   what we were before God took us up. Then our origin will prostrate all
   arrogance, and prevent us from being ungrateful to God. But that is not
   yet sufficient; but we must come to the second clause, that not only
   has God's free grace raised us to such a height, but also sustains us;
   so that our standing is not founded in ourselves, but depends only on
   his will. Hence not only the remembrance of our origin ought to humble
   us, but the sense of our infirmity. Whence we gather that we have no
   perseverance in ourselves unless God daily, nay, momentarily strengthen
   us, and follow us up with his favor. This is the second point: the
   third is, if God afflicts or chastises us with his rods, we should know
   that the foolish confidence by which we deceive ourselves is by this
   means beaten out of us. Here we ought diligently to weigh the meaning
   of the phrase -- the wood of the vine is useless when it is torn up,
   and especially when dry. For although the profane nations perish, yet
   it is not surprising if God's judgments are more severe towards the
   reprobate, who had obtained a place in his Church, and who had been
   enriched with his spiritual gifts. This ingratitude requires us to
   become an example to others, so that the whole world may be astonished
   at beholding in us such dreadful signs of God's anger. Hence the Jews
   were for a hissing and an abhorrence, an astonishment and a curse to
   the profane nations. Why so? They had more grievously exasperated God
   who had acted so liberally towards them, and were not only ungrateful
   and perfidious, but had purposely provoked him. Thus also it happens to
   other reprobates. So this clause is to be diligently noticed, when the
   Prophet says that the wood of the vine is cast into the fire, although
   trees, when cut down, are still useful either for building or for
   furniture. Now it follows --

   Ezekiel 15:7-8

   7. And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one
   fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am
   the LORD, when I set my face against them.

   7. Et ponam faciem meam in ipsos: ex igni egredientur, et ignis vorabit
   [61] eos: et scietis quod ego Iehovah, cum posuero faciem meam in
   ipsis. [62]

   8. And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a
   trespass, saith the Lord GOD.

   8. Et ponam terram in vastitatem, quia transgressi sunt transgressione
   [63] dicit Dominator Iehovah.


   He confirms what had been said in the last verse, and at the same time
   explains it: as if the citizens of Jerusalem retained some form,
   because they were not reduced to dust; but the fire had burnt all round
   them, as if the flame was licking a bundle of twigs. While the royal
   seat remained to them, the name of a people remained, and hence an
   opportunity for their obstinacy. For they were not to be subdued, since
   they were not entirely consumed: and now another madness is added; for
   as soon as they had escaped from any misfortune, they thought
   themselves quite safe, -- "O now we shall rest," said they; if the
   enemy had departed from the city, or if new forces had not arrived
   against them, or if provisions failed the enemy's troops, they
   immediately regained their courage, and not only breathed again, but
   proudly laughed at God and his prophets, as if they were beyond all
   danger. For this reason he now says, I have set my face against them.
   To set, or, if any one prefers it, to establish one's face, is to
   persist constantly, so as not only to do anything on passing, but to
   remain there until we have accomplished our intention; so that those
   are not bad expounders of the Prophet who say, "I have set my face
   firmly:" they do not translate verbally, but according to God's
   meaning. For he often chastises a whole nation or city, and yet he does
   not set his face, that is, he does not stay there, but chastises them
   lightly, and but for a short time, as if passing in another direction.
   But he means something else here -- that he would set his face; that
   is, never desist until the people's name, as well as their city, was
   utterly abolished. For we have said that the prophets speak of the
   present state of the people when they threaten such destruction. I will
   set my face, therefore, against them: they shall escape from one fire,
   and another shall devour them. Here the Prophet strikes down that
   foolish opinion by which the Jews deceived themselves. For if they
   escaped from one danger, they thought it the last, and hence their
   security, and even obstinacy. But the Prophet says here, after they had
   escaped from one fire, that a new fire to consume them was lighted up:
   he means, that there were different means in God's hand by which he
   destroys and extinguishes a people: as he had previously said, that he
   was armed with pestilence and the sword, and famine and wild beasts; so
   now under the name of fire he comprehends various scourges. If,
   therefore, men have escaped the sword, a new attack shall inter them,
   since God will press them with famine, or urge them with pestilence, or
   in other ways: and then, they shall know, says he, that I am Jehovah,
   when I shall set my face against it. By these words he signifies that
   his glory could not otherwise remain safe, since impunity blinded the
   Jews -- nay, hardened them till they became like the brutes. If,
   therefore, God had spared them, his glory would have been as it were
   buried, and through so long a connivance he had been no longer
   acknowledged as God. There was a real necessity for so much rigor:
   since he would never show himself to be God otherwise than by
   destroying the impious who were so stupefied by their sins as long as
   he bore with them. At length he adds, I will lay the land waste since
   they have prevaricated by prevarication. Here, also, God expresses how
   terrible, yet just, was that judgment, because the Jews were no
   trifling offenders, but perfidiously departed from his worship, and
   from the whole teaching of the law, and were obstinate in their
   ingratitude. Since they were so abandoned, we gather that God was not
   too severe when he put forth his hand to destroy them utterly.

   Grant. Almighty God, since you have not only deigned to separate us
   from the common herd of men, but also to renew your image in us: and
   while thy favors towards us are conspicuous you exhort us at the same
   time to glorify thy name: Grant that being mindful of our calling we
   may study to devote ourselves wholly to thee and so to extol thee by
   peculiar and true and rightful praises, that we may be at length
   partakers of the glory to which you invite us, and which has been

   CHAPTER 16
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:

   1. Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

   1. Et fuit sermo Iehovae ad me, dicendo,

   2. Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

   2. Fili hominis, indica [64] Hierosolymae suas abominationes,

   3. And say, Thus says the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy
   nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy
   mother an Hittite.

   3. Sic dices, Sic dicit Dominator Iehovah Hierosolymae, habitationes
   tuae, et natales tui e terra Chanaan: pater tuus Amorrhaeus, mater tua
   Hithaea, et quae sequuntur.


   This chapter contains very severe [5]reproaches against the people of
   Judea who were left at Jerusalem. For although Ezekiel had been a
   leader to the Israelites and the Jewish exiles, yet God wished his
   assistance in profiting others. Hence the office which God had imposed
   upon his Prophet is now extended to the citizens of Jerusalem, whose
   abominations he is ordered to make manifest. The manner is afterwards
   expressed, when God shows the condition of that nation before he
   embraced it with his favor. But after recounting the benefits by which
   he had adorned the people, he reproves their ingratitude, and shows in
   many words, and by different figures, how detestable was their perfidy
   in revolting: so far from God after he had treated them so liberally.
   These things will now be treated in their own order. As to Ezekiel's
   being ordered to lay bare to the Jews their abominations, we gather
   from this that men are often so blinded by their vices that they do not
   perceive what is sufficiently evident to every one else. And we know
   that the people was quite drunk with pride, for they voluntarily
   blinded themselves by their own flatteries. It is not surprising, then,
   that God orders them to bring their abominations into the midst, so
   that they may at length feel themselves to be sinners. And this passage
   is worthy of notice, since we think those admonitions superfluous until
   God drags us into the light, and places our sins before our eyes. There
   is no one, indeed, whose conscience does not reprove him, since God's
   law is written on the hearts of all, and so we naturally distinguish
   between good and evil; but if we think how great our stupidity is
   concealing our faults, we shall not wonder that the prophets uttered
   this command, to lay open our abominations to ourselves. For not only
   is that self-knowledge of which I have spoken cold, but also involved
   in much darkness, so that he who is but partially conscious grows
   willingly hardened while he indulges himself. Again, we must remember
   that the Jews were to be argued with in this way, because they pleased
   themselves with their own superstitions. For the Prophet shows that
   their chief wickedness consisted in deserting God's law, in
   prostituting themselves to idols, and in setting up adulterous worship
   like houses of ill fame; but in this they pleased themselves, as we
   daily see in the papacy, that under this pretext the foulest idolatries
   are disguised, since they think themselves to be thereby worshipping
   God.

   It is not surprising, then, if God here obliquely blames the stupidity
   and sloth of the Jews when he commands their abominations to be laid
   open, which are already sufficiently known to all. Afterwards, that God
   may begin to show how improperly the people were behaving, he recalls
   them to the first origin or fountain of their race. But we must notice
   that God speaks differently of the origin of the people. For sometimes
   he reminds them of Abraham's condition before he had stretched forth
   his hand and dragged them, as it were, from the lowest regions into
   life, as it is said in the last chapter of Joshua, (Joshua 24:2, 3,)
   Thy father Abraham was worshipping idols when God adopted him. But
   sometimes the beginning is made from the covenant of God, when he chose
   Abraham with his posterity for himself. But in this passage God takes
   the time from the period of the small band of men emerging by wonderful
   increase into a nation, although they had been so wretchedly oppressed
   in Egypt; for the redemption of the people which immediately followed
   is called sometimes their nativity. So here God says that the Jews were
   there born when they increased so incredibly, though when oppressed by
   the Egyptian tyranny they had scarcely any place among living men. And
   what he says of Jews applies equally to all the posterity of Abraham:
   for the condition of the ten tribes was the same as that of Judea. But
   since the Prophet speaks to a people still surviving, he is silent
   about what he would have said, if he had been commanded to utter this
   mandate to the exiles and captives, as well as to the citizens of
   Jerusalem. Whatever its meaning, God here pronounces that the Jews
   sprang from the land of Canaan, from an Amorite father, and from a
   Hittite mother

   A question arises here -- When God had adopted Abraham two hundred
   years previously, why was not that covenant taken into account? for he
   here seems not to magnify his own faithfulness and the constancy of his
   promise when he rejects the Jews as sprung from the Canaanites or
   Amorites; but this only shows what they were in themselves: for
   although he never departed from his purpose, and his election was never
   in vain, yet we must hold, as far as the people were concerned, that
   they are looked upon as profane Gentiles. For we know how they
   corrupted themselves in Egypt. Since, then, they were so degenerate and
   so utterly unlike their fathers, it is not surprising if God says that
   they were sprung from Canaanites and Amorites. For by Hosea he says,
   that they were all born of a harlot, and that the place of their birth
   was a house of ill fame. (Hosea 2:4.) This must be understood
   metaphorically: since here God does not; chide the women who had been
   false to their husbands, and had borne an adulterous offspring; but he
   simply means that the Jews were unworthy of being called or reputed
   Abraham's seed. Why so? for although God remained firm in his covenant,
   yet if we consider the character of the Jews, they had entirely cut
   themselves off by their faithlessness. Since, then, they did not differ
   from the profane Gentiles, they are deservedly rejected with reproach,
   and are called an offspring of Canaan, as in other places. Now
   therefore, we understand the intention of the Prophet, or rather of the
   Holy Spirit. For if God had only said that he would pity that race when
   reduced to extreme misery, it would not have been subjected to such
   severe and heavy reproof, as we shall see. Hence God not only relates
   his kindness towards them, but at the same time shows from what state
   he had taken the Jews when he first aided them, and what, was their
   condition when he deigned to draw them out of such great misery.
   Moreover, since he was at hand to take them up, their redemption was
   founded on covenant, and so they were led forth, because God had
   promised Abraham four centuries ago that he would be the liberator of
   the people. That they should not be ignorant of the favor by which God
   had bound himself to Abraham, the Prophet meets them, and pronounces
   them a seed of Canaan, having nothing in common with Abraham, because,
   as far as they were concerned, according to common usage, God's promise
   was extinct, and their adoption dead and buried. Since they had acted
   so perfidiously, they could no longer boast themselves to be Abraham's
   children. Hence he says, thy habitations, that is, the place of their
   origin. Jerome translates it "root;" but the word "nativity" suits
   better, or native soil, or condition of birth in the land of Canaan:
   and thy father an Amorite and thy mother a Hittite There were other
   tribes of Canaan, but two or three kinds are put here for the whole.
   Now it follows --

   Ezekiel 16:4-5

   4. And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not
   cut, neither wast you washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not
   salted at all, nor swaddled at all.

   4. Et nativitates tuae in die qua nata es tu [65] non praecisus fuit
   umbilicus tuus, aquis non fuisti lota, ad mollitiem [66] sale non
   fuisti salita, et non fuisti involuta fasciis. [67]

   5. None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
   compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the
   lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.

   5. Non misertus est super te oculus faciendum tibi unum ex his ad
   considerandum super te et projecta fuisti in superficie agri, in
   probrum animae tuae quo die nata es.


   Here the Prophet metaphorically describes that most miserable state in
   which God found the Jews. For we know that scarcely any nation was ever
   so cruelly and disgracefully oppressed. For when they were all driven
   to servile labor without reward, the edict went forth that their males
   should be cut off. (Exodus 1:16, 22.) No species of disgrace was
   omitted, and their life was worse than a hundred deaths. This, then, is
   the reason why God says that the Jews were so cast forth on the face of
   the earth without any supply of the common necessaries of life. He
   takes these figures from customary usage; for it is usual to cut the
   navel-string of infants: for the navel affords them nourishment in
   their mothers' womb, and mother and child would both perish unless a
   separation took place; and if the navel-string were not tied the child
   would perish; for all the blood flows through that organ, as the child
   received its sustenance through it: and this is the midwife's chief
   care as soon as the child is born, to cut away what must afterwards be
   restored to its place, and to bind up the part, and to do it, as I have
   said, with the greatest care, as the infant's life depends upon it.

   But God says, that the navel-string of the Jews is not cut off. Why so?
   because they were cast, says he, on the surface of the earth; that is,
   they were deserted and exposed, -- using but a single word. He now
   adds, they were not washed with water: for we know how young infants
   require ablution; and unless it be performed immediately, they will
   perish. Hence he says, they were not washed with water. He adds, to
   soften or refresh, or "fettle" them, as the common phrase is; for water
   softens and smoothes the skin, though others translate it in the sense
   of causing it to shine: but we understand the Prophet's meaning
   sufficiently. He afterwards adds, they were not rubbed with salt; for
   salt is sprinkled on the body of an infant to harden the flesh, while
   care must be taken not to render it too hard; and this moderate
   hardness is effected by the sprinkling of salt. The full meaning is,
   that the Jews at their birth were cast out with such contempt, that
   they were destitute of the necessary care which life requires. He adds,
   No eye pitied thee, so as to discharge any of these duties, and to show
   thee pity: and this is sufficiently evident, since the Israelites would
   have been destroyed had no one taken compassion on them; for they were
   in some sense buried in the land of Egypt; for we know how cruel was
   the conspiracy of the whole land against them. No wonder, then, if God
   here relates that they were cast upon the surface of the land, so that
   no eye looked upon them and showed them pity. He adds, they were cast
   to the loathing of their life. He simply means, that they were so
   despicable that they had no standing among men; for loathing of life
   means the same as rejection. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 16:6

   6. And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood,
   I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto
   thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Live.

   6. Et transivi juxta te, et vidi te foedatam [68] in sanguinibus tuis:
   et dixi tibi, in sanguinibus tuis, Vive: et dixi tibi, in sanguinibus
   tuis, Vive.


   I have already explained the time to which the Prophet alludes, when
   the seed of Abraham began to be tyrannically oppressed by the
   Egyptians. For God here assumes the character of a traveler when he
   says that he passed by. For he had said that the Jews and all the
   Israelites were like a girl cast forth and deserted. Now, therefore, he
   adds, that this spectacle met him as he passed by: as those who travel
   cast their eyes on either side, and if anything unusual occurs they
   attend and consider it; meanwhile God declares that he was taking care
   of his people. And truly the matter is sufficiently evident, since he
   seemed to have neglected those wretched ones, while he had wonderfully
   assisted them. For they might have perished a hundred times a-day, and
   if he had not taken notice of them, they had not dragged out their life
   to the end. That celebrated sentence is well known -- I have seen, I
   have seen, the affliction of my people. When he sent for Moses and
   commanded him to liberate the people, he prefaces it in this way, I
   have seen, I have seen. (Exodus 3:7) Hence he had long ago seen, though
   he seemed to despise them by shutting his eyes. There is no doubt that
   the doubling of the word here means that God always watched for the
   safety of this desperate people, although he did not assist them
   directly: he now means the same thing when he says, that he passed by:
   I passed by, then, near thee, and saw thee defiled with blood. That
   spectacle could not turn away God's eyes; for whatever is contrary to
   nature excites horror. God therefore here shows how compassionate he
   was towards the people, because he was not horrified by that
   disgraceful foulness, when he saw the infant so immersed in its own
   gore without any shape. As to the following phrase, I said to thee, he
   does not mean that he spoke openly so that the people heard his voice,
   but he announces what he had determined concerning the people. The
   expression, live in thy blood, may indeed be taken contemptuously, as
   if God had grudged moving his hand, lest the very touch should prove
   contagious; for we do not willingly touch any putrid gore. The words,
   live in thy blood, may be thus explained, since at first God did not
   deign to take care of the people. But it is evident from the context,
   that God here expresses the secret virtue by which the people was
   preserved contrary to the common feelings. For if we consider what has
   been previously said, the people surely had not lived a single day,
   unless it had received rigor from this voice of God. For if a new-born
   child is cast out, how can it bear the cold of the night? surely it
   will instantly expire: and I have already said that death is prepared
   for infants, unless their navel-string be cut. Since therefore a
   hundred deaths encompassed the people, they could never have continued
   alive, had not the secret voice of God sustained them.

   God therefore in commanding them to live, already shows that he was
   willingly and wonderfully preserving them amidst various kinds of
   death. As it is said in the 68th psalm, (Psalm 68:20,) "In his hands
   are the issues of death," so that death is converted into life: since
   he is the sovereign and lord of both. But this phrase is doubled, since
   the people were afflicted in Egypt for no short period. But if that
   tyranny had endured only a few years, they must have been consumed. But
   their slavery was protracted to many years: whence that remarkable
   wonder occurred, that their remembrance and their name were not often
   cut off. We see then that God has reason enough to speak that sentence
   in which the safety of the people was included, live in thy bloods,
   live in thy bloods. The fact itself shows the people to have been
   preserved, since it pleased God. The history which Moses relates in the
   book of Exodus is a glass in which we may behold the living image of
   that life of which we have made mention as drawing its whole vigor from
   the secret good pleasure of God. Now the reason is asked why God did
   not openly and directly take up his people, and treat them as kindly as
   he did during their youth? The reason is sufficiently manifest, since
   if the people had been freed at the very first, the memory of the
   benefit would have by and by vanished away, and God's power would have
   been more obscure. For we know that men, unless thoroughly convinced of
   their own misery, never acknowledge that they have obtained safety
   through God's pity. The people then thought so to live, as always to
   have death before their eyes -- nay, as if they were bound by the
   chains of death. It lived, then, in bloods, that is, in the tomb, like
   a carcass remaining in its own putridness, and its life in the meantime
   lying hid: so it happened to the sons of Abraham. Now then we
   understand God's intention why he did not raise up the children of
   Abraham with grandeur from the beginning, but suffered them to drag out
   a miserable life, and to be steeped in the very pollution of death. It
   now follows --

   Ezekiel 16:7

   7. I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou
   hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent
   ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas
   thou wast naked and bare.

   7. Et magnam te feci quasi germen agri: [69] et crevisti, et
   adolevisti, [70] et venisti in ornamentum ornamentorum: [71] ubera tua
   aptata sunt, [72] et pilus tuus germinavit: tu autem nuda et
   discooperta eras.


   Here what I lately touched upon is now clearly expressed, that the
   people in their extreme distress were not only safe, but increased by
   God's singular favor. For if the infant after exposure retains its
   life, it will still be a weak abortion. Hence God here by this
   circumstance magnifies his favor, since the people increased as if it
   had been properly and attentively cared for, and as if no kind office
   had been omitted. This is the meaning of the words they were increased;
   for though he looks to the propagation of Abraham's family, yet the
   simile is to be observed, for the people is compared to a girl exposed
   in a field from its birth, and their growth took place when God
   increased them so incredibly, as we know. And surely God's blessing was
   great when they entered Egypt, 75 in number, and were many thousands
   when they left it. (Acts 7:14; Exodus 12:37.) For within 250 years, the
   family of Abraham was so multiplied, that they amounted to 800,000 when
   God freed them. But since the Prophet speaks metaphorically, when he
   says the people were increased, and, under the image of a tender girl,
   until they grew up to a proper age; meanwhile he shows that this was
   done only by the wonderful counsel and power of God. I placed thee,
   says he. God claims to himself the praise for this great
   multiplication, and then strengthens what I have said, namely, that the
   people's safety was included in that phrase live in bloods: then he
   says, she came into ornament of ornaments. Here dy, gnedi, cannot mean
   any occasional ornament, since it is added directly, thou wast naked
   and bare. It follows then that it refers to personal comeliness. It
   means not only that the girl grew in loftiness of stature but in beauty
   of person. Hence elegance and loveliness are here marked, as the
   context shows us. Thou camest then to excellent or exquisite beauty,
   for we know this to be the meaning of the genitive, signifying
   excellence. He adds at the same time, thy breasts were made ready, for
   kvn, kon, means to prepare, to strengthen: but as he is speaking of
   breasts, I have no doubt that he means them to have swelled as they
   ought to do. Thy breasts then were fashioned, that is, of the right
   size, as in marriageable girls. Thy hair also grew long. Finally, the
   Prophet expresses thus grossly what he could have said more concisely,
   in consequence of the people's rudeness. Thy hair grew long, whilst
   thou wast naked and bare; that is, as yet you had no outward ornament,
   you was like a marriageable girl -- you had great beauty of person, a
   noble stature, and all parts of thy body mutually accordant, but you
   had cause to be ashamed of thy nakedness. And such was the condition of
   the people since the Egyptians devised everything against them, and
   conspired by all means for their destruction: we see then how God
   stretched forth his hand not only for the people's defense, but to
   carry them forth against the tyranny of Pharaoh and of all Egypt. He
   points out the time of their redemption as near, because the people had
   increased and multiplied, just like a girl who had reached her
   twentieth year. Now it follows --

   Ezekiel 16:8

   8. Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time
   was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy
   nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with
   thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.

   8. Et transivi juxta te, et vidi te; et ecce tempus tuum tempus amorum:
   et extendi alam meam [73] super te, et texi nuditatem tuam, [74] et
   juravi tibi, et veni in foedus tecum, dicit Dominator Iehovah: et
   fuisti mea.


   God now reproaches the Jews with his kindness towards them, since he
   had clothed them in splendid ornaments, and yet they afterwards cast
   themselves into the vilest lusts, as we shall see. But we must remember
   that the Prophet is now speaking of the time of their liberation. But
   God says that he passed by again and saw the state of the people, --
   not that he had ever forgotten it. For we know that even when he
   dissembles and seems to shut his eyes and turn them from us or even to
   sleep, yet he is always anxious for our safety. And we have already
   said that there was need of his present power, that the people might
   prolong their lives, since if he had not breathed life into them, a
   hundred deaths would have immediately prevailed. But it is sufficiently
   common and customary to mark an open declaration of help by God's
   aspect. When God appears so openly to deliver us that it may be
   comprehended by our senses, then he is said to look down upon us, to
   rise up, and to turn himself towards us. He passed by, then, near the
   people, namely, when he called Moses out of the desert and appointed
   him the minister of his favor, (Exodus 3,) he then saw his people, and
   proved by their trial that he had not utterly cast them away. I looked,
   then, and behold thy time, thy time of years. Here God speaks grossly,
   yet according to the people's comprehension. For he personates a man
   struck with the beauty of a girl and offering her marriage. But God is
   not affected as men are, as we well know, so that it is not according
   to his nature to love as young men do. But such was the people's
   stupidity, that they could not be usefully taught, unless the Prophet
   accommodated himself to their grossness. Add also that the people had
   been by no means lovely, unless God had embraced them by his kindness,
   so that his love depended on his good pleasure towards them. So by the
   time of loves, we ought to understand the complete time of their
   redemption, for God had determined to bring the people out of Egypt
   when he pleased, and that had been promised to Abraham: after four
   hundred years I will be their avenger. (Genesis 15:13, 14; Acts 7:6,
   7,) We see, then, that the years were previously fixed in which God
   would redeem the people. He now compares that union to a marriage.
   Hence if God would bind his people to himself by a marriage, so also he
   would pledge himself to conjugal fidelity. But I cannot proceed further
   -- I must leave the rest till tomorrow.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since from our first origin we have been entirely
   accursed, so that we were entirely foul and polluted in thy sight, that
   we may be mindful of our condition, and acknowledge your inestimable
   pity towards us, since you have deigned to draw us from the lowest
   estate, and to adopt us among thy children: and may we so desire to
   spend our whole life in obedience to thee, that we may at length enjoy
   that blessed glory to which you has called us, and which you have
   prepared for us in your only-begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Lecture Forty-Third.

   We began yesterday to explain another point of which the Prophet
   treats, namely, the liberation of the people. For then was the fitting
   time in which God espoused them to himself. He now adds, that he spread
   out the skirt of his garment to cover the foulness and disgrace of the
   people. This spreading comprehends all the virtues which God exercised
   in freeing his people. For he then delivered them from all reproaches
   by which they were shamefully and disgracefully treated in Egypt. Some
   think that it was a nuptial rite for a spouse or husband to cover the
   bride with his garment, but this is only a conjecture. Hence I simply
   interpret it, the border of the garment was spread out, when God
   vindicated his people from the reproaches by which they had been
   deformed. He afterwards adds, and I have sworn to thee, and come into
   covenant with thee. There is no doubt that this thought to be referred
   to the promulgation of the law. For although God had long ago made a
   covenant with Abraham, and the adoption of the people was founded upon
   it, yet that favor on the people's part had almost vanished away, as I
   yesterday said; hence God pronounces that he had, as it were, adopted
   the people afresh. It was like the renewal of the covenant, when God
   bound the people to himself by a fixed law, and prescribed a fixed
   method of worship. These, then, were the accustomed marriage rites. But
   God deservedly announces that he had come into covenant, because he
   then coupled the people to himself; whence also that eulogy of Moses --
   What nation is so illustrious under heaven, which has God so near them,
   as thy God approaches unto thee? You shall be to me a kingdom of
   priests; you shall be my inheritance. (Deuteronomy 4:7; Exodus 19:6.)
   We should remark the word swear as emphatic, for God increases his
   indulgence when he says that he swore. If we think of the majesty of
   God, and of what his people was, this is surely incredible, that God
   should deign to descend so far as to swear like men accustomed to
   pledge their faith, and to sanction it by an oath. Now, therefore, we
   see the singular benefit expressed here with which God adorned his
   people, when, at the giving of the law, he chose them as his own, and
   appointed them to be a kingdom of priests. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 16:9

   9. Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy
   blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

   9. Et lavi te aquis, et mundavi [75] sanguines tuos abs te [76] et unxi
   te oleo.


   Here God more clearly explains what had been formerly touched upon,
   namely, that he then married the people, as a young man marries his
   bride. But he here states that he endowed her; for they would not have
   been sufficiently adopted by God unless they had been adorned with
   superior presents; since if they had been left in that miserable
   slavery by which they were oppressed, God's favor would have been very
   obscure. Now, therefore, God means, that by his law he had entered into
   a new covenant with his people, so that he did not leave them naked and
   bare, but clothed with remarkable gifts. First of all, he says, I
   washed thee with water. Although he had just said that the people were
   like a beautiful damsel, and had praised their beauty, yet the filth of
   which the prophet had spoken yet remained: it ought, therefore, to be
   cleansed from those stains: I have cleansed thee with water, says he,
   and washed off thy bloods, namely, the corrupt blood which the damsel
   whom Ezekiel mentions had retained from her birth. Lastly, Ezekiel says
   that God performed those offices which the nurse discharges for the
   child. Afterwards he adds --

   Ezekiel 16:10-13

   10. I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
   badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered
   thee with silk.

   10. Et vestivi te Phrygionica veste, [77] et calceavi te taxo, [78] et
   cinxi te bysso, et operui te serico.

   11. I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
   hands, and a chain on thy neck.

   11. Et ornavi te ornatu, et posui armillas in manibus tuis, et torquem
   in collo tuo.

   12. And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and
   a beautiful crown upon thine head.

   12. Et posui circulum super faciem tuam, [79] et inaures super aures
   tuas, et coronam decoris in capite tuo. [80]

   13. Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of
   fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; you didst eat fine flour, and
   honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst
   prosper into a kingdom.

   13. Et ornata fuisti auro et argento, et vestitus tuus byssus, et
   sericum [81] et variegatus: [82] similam, et mel, et oleum comedisti,
   et pulchra fuisti in valde valde, [83] et prospere [84] progressa es
   usque ad regnum.


   Here the Prophet, in a metaphor, relates other benefits of God by which
   he liberally adorned his people; for we know that nothing has been
   omitted in God's pouring forth the riches of his goodness on the
   people. And as to the explanations which some give of these female
   ornaments allegorically, I do not approve of it, as they fruitlessly
   conjecture many trifles which are at variance with each other. First of
   all, their conjectures may be refuted by the Prophet's words: then, if
   we suffer the Prophet's words to be turned and twisted, what these
   allegorical interpreters chatter with each other is entirely contrary
   in their meaning. Let us, therefore, be content with the genuine sense,
   that God was so generous towards the Israelites that he poured forth
   all his blessings in enriching them. Now, if one asks how the people
   were adorned? I answer, in two ways -- first, God embraced them with
   his favor, and promised to be their God, and this was their chief
   honor; as Moses says they were naked, and their shame was discovered
   when they set up an idol in the place of God. He now adds a second kind
   of blessing, when God took care of them in the desert: he appeared by
   day in a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire: the water flowed for
   them from the rock; daily food was given them from heaven, as if God
   with his own hands had placed it within their mouths: then in his
   strength they conquered their enemies, and entered the promised land;
   while he slew the nations for them, and gave them quiet possession and
   dominion there: then he blessed the land, so that it nourished them
   abundantly, and made it testify that it was no vain promise that the
   land should flow with milk and honey. (Exodus 3:17; Exodus 13:21, 22;
   Exodus 16:15,16; Exodus 17:6; Exodus 22:25; Numbers 20:11.) Ezekiel
   includes all these things under necklaces, bracelets, gold, silver,
   linen garments, broidered work, etc. As to the particular words I will
   not, accurately insist, unless I shortly touch on a point or two which
   may occasion doubt.

   When he says that he clothed them, rqmh, rekmeh, this is in accordance
   with eastern customs: for they were accustomed to use clothing of
   different colors; as Benjamin wore a dress of this kind when he was a
   boy; and this was no royal splendor on his father's part, who was a
   shepherd, but simply the usual custom. At this day, indeed, if any one
   among us wore a party colored garment, it would not be manly: nay,
   women who desire such variety in colors show themselves to have cast
   off all modesty. But among the Orientals, as I have said, this was the
   usual kind of dress. He afterwards adds, I shod thee with badgers'
   skin. I know not why Jerome translates it violet-colored, and others
   hyacinth: it is sufficiently clear that it was a precious kind of skin.
   The word is often used by Moses when treating of the tabernacle; for
   the coverings were of violet-colored skin, and the whole tabernacle was
   covered with them. The badger was an animal unknown to us: but since he
   is here treating of shoes, there is no doubt that the skin was more
   elegant, and more highly esteemed by God. (Exodus 35:23; 36:19.)
   Afterwards he adds, I bound thee with fine linen. We know that linen
   garments were in more frequent use among that people than in Greece or
   in Italy, or in these parts: for linen was rarely used by the Romans
   even in their greatest luxury; but in the East they wore linen, as that
   region is very warm. But we know that linen is very fine, and that they
   were accustomed to weave transparent veils. Now this clothing was
   commonly worn by men in the East, though it is by no means manly: nay,
   in women it is scarcely tolerable. But the priests afterwards adopted
   the custom, and clothed themselves in linen while performing sacred
   rites. The Papal priests too -- apes in all things -- have imitated the
   custom; and although they do not wear fine linen, yet use linen robes,
   which they call surplices.

   He now adds, and I covered thee with silk, or silken garments, or silk
   cloth. He adds, that he placed bracelets upon the hands: barbarians
   call them armlets. This luxury was spread abroad almost everywhere; but
   the circular ornament which the Prophet adds to it was rejected by
   other nations. He puts a chain round the neck: chains were in common
   use as they are this day: nay, to necklaces were added looser chains --
   double, threefold, and fourfold; for this fault was too common. And
   what he afterwards adds of the ring was left to the Orientals, for they
   had jewels hanging from their nostrils: and I wonder why interpreters
   put earrings here, and then instead of earrings put nose-rings. But the
   Prophet here means a ring, whence a jewel was hung from the nose; and
   this with us is ridiculous and deforming: but in those barbarous
   regions both men and women have gems hanging from both their noses and
   ears. He adds, a crown on thy head. He does not mean a diadem or crown
   as a sign of royalty, but an ornament sufficiently common.

   If any one makes any inquiry about these various kinds of dresses,
   whether it was lawful for women to use so many ornaments, the answer is
   easy, that the Prophet here does not approve of what he relates, but
   uses a common image. We said that his only intention was to show that
   God could not have treated his people more freely; since in every way
   he had unfolded the incomparable treasures of his beneficence in
   adorning the Israelites. He now describes this in a metaphor, and under
   figures taken from the common practice everywhere received. It does not
   follow, therefore, that women ought to adorn themselves in this way.
   For we know that superfluous ornaments are temptations; and we know
   also the vanity of women, and their ambition to show themselves off, as
   the saying is: and we see how sharply this eager desire of women is
   blamed, especially by Isaiah. (Isaiah 3.) But it is sufficient to
   elicit what God wished to teach by these figures, namely, that he had
   not omitted any kind of liberality. Whence it follows, that the
   people's ingratitude was the less excusable, as Ezekiel will
   immediately add. But before we proceed further, we must turn this
   instruction to our use. What has hitherto been said of the Israelites
   does not suit us, I confess, in all things: but yet there is some
   likeness between us and them. If we reflect upon our origin, we are all
   born children of wrath, all cursed, all Satan's bondsmen, (Ephesians
   2:3;) and although many have been well brought up, yet as to our
   spiritual state we are like infant children or the new-born babe,
   exposed and immersed in its own filth and corruption. For what can be
   found in man before his renewal but the curse of God? Hence we are such
   slaves of Satan, that God hates us, as it is said in Genesis, (Genesis
   6:7,) I repent of having formed man; where he does not acknowledge his
   image in us, which is not only defiled by original sin, but is all but
   extinct, surely this is the height of deformity: and though we do not
   perceive what is said by our senses, yet we are sufficiently detestable
   before God and the angels. We have no cause, then, to please ourselves;
   nay, if we open our eyes, the foulness which I have mentioned will be
   sufficiently clear to us. Meanwhile, God so aided us that he truly
   fulfilled what Ezekiel relates. For although we were not freed from any
   external tyranny, yet God espoused us: then he adopted us into his
   Church: this was our greatest honor; this was more than royal dignity.
   We see, then, that this instruction is useful for us also at this time,
   if we only consider in what we are like the ancient people. I had
   almost omitted one point -- the nourishment. God here not only reminds
   them that he had adorned the people with various kinds of clothing, and
   necklaces, and gems, and silver; but he adds also, you did eat fine
   flour, or fine meal, and honey and oil, and you was very beautiful, and
   proceeded prosperously, even to a kingdom. Here God again commends and
   extols his beneficence, because he not only clothed sumptuously his
   spouse of whom he speaks, but also fed her plentifully with the best,
   and sweetest, and most delicate food. He puts only three species: he
   makes no mention of will or flesh; but by fine flour he means that they
   lacked no delicacy: the oil and honey mean the same thing. This clause
   points out an accumulation of grace when he says that they progressed
   happily even to a kingdom: all God's benefits could not be recounted:
   he says that his bride was not only magnificently clothed and
   delicately brought up, but that she proceeded even to the royal
   dignity. In the next verse he still reminds them of his benefits.

   Ezekiel 16:14

   14. And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it
   was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the
   Lord GOD.

   14. Et egressum tibi fuit nomen in gentibus in pulchritudine tua: [85]
   quia perfecta fuisti in decore quem posueram super te, dicit Dominator
   Iehovah.


   Here the Prophet still continues to recite those blessings of God by
   which he had bound the people to himself. As to his saying, that its
   name had gone forth, it cannot be restricted to a short period; but it
   embraces a continued series of God's favors until the people reached
   the highest point of happiness; and this happened under David. There is
   no doubt that God here means that he was so continually liberal towards
   the people that their fame became celebrated, for the name of the
   Israelites were spread far and wide; and God deservedly recounts their
   nobility or celebrity of fame among his benefits: hence he adds, on
   account of the beauty or elegance which I have placed upon thee, says
   he; because you was perfect through the ornament which I had placed
   upon thee. Here, therefore, God signifies that the people had not
   earned their fame by their own virtue, nor were they noble through
   their own native excellence, so to speak; but rather by ornament
   bestowed upon them. You, therefore, was of great name among the
   nations, said he. But wherein was that nobility and excellence?
   Certainly from my gifts. For nothing was accomplished by thyself so to
   arrive at a name and dignity more than royal. Through that ornament thy
   fame was spread abroad among the nations. But this enlargement must be
   noticed, since the people had not only experienced God's goodness in
   that corner of Judea, but, when they ought to be content with their
   lot, were held in admiration and repute among foreigners. Now follows
   the reproof --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [85] Or, "on account of thy beauty." -- Calvin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:15

   15. But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot
   because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one
   that passed by; his it was.

   15. Et confisa es in pulchritudine tua, et fornicata es pro nomine tuo,
   [86] et effudisti fornicationes tuas ad omnem transeuntem; [87] illius
   fuit.


   Here God begins to expostulate with his people; and with this view
   relates all the benefits which for a long time he had bestowed upon the
   Israelites, and especially upon the tribe of Judea. The Prophet now
   addresses them. Nothing was more unworthy or preposterous than for the
   Jews to be proud through the pretext of God's gifts. But this vice has
   always been rife in the world, as it is now too prevalent, and
   especially among handsome women; for, though beauty is God's gift, nine
   women out of ten who possess it are proud, and fond of men, and unite
   lust with elegance of form. This is quite unworthy of them; but it was
   customary in all ages, as it is this day: for we recognize the same in
   men; for as each excels in anything, so he arrogates to himself more
   than he ought, when he exults against God, and is reproachful towards
   others. If any one abounds in riches, he immediately gives himself to
   luxury and empty pomp; and others abuse them to various perverse, and
   even corrupt uses. If any one is endowed with ability, he turns his
   acuteness to cunning and fraud; then he plans many devices, as if he
   wished to mingle earth and heaven. Thus almost all men profane God's
   gifts. But here the Prophet shows the fountain of this pride, when he
   says that the Jews trusted in their own beauty: for if modesty
   flourished in us, it would certainly suffice for restraining all
   insolence; but when that restraint has been once thrown off, there is
   no moderation before either God or man. This passage, then, is worthy
   of observation, where God reproves his ancient people for trusting in
   their beauty: because the figure signifies that they drew their
   material for pride from the gifts which ought rather to lead them to
   piety; for the gifts which we receive from God's hand ought to be
   invitations to gratitude: but we are puffed up by pride; and luxury, so
   that we profane God's gifts, in which his glory ought to shine forth.
   We must also observe that God has thus far recited his benefits, that
   the people's ingratitude may appear more detestable: for God gives all
   things abundantly, and upbraids not, as James says, (James 1:5;) that
   is, if we acknowledge that we owe all things to him, and thus devote
   and consecrate ourselves in obedience to his glory, with the blessings
   which he has bestowed upon us. But when God sees us impiously burying
   and profaning his gifts, and, through trusting in them, growing
   insolent, it is not surprising if he reproves us beyond what is
   customary. Hence we see that God assumes as it were another character,
   when he expostulates with us concerning our ingratitude; because he
   willingly acknowledges his gifts in us, and receives them as if they
   were our own; as we call that bread ours by which he nourishes us,
   although it is compelled to change its nature as far as we are
   concerned. It always remains the same in itself; but I speak of
   external form. God therefore, as it were, transfigures himself, so as
   to reprove his own gifts, conferred for the purpose of our glorying
   only in him. (Matthew 7:11; Luke 11:13.)

   God afterwards says, that the people had played the harlot according to
   their renown. I have no doubt that the Prophet alludes to famous
   harlots who excel in beauty, and interpreters have not observed this
   sufficiently; for they do not explain anything by saying, you have
   committed fornication in thy name: for as many lovers flow from all
   sides in troops towards a famous harlot, so the Prophet says the Jews
   were like her; and since they were universally noted, they were exposed
   to promiscuous lust, and attracted lovers to themselves. Here the
   Prophet condemns two kinds of fornication in the Jews; one consisting
   in superstitions and in the multiplication of idols, -- the other in
   perverse and unlawful treaties: and we know this to be the worst kind
   of fornication, when God's worship is vitiated; for this is our
   spiritual chastity, if we worship God purely according to the
   prescription of his teaching, if we do not bend to either the right or
   the left from his commands: so on the other hand, as soon as we pass
   the goal fixed by him, we wander like impure harlots, and all our
   superstitions are so many acts of defilement. The Prophet begins with
   the former kind, when he says that the Jews had committed fornication,
   namely, with their idols. But before he comes to that, he shows that
   their lust had been insatiable, since they had so eagerly and ardently
   approached their various idols, just as a harlot burns with unsatisfied
   desire, and is carried hither and thither, and must have a number of
   men; so the Prophet here says that the Jews committed fornication, not
   with one or two only, but with whomsoever they met; and this was
   occasioned by that favor of which we formerly spoke. It now follows --

   [87] That is, "to whomsoever she met." -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 16:16

   16. And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places
   with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things
   shall not come, neither shall it be so

   16. Et sumpsisti e vestibus tuis, et fecisti tibi excelsa conspersa
   maculis, [88] et scortata es cum illis: non venientes: [89] deinde et
   non erit.


   He says that the Jews erected houses of ill fame for themselves; and
   the language is mixed, because the Prophet, expresses simply the kind
   of harlotry of which he is speaking, and yet in the meantime mingles
   another figure; for he says that they took garments and made themselves
   altars. No doubt he compares the high places to tents, just as if a
   harlot wished to attract a number of eyes to herself, and, through
   desire of a crowd, should place her standard on a lofty place. So also
   the Prophet says that the Jews, when they gave themselves up to
   fornication, made high places for themselves. When he says high places
   with different colors, some refer this to ornaments; yet it may be
   taken in a bad sense, since those high places were stained, so that
   they could be distinguished from chase and modest dwellings; as if he
   had said, If you had been a modest woman, you had remained in
   retirement at home, as honest matrons do, and you would not have done
   anything to attract men to thee; but you has erected thy high places,
   like conspicuous houses of ill fame, as if a female, forgetful of
   modesty and delicacy, should set up a sign, and show her house to be
   open to all, and especially to her own adulterers. It seems to me that
   the Prophet intends this; for when he adds, that they committed
   fornication with them, he means doubtless with their lovers, and all
   besides; but this is not the sense of the words vmvt tl'vt, bemoth
   telaoth. Now, at the end of the verse, where he says, they do not come,
   and it shall not be, some explain this part as if the Prophet had said
   that there was no instance like it in former ages, and there should be
   none such hereafter. In this way they understand that the insane lust
   of the people is condemned, as if it were a prodigy, such as was never
   seen, nor yet to be expected. Others say, that such was the multitude
   of high places, that nothing was ever like it; because, although the
   Gentiles built idols, and temples, and altars everywhere, yet the
   Prophet says that the madness and fury of the people surpassed the
   intemperance of the Gentiles: -- this is indeed to the purpose.
   Meanwhile, as to the general scope, it is not of much consequence; as
   in the former verse, where he said it shall be theirs, some understand
   appetite or desire. But I interpret it more simply -- that she was
   exposed to every passer-by, and that it was in his power to engage her.
   The sense does not seem to me doubtful, because the Jews were so cast
   out, that no liberty remained to them, as when a woman becomes
   abandoned, she is the slave of all, and all use her disgracefully after
   that, since she is no longer her own mistress. Ezekiel now reproves the
   Jews for the same vice.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that we may diligently consider in how many ways
   we are bound to thee, and may deservedly magnify thy fatherly
   indulgence towards us, so that in return we may desire to devote
   ourselves to thee: Grant also, that as you have adorned us with thy
   glory, we may endeavor to glorify thy name, until at length we arrive
   at the enjoyment of that eternal glory which you have prepared for us
   in heaven by Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Ezekiel 16:17

   17. Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver,
   which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst
   commit whoredom with them,

   17. Et sumpsisti vasa pulchritudinis tuae ex auro meo et ex argento meo
   quae dederam tibi: et fecisti tibi imagines masculi, [90] et scortata
   es cum illis.


   The Prophet reproves them because they used silver and gold in making
   idols for themselves. He not only condemns idolatry, but ingratitude,
   since they turned to God's dishonor the gifts which he had bestowed.
   First, the profanation of his gifts was base; besides this, they had
   rashly and purposely abused his liberality to his dishonor, and that
   was not to be endured. He reproves at the same time their blind
   intemperance, since they willingly gave themselves up to
   licentiousness, and buried themselves in their superstitions. But he
   does not say that they simply took gold and silver, but vessels of
   elegance or beauty of gold and silver. Whence it appears that they were
   blinded by furious lusts, as we have seen. He still pursues the simile
   of fornication, when he calls these manufactured deities images of
   males; and it seems obliquely to mark the excess of lust in having to
   do with shadows; by which he means that they were hurried away about
   nothing by their unbridled appetites, just as a woman feeds her passion
   by the mere picture of her paramour. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 16:18-19

   18. And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou
   hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.

   18. Et tulisti [91] vestes tuas discolores, [92] et operuisti eos [93]
   et oleum meum, et suffitum meum dedisti coram ipsis. [94]

   19. My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
   wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet
   savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.

   19. Et. panem meum quem dederam tibi, similam, et oleum, et mel quibus
   te cibaveram [95] etiam dedisti coram ipsis in odorem quietis: et ita
   fuit, dicit Dominator Iehovah.


   Here God complains that the Jews turned their abundance of all things
   to perverse worship: for, as a husband who indulges his wife freely
   supplies all her wants, so a woman who is immodest was what she has
   received from her husband, and bestows it on adulterers; so also the
   Jews were prodigal in the worship of idols, and wasted upon them the
   blessings which God had bestowed upon them. Ezekiel, therefore, now
   follows up this sentiment. He says that they took those variegated
   garments, of which we spoke yesterday, and covered their idols; just as
   if an adulteress were to clothe her paramours in the very garments
   which she had received from her husband's liberality: you have covered
   them, he says. He afterwards adds, you have offered my oil and incense.
   Here he speaks more clearly, although he does not depart far from the
   figure, for they were accustomed to use oil in sacrifices; and incense
   was used by all nations when they wished to propitiate their deities.
   There is no doubt that the unbelievers imitated the holy fathers, but
   sinfully, because they did not consider the right end. We know that the
   fathers used oil in their sacrifices, (Leviticus 2:1, and often
   elsewhere;) we know that incense was prescribed by God's law, and it
   was used promiscuously by all the nations, but without reason and
   judgment. So now God complains that they made incense of his herbs, and
   an offering of the oil which he had bestowed upon the Jews. He then
   adds the same of bread, and fine flour, oil, and honey. We said
   yesterday that by these words ample and delicate food was intended; for
   by the figure, a part for the whole, fine flour comprehends the best
   and sweetest bread, as well as other viands. Oil and honey are added.
   It is then just as if the Prophet had said that the Jews overflowed
   with all luxuries, yet consumed them badly. But this was a mockery not.
   to be borne, when the Jews, after being enriched by God's beneficence,
   rashly threw it all away, and not only so, but adorned their false gods
   to the dishonor of God himself, when they ought to have offered to him
   what they wasted upon idols. For this reason he calls it his own bread,
   and explains the passage in this sense, that the Jews could neither
   ascribe to themselves the abundance of their possessions, nor boast in
   the fruitfulness of the soil; for all these things flowed from the mere
   benevolence of God. This ingratitude, then, was too foul -- to bestow
   upon idols what God had given for a far different purpose. I, says he,
   have fed thee He shows the legitimate use of such manifold abundance.
   Since they abounded in wheat, whence they obtained fine flour, and were
   stuffed full of other delicacies, they thought to be elevated towards
   God, and to exercise themselves in the duties of gratitude; but they
   abused that abundance in adorning false deities.

   You have offered it to them, therefore, for a savor of peace. Rest no
   doubt signifies appeasing here, as frequently with Moses, though others
   translate "for an odor of sweetness;" but they do not sufficiently
   express the meaning of Moses; for he means that when God is appeased
   there is peace between himself and men. (Leviticus 3:9, 13, 17, and
   often.) There is no doubt that "the odor of quiet" signifies a just
   expiation, by which God is appeased, so that he receives men into
   favor. This is everywhere said of the sacrifices of the law, since
   there was no other means by which men could be reconciled to God,
   unless by offering sacrifices according to his command. Now the Prophet
   transfers this ironically to their impious worship, when he says that
   they offered to idols all the delicacies by which God nourishes his
   people. To what purpose? for a sweet savor; that is, that they may be
   propitious to you. But it was ridiculous to wish to appease gods of
   stone and wood and silver. We see then how Ezekiel reproves the
   people's folly, when he says, that they offered both fine flour and
   other things to their idols to reconcile themselves to them. Now the
   crime is increased since the Jews did not recognize that singular
   blessing of being so reconciled to God, that he no longer imputed their
   sins to them. Woe indeed to us if we are destitute of this remedy!
   because we constantly commit various faults, and are thus subject to
   God's judgments. Unless, then, God receives us into favor, we see that
   nothing can be more miserable for us. But he has prescribed a fixed and
   easy rule by which he will be appeased, namely, by sacrifices -- I am
   speaking of the fathers who lived under the law: for we know that we of
   this day must flee to the only sacrifice of Christ, which the
   sacrifices of the law shadowed forth. Since, therefore, the Jews could
   return to God's favor, and bury all their sins, and redeem themselves
   from the curse, how great was their madness in willingly depriving
   themselves of so inestimable a boon! Hence the Prophet now rebukes this
   folly, when he says that they propitiated their idols that they might
   appease them. He concludes at length, and it was so, says the Lord
   Jehovah. Here God takes away all occasion for their turning aside, when
   he says it was so; for we know that men always have various pretenses
   by which they lay the blame on some other parties, or soften it off, or
   cover it with some disguise. But God here says that there is no
   occasion for dispute, since the matter is perfectly plain. We see,
   then, that this word is used emphatically, when he says I am the Lord;
   for, if Ezekiel had announced it, they would not have listened to him;
   but God himself comes before them, and cuts off all excuses from the
   Jews. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:20

   20. Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast
   borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured.
   Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,

   20. Et sumpsisti filios tuos, et filias tuas quos genueras mihi: et
   jugulasti eos [96] ad comedendum: [97] an parum a scortationibus tuis?


   Here God blames them for another crime, that of sacrificing their
   offspring to idols. This was a very blind superstition, by which
   parents put off the sense of humanity. It is indeed a detestable
   prodigy when a father rejects his children, and has no regard or
   respect for them. Even philosophers place among the principles of
   nature those affections which they call natural affections. [98] When,
   therefore, the affection of a father towards his children ceases, which
   is naturally implanted in all our hearts, then a man becomes a monster
   indeed. But not only did an inconsiderate fury seize upon the Jews,
   but, by slaying their own offspring, they thought that they obeyed God,
   as at this day [6]the Papists are content with the name of good
   intentions, and do not think that any offering can be rejected if it be
   only daubed over with the title of either good intention or zeal for
   good. Such also was the confidence of the Jews; but, as I have said, we
   see that they were seized with a diabolic fury when they slew their
   sons and daughters. Abraham prepared to offer his son to God, but he
   had a clear command. (Genesis 22:9, 10, and Hebrews 11:19.)

   Then we know that his obedience was founded on faith, because he was
   certainly persuaded, as the Apostle says, that a new offspring could
   spring up from the ashes of his son. Since, therefore, he extols the
   power of God as equal to this effect, he did not hesitate to slay his
   son. But since these wretches slew their sons without a command, they
   must be deservedly condemned for prodigious madness. The Prophet
   therefore now brings this crime before us: that they had taken, their
   sons and their daughters, and slew them to idols. He now adds, to
   consume them, since it is probable, and may be collected from various
   passages, that the sons were not always slain, but there were two kinds
   of offerings. [99] Sometimes they either slew their sons or cast them
   alive into the fire and burnt them as victims. Sometimes they carried
   them round and passed them through the fire, so that they received them
   safe again. But God here shows that he treats of that barbarous and
   cruel offering, since they did not spare their sons.

   In this sense he adds, that they slew their sons to eat them up, or
   consume them. But another exaggeration of their crime is mentioned,
   when God expostulates concerning the insult offered: thou, says he,
   hath slain thy sons and daughters, but they are mine also, for you
   barest them to me. Here God places himself in the position of a parent,
   because he had adopted the people as his own: the body of the people
   was as it were his spouse or wife. All their offspring were his sons,
   since, if God's treaty with the people was a marriage, all who sprung
   from the people ought to be esteemed his children. God therefore calls
   those his sons who were thus slain, just as if a husband should
   reproach his wife with depriving him of their common children. God
   therefore not only blames their cruelty and superstition, but adds also
   that he was deprived of his children. But this, as is well known, is a
   most atrocious kind of injury. For who does not prefer his own blood to
   either fields, or merchandise, or money? As children are more precious
   than all goods, so a father is more grievously injured if children are
   taken away, as God here pronounces that he had done: you had born them
   unto me, says he. Hence sacrilege was added to idolatry when you did
   deprive me of them. He will soon call them again his own in the same
   sense. A question arises here, how God reckons among his sons those who
   were complete strangers to him? He had said in the beginning of the
   chapter (Ezekiel 1:3) that the people derived their origin from the
   Amorites and Hittites, since they had declined from the piety of
   Abraham and the other fathers. Since then the Jews were cast off while
   they were in Egypt, and after that had been such breakers of the
   covenant as the Prophet had thus far shown, were they not aliens? Yes;
   but God here regards his covenant, which was inviolable and could not
   be rendered void by man's perfidy. The Jews, then, of whom the Prophet
   now speaks, could no longer bear children to God: for he said that the
   body of the people was like a foul harlot, who walks about and turns
   round and seeks vague and promiscuous meetings. Since it was so, the
   children whom such idolaters bore were spurious, instead of being
   worthy of such honor that God should call them his sons: this is true
   with respect to them, but as concerns the covenant, they are called
   sons of God. And this is worthy of observation, because in the Papacy
   such declension has grown up through many ages, that they have
   altogether denied God. Hence they have no connection with him, because
   they have corrupted his whole worship by their sacrilege, and their
   religion is vitiated in so many ways, that it differs in nothing from
   the corruption's of the heathen. And yet it is certain that a portion
   of God's covenant remains among them, because although they have cut
   themselves off from God and altogether abandoned him by their perfidy,
   yet God remains faithful. (Romans 3:3, 4.) Paul, when he speaks of the
   Jews, shows that God's covenant with them is not abolished, although
   the greater part of the people had utterly abandoned God. So also it
   must be said of the papists, since it was not in their power to blot
   out God's covenant entirely, although with regard to themselves, as I
   have said, they are without it; and show by their obstinacy that they
   are the sworn enemies of God. Hence it arises, that our baptism does
   not need renewal, because although the Devil has long reigned in the
   papacy, yet he could not altogether extinguish God's grace: nay, a
   Church is among them; for otherwise Paul's prophecy would have been
   false, when he says that Antichrist was seated in the temple of God. (2
   Thessalonians 2:4.) If in the papacy there had been only Satan's
   dungeon or brothel, and no form of a Church had remained in it, this
   had been a proof that Antichrist did not sit in the temple of God. But
   this, as I have said, exaggerates their crime, and is very far from
   enabling them to erect their crests as they do. For when they thunder
   out with full cheeks -- "We are the Church of God," or, "The seat of
   the Church is with us," -- the solution is easy; the Church is indeed
   among them, that is, God has his Church there, but hidden and
   wonderfully preserved: but it does not follow that they are worthy of
   any honor; nay, they are more detestable, because they ought to bear
   sons and daughters to God: but they bear them for the Devil and for
   idols, as this passage teaches. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:21

   21. That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them
   to pass through the fire for them?

   21. Et maetasti filios meos, et posuisti eos ut transirent illis. [100]


   He strengthens the same sentence, and more clearly explains that they
   offered their sons and daughters by cruelly sacrificing them when they
   passed them through the fire. This was a kind of purifying, as we have
   seen elsewhere. When, therefore, they passed their children through the
   fire, it was a rite of illustration and expiation; and they brought
   them to the fire, as I have lately explained, in two different ways.
   Here the Prophet speaks especially of that cruel and brutal offering.
   We have already mentioned the sense in which God claims a right in the
   sons of his people, not as members of the Church properly speaking, but
   as adopted by God. And here again we must hold what Paul says, that all
   the progeny of Abraham were not lawful sons, since a difference must be
   made between sons of the flesh and sons of promise. (Romans 9:7, 8.)
   This is as yet partially obscure, but it may be shortly explained. We
   may remark that there was a twofold election of God: since speaking
   generally, he chose the whole family of Abraham. For circumcision was
   common to all, being the symbol and seal of adoption: since when God
   wished all the sons of Abraham to be circumcised from the least to the
   greatest, he at the same time chose them as his sons: this was one kind
   of adoption or election. But the other was secret, because God took to
   himself out of that multitude those whom he wished: and these are sons
   of promise, these are remnants of gratuitous favor, as Paul says.
   (Romans 11:8.) This distinction, therefore, now takes away all doubt,
   since the Prophet speaks of the unbelievers and the profane who had
   departed from the worship of God. For this their unbelief was a
   complete abdication. It is true, then, that as far as themselves were
   concerned, they were strangers, and so God's secret election did not
   flourish in them, but yet they were God's people, as far as relates to
   external profession. If any one objects that this circumcision was
   useless, and hence their election without the slightest effect, the
   answer is at hand: God by his singular kindness honored those miserable
   ones by opening a way of approach for them to the hope of life and
   salvation by the outward testimonies of adoption. Then as to their
   being at the same time strangers, that happened through their own
   fault. Hence we may shortly hold, that the Jews were naturally accursed
   through being Adam's seed: but by supernatural and singular privilege,
   they were exempt and free from the curse: since circumcision was a
   testimony of the adoption by which God had consecrated them to himself:
   hence they were holy; and as to their being impure, it could not, as we
   have said, abolish God's covenant. The same thing ought at this time to
   prevail in the Papacy. For we are all born under the curse: and yet God
   acknowledges supernaturally as his sons all who spring from the
   faithful, not only in the first or second degree, but even to a
   thousand generations. And so Paul says that the children of the
   faithful are holy, since baptism does not lose its efficacy, and the
   adoption of God remains fixed, (1 Corinthians 7:14,) yet the greater
   part is without the covenant through their own unbelief. God meanwhile
   has preserved to himself a remnant in all ages, and at this day he
   chooses whom he will out of the promiscuous multitude.

   Now let us go on. I had omitted at the end of the last verse the
   phrase, Are thy fornications a small matter? By this question God
   wishes to press the Jews home, since they had not only violated their
   conjugal fidelity by prostituting themselves to idols, but had added
   the cruelty which we have seen in slaying their sons. Lastly, he shows
   that their impiety was desperate.

   Ezekiel 16:22

   22. And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not
   remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and
   wast polluted in thy blood.

   22. Et in omnibus abominationibus tuis et scortationibus tuis non
   recordata es dierum adolescentiae tuae, cum tu esses nuda et
   discooperta, et foedata in sanguinibus tuis esses.


   Here God accommodates to his own ends what he has hitherto related,
   namely, the extreme wickedness and baseness of the people's ingratitude
   in thus prostituting themselves to idols. Hence he recalls to mind
   their condition when he espoused them. For if the wretched slavery from
   which they had been delivered had been present to their mind, they had
   not been so blinded with perverse confidence, nor had they exulted in
   their lasciviousness. But since they had forgotten all God's benefits,
   they became lascivious, and prostrated themselves to foul idolatries,
   and provoked God in every way. Now the Prophet proves this when he
   says, behold, through these abominations the people did not remember
   their youth. Whence happens it that impure and lustful women thus
   despise their husbands, unless through being blinded by their own
   beauty? And since they do not recognize their own disgrace, they please
   themselves in foul loves, as says the Prophet Hosea, (Hosea 2:5.) Such
   then was the self-confidence of the, Jews, that they pleased themselves
   by their beauty and ornaments: though God's glory and brightness shone
   forth in them, yet they did not perceive the source of their dignity;
   and hence the addition of ingratitude to pride. You have not
   remembered, says he, the days of thy youth, when you was naked, and
   bare, and defiled in thy blood. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:23-25

   23. And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee!
   saith the Lord GOD;)

   23. Et fuit post omnem malitiam tuam, Vae vae tibi, dicit Dominator
   Iehovah.

   24. That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made
   thee an high place in every street.

   24. Et aedificasti tibi excelsum, et fecisti tibi excelsum in omni
   platea. [101]

   25. Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast
   made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one
   that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.

   25. Ad omne caput [102] viae aedificasti excelsum tuum: et abominabilem
   fecisti tuam pulchritudinem: et divaricasti [103] pedes tuos omni
   transeunti, et multiplicasti tuas scortationes.


   The first verse is variously explained. Some read the clause
   separately, vyhy 'chry kl rtk, vihi achri kel regnethek -- it was after
   all thy wickedness: and they think that God threatens the Jews here as
   he did in Hosea, (Hosea 2:9,10.) For after God had there complained
   that his wool and his flax had been taken away, and offered as gifts to
   idols, he afterwards adds, I will demand all things back again, and
   then all thy beauty shall be taken from thee, and thy nakedness shall
   be laid bare, so that you shall be deservedly ashamed. Thus then they
   explain these words, that the condition of the Jews should be as it
   formerly was; as if he had said in one word, I will so avenge myself,
   that whether you will or not, you shall be compelled to feel the
   disgrace of your nakedness, since I will manifest it again. But this
   sense seems forced; therefore I unite it with the remainder of the
   verse which follows it. Thus then the language of the Prophet flows on:
   and it was after all thy wickedness that you built a high place for
   thyself -- you made for thyself a lofty place in every street: there
   are two different words, but the sense is the same: you did set up thy
   high places in all the principal ways, and so, says he, thy beauty
   became abominable. But this is inserted by way of parenthesis, Alas!
   alas for thee! This exclamation is abruptly interposed. But, at the
   same time, I have no doubt that these things all adhere together, since
   the Jews added sin to sin, and never made an end of sinning. He says,
   therefore, after they had been perfidious and ungrateful to God, after
   they had basely devoted all they had to perverse worship, then this new
   crime was added, that they had erected high places in every street and
   in every path.

   If any one objects that this was not a greater crime than others, the
   answer is easy, that God does not speak of one high place only, or of
   one altar, but he comprehends all the signs of idolatry by which they
   had infected the land; for it was the height of impudence to erect
   everywhere the standard of their superstitions. For every high place
   and every altar was a testimony of their backsliding; just as if they
   had openly boasted that they would not magnify the worship of the law,
   and intended purposely to overthrow whatever God had prescribed. God
   therefore, not without cause, burns with wrath because the Jews had
   erected high places and altars everywhere. Now, then, we understand the
   Holy Spirit's meaning as far as these words are concerned. It is added,
   after all thy wickedness, says he; that is, in addition to all thy
   crimes, this sin and impudence is added, that you have built not only
   one, but innumerable high places in every street, nay, in every pathway
   of importance, that is, in the most celebrated places. For the heads of
   the pathways are the most conspicuous places, and whatever is done
   there is more exposed to the eyes of all.

   We must now notice the exclamation which is interposed. Alas! alas! for
   thee, says the Lord Jehovah. Since the Jews, through their sloth, were
   not at all attentive to the reproofs of the prophets, that God might
   waken them up, he here pronounces his curse twice. It is clear that
   they were not moved by it: but this vehemence tended to their severer
   condemnation, since, though they were drowned and sunk in deep sleep,
   yet they might be raised by this formidable voice. There is no doubt
   that they applauded themselves for their own superstitions; but it is
   on that account profitable to estimate the weight of these words of
   God. For we gather from hence, that when idolaters indulge in their own
   fictions, and think themselves entirely free from blame, the word of
   God is sufficient, by which he thunders against them, saying, alas!
   alas! for thee. Hence men cease to judge according to their own
   notions, and are rather attentive to the sentence of God, and
   acknowledge his curse passing on them when they think that they are
   rightly discharging the duty of piety in worshipping idols.

   He now adds, that he made their beauty to be abhorred. I have no doubt
   that the Prophet alludes to the filthiness of abandoned women; and even
   the Latins called them "worn out," whose foulness arises from their
   utterly giving themselves up to every wickedness. The Prophet then says
   that the people were not only like an abandoned woman who engages in
   impure amours, but that their conduct was gross in the extreme; for
   though many gratify improper desires through intemperate lust, yet they
   fastidiously reject those foul and shameless females who are notorious
   for profligacy. The Prophet means, then, that the people had come to
   such a pitch of abomination, just as the most abandoned of the sex. He
   now adds, you have spread thy feet to every passer-by, and have
   multiplied thy fornications. This is taken also from the conduct of
   harlots and confirms what we have already explained, that the Jews
   indulged not only in one kind of idolatry, but were prone to all
   abominations, like females who beset the paths, and address all they
   meet, and not only so, but shamelessly spread their feet everywhere to
   entice admirers.

   Ezekiel 16:26

   26. Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
   neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to
   provoke me to anger.

   26. Et scortata es cum fills AEgypti vicinis tuis magnis carne: et
   multiplicasti scortationes tuas ad irritandum me.


   I Mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, that the Prophet blames
   the Jews not for one single kind of fornication, but for two different
   kinds. Interpreters do not observe this, but think that the Prophet is
   always discoursing of idols and superstitions. But if we prudently
   weigh all the circumstances, what I have said will not appear doubtful,
   namely, that the Jews were condemned not only for vitiating the worship
   of God by their perverse fictions, but for flying, now to the
   Egyptians, now to the Assyrians, and thus involving themselves in
   unlawful covenants. It is a very common method with the Prophets to
   call such covenants fornications: for as a wife ought to lie under the
   shadow of her husband, so God wished the Jews to be content under his
   protection. But as soon as any danger frightened them, they fled
   tremblingly to either Egypt, or Assyria, or Chaldea. We see, then, that
   they had in some sense renounced God's help, since they could not rest
   under his protection, but were hurried hither and thither by vague
   impulse. After the Prophet had inveighed against their superstitions,
   he now approaches another crime, namely, the Jews implicating
   themselves in forbidden treaties. He begins with Egypt. God had clearly
   forbidden the elect people to have any dealings with Egypt. Even if God
   had not made known the reason, yet they ought to have obeyed his
   command. But I have already explained the reason why God was unwilling
   that the Israelites should enter into any covenant with the Egyptians,
   because he wished to try their faith and patience, and if they would
   fly to his help when any danger pressed upon them, as the saying is,
   like a sacred anchor. There was also another reason, because from the
   time when God drew his people out from thence, he wished them separated
   from that nation which had raged so cruelly against their miserable
   guests. As far as the Chaldmans and Assyrians are concerned, the former
   reason prevailed thus far, that it was not lawful for them to distrust
   God's aid in their dangers.

   Now, therefore, we understand the Prophet's meaning when he says, that
   the Jews had committed fornication with the sons of Egypt He adds, they
   were gross in flesh. He means that they were foul and immodest, and
   were inflamed with disgraceful lust. [104] He uses a grosser simile by
   and by, for the perfidy of this detestable people could not be
   sufficiently condemned. The Prophet here says reproachfully, you have
   committed fornication with the Egyptians, as a licentious woman acting
   most basely. He adds, you have multiplied thy fornications: he speaks
   to the people under the character of a woman, as we have formerly seen:
   to irritate me. Here the Prophet takes away all excuse for error from
   the impious people. He says, therefore, since they so wandered after
   these impure desires, that they had not fallen through ignorance, since
   they knew well enough what God had commanded in his law. And there is
   no doubt that they darkened their own minds, as the impious always dig
   hiding-places for themselves, and have specious pretexts, by which they
   not only hide their malice before men, but also deceive themselves.
   Hence it is probable that the Jews were not free from such pretenses.
   But, on the other hand, we must remark that they were abundantly
   instructed by God's law what was lawful and right. Since, therefore,
   through neglect of the law they were so ravenous in impious desires,
   the Prophet says that they had purposely and designedly entered into a
   contest with God. For if any one raises the question whether it is
   lawful to enter into an alliance with the impious, the answer is easy,
   that we must beware of all alliances which may couple us under the same
   yoke; for we are naturally enough inclined towards all vices: and when
   we invent fresh occasions for sin we tempt God. And when any one joins
   himself in too great familiarity with the impious, it is just like
   using a fan to inflame his corrupt affections, which, as I have said,
   were already sufficiently flagrant in his mind. We must take care,
   therefore, as far as we can, not to make agreements with the impious.
   But, if necessity compels us, this conduct cannot be thought wrong in
   itself, as we see that Abraham entered into an agreement with his
   neighbors, though their religion was different. (Genesis 21:27,32.) But
   because he could not otherwise obtain peace, that was a kind of
   agreement by which Abraham hoped to acquire peace for himself. (Genesis
   14:13; Isaiah 51:2.) Nor did he hesitate to use the assistance of
   allies when he succored his nephew. But if we seek the principle and
   the cause which induced Abraham to enter into a treaty with his
   neighbors, we shall find his intention to be nothing else but to dwell
   at home in peace, and to be safe from all injury. He was solitary, as
   Isaiah calls him: he had, indeed, a numerous family, but no offspring;
   and hence he could not escape making treaties with his neighbors. But
   when the Lord placed the people in the land of Canaan on the condition
   of defending them there, of protecting them on all sides, and of
   opposing all their foes, we see them enclosed, as it were, by his
   protection, so as to render all treaties useless; since they could not
   treat with either the Egyptians or the Assyrians without at the same
   time withdrawing themselves from God's aid.

   As far as we are concerned, I have said that we have more freedom, if
   we are only careful that the lusts of the flesh do not entice us to
   seek alliances which may entangle us in the sins of others; for it is
   difficult to retain the favor of those with whom we associate, unless
   we entirely agree with them. If they are impious, they will draw us
   into contempt of God and adulterous rites, and so it will happen that
   one evil will spring from another. Nothing, therefore, is better than
   to reef our sails, and to look to God alone, and to have our minds
   fixed on him, and not to allow any kind of alliance, unless necessity
   compels us. And though we must prudently take care that no condition be
   mingled with it which may draw us off from the pure and sincere worship
   of God, since the devil is always cleverly plotting against the sons of
   God, and draws them into hidden snares. When, therefore, we are about
   to contract an alliance, we should always take care lest our liberty be
   in any degree abridged, and lest we be drawn aside by stealthy and
   concealed arts from the simple worship of God. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 16:27

   27. Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have
   diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of
   them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are
   ashamed of thy lewd way.

   27. Et ecce, extendi manum meam super te, et diminui demensum tuum, et
   tradidi te desiderio [105] earum quae te oderant filiarum Philistim,
   quae pudefactae sunt a viis tuis sceleris. [106]


   Here God reproves the hardness of the Jews because admonition did not
   render them wise. The common proverb aptly says, "fools grow wise only
   by the rod;" and when their obstinacy is such that the rod does no
   good, their faults are indeed desperate. Hence God complains, when he
   had chastised the Jews, that even this did not profit them, for they
   were so perverse that they did not apply their minds to reflect upon
   their sins. For God's blows ought to rouse us up, so that our faults
   previously hidden ought to be brought to light and knowledge; but when
   we champ the bit, and are not affected by the blows, then our abandoned
   disposition is made manifest. Now the Prophet condemns this obstinacy
   in the Jews: I have extended, says he, my hand over thee. He now
   enumerates two kinds of chastisement, first, when God deprived the Jews
   of the abundance of the possessions by which they were enriched; and
   then because he had subjected them to the lust of their enemies. Those
   who translate justification as Jerome does, depart from the sense of
   the Prophet: chq, chek, signifies, indeed, a statute and edict, and he
   explains it of the law. But how will this agree with the Prophet's
   retaining the simile already used? for he compares God to a husband.
   God now pronounces that he had taken away their appointed portion, when
   he saw himself a laughingstock through his impure wife; that is, what
   he had intended for both food and clothing: for husbands spend a fixed
   sum on their wives in food, clothing, and ornament. And God previously
   recounted, among other things, that what he had conferred upon the Jews
   they had spent in superstitions. Hence, for this reason, he now says, I
   have taken away their allotted portion, that is, what I had assigned to
   them. This was one part of the chastisement: for he compares the
   fruitfulness of the land and other advantages to the portion which the
   husband assigns to the wife.

   Now the other chastisement follows -- their being harassed by their
   enemies; for not only did the Jews find themselves encompassed by the
   Philistines, but they were delivered up and bound to slavery, as Moses
   says, (Deuteronomy 32:30,) How, then, could one vanquish ten, and ten
   chase a thousand, unless we had been shut up in his hand? He shows,
   therefore, that our enemies are never our superiors unless God enslaves
   us to them. But those who do not calmly subject themselves to God's
   command, but are refractory, are delivered into the enemy's hand, that
   their contumacy may be subdued by severe tyranny. Now we understand
   what the Prophet means by this verse: he enlarges upon the people's
   wickedness in not turning to God, though they felt by clear experience
   that they were under a curse. They ought to examine their lives, to
   groan before God, to acknowledge their fault, and to beg for pardon:
   since no feeling was awakened, the Prophet gathers that their obstinacy
   was desperate. This passage is worthy of our notice, that we may be
   attentive to God's chastisements. Whenever God even raises his finger
   and threatens us, let us know that he is anxious for our safety: hence
   in our turn let us rouse ourselves and implore his pity, and especially
   let us repent of our sins by which we see his anger to have been
   enflamed. (Jeremiah 2:30.) But if we remain slothful, we see that no
   excuse for us remains, since God elsewhere complains that he is trifled
   with, when he has chastised his children in vain. Here, nphs, nepish,
   the soul is used for [7]lust or desire, as I have explained it. It
   follows --

   Ezekiel 16:28

   28. Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou
   wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet
   couldest not be satisfied.

   28. Et scortara es cum fills Assur, [107] quia, non esse satietatem
   tibi, [108] scortata es inquam cum illis, et ne sic quidem fuisti
   satiata.


   I interpret this verse also of the covenant by which the Jews had
   entangled themselves, when they willingly joined themselves to the
   Assyrians; for this was a sure sign of distrust, when they so desired
   foreign aid, as if they had been deprived of God's protection. And it
   would be absurd to explain this verse of idolatries, since the prophets
   were not accustomed to speak in this way, that the people committed
   fornication with the Assyrians, because they imitated their
   superstitions and perverse worship. As, therefore, we formerly saw that
   the Jews had defiled themselves with idols, and prostituted themselves
   to impious ceremonies, forgetful of God's law; so now the Prophet
   accuses them of a different kind of pollution, since they eagerly
   sought for aid from all quarters, as if God had not sufficient strength
   for their protection. For otherwise there was no religious reason for
   their not making peace with the Assyrians; but when they saw themselves
   oppressed by the kings of Israel and Syria, then they thought of
   sending for the Assyrians; and this was like thrusting God from his
   place. (2 Kings 16:7-9.) For God was willing to defend the land with
   extended wings, and to cherish the Jews as a hen does her brood, as
   Moses says, (Deuteronomy 32:11.) Now, in thinking themselves exposed to
   any danger, they really throw off the help of God. It is not
   surprising, then, that the Prophet says, that they had polluted
   themselves with the Assyrians, because they were not satisfied. He
   pursues the simile on which we have dwelt sufficiently; for he blames
   the Jews for their insatiable lust, just as when a woman is not content
   with a single follower, and attracting a crowd obtrudes herself without
   modesty or delicacy, and sells herself to wickedness. Such was the
   licentiousness of the Jews, that they united many acts of pollution
   together. They had already departed from the true faith in making a
   treaty with the Egyptians, and they added another imagination, that it
   was useful to have the Assyrians in alliance with them: hence that
   unbridled lust which the Prophet metaphorically rebukes. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:29

   29. Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan
   unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.

   29. Et multiplicasti [109] scortationes tuas super terram Chanaan in
   Chaldaea, et ne in hoc quidem fuisti satiata.


   Here the Prophet teaches that the Jews were immoderate in their
   desires, just as if a woman was not satisfied with two or three
   followers, should wantonly crave after many lovers: such, says the
   Prophet, was the Jews' licentiousness. As to his saying, over the land
   of Canaan in Chaldaea, some think it means, that they heaped up the
   impure rites of all the nations, and not only defiled themselves with
   the ancient. idolatries of the nations of Canaan, but imitated the
   Chaldaeans in their impiety. Others say in Chaldea, which is next to
   the land of Canaan; but this comment, like the last, is too forced:
   others take 'l, al, comparatively, for "through" the land of Canaan.
   But I only understand it as a particle expressing likeness, thus, you
   have multiplied thy pollution's in Chaldaea just as in the land of
   Canaan. It is not surprising if they defiled themselves with their
   neighbors, as the Prophet had formerly said they did with the
   Egyptians, but when they ran about to a remote region of the world,
   this indeed was most remarkable. This then seems the real sense, and it
   reads best, that they increased their defilement in Chaldaea as in the
   land of Canaan. For if a female meets with a stranger she may act
   sinfully without so much disgrace, but when she runs about to a
   distance to seek followers, this proves her most abandoned. I have no
   doubt that the Prophet here exaggerates the people's crimes by
   comparison, since they penetrated even to the Chaldaeans to pollute
   themselves among them. He says that the Jews were not satisfied even
   with this, using the same expression as when treating of the Assyrians.
   The sum of the whole is, that the Jews were seized with such a furious
   impulse that they manifested no moderation in their wickedness. For
   they had not revolted from God once only, or in one direction: but
   wherever occasion offered, they were accustomed to seize it too
   eagerly, so that they showed in this way that not even a drop of piety
   remained in their minds. Let us learn then from this passage to put the
   bridle on cur lusts in time: for when the fire is lighted up, it is not
   easily extinguished, and the devil is always supplying wood or adding
   oil to the furnace, as the phrase is. Let us then prevent the evil
   which is here condemned in the Jews, and let us restrain ourselves,
   lest the devil seize upon us with insane fury. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:30

   30. How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all
   these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;

   30. Quam molle [110] est cor tuum! dicit Dominator Iehovah, cum facis
   hoc totum opus mulieris meretricis robustae. [111]


   The Prophet seems at variance with himself when he compares the Jews to
   a robust or very strong woman, and yet says that their heart was
   dissolute. For those who translate an obstinate heart are without a
   reason for it, for this seems to imply some kind of resistance, as they
   were strong and bold, and yet of a soft or weak or infirm heart. But in
   the despisers of God both evils are to be blamed when they flow away
   like water and yet are hard as rocks. They flow away, then, when there
   is no strength or constancy in them; for they are drawn aside this way
   and that, as some explain it, by a distracted heart, but we must always
   come to the idea of softness. All who revolt from God are borne along
   by their own levity, so that the minds of the impious are changeable
   and moveable: for the heart is here taken for the seat of the
   intellect, as in many other places. Hence the Prophet accuses the Jews
   of sloth, but under the name of a dissolute heart: as in French we say
   un coeur lasche, and the Prophet's sense is best explained by that
   French word -- faint-hearted. But it is sufficient to understand the
   Prophet's meaning, that the Jews were unstable, and agitated and
   distracted hither and thither, since there was nothing in them either
   firm or solid. Meanwhile he compares them to a strong and abandoned
   woman, since we know the boldness of the despisers of God in sinning
   against him. Since then they are dissolute, because they have no power
   of attention, and nothing is stable in their minds: yet they are like
   rocks, and carry themselves audaciously, and do not hesitate to strive
   with God. Although therefore these two states of mind appear contrary
   in their nature, yet we may always see them in the reprobate, though in
   different ways. Thus he properly calls the Jews not only a robust or
   abandoned woman, but "a high and mighty dame," as it may best be
   rendered in French, une maitresse putain ou painarde. [112] It is
   forced to explain the word "lofty," as taking license for her desires.
   I do not hesitate to interpret it of the people being like dissolute
   women, who throw aside all modesty, and seek lovers from all quarters,
   and entertain them all. This is the Prophet's sense. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 16:31

   31. In that thou buildes thine eminent place in the head of every way,
   and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an
   harlot, in that thou scornest hire;

   31. Cum extulisti sublime tuum in capite omnis viae, et excelsum tuum
   fecisti in omni celebri loco: et non fuisti tanquam meretrix ad
   spernendum munus.


   Here the Prophet again reproves the superstitions to which the Jews had
   devoted themselves: but yet he speaks figuratively, because by high
   places he does not simply mean altars, but tents by which the Jews had
   attempted to entice their neighbors: just as if an immodest female
   should choose a high place, and build her couch there conspicuously to
   attract her followers. Although therefore he inveighs against
   superstitions, the language is not simple, but retains the same simile
   as had been previously used. He says that the Jews were so prone to
   lust, that they were ostentatious and thought followers from a
   distance, and erected their tents or couches in high places. Since this
   has been treated before, I now pass it over slightly. But we may remark
   that a thing which seems of slight importance is here seriously
   condemned by the Prophet, whence we may learn that the worship of God
   is not to be estimated by our natural perception. For who would think
   it so great a crime to build an altar on a high place to God's honor?
   but we see that the Prophet abhors that superstition. Since therefore
   God wishes nothing to be changed in his worship, as the principal part
   of his worship is obedience, which he prefers to all sacrifices, (1
   Samuel 15:22,) let us learn that things which we might tolerate ought
   to be detested by us, because God condemns them so severely.

   Since therefore you have erected and made for thyself a high place at
   the head of all streets and paths, that is in every celebrated place.
   Here we see how ardently they were enflamed by idolatry so as to
   provoke the anger of God, and this seemed unworthy of them, as the
   papists at this day, who are bent upon idol worship, and under the
   title of "devotion," think that any vice both can and ought to be
   excused before God. But, on the other side, the Holy Spirit says that
   idolaters sin the more grievously in being so eager for those impure
   rites. He says, thou wast not like a harlot in despising hire Some
   explain this coldly, that harlots mentally despise the folly of those
   who reward them, but this comment is incorrect: the other view is more
   probable, namely, that the Jews were not like a harlot who despises the
   bribe by which she is deceived: for by this craftiness they gain most
   influence when they contemptuously despise what is offered them, and
   scarcely deign to touch it: they do this that the wretched lover may
   not think himself sufficiently liberal, and so may double his gift and
   squander away all his goods. This passage then may mean that the people
   were not like a harlot who despises her reward that the wretched lover
   may feel ashamed and increase his offer. But the Prophet's sense seems
   to me different, though I do not altogether reject this. I interpret it
   thus: the Jews were not like a harlot, since they despised any reward
   for their sin, and harlots do not: they make a gain of their lusts,
   whence the name they bear. Since then such persons sell themselves for
   reward, the Prophet say's that the Jews were not like them: how so?
   because they despised reward, and through the mere desire of gratifying
   their appetites, they neither asked nor expected any reward. Afterwards
   it follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:32

   32. But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers
   instead of her husband!

   32. Mulier adultera loco viri sui sumit extraneos.


   Some translate it an adulteress under her husband's roof, and tcht,
   thecheth, signifies "instead of:" and they explain it thus, that
   adulteresses do not divorce themselves from their husbands when they
   violate the marriage bond, but always remain at home for the purpose of
   admitting strangers; and they think the people's crime increased by
   this comparison, that they not only acted deceitfully towards God, but
   openly revolted from him, and left his home; for many shameless women
   remain at home, and hide their crimes as far as they can; but when a
   woman deserts her husband and children, then her case is most
   deplorable: they think, therefore, that the Prophet is here
   exaggerating the divorce or revolt of the people from God; but the
   sense seems better simply to compare them to an adulteress who admits
   strangers in her husband's stead: thou art says he, an adulteress who
   has sent for strange lovers instead of thy husband: for a woman married
   to a liberal husband is treated by him honorably; and if she seeks
   lovers from all sides, she is induced by neither avarice nor
   covetousness, but by her own lusts. In fine, as the Prophet lately said
   that they despised all gain through being blinded by their appetites,
   so he now says they were like an adulteress who rejects her husband;
   and not only so, but throws herself into the protection of others,
   while she has an honorable and happy home.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you have thought us worthy of such honor,
   that we should be bound to thee in your only-begotten Son by the bond
   of a spiritual marriage, -- that we may remain in that fidelity which
   we promised to thee, since we have found thee faithful to us by so many
   proofs on thy part, until, having passed through this present life, we
   arrive at the enjoyment of that blessedness which is the fruit of our
   faithful chastity, through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Ezekiel 16:33

   33. They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy
   lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for
   thy whoredom.

   33. Cunctis meretricibus dant munus, [113] tu autem dedisti munera tua
   cunctis amatoribus tuis: et conduxisti eos ut ingrederentur ad te
   undique [114] in scortationibus tuis.


   Here the Prophet shows the great folly of the Jews in shamelessly
   squandering their goods; for gain impels harlots to their occupation:
   they feel the disgrace of it, but want urges them on. But the Prophet
   says, that when the Jews committed sin they did it with extravagance,
   since they spared no expense in attracting their lovers. He pursues the
   simile which we have had before; for he compares the nation to a
   perfidious woman who leaves her husband and offers herself to
   adulterers. We now understand the Prophet's meaning. It is clear that
   the Jews did not act thus on purpose, for they thought they would
   profit by their treaties with the Egyptians and Assyrians' they were
   unwilling to serve their idols for nothing, since they hoped for most
   ample rewards from this their adulterous worship. But the Holy Spirit
   does not regard either what they wished or hoped for, but speaks of the
   matter as it was. It is clear, then, that the Jews were very prodigal
   in their superstitions, and we see this even now in the papacy. Those
   who grudge even a farthing for the relief of the poor will throw away
   guineas when they wish to compound for their sins; and there is no end
   to their extravagance under this madness. The very same rage prevailed
   among the Jews for which Ezekiel now reproves them. He says, then, that
   they offered gifts to their lovers; for, as I have said, they were so
   prodigal in the worship of false gods, that when they desired a treaty
   with either the Egyptians or Assyrians, they were necessarily loaded
   with valuable presents; and history bears witness that they entirely
   exhausted themselves. Lastly, the Prophet here shows that the Jews were
   so blind, that in leaving God, and devoting themselves to idols, they
   failed to obtain any advantage. Then, when they implicated themselves
   in perverse and wicked treaties, he shows that they were so utterly
   deranged as to deprive themselves of all their goods, and yet to
   receive nothing but disgrace in return for their extravagance: presents
   are given to all harlots, but thou bestowest thine. Jerome takes the
   pronoun passively, meaning the blessings which God had bestowed upon
   the people: and this passage is like that in Hosea, (Hosea 2:5-8) where
   God complains that the Jews had profaned the blessings which he had
   conferred upon them, just as if a wife should bestow on adulterers what
   she had received from her husband. Foul indeed is this! for a husband
   thought these would be pledges of chastity when he adorned his wife
   with precious garments, or enriched her with other presents and
   ornaments; but when a wife, forgetful of modesty and propriety, throws
   her husband's gifts at the feet of adulterers, this is indeed
   outrageous. Hence this sense does not displease me, although it would
   be more simple to understand it that the Jews had washed away all their
   goods. He says, that they had hired their lovers to come in from every
   side for wickedness. He repeats again what we saw before, that the Jews
   were abandoned sinners, for some, though impure, are content with a
   single lover. But as he had before said that the Jews spread their feet
   widely, so he now adds, that they hired lovers from all sides. Shameful
   indeed is such conduct in any woman: yet Ezekiel reproves the Jews for
   this indelicacy, and we saw the reason in yesterday's lecture. It
   follows --

   34. And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,

   givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art
   contrary.

   post tua postrema [115] non erit scortatio: [116] quia dedisti munus,
   et munus tibi non fuit datum: ita fuisti in contrarium. [117]


   But the Prophet only confirms his former teaching, that the Jews were
   seized with such lust, and in so unaccustomed a manner, that they could
   only satisfy their desires with severe loss; but this comparison only
   magnifies their crime, since they were worse than any harlots; for
   although they basely sell themselves, yet the hope of gain is a kind of
   pretext and excuse, and a starving woman may be led into great excess;
   but far fouler and less excusable is her conduct who purchases her
   lovers. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 16:35-37

   35. Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:

   35. Propterea, meretrix, audi sermonem Iehovae.

   36. Thus says the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and
   thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and
   with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy
   children, which thou didst give unto them;

   36. Sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, quia effusum fuit infimum tuum, [118]
   et detecta fuit turpitudo tua [119] in scortationibus tuis erga
   amatores tuos, et erga omnia idola abominationum tuarum, et in
   sanguinibus filiorum tuorum quos dedisti illis.

   37. Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast
   taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that
   thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and
   will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy
   nakedness.

   37. Propterea ecce congregabo cunctos amatores tuos, quibus te
   oblectasti erga eos, et omnes quos dilexisti, et quos odisti:
   congregabo inquam, eos contra te a circuitu, et retegam [120] pudenda
   tua [121] coram ipsis, et videbunt totam turpitudinem tuam.


   After God has inveighed against the people's sins, and treated the
   whole nation as guilty, he now pronounces judgment on their wickedness.
   He repeats shortly what he had said, as a judge explains the reason of
   his sentence. Since, says he, the lower parts of thy body and thy
   disgrace has been discovered before thy lovers. This is the reason of
   the judgment, whence it is collected that God is induced to treat his
   people harshly for just and necessary causes. It now follows:
   therefore, says he, I will assemble all thy lovers, with those also
   whom you hate, I will assemble them, and uncover thy shame before them.
   We may now see what the Jews are threatened with, namely, a disgraceful
   destruction, so that they become a common laughingstock without any one
   to succor them; for the diction is metaphorical when he speaks of
   lovers and of parts of the body; for by lovers he here means the
   Egyptians, Assyrians, and Chaldeeans. Whence their opinion is refuted
   who think that the Prophet treats only of superstitions. Nor can this
   language be transferred to idols, since we know that false gods were
   not spectators of the punishment which the Prophet denounces against
   the Jews. Whence it follows that this language will only suit those
   persons to whose protection the Jews trusted, so as to treat God's help
   as useless. Since, then, such is the metaphorical sense of the passage,
   we understand that shame means spoliation and slaughter; nay, the
   destruction of both the kingdom and city, and even of the temple. Thus
   the nation was a common laughingstock, and in this way like a foul and
   aged harlot. Now we understand the Prophet's intention. As to Jerome
   translating "wealth," it is altogether adverse to the Prophet's
   meaning; there is no doubt that he means the lower part of the body,
   and it follows in the same sense, thy shame was uncovered. But at the
   same time God expresses why it was done, namely, for fornication, as if
   an abandoned woman were to act so disgracefully. He now says it was
   done towards your lovers, towards the idols of your abominations: l,
   gnel, is here taken for towards or against. He distinguishes between
   lovers and idols. Those who think that the Prophet treats only of
   superstitious think the copula superfluous; but there is no doubt that
   the Prophet means, on one side, the Assyrians, and Egyptians, and
   Chaldeeans; and on the other, false gods.

   And in bloods, says he. He here adds another crime, namely, that of
   barbarous cruelty, because they did not spare their own sons, as we saw
   before: many offered up their children, and some were found so excited
   as to cast them into the fire: it was indeed a monstrous crime when
   they hesitated not to rage against their own offspring: but they were
   so carried away by insane zeal that they burnt, up their children when
   others only drew them through the fire. Hence the Prophet again accuses
   them of cruelty for offering their children to idols, and so pouring
   forth innocent blood. Now follows the punishment. Behold, says he, I
   collect all thy lovers. We said that this ought to be understood of the
   Egyptians, Assyrians, and Chaldreans, all of whom looked upon the
   slaughter of that perverse and perfidious nation, but none of them
   helped her. God therefore pronounces the destruction of the people just
   like that of a harlot abandoned by her lovers, and perishing through
   hunger, want, and other miseries: for it very often happens that a
   person under the impulse of love prefers a harlot to his own life; for
   he will throw off all regard for his wife; he will be disrespectful to
   both his father and mother, and will break through every restraint to
   enjoy her company: but when such persons are grown old, and their hair
   becomes white, which represents the winter of life, and when wrinkles
   deform the face, then they are despised, and especially if they suffer
   through disease. So also the Prophet now says that the Jews would be
   despised by all, so that their lovers should be compelled to behold
   that example; and meanwhile they scarcely deign to look at the foul
   appearance which had formerly sweetly delighted them.

   Then he proceeds further, namely, that their enemies should behold
   their ignominy: we know that the Jews were surrounded on all sides by
   enemies, and that all their neighbors were hostile to them. The Prophet
   now says that the nations disgrace should be exposed before their
   lovers, that is, the Egyptians, the Assyrians, Chaldaeans,
   Philistilles, Edomites, and other nations. This passage teaches us,
   that although the reason for God's judgments does not always clearly
   appear, yet they are never too severe; and when he condescends to
   afford us a reason, he grants us a gratuitous indulgence. But when he
   silently executes his judgments, let us learn to acquiesce in his
   justice, and not to cry out if he exceeds moderation; because when he
   has once explained that his severity is only justice, hence we must
   gather the general rule, that whenever he seems to treat his people too
   severely and harshly, yet he has just reasons for it. Let us learn,
   also, that the Jews only suffered a just recompense when God so cursed
   all their counsels. They thought themselves very provident and
   circumspect when they engaged in alliances with Egyptians and
   Assyrians. But all their plans turned out unhappily for them, since
   they consulted their own will contrary to that of God. Let us learn,
   then, if we wish to promote our own salvation, and to obtain a
   prosperous result, to do nothing without God's permission, and not to
   undertake any deliberations except those which God has dictated and
   suggested by his word and Spirit. For here every future event is shown
   to us as in a glass when we wish to be wiser than they ought, and than
   God permits them. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 16:38

   38. And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood
   are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.

   38. Et judicabo te judiciis adulterarum, et fundentium sanguinem et
   ponam te sanguinem excandescentiae [122] et zeli. [123]


   This verse is only added for the sake of explanation. Already God had
   explained shortly and clearly every event which should happen to the
   Jews, yet they should perish in the greatest disgrace and be destitute
   of all help, since through distrust in God they sought the favor of
   men, like a woman eager for lovers. But he confirms the same teaching,
   that they should suffer double punishment, since they not only polluted
   themselves thus shamefully, but also by impious slaughters, since they
   burnt their children in honor of false gods. This sentence may be
   explained generally, I will judge you with the judgments of women
   pouring out blood, as we know that not only idolatry was rampant at
   Jerusalem, but rapine, and all kinds of cruelty; for since they had
   departed from God and his worship, they boldly violated his law. By the
   second word we may understand all the crimes by which they had provoked
   God's anger on account of their cruelty. But since he has lately spoken
   of sons, I willingly retain that sense, that they should suffer as an
   adulteress and a parricide who has put her children to death. But they
   thought that they obeyed: but he not only rejects, but abominates such
   foolish thoughts; for nothing is more disgraceful than, under the
   pretense of piety, to slay and to burn one's own children: this, I say,
   was a profanation of God's name scarcely tolerable. No wonder, then,
   that he denounces double vengeance, since, when the Jews pleaded their
   zeal, God branded upon them the mark of wickedness, though they thought
   him bound to their interests. It afterwards follows --

   Ezekiel 16:39

   39. And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw
   down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they
   shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels,
   and leave thee naked and bare.

   39. Et dabo te in manum eorum: et sublime tuum diruent, [124] et
   disrumpent [125] excelsa tua; et spoliabunt te vestibus tuis, et sument
   vasa gloriae tuae, [126] et dimittent te nudam et discoopertam.


   Here Ezekiel enlarges upon God's judgment, when he teaches that the
   Jews would not only be exposed to every disgrace, as if they were
   brought forward into a noble and conspicuous theater, but they would
   suffer spoliation and rapine from those in whom they formerly trusted.
   I will give thee, says he, into their hands He speaks of lovers and
   enemies: in truth, he says all shall meet together -- your ancient
   allies and friends as well as your enemies: and we know that they were
   spoiled at one time or another by the Egyptians, Assyrians, and
   Chaldaeans. For at the time when Jerusalem was taken and cut off, the
   Assyrians were reduced under the monarchy of the Chaldees. Babylon had
   oppressed Nineveh, as is well known, but the strength of both people
   were joined together. Thus the Jews were spoiled by them when they
   thought that they had provided for themselves very successfully by an
   alliance with the Assyrians against the kings of Israel and Syria: and
   afterwards, when they had formed an alliance with the Chaldaeans, they
   thought themselves beyond the reach of all danger. But now the Prophet
   derides there foolish confidence, and says that they should be spoiled
   by all their friends: so also he says that their altars should be
   thrown down. Those who translate it "a house of sin" do not
   sufficiently consider what I yesterday observed, that the Prophet uses
   the figure so as to mark a thing simply from any part of it. The
   Prophet's language is moderate or mixed, because he speaks partially of
   lofty and profane altars, and at the same time follows out its own
   simile. There is no doubt, therefore, that by a high place and lofty
   things he means altars themselves: although he does allude to these
   sinful houses, because he said in yesterday's lecture that the Jews
   stood at the top of the streets so as to entice any casual and unknown
   strangers to them. As also the Chaldaeans did not spare the temple, so
   there is no doubt that they destroyed all the altars promiscuously. and
   yet the Jews had wished to gratify them by destroying a part of them.
   But God shows how foolishly men imagine they shall succeed while they
   purposely fight against him: and experience teaches that the same thing
   happens to all unbelievers. For when any one has embraced his own
   superstitions, and despises what others think sacred and holy, then the
   conquerors destroy temples and images, and deform the region which they
   wish to be ruined and desolate. So also it is now said, they shall
   destroy your altars and high places. He now adds, and they shall spoil
   thee of thy garments, and take away the vessels of thy beauty. The
   Prophet comprehends in these words whatever benefits God had conferred
   on the Jews; for we know how liberally he had adorned them with his
   gifts, and especially in rendering the earth wonderfully fruitful by
   his blessing. He signifies in a word, that the Jews, when deprived of
   all their ornaments, would be disgraced; as it follows, and they shall
   send thee away naked and bare; that is, they shall cast thee off, just
   as a lover when satisfied rejects the companion of his iniquity.

   40. They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall

   40. Et ascendere facient contra te coetum, [127] et lapidabunt te
   lapidibus, [128] et perfodient te gladiis suis.


   Since what Ezekiel has hitherto brought forward was incredible, he now
   explains the manner of its accomplishment -- that the Chaldmans and
   Assyrians should bring a large army and bury the whole of Judea with
   stones, and pierce it through with swords. By these figures he simply
   means that there should be such slaughter that the whole region should
   be made desolate, just as if the enemy should slay all that they met
   with stones and swords. Some think that he alludes to stones which were
   thrown by engines of war; but I doubt whether the Prophet thought of
   this. What I have stated is more simple, that the Jews had no cause to
   think themselves free from that final slaughter of which the Prophet
   spoke, since numerous and powerful armies should come and overwhelm
   them with stones, and pierce them through with swords. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:41

   41. And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments
   upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease
   from playing the harlot, and thou also shall give no hire any more.

   41. Et exurent domes tuas igni, [129] et facient in te [130] judicia in
   oculis mulierum multarum, et cessare faciam te a scortando: atque etiam
   munus non offeres amplius.


   After he had spoken of the slaughter of men, he adds the burning of
   their dwellings. This was sad indeed, that the whole land should be
   deprived of inhabitants: but the deformity of this last slaughter was
   heaped upon them when the houses were burnt up; for the country was
   laid waste for the future, and for a length of time. For when men are
   slain others may succeed, if they find houses prepared, and fields not
   uncultivated. But when all these things are consumed by fire, and by
   other means of ruin, all hope for the future is taken away. The Prophet
   now means this when he says, that the houses were burnt up. He adds,
   they shall execute judgment against thee in the sight of many women. As
   he had used the simile of a harlot for the Jewish people, that the
   clauses of the sentence may correspond, he understands the neighboring
   people under the name of women. He confirms what we formerly saw, that
   the penalty which should be exacted of the Jews should be joined with
   the greatest disgrace. But this is very bitter, when not only we must
   perish, but the cruelty of enemies must be satiated while many behold
   us; and doubtless it was much more severe for the Jews to sustain the
   ridicule of their foes than to perish at once. If they had perished at
   once, death had not been such a torture to them as those mockeries by
   which they were harassed by their enemies. For we said that they were
   hated by almost all; and in the 137th Psalm (Psalm 137:7) it is shown
   that the Edomites, and others like them, said, by way of
   congratulation, Hail! hail! when Jerusalem was destroyed: Remember, O
   Lord, the sons of Edom, who said in the day of Jerusalem, Down with it,
   down with it, even to the ground. The Prophet, therefore, announces
   this, that the punishment which he formerly mentioned should be an
   example to all nations. He speaks improperly of the Chaldaeans, when he
   says that they should be executors of God's judgments, for there was
   not a duty assigned to them; but God often transfers to man as the
   instrument of his wrath what peculiarly belongs to himself alone. And
   in this way he wounds the Jews more severely when he makes the
   Chaldaeans their judges. God, properly speaking, was the sole judge who
   avenged the people's wickedness; but meanwhile he substitutes the
   Chaldaeans for himself, that the punishment might be the more
   disgraceful. He adds, and I will make thee cease from fornication, nor
   shall you offer gifts any more God does not mean that the Jews would be
   better when in exile, but simply reminds them that the opportunity for
   their sinning would be wanting, as when an immodest person is ashamed
   through being despised by every one, not through any improvement in her
   disposition, since her licentious feelings are the same as before. So
   also the Jews were always obstinate in their wickedness, though
   deprived of the opportunity of sinning. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:42

   42. So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall

   42. Et quiescere faciam excandescentiam meam in te, et recedet
   aemulatio mea abs te: et quiescam, et non irascar amplius.


   Although God seems here to promise some mitigation of his wrath, there
   is no doubt that he expresses what we formerly saw, namely, that such
   should be the destruction of the nation that there would be no need to
   return again to punish them. When, therefore, he says, I will make my
   indignation rest upon thee, it means that he would satiate himself with
   vengeance for all their crimes: so that the consumption of the people
   is here called the rest of God's indignation, as if he had said, When I
   have utterly reduced you to nothing, then my indignation against thee
   shall rest. In the same way he afterwards adds, and my indignation
   shall depart from thee. But I cannot finish today.

   which you set before us a specimen in your ancient people: and may we
   so devote ourselves to thee in the true chastity of faith, that we may

   inheritance which your only-begotten Son has acquired for us by his
   blood. -- Amen.

   Lecture Forty-Seventh

   We stopped yesterday at the passage where God pronounces that his
   rivalry should depart from the Jews. Some interpret this of jealousy,
   and this sense does not displease me; for we know that God has hitherto
   spoken in the character of a husband. But when a husband avenges the
   injury which he has suffered, he is enflamed with jealousy. Hence he
   has no moderation in his wrath; but when he begins to despise his wife
   because she is defiled, and to think her unworthy of further notice,
   then his anger and indignation is allayed. So, therefore, some
   understand it, My jealousy shall depart from thee, that is, You shall
   be no longer esteemed as my wife, but I shall despise thee as if you
   are altogether strange and unknown to me. But the word jealousy or
   rivalry may be taken otherwise; as he said yesterday, I will put upon
   thee the blood of indignation and jealousy, that is, I will treat thee
   in no milder way than those do who burn with wrath, and breathe out
   nothing but slaughters; as when any one is enflamed against his
   enemies, he slays all he meets. As, therefore, God put aside, in the
   last lecture, the blood of jealousy and anger, so in this place the
   word may be taken to mean simple rivalry; for God's qn'h, kenah, zeal,
   or ardor in vengeance, shall depart from the Jews, because material
   shall be deficient, as we explained it yesterday, I shall be at rest,
   says he, and shall not be angry anymore. By these words he confirms the
   same thing, that such should be the destruction of Jerusalem that God
   shall cease his wrath, as if he were satiated. He does not here promise
   any mitigation, as some think, but expresses its formidable nature,
   since it should consume and abolish the whole people, so that God's
   anger ceases, just like a fire is extinguished of its own accord when
   no fuel is left. This is the full sense. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:43

   43. Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast
   fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will
   recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt
   not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.

   43. Quia [131] non es recordata dierum adolescentiae tuae, et irritasti
   me in hoc toto [132] etiam ego viam tuam in caput reddam, [133] dicit
   Dominator Iehovah: et non fecisti cogitationem super cunctis
   abominationibus tuis. [134]


   He first blames the Jews for not reflecting on the liberality of their
   treatment. But that ingratitude was too shameful, since God had not
   omitted any kind of beneficence for their ornament. But since they
   thought themselves not adorned with sufficient splendor by God, and
   that he was less munificent than he ought to be, it may here be
   gathered that they were unworthy of such great and remarkable benefits.
   Finally, God here shows that how severely soever he punished the Jews,
   yet they deserved it for their ingratitude in not thinking him
   sufficiently liberal towards them: for their spirits were utterly
   broken. If a wife leave her husband, she is either compelled to do so
   by his perverse conduct, or else she betrays an illiberal disposition
   if she has been treated honorably. But since the Jews were bound to God
   so strongly in so many ways, their perfidy and revolt was so much the
   more detestable; for God does not suffer his blessings to be despised
   by us: since we must always mark the reason of his omitting nothing
   which may testify his paternal love towards us, namely, that we may
   celebrate his goodness. But when we turn his benefits to the
   profanation of his name, that is like mingling heaven and earth. Hence
   this passage against ingratitude must be remarked.

   He now adds, thou, has been tumultuous against me, or has moved or
   irritated me. rgn, regen, sometimes signifies to frighten, but it means
   here to quarrel with, contend, or be in a rage with: for the word may,
   in my opinion, be taken either actively or passively, and also as a
   neuter. If we take it in the neuter sense, it will mean that the Jews
   were tumultuous against God, as if they were seized by a turbulent
   spirit, so as to neglect and despise him, and to indulge themselves in
   wickedness. If you prefer the active sense, it means you have irritated
   me. He adds again, I also will recompense thy way upon thy head, [135]
   by which words God again affirms that he was not induced to punish the
   Jews by any rash or inconsiderate zeal, since if any one considered
   their crimes, he will acknowledge that they had received a just
   recompense. In fine, the mouth of the Jews is here stopped, lest they
   should suppose God to act unfairly when they were only reaping the
   fruit of their deeds. He next adds, and you have not made consideration
   I have already given two expositions in the note, but neither of them
   pleases me, for it seems altogether adverse to the Prophet's context to
   receive it as if God were the speaker: besides, it is not necessary to
   change the tense of the verb, and take the past for the future, when
   the sense tends in another direction. It agrees far better that the
   Jews did not recall to mind their own abominations so as to be
   displeased with them. To make consideration, means to reflect upon.
   zmh, zemeh, is mostly taken in a good sense, and signifies
   consideration simply; and as this is the word's proper meaning, we see
   that the Prophet here accuses the Jews of stupidity, because they did
   not turn their attention to reconsider their abominations. Those who
   take it for lewdness distort the sense. The whole meaning is, that the
   Jews were worthy of the horrible destruction which hung over them,
   because they were not only obstinate in their ingratitude, but
   altogether stupid: for their abominations were so foul before the
   nations, as we have formerly seen, that the daughters of the
   Philistines were ashamed of the wickedness of the nation, but they did
   not apply their minds to the consideration of these things. Since,
   therefore, their abominations were so gross, it was a mark of the
   greatest indolence not to turn their attention to review them. It now
   follows --

   [132] Or, "you have been tumultuous against me." -- Calvin.

   [133] "I will put." -- Calvin.

   [134] Others translate, "that you may not execute thy thought in all
   your abominations." Jerome reads it in the first person, and translates
   it thus: "I have not fulfilled my thought according to your
   abominations," as if God would praise his own clemency here in being so
   moderate in his wrath; but this is altogether foreign to the subject.

   [135] We must understand the pronoun "thy" before "head." -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 16:44-46

   44. Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
   against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.

   44. Ecce quisquis proverbiat [136] super te proverbiabit dicendo, Sicut
   mater filia ejus.

   45. Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her
   children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their
   husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your
   father an Amorite.

   45. Filia matris tuae es quae abjecit [137] maritum suum et filios
   suos: et soror sororis tuae [138] quae repudiarunt maritos suos, et
   filios suos. Mater vestra Chitaea, et pater vester Amorrhaeus.

   46. And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell
   at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right
   hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

   46. Et soror tua major Samaria est, et filiae ejus, quae habitant ad
   sinistram tuam: et soror tua minor prae te, quae habitat a dextris
   tuis, Sodoma et filiae, ejus.


   Here the Prophet uses another form of speech; for he says that the Jews
   deserved to be subject to the taunting proverbs of those who delight in
   wickedness. The sense is, that they were worthy of extreme infamy, so
   that their disgrace was bandied about in vulgar sayings. This is one
   point: he now adds, that proverbs of this kind were the Jews' desert --
   the daughter is like her mother and sisters Then he says, their mother
   was a Hittite, and their sisters Samaria and Sodom. We must briefly
   treat these clauses in order. When the Prophet speaks of proverbs, he
   doubtless means what I have touched on, namely, that the crimes of the
   nation deserved that their infamy should fly abroad on the tongues of
   all; for there are many sins which are hidden, through either their
   being spared, or their not seeming to be much noticed. If any one
   surpass all others in cruelty, avarice, lust, and other vices, his
   disgrace will be notorious, and he will be pointed at by vulgar
   proverbs. Hence Ezekiel dwells on the people's wickedness, since they
   supply material for all men to laugh at their expense; for he alludes
   to buffoons and wits, and such as are ingenious in fabricating vulgar
   sayings.

   The maker of proverbs shall utter this proverb against thee: like
   mother like daughter. There is no doubt that they used this saying at
   that period, and it often happens that daughters' faults are like their
   mothers'. Daughters indeed often degenerate from the best mothers, and
   matrons will be found who excel in the virtues of modesty, chastity,
   sobriety, and watchfulness, while their daughters are rash and proud,
   luxurious, lustful, and intemperate; but it usually happens that a
   mother has wicked daughters like herself: this happens less by nature
   than by education; for a woman of a perverse inclination will think
   that a stigma attaches to herself if her daughter is better than she
   is, and so she will wish to form her after her own morals; hence it
   happens that few daughters are found modest whose mothers are immodest:
   few sober who have been brought up by drunkards. Since therefore
   experience always taught the similarity between mothers and daughters,
   hence this proverb was in the mouth of every one. Proverbs, however,
   are not always true, but only on the whole; but God sometimes extends
   his pity so far that the daughter of a wicked woman is honorable and
   well conducted. But this is very rare: hence this proverbial saying
   cannot be rejected, -- like mother like daughter. It now follows: thou
   art the daughter of thy mother; that is, altogether like her: and this
   phrase is equally common among us, "Thou art thy father's son," namely,
   you are like him in thy sins. Thus the Prophet means that the nation
   was like their mother, since it differed in nothing from the Canaanites
   and the Hittites. He adds also, sister and their daughters, as if he
   would collect the whole family. He says that Samaria is their elder
   sister, and Sodom their younger. I know not whether those who think
   that Samaria is called older than Jerusalem, through its revolting
   first from the worship of God, have sufficient grounds for their
   interpretation: for as we go on we shall see that Samaria is compared
   with Sodom, and since Sodom is the worst, it is very naturally compared
   with it. For Jerusalem will afterwards be placed in the highest rank,
   because it had surpassed them all in enormity. Samaria therefore is one
   of the sisters, and so is Sodom these towns are called daughters, for
   we know that Sodom was not the only one destroyed by fire from heaven,
   since there were five cities. (Genesis 10:19, and Genesis 19:25.) We
   see, then, why those smaller cities near at hand were called daughters
   of Sodom, and as far as Samaria is concerned, it was the head of the
   kingdom of Israel: hence all the cities of the ten tribes were called
   its daughters.

   With relation to the father, the Prophet says here more than he had
   ventured before. He says, their father was an, Amorite, as if the Jews
   had sprung from profane nations, and did not draw their origin from a
   holy parent; and the Prophet very often makes this objection, not that
   they were spurious or descended according to the flesh from the
   uncircumcised Gentiles, but because they were unworthy of their father
   Abraham, through being degenerate. In fine, God here signifies that the
   parents of the Jews were not only profane nations but utterly
   reprobate, and those whom God for very just reasons had ordered to be
   destroyed, since they had contaminated the earth with their crimes far
   too long. He says that the Jews were like a daughter sprung from most
   abandoned parents. As to his saying, that the mother as well as sisters
   had despised their husbands, this may seem absurd. But we know that in
   proverbs, parables, examples, and comparisons, all things ought not to
   be exacted with the utmost nicety. When Christ's coming is said to be
   stealthy, (Matthew 24:43, 44,) if any one here desires to be cunning
   and inquires how Christ is like a thief, that will be absurd. And also
   in this place when it is said, thy mother has abandoned her husband and
   her sons, and thy sisters have done the same. God simply means that
   both the mother and sisters of Jerusalem were impure and perfidious
   women; and cruel also, since they not only had violated the marriage
   pledge and had thus broken through all chastity, but were like
   ferocious beasts against their own sons. (Luke 12:39, 40; 1
   Thessalonians 5:2.) He reproves the crime which we yesterday exposed,
   that of the Jews burning their own sons. In fine, he means to compare
   the Jews with the Canaanites, the Samaritans, and the Sodomites, in
   both perfidy and cruelty. Hence they are first condemned for throwing
   away all modesty and conjugal fidelity, and next for forgetting all
   humanity. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 16:47

   47. Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their
   abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast
   corrupted more than they in all thy ways.

   47. Et non in viis ipsarum ambulasti, et non secundum abominationes
   earum fecisti quasi parum [139] et exiguum: et corrupt, es prae illis
   in cunctis viis tuis.


   Now the Prophet, not content with the simile which he had used, says
   that the Jews were far worse than either their mothers or sisters. Yet
   he is not inconsistent, for God wished by degrees to drag the wicked to
   trial. If at the very first word he had said that they were worse than
   the Sodomites, they would have been less attentive to this accusation.
   But when he proposed a thing incredible, namely, that they were the
   daughters of the nations of Canaan, and the sisters of Samaria and
   Sodom, and afterwards proceeded further, and pronounced that they
   surpassed both their mother and sisters, this, as I have said, would
   stir up their minds more vehemently. This difference then contains no
   inconsistency, but rather tends to magnify their crimes. You, says he,
   have not walked according to their ways. He does not here exempt the
   Jews from participating in sins as if they were faultless through not
   imitating the Hittites, or Sodomites, or Israelites: but the word
   walking ought to be restricted to the sense of equality, as if he said,
   you are not equal. But it is a kind of correction when God says that
   the Jews were not equal to the Hittites or Sodomites, meaning that
   their impiety was more detestable, since they rushed forward to all
   kinds of wickedness with greater license. We now understand the
   Prophet's meaning when he says that; the Jews had not walked in the
   ways of either Sodom or Samaria or the nations of Canaan, since they
   had gone before them, and even with greater ardor of pursuit; for if
   they had simply imitated the three people of whom mention has been
   made, they had walked in their ways. But when they were so hurried on
   in their intemperance as to run before them, they did not walk in their
   ways only through leaving them behind. And this comparison will
   sufficiently explain the Prophet's mind, that the Jews did not follow
   either the Sodomites, Israelites, or Canaanites, but through their base
   and headlong violence left them far behind. And he says, as if it were
   only a small matter, that is, as if it were of little moment to thee to
   be like thy mother and sisters. But you have been corrupt, says he,
   before them. He now explains the case more clearly, since they had not
   walked in their ways through precipitating themselves with greater
   license, as we have already said. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:48

   48. As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she
   nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.

   48. Vivo ego, dicit Dominator Iehovah, si fecerit Sodoma, soror tua
   ipsa et filiae ejus quemadmodum fecisti tu, et filiae tuae.


   Since what we have lately seen was difficult to be believed, hence God
   interposes an oath. Nor is it surprising that shame was so despised and
   cast far away by the Jews, since they were inured to it; and we know
   how they were swollen with pride, for they always boasted in their
   adoption and gloried in the name of God. Besides, we know that at this
   day, if any one accuses a wicked nation, yet it is not so detestable as
   Sodom, and if he uses this phrase, he inflames all against himself, and
   causes them to reject his language with indignation. For who will
   suffer either one city or nation to be compared with Sodom? As far as
   concerned the Jews, we have said that it was intolerable in them to be
   fastidious and proud. There was also another reason why they should be
   indignant at being pronounced worse than the Sodomites: since God had
   not chosen them as his peculiar treasure in vain and marked them with
   magnificent titles: you shall be a nation of priests unto me, you shall
   be my inheritance, and besides, my son -- my first-born Israel. (Exodus
   19:6, and Exodus 4:22.) We now see how necessary the interposition by
   oath was to sanction what the Prophet had said. God therefore here
   swears by himself, because we call him in as a witness and judge when
   we swear. But he swears by himself or by his life, because, as the
   Apostle teaches, he has no greater by whom to swear. (Hebrews 6:13.)
   Whatever it be, he here prostrates all foolish boasting, by which the
   Jews were puffed up when he swears by himself, that they were worse
   than Sodom and her daughters. And here also he calls in like manner the
   smaller cities daughters of Jerusalem. This was very hard upon the
   Jews, when the Prophet says and often repeats, thy sister Sodom. But he
   wounds their feelings far more bitterly, that Sodom was just in
   preference to Jerusalem: this was indeed intolerable, and yet we see
   that the Holy Spirit by no means indulges them here. Hence we must not
   regard what the reprobate are able to bear, but they must be treated
   according to their own disposition, and since they rise fiercely
   against God, so also are they to be subdued, and, according to the
   common proverb, "a hard wedge must be formed for a hard knot." It now
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:49

   49. Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness
   of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters,
   neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

   49. Ecce haec fuit iniquitas Sodomae sororis tuae, superbia, satietas
   panis, et securitas oti [140] fuit illi et filiabus ejus: et manum
   egeni et inopis non apprehendit.


   Here God begins to show the reason why he extenuated the wickedness of
   Sodom in comparison with that of his own people: for if he had spoken
   generally, without explaining the counsel of God, his language would
   have been incredible, and so would have been ineffectual. But now God
   shows that he did not pronounce rashly what we heard before, namely,
   that the Jews were worse than the Sodomites. How so? for this was the
   iniquity of Sodom thy sister, says he, first pride, then fullness of
   bread, and luxury in which they were in the habit of indulging, and of
   drowning themselves in ease to enjoy a long peace; afterwards, they did
   not seize the hand of the poor. Now he adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [140] Or, "quiet peace;" others, "abundance of ease." -- Calvin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:50

   50. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
   therefore I took them away as I saw good

   50. Et superbe se extulit, et fecit abominationem coram me, et abstuli
   ipsos quemadmodum vidi. [141]


   We must diligently attend to this passage; for God does not here excuse
   the wickedness of Sodom; but, abominable as that people was, he says
   that the Jews were yet more abandoned. We know why God inflicted his
   vengeance in a terrible manner against the Sodomites and their
   neighbors, for that was a fearful example; and Judea says that it was a
   kind of mirror of the wrath of God which awaits all the impious, (Jude
   1:7;) and Scripture often recalls us to that proof of God's judgement:
   but we must see how Sodom rushed forward to that degree of
   licentiousness so as to be horrified by no enormity. God says that they
   began by pride, and surely pride is the mother of all contempt of God
   and of all cruelty. Let us learn, then, that we cannot be restrained by
   the fear of God, unless moderation and humility reign within us. Pride,
   we know, has two horns, so to speak; one is, when men forget their own
   condition, and claim to themselves not only more than is right, but
   what God alone calls his own. This, then, is one horn of pride, when
   men, trusting in their dignity, excellence, plenty, and wealth, are
   intoxicated by false imaginations, so as to think themselves equal to
   God. Now, another horn of pride is, when they do not acknowledge their
   vices, and despise others in comparison with themselves, and please
   themselves in enormities, just as if they were free from any future
   account. Since, therefore, pride is contained in these two clauses,
   when men arrogate too much to themselves, and thus are blind to their
   own vices, each of these is doubtless condemned in the Sodomites, since
   they first raised themselves by a rash confidence, and then refused to
   subject themselves to God, and rebelled against him as if they could
   shake off his yoke.

   He afterwards adds fullness of bread. But the Prophet seems to condemn
   in the Sodomites what was not blamable in itself: for when God feeds us
   bountifully, fullness is not to be considered a crime; but he takes it
   here for immoderate gluttony; for those who have abundance are often
   luxurious, and nothing is more rare than self-restraint when materials
   for luxury are supplied to us. Hence fullness of bread is here taken
   for intemperance, since the Sodomites were so addicted to gluttony and
   drunkenness, that they gratified their appetites worse than the brutes,
   who do retain some moderation, for they are content with their own
   food: but men's covetousness is altogether insatiable. Let us observe,
   then, that by fullness of bread we are to understand that intemperance
   in which profane men indulge when God supplies them bountifully with
   the means of living; for they do not consider why they abound in wine,
   and corn, and abundance of all things, but they drown themselves in
   luxuries with a blind and brutal impulse. Hence such greediness, so
   inflaming to the spirits of the Sodomites, is added to pride, that they
   arrogate to themselves more than is just. He afterwards adds, and rest;
   tvls, sheloth: some translate it abundance, but almost everywhere it
   means peace; the noun tqs, sheket, which is added next, means properly
   rest; so that it will be the peace of rest or ease, and this seems
   without blame: for why shall we not be permitted to enjoy ease, if no
   one molests or troubles us? nay, it is reckoned among God's blessings:
   you shall sleep, and no one shall frighten thee. (Leviticus 26:6.)
   Since God, therefore, wishes this to be considered among his blessings,
   that the faithful should sleep soundly, without any anxiety or trouble,
   why is Sodom condemned for thus enjoying ease and peace? But here its
   excess is pointed out, not its true use, since the use of peace is to
   render our minds tranquil, that we may return thanks to God, and dwell
   calmly under his sway. But how do the reprobate act? They grow brutish,
   so to speak, in their own peacefulness. Hence sloth is in this passage
   meant by the peacefulness of ease, and God means that the Sodomites
   were intoxicated by their luxuries when they enjoyed peace. We must put
   off the remainder.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you have deigned to graft us once into the
   body of your only-begotten Son, that we may be mindful of our origin,
   since from our very birth we were lost and cursed; and grant that we
   may be mindful of that grace by which you have honored us, so that we
   may worship thee as a father, and preserve our trust in thee inviolate:
   and may we be so obedient to thee that thy image may be renewed in us
   more and more in all righteousness and holiness, until thy glory may
   perfectly shine forth in us in thy heavenly kingdom by the same Jesus
   Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Forty-Eighth.

   We began in the last lecture to treat that passage where God pronounces
   that the Jews surpassed in all kinds of wickedness both the Sodomites
   and the ten tribes of Israel. When he wished to prove this he said that
   the iniquity of Sodom was pride, fullness of bread, and then ease, with
   sloth and cruelty: afterwards he put another kind of pride, since the
   people were intoxicated with confidence, and indulged in unbridled and
   brutal license, as he afterwards says. For he adds, that the cities
   were overthrown and destroyed since they had perpetrated foul
   abominations. With regard to excess, we said that good living simply is
   not here condemned when any one uses the affluence granted to him for
   God's glory; but luxury and intemperance. For the rich boast as much as
   possible, and are not only eager for delicacies, and stuff themselves
   to the full, but they triumph and luxuriate in what is sure to destroy
   them. The Prophet then blames this in the Sodomites. We said also of
   quiet and rest, that it denoted that sloth by which the profane madden
   themselves; but that is more clearly expressed shortly by
   vain-boasting. The Prophet now adds, that they had not seized the hand
   of the poor and needy. We must notice this, since pride is almost
   always cruel; and truly no one heartily succors his poor brethren who
   is not affected by their necessities. But those who are intoxicated by
   false confidence, and claim everything for themselves, despise their
   brethren, and thus carelessly permit them to be utterly oppressed by
   poverty and want. The Prophet here pronounces nothing concerning Sodom
   but what we too often perceive by daily experience. He now adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:50

   50. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
   therefore I took them away as I saw good.

   50. Et extulit se, [142] et fecerunt abominationem coram facie mea, et
   abstuli eas quemadmodum volui. [143]


   Here God shows that Sodom had not at first fallen into those foul and
   gross crimes which were the cause of its final destruction. We must
   diligently mark this: for when Satan begins to entice us, we think that
   we shall be free to retract our steps whenever we please; but we are
   ensnared, some in one way and some in another. But when we are
   entangled by Satan's deceits, it is not in our power to escape from
   them; nay, we feel that we are involved in a complete labyrinth. Since,
   then, men proceed gradually in provoking God's wrath, we must observe
   this passage, in which God informs us that the Sodomites were not given
   up at once to enormous lust, but they began with smaller sins, and then
   became luxurious through their abundance, and were stupefied by ease
   and quiet; meanwhile they despised the poor and needy, and did not
   stretch forth their hands to them. For to seize the hand means the same
   as to stretch forth the hand, when we set up again those who have
   fallen, or prop up those who are slipping. Hence God shows that the
   Sodomites were afterwards so corrupted by luxuries, that he at length
   adds, that they raised themselves up, that is, that they purposely, and
   of their own accord, exempted themselves from all fear of punishment:
   for this is the meaning of the word raised up; that is, they buoyed
   themselves up, since they promised themselves freedom from punishment;
   and in that fallacious hope they dared to perpetrate abomination before
   my face. Hence we must always fear lest Satan should entangle us by His
   enticements, and at length so fascinate and stupefy our senses that we
   can no longer distinguish between good and evil, as the Sodomites
   exceeded the brutes in their abominations, which were the cause of
   their ruin.

   When God announces that he removed those cities as he pleased, he
   wishes to inspire the Jews with terror, lest they should suppose that
   they would profit by turning their backs; because, whether they wished
   it or not, he would at length drag them before his tribunal. God,
   therefore, here passes the final sentence, that the Jews may feel that
   they must render an account to him. Now, if any one should ask whether
   these crimes which Ezekiel relates are worse than those of the Jews,
   the answer is at hand, that the Sodomites were not under the law; and
   hence it is no wonder if they wandered and stumbled in darkness: but
   when the right course of life was pointed out to the Jews, they
   professedly sought their own destruction, they knowingly and willfully
   rejected God's yoke, and haughtily despised all the prophets who daily
   desired to recall them into the path of duty. Other circumstances are
   also to be noticed, that the Jews not only abused the goods which God
   plentifully bestowed upon them, but, as we have seen, squandered them
   upon adulterous worship, and then they fetched from thence all kinds of
   superstition, and became worse than the beasts, as we have seen
   elsewhere. While we know that the imitation of the people of Sodom was
   very common in Judea, when they were tainted with many corruption's
   through forgetfulness of the law. If, therefore, we weigh these points
   together, it will not be surprising that God pronounces the Jews to
   have sinned more grievously that the Sodomites. It now follows --

   [142] "And they raised themselves up," for he comprehends the daughters
   of Sodom, that is, the neighboring cities. -- Calvin.

   [143] That is, "as I pleased and desired." -- Calvin. He repeats
   Ezekiel 16:50.

   Ezekiel 16:51

   51. Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
   multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy
   sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.

   51. Et Samaria secundum dimidium scelerum tuorum non scelerate egit: et
   multiplicasti abominationes tuas prae illis, et justificasti sorores
   tuas in omnibus abominationibus tuis quas patrasti.


   God now pronounces the same thing concerning Samaria, whom he had
   formerly called the younger sister. By Samaria, as we said, he means
   the Israelites, because that city was the head of the Kingdom of
   Israel: the ten tribes had been already driven into exile; and he says
   they were not half so wicked when compared with the Jews. This, at the
   first glance, may seem absurd; for we know that God's worship was
   continued at Jerusalem when the Israelites rejected the law, and basely
   and openly turned aside to idolatry. Since, therefore, some sound piety
   flourished at Jerusalem when the Israelites wickedly revolted from
   God's law, what can it mean by the Jews being censured as worse than
   they were? We must always come to the fountain which I have pointed
   out; for ingratitude has great influence in exaggerating men's crimes.
   But another reason must also be remarked. The Jews had seen how
   severely God had avenged the superstitions of the kingdom of Israel:
   they were so far from repenting that they rather courted their
   alliance, as if for the very purpose of provoking God afresh. If we
   reflect upon these two points, the question will be solved as far as
   relates to the present passage. God says what is incredible to us, that
   the Jews were worse than the Israelites: but he asserts this, because
   ingratitude had rendered them less excusable; for God had retained them
   under his own charge when that wretched dispersion happened, and the
   ten tribes were all but absorbed. God's candle was always shinning at
   Jerusalem, as it is said. (Exodus 27:20.) When, therefore, God had
   preserved for himself that small band as the very flower of the people,
   safe and sound, the revolt of this people was far more criminal than
   that of the ten tribes: for these tribes were drawn away from the
   worship of God by little and little, as is well known. For Jeroboam
   always set before himself one definite object -- the worship of God as
   the liberator of the people, (1 Kings 12:) for the Israelites did not
   look on themselves as apostates, although they had degenerated from
   their fathers. But the Jews addicted themselves to gross superstitions,
   of which the Israelites at first were ashamed; and then they were
   warned by many penalties not to imitate their kinsmen: still, as we saw
   before, the temple was defiled by many pollution's; for Ezekiel, in the
   eighth chapter, says that he saw there many defilement's. Since then
   the Jews profited so badly, though God set his vengeance before their
   eyes, it is not surprising that they are said to have sinned
   grievously.

   In conclusion, he adds, thou hast multiplied your abominations beyond
   them; and you have justified thy sisters in all the abominations which
   you have perpetrated. Here the word "justified" is to be received at
   first comparatively: it does not signify that the fault of others is
   extenuated by the wickedness of the Jews; but if the people wished to
   offer excuses, they might easily be convinced that both Sodom and the
   kingdom of Israel were just in comparison with the Jews. To justify is
   usually received for to absolve; and we must observe this when we treat
   of justification, since the papists always seize upon the quality, as
   if to be justified was in reality to be just. Hence they are unable to
   comprehend a doctrine sufficiently familiar to Scripture, and plain
   enough -- that we are justified by faith: for they examine man, that
   they may find justice there, and do not ascend any higher: but to be
   justified by faith signifies nothing but to be absolved, though we are
   not just in ourselves; hence a justification by faith without us must
   be sought for, and hence we gather that it is not a quality. Hence
   Jerusalem justified her sisters, although Sodom and Samaria were found
   worse than herself. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:52

   52. Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for
   thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are
   more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy
   shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.

   52. Etiam tu porta probrum tuum quae judicasti sororem tuam in
   sceleribus tuis quibus impie egisti [144] prae illis: justificatae sunt
   prae te. Atque etiam tu [145] pudefias, et porta probrum tuum, quod
   justificaveris sorores tuas.


   Here at length God announces that he would punish the Jews according to
   their deserts. Hitherto he has recounted their crimes, as judges are
   accustomed, when they condemn criminals, to state the reasons which
   induce them to pass sentence: thus God shortly shows how wicked the
   Jews were. He now adds, that he would avenge them according to the
   magnitude of their crimes. For they would easily have swallowed all
   reproaches if the fear of punishment had not been infused into them.
   This second head, then, was necessary, lest they should Judea off with
   impunity, since they had surpassed both Sodom and Samaria. Do thou also
   bear thy disgrace who has judged thy sisters. Here Ezekiel seems to be
   at variance with himself, for he said just now and will repeat again
   shortly, that Jerusalem had justified her sisters; and this is contrary
   to judging. But he says that Samaria was condemned by the Jews; and the
   solution of this discrepancy is easy: for the Jews justified both the
   Israelites and the Sodomites, not by absolving them in any sentence
   passed on them, but because they were worthy of double condemnation; as
   Christ says, In the last day it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and
   Gomorrah than for the Jews. (Matthew 11:24.) But what is here said of
   condemnation has another meaning -- that the Jews insulted over their
   brethren when they saw their kingdom destroyed, and the Israelites
   driven away from their land. Since they spoke so proudly of the
   slaughter of the ten tribes, as if innocent themselves, the Prophet
   here reproves them as if they judged them. And this is too common with
   all hypocrites, to inveigh hardly against all others, and to grow hot
   against them, as if in this way they covered their own crimes. And Paul
   reproves this vice in them, since they were supercilious censors of
   others, and at the same time committed every sin. Thinkest you, O man,
   says he, when you judge others, that God will not condemn thee; for who
   art you, O mortal man? Do you claim the office of a judge? (Romans
   2:1-3.) Meanwhile will God be deprived of his rights, so as not to call
   thee to account for thy sins? Now, therefore, we understand the
   Prophet's intention: for he exaggerates the crimes of the Jews when he
   pronounces sentence from on high against the ten tribes. Truly God
   blotted out this kingdom deservedly: for they were apostates; they had
   revolted from the family of David, and had violated that sacred unity
   by which God had bound to himself the whole family of Abraham. They had
   indeed just cause for speaking thus in condemning the Israelites; but
   when they were worse than them, what arrogance it was to harass their
   brethren, and to be blind to their own vices, nay, to grow utterly
   callous to them!

   Thou, therefore, have judged thy sister, that is, you have taken God's
   office upon thee, and yet you were worse than thy sister. Some explain
   it otherwise, that the Jews judged the ten tribes as long as they
   remained in a moderate degree worshipers of God: but they do not attend
   to the context. There is no doubt that the Prophet here rebukes the
   pride with which the Jews were puffed up, while they judged others
   severely and themselves leniently. They were justified in comparison
   with thee, says he: you, therefore, he repeats, blush and bear thy
   disgrace. This repetition is not superfluous, although in the former
   words there was nothing obscure, for it was difficult to persuade the
   Jews that they should suffer punishment, since God had borne with them
   so long. God's goodness, then, which invited them to repentance, had
   rather hardened them, and had occasioned so much torpor that they
   thought themselves free from all danger. Hence this is the reason why
   the Prophet confirms his former teaching concerning the nearness of
   God's vengeance against them. He says, when you have justified them. He
   here repeats the cause, and does so to restrain all pretenses by which
   the Jews could in any way protect themselves. For by one word he shows
   that they must perish, since they had justified those who had been
   treated so strictly. For it is by no means likely, that God should
   cease from his office of judge in one direction, since he had been so
   severe against the Sodomites, who were in some way excusable for their
   errors. This then is the reason why the Prophet affirms again that
   Sodom and Samaria were justified by the Jews. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:53

   53. When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom
   and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then
   will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:

   53. Et convertam captivitatem earum, captivitatem Sodomae et filiarum
   ejus, et c.aptivitatem Samartiae et filiarum ejus, et captivitatem
   captivitatum tuarum in medio ipsarum.


   He here confirms again what we lately saw, that the Jews were doomed
   and devoted to final destruction, nor was it possible for them to
   escape any more than for Sodom to rise again and Samaria to be restored
   to her original dignity. The Jews foolishly corrupt this passage, since
   they think that restoration is promised to Israel and Sodom. But by
   Sodomites they mean the Moabites and Ammonites, the descendants of Lot
   who dwell at Sodom: but a child may see that this is trifling. There is
   no doubt that the Prophet here deprives the Jews of all hope of safety
   by reasoning upon an impossibility: as if he had said, you shall be
   safe when Sodom and Samaria are. We now understand the Prophet's
   meaning. But the inquiry arises -- how can he pronounce none of the
   Israelites safe, when their return home is so often promised? But we
   must bear in mind, what we saw elsewhere, and what it is often
   necessary to repeat, since many passages in the prophets would
   otherwise give rise to scruples. Therefore we have sometimes said, that
   the prophets speak of the people in two ways; for they sometimes regard
   the whole body of the nation promiscuously: but the Israelites were
   already alienated from God; afterwards the Jews also cut themselves off
   from him. Since therefore each people, considering them in a body and
   in the mass, to speak roughly, was outcast, it is not surprising if the
   prophets use this language -- that no hope of mercy remained -- since
   they had excluded themselves from God's mercy. But afterwards they
   change their discourse to the remnant: for God always preserves a
   hidden seed, that the Church should not be utterly extinguished: for
   there must always be a Church in the world, but sometimes it is
   preserved miserably as it were in a sepulcher, since it is nowhere
   apparent. God, therefore, when he denounces final vengeance on the
   Jews, regards the body of the people, but then he promises that there
   shall be a small seed which he wishes to remain safe. Hence it is said
   in Isaiah, (Isaiah 8:16,) seal my law, bind up my testimony among my
   disciples; that is, address my disciples as if you were reading in a
   hidden corner any writing which you did not wish to be made public. Do
   you therefore collect my disciples together, that you may deliver to
   them my law and my testimony like a sealed letter. But now God cites to
   his tribunal those degenerate Jews who had nothing in common with
   Abraham, since they had made void and utterly abolished his covenant:
   Now, therefore, we see how the Jews perished together with Sodom and
   Samaria, and were never restored, that is, as far as relates to that.
   filth and dregs which were utterly unworthy of the honor of which they
   boasted. I will restore, therefore, their captivities; namely, the
   captivity of Sodom and of its cities, and the captivity of Samaria and
   its cities, and the captivity of thy captivities, that is, and the
   captivity of all thy land; I will restore you, says he, altogether; but
   he speaks ironically, and, as I have said, he shows that God's taking
   pity upon the Jews was impossible. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:54

   54. That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in
   all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.

   54. Ut portes probrum tuum, et pudefias ab omnibus quae fecisti,
   consolando ipsas.


   Hence we gather from the last verse, that God gave the Jews no hope of
   safety, but rather confirms their utter destruction, so that no future
   safety was to be hoped for. For he says, that you may bear thy reproach
   and become ashamed, namely, because they had sinned grievously, as I
   have said before, and had not repented of their wickedness. He adds, in
   consoling them. He speaks after the ordinary manner of men, since the
   miserable feel some consolation in seeing themselves perish among a
   great multitude. This then is the consolation of which the Prophet
   speaks, not that the sorrow of Sodom and Samaria was mitigated when
   they saw the Jews joined to themselves, but, as I have said, God adopts
   the common language of men. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:55

   55. When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their
   former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their
   former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former
   estate.

   55. Et sorores tuae Sodoma, et filiae ejus revertentur ad pristina sua,
   [146] et Samaria et filiae, ejus revertentur ad antiquitatem suam,
   [147] et tu et filiae tuae revertimini ad pristinum statum.


   A clearer explanation of the former doctrine now follows, that the
   Jews, should thus feel God merciful when his mercy reached Samaria and
   Sodom; but that never could be done, and hence the Jews were reduced to
   despair; for, as I have said, the Prophet argues from what is
   impossible and almost absurd. Just as Virgil writes --

   "The inhabitants of seas and skies shall change,
   And fish on shore, and stags in air shall range:"
   Virgil, Dryden's, Eclogue 1. V. 60 --

   which can never take place: so that it implies the complete denial of
   what might seem doubtful. This way of speaking is proverbial, when
   Ezekiel says that the Sodomites and Israelites should return to their
   ancient state or their former dignity; and that could never be hoped
   for, as I have said: hence it follows, that the Jews could not be safe
   when God draws them into the same punishment. Besides, the Prophet
   speaks as if the city should be cut off and temple overthrown, since
   the Jews had often been threatened with this, and he had shown them the
   wrath of God present before their eyes. But, although they had always
   hoped well, yet he despises their pride by which they were blinded, and
   utters his prophecies openly as if God had executed whatever he had
   threatened. For this reason he says, the captivity of thy captivities
   shall be in the midst of them. But they might object, that they enjoyed
   their country, that they still cultivated their fields, and had
   sufficient food for their support although besieged by their enemies.
   But the Prophet looked down upon it all, because before God the city
   was as it were taken and all were exiles, since God had not threatened
   them in vain. Weakness here compels me to break off.

   Grant, Almighty God, since in your inestimable mercy you have deigned

   Ezekiel 16:56-57

   56. For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of
   thy pride,

   56. Et non fuit Sodoma soror tua in sermonem in ore tuo in die
   superbiarum tuarum, [148]

   57. Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy
   reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her,
   the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.

   57. Priusquam detegeretur malitia tua secundum tempus probri filiarum
   Syriae, et omnium quae in circuitu ejus sunt filiarum Philistim, quae
   spreverunt [149] te a circuitu.


   God here blames the Jews because they did not attend to that remarkable
   judgment which he had executed against the Sodomites: for they had
   always before their eyes what ought to retain them in the fear of God;
   for that was a formidable spectacle, as it is this day. They knew that
   region to have been like the paradise of God, as it is called by Moses.
   (Genesis 13:10.) Since, then, the fertility and pleasantness of the
   place was so great, to see there the lake of sulphur and bitumen was
   sufficient material for instructing them, unless they had been utterly
   sluggish. But the Prophet says, that there was no mention of Sodom
   while the Jews lived happily; and we know that it was a great crime not
   to consider God's judgments, as we read in Isaiah. (Isaiah 5:12.) Among
   other things he says, that the Jews and Israelites were so corrupt that
   they did not regard God's works: hence as it is a useful exercise to
   consider God's judgments, yea, this is the chief prudence of the
   faithful; so, on the other hand, those who shut their eyes to the
   manifest judgments of God are like the brutes. And yet this is a very
   common fault, especially when the circumstance here expressed is added,
   that profane men do not attend to God's operations through being
   intoxicated by prosperity; for in this passage we have two ways of
   explaining the word g'vnyk, gaonik, which the Prophet uses for pride or
   loftiness. Sometimes the word g'vn, gaon, is taken in a bad sense, as
   well as for sublimity or any high degree of honor. Besides, the
   Prophet's meaning is clear, while things proceeded according to the
   Jews desires they were not anxious about rendering an account before
   God; nay, they passed by with their eyes shut that memorable example
   which God designed for them in Sodom and the neighboring cities.
   Therefore we should learn from this passage, when God indulges us, and
   treats us softly and delicately, that we must always recall his
   judgments to mind, that we may be restrained from all licentiousness,
   lest prosperity should incite us to self-indulgence; for such
   remembrance is most needful. For we know that nothing is more dangerous
   than to exult like ferocious horses when God feeds us in abundance.
   Hence the remedy must be taken in time that we may receive instruction
   from the examples of punishment which we read in Scripture, or in other
   histories, or such as we witness with our own eyes. He adds, before thy
   wickedness was discovered. Here Ezekiel says that their wickedness was
   discovered, when it appeared that God was hostile to their sins;
   because even then, when their sins could be pointed out with the finger
   as notorious throughout Jerusalem, yet the people gloried in them; just
   as if an immodest woman, who is the town's talk, is saluted honorably
   by all because she has many admirers to worship and adore her, and so
   sets herself above every chase matron: but if they all reject her, and
   she is reduced to want, and to foul and disgraceful ulcers, then all
   her enormities are made evident. This is the effect of which the
   Prophet speaks: before, says he, thy enormities were discovered. How
   so? God, indeed, constantly proclaimed them by his prophets, and the
   wickedness of the people was open enough; but then they also remained
   as if buried: for they proudly rejected all the prophetic warnings, and
   were even restive against God himself: thus they lay hid under their
   own hiding-places. But when they became a laughingstock they were
   spoiled by their neighbors, and suffered the extremity of reproach, and
   then it was apparent that God had rejected them; for their crimes were
   detected by punishments, since neither reproofs nor threats profited
   them in any way.

   Besides, interpreters explain this of the slaughter which the Jews
   suffered in the time of Ahaz. (2 Kings 16.) For then the King of Syria
   laid waste almost the whole region, and the citizens of Jerusalem were
   grievously fined. The Philistines took advantage of this occasion and
   made an irruption: they think, therefore, that the time is pointed out
   when the King of Syria made war upon the Israelites, and violently
   assaulted Judea. But I know not whether the Prophet looks to the
   future, as I said yesterday; for he speaks of punishment at hand, just
   as if God was fulfilling what he had already determined. I am inclined
   to think that the beginning and the end ought to be united. Hence God
   begins to disclose the wickedness of the people from the time when the
   burning consumed their neighbors till it reached themselves; for the
   slaughter of the tribes of Israel brought upon them many losses, as we
   know well enough. But God seems to embrace their ultimate destruction,
   which was now at hand. Hence he says, that they had been, and would be,
   a laughingstock to the daughters of Syria, and the nations all around,
   and also to the daughters of the Philistines. But because they were
   spoiled by the Philistines, who took their cities, as the sacred
   narrative informs us, it is very suitable thus to explain the word s't,
   shat, to despise, in this passage. But because it signifies to despise,
   and the Prophet spoke of reproach, he may repeat the same thing of the
   Philistines which he had a little before said of the Syrians. It
   follows --

   Ezekiel 16:58

   58. Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the
   LORD.

   58. Pravas cogitationes tuas, [150] et abominationes tuas, tu portasti
   ea, dicit Iehovah.


   Here God repeats what we saw before, that the Jews were deprived of all
   excuse. We know how bold they were in their expostulations, and how
   they always cried out when God treated them severely. Because,
   therefore, complaints were always flying about from this proud people,
   here, as before, God pronounces that they deserved their sufferings:
   you bear, says he, not any immoderate rigor of which you falsely accuse
   me, but your abominations and crimes. zmh, zemeh, signifies simply
   purpose, but also abomination, so that it is better to translate it
   wickedness or baseness. Now, therefore, we understand the Prophet's
   intention, that the Jews, indeed, suffered the just reward of their
   wickedness; and the penalties which awaited them could not be imputed
   to God as too severe, since, if they weighed their enormities, they
   would be found heavier than God's treatment of them. Besides, this
   verse also embraces the final destruction of the city and temple;
   although God at the same time adds the punishment by which he wished to
   recall them into the way of life. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:59

   59. For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou
   hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

   59. Quia sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, et faciam tibi quemadmodum
   fecisti, quae [151] sprevisti jusjurandum ad dissipandum [152] foedus.


   Here, also, God meets the false objection by which the Jews might
   strive with him; for whatever they were, yet God had entered into
   covenant with them. They might, therefore, fly to this refuge, that God
   had bound himself in covenant with them, since he had adopted Abraham
   with his seed. Although they had provoked God's anger a thousand times,
   yet this exception remained, that God ought to stand to his agreement,
   and not to look at what they had deserved by their ingratitude, but
   rather to be consistent with his promises. Now, therefore, he returns
   to this cavil, and says that he is free to break the covenant since
   they have done so first. I will do, says he, to thee as thou has done.
   We see, therefore, that the calumny is here repelled by which the Jews
   could obliquely defame God, as they were accustomed to do, as if he had
   rendered his covenant void. He says, then, that in agreement it is
   customary for a person, when deceived, no longer to be necessarily
   bound to a perfidious breaker of agreements; for covenanting requires
   mutual faith: but the Jews had violated their agreement, and reduced it
   to nothing. Hence, through their perfidy and wickedness, God had
   acquired the liberty of rejecting them, and of no longer reckoning them
   among his people. Hence, as in the last verse, he said that the Jews
   paid a just penalty; so now, he adds specially, that he could not be
   condemned for bad faith in departing from his agreement, because he had
   to deal with traitors and covenant-breakers who had rendered void their
   agreement: for there is no covenant when either party declines it. I
   will do, therefore, to thee as you has done, namely, because you have
   despised an oath, so as to render the covenant void Here God enlarges
   upon the crime of revolt, because the Jews had not only dissipated the
   covenant, but had despised an oath. 'lh, aleh, signifies both an oath
   and a curse; (Deuteronomy 27;) hence some think that the Prophet here
   looks to the curses by which the law was sanctioned, which I willingly
   adopt. But we must remark what I have already said, that their
   criminality is increased, because the Jews had not only acted falsely,
   but had also set at naught that solemn oath by which they had bound
   themselves. For as God promised that he would be their God, so Moses
   stipulated in his name that the people should remain obedient to him,
   and they all answered, Amen; (Leviticus 26.) A punishment was
   announced, and such as ought to have terrified them. For the Jews then
   to neglect this covenant as a mere trifle, was the act of brutal
   stupidity. Whence we see that their crime was doubled, when the Prophet
   accuses them of not only being truce-breakers, but also of wantonly
   deriding God, and of treating their own solemn oath, by which they had
   bound themselves, as a childish action. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:60

   60. Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of
   thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.

   60. Et memor ero [153] foederis mei tecum diebus adolescentiae tuae: et
   stabiliam tibi foedus perpetuum.


   Because God here promises that he would be propitious to the Jews, some
   translate the former verse as if it had been said, "Shall I do with
   thee as you have done?" or, I would do as you have done, unless I had
   been mindful; but that is too forced in my opinion. I have no doubt
   that the Prophet restrains himself, so to speak, and directs his
   discourse peculiarly to the elect, of whom we spoke yesterday. Hitherto
   he had regarded the whole body of the people which was abandoned, and
   hence he put before them nothing but despair. But he now turns himself
   to the election of grace, of which Paul speaks, (Romans 11:5;) and for
   this reason promises them that God would be mindful of his covenant,
   though he would not restore the whole people promiscuously. For the
   body on the whole must perish; a small band only was reserved. We know,
   therefore, that this promise was not common to all the sons of Abraham
   who were his offspring according to the flesh, but it was peculiar to
   the elect alone. God therefore pronounces, that he would be mindful of
   his covenant which he had made with that people in their youth, by
   which words he signifies, that his pity should not go forth except from
   the covenant. For God always recalls the faithful, as it were, to the
   fountain, lest they should claim anything as their right, or imagine
   this or that to be the cause of God's being reconciled to them. He
   shows, therefore, that this pity has no other foundation than the
   covenant; and this is the reason why he says, that he would be mindful
   of his covenant. He now adds, and I will establish a perpetual covenant
   with thee. Here God promises, without obscurity, a better and more
   excellent covenant than that ancient one already abolished through the
   people's fault. This passage, then, cannot be understood except of the
   new covenant which God has established by the hand of Christ. But these
   two clauses are so mutually united that they ought to be carefully
   weighed, namely, that God here gives the hope of a new covenant, and
   yet teaches us that it originates in the old one already abolished
   through the people's fault. Thus we see that the New Testament flows
   from that covenant which God made with Abraham, and afterwards
   sanctioned by the hand of Moses. That which is promulgated for us in
   the Gospel is called the; New Covenant, not because it had no beginning
   previously, but because it was renewed, and better conditions added;
   for we know that the Law was abrogated by the New Covenant. Whether it
   be so or not, the excellence of the New Testament is not injured,
   because it has its source and occasion in the Old Covenant, and is
   founded on it. It follows --

   Ezekiel 16:61

   61. Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt
   receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them
   unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.

   61. Et recordaberis viarum tuarum, et pudefies cum tu assumes sorores
   tuas majores prae te, et cum minoribus prae te: et dabo ipsas tibi in
   filias: et non a foedere tuo.


   As God, then, shows that he would not be merciful to the Jews for any
   other reason than through being mindful of his covenant, so now, in
   return, he informs us what he requires from them, namely, that they
   should begin to acknowledge how basely they had abjured their pledged
   fidelity -- how unworthily they had despised his law -- how impiously
   obstinate they had been against all his prophets in deriding their
   threats, and in being stupid under manifest penalties. But this passage
   is worthy of notice, since we gather that none are capable of obtaining
   God's mercy except those who are dissatisfied with themselves, and,
   being ashamed and confounded, betake themselves to his mercy. In fine,
   we see that God's grace does not profit the obstinate at all: it is
   offered to all in common; but none receive it except those who condemn
   themselves, and bear in mind their crimes, so that they are forgotten
   before God. If, therefore, we wish our sins to be buried before God, we
   must remember them ourselves; if we wish our iniquities to be blotted
   out before God and the angels, we must disgrace ourselves; that is, we
   must blush and be ashamed of our baseness whenever we transgress and
   provoke God's wrath. Hence we here see that the whole contents of the
   Gospel are shortly summed up; for the Gospel contains nothing else but
   repentance and faith, as is well known. Concerning faith, Ezekiel has
   proclaimed that God, mindful of his covenant, will become reconciled to
   the lost; but he now adds an exhortation that they should acknowledge
   their faults: but we know that the shame of which the Prophet speaks is
   the fruit or part of repentance, as is evident from Paul's description
   of penitence in the seventh chapter of his second epistle to the
   Corinthians, (2 Corinthians 7:9-11.) But we shall have yet to speak on
   this subject, so that I now hasten forwards, because what I have
   hitherto taught cannot be understood until we come to the end of the
   verse. He says, when you shall receive thy sisters, as well the elder
   as the younger; for he does not speak here of Sodom and Samaria alone,,
   but of all nations; for all the nations may properly be called sisters,
   for all the world was corrupt. Since, therefore, they were all alike in
   vices, their union was like that of relationship. For this reason he
   says, that when the Jews shall return to favor, they shall then have a
   great multitude with them, who shall receive their own sisters; that
   is, shall collect from all sides an immense multitude, so that all
   shall be assembled in obedience to God, and shall be partakers of the
   same covenant. If any one object that this has never been fulfilled,
   the answer is at hand, that the prophets speak of the calling of the
   Gentiles in two ways. They sometimes proclaim it so as to declare that
   the Jews and Israelites are the leaders of all the others, so as to
   confer upon them the favor and patronage of God. In that day seven men
   shall lay hold of the skirt of a single Jew, and shall say, Lead us to
   your God, (Zechariah 8:23;) and this was the legitimate order, that the
   Jews, as first-born, should join others in alliance to themselves, and
   thus unite all into one body and one Church: but because the Jews were
   cut off through their ingratitude, the prophets make mention of another
   calling, that the Gentiles should succeed in the place of the
   ungrateful people, as Paul says that the natural branches were cut off,
   and that we were grafted in who belonged to the unfruitful tree.
   (Romans 11:16-19.) The Prophet adds this former reason, that the Jews
   should receive their sisters, both elder and younger, since they should
   collect God's Church from all nations; and this has been partly
   fulfilled. For whence came the Gospel except from this fountain? as it
   had been foretold, A law shall go out from Zion, and God's word from
   Jerusalem. (Isaiah 2:3; Micah 4:2.) Again, in the 110th Psalm, (Psalm
   110:1,) Thy scepter shall go forth from Zion; that is, the kingdom of
   Christ shall be propagated throughout the whole world: because,
   therefore, salvation flowed from the Jews, and the Gospel emanated from
   thence, what is here promised was partly fulfilled, namely, that other
   people were received by the Jews.

   He now subjoins, I will give them to thee for daughters: for if the
   Jews had not, by their ingratitude, rejected the honor of which God had
   reckoned them worthy, they had always been the first-born in the
   Church. Then the Gentiles would have been, as it were, under a mother,
   since they were "[8]the primitive Church" (according to the language of
   the day,) and thus they would have obtained the degree of mother among
   all nations. Therefore God here deservedly pronounces that he would
   give them, all nations for daughters, to be added to the Jews, when the
   Gentiles were grafted into the same body of the Church by faith in the
   Gospel. But he adds, not from thy covenant. Some refer this to
   ceremonies, since, when the Gentiles were adopted, they still remained
   free from the ceremonies of the law; but that is cold. Others compare
   this passage with Jeremiah: I will establish a new covenant with you,
   not such as I established with your fathers, which they rendered vain;
   but this is the covenant which I will make with you, etc. (Jeremiah
   31:31-33.) Since, then, it is here said, the covenant shall not be
   according to the covenant of the people, this is said with truth,
   because it will be a New Testament. But such expounders are partly
   right, but not wholly so; for a contrast must be understood between the
   people's covenant and God's. He had said just before, I will be mindful
   of my covenant: he now says, not of thine. Hence he reconciles what
   seemed opposites, namely, that he would be mindful of his own
   agreement, and yet it had been dissipated, broken, and abolished. He
   shows that it was fixed on his own side, as they say, but vain on the
   people's side. I will be reconciled, then, but not through thy
   covenant; for there was now no covenant, as Hosea says -- Not my
   people, not beloved. (Hosea 1:9.) All the progeny of Abraham were not
   God's people, nor all their daughters beloved: but although the
   covenant was vain through the people's perfidy, yet God overcame their
   malice, and so he again erected his own covenant towards them. And when
   he says, I will establish a covenant, we may explain it, I will set it
   up again, or restore it afresh: for we said that the New Testament was
   so distinguished from the Old, that it was founded upon it. For what is
   proposed to us in Christ, unless what God had promised in the law? and
   therefore Christ is called the end of the law, and elsewhere its
   spirit: for if the law be separated from Christ, it is like a dead
   letter: Christ alone gives it life. Since, therefore, God at this day
   exhibits to us nothing in his only-begotten Son but what he had
   formerly promised in the law, it follows that his covenant is set up
   again, and so perpetually established; and yet this is not man's part.
   Wherefore? For men had so revolted from the faith, that God was free;
   nay, the covenant itself had no force, and lost its effect through
   their perfidy: for it is easy to collect the points in which the New
   and Old Testaments are alike, and those, in which they differ. They
   have this similarity, that God to this day confirms to us what he had
   formerly promised to Abraham, and in no other sense could Abraham be
   called the Father of the Faithful.

   Since, therefore, Abraham is at this time the father of all the
   faithful, it, follows that our safety is not to be thought otherwise
   than in that covenant which God established with Abraham; but
   afterwards the same covenant was ratified by the hand of Moses. A
   difference must now be briefly remarked from a passage in Jeremiah,
   (Jeremiah 31:32,) namely, because the ancient covenant was abolished
   through the fault of man, there was reed of a better remedy, which is
   there shown to be twofold, namely, that God should bury men's sins, and
   inscribe his law on their hearts: that also was done in Abraham's time.
   Abraham believed in God: faith was always the gift of the Holy Spirit;
   therefore God inscribed his covenant in Abraham's heart. (Genesis 15:6;
   Romans 4:3; Ephesians 2:8.) He inscribed his law on the heart of Moses
   and on the rest of the faithful. This is true: but at first that inner
   grace was more obscure under the law, and then it was an additional
   benefit. It could not therefore be ascribed to the law that God
   regenerated his own elect, because the spirit of regeneration was from
   Christ, and therefore from the Gospel and the new covenant. But yet we
   must remember what I have said, that the faithful under the ancient
   covenant were gifted and endowed with a spirit of regeneration. As far
   as relates to the remission of sins, it was still more obscure: for
   cattle were sacrificed, which could not acquire salvation for miserable
   men, nor blot out their sins. Therefore, if the law is regarded in
   itself, the promise in the new covenant will not be found in it: I will
   not remember thy sins: yet to this day God is propitious to us, because
   he promised to Abraham that all nations should be blest in his seed.
   (Jeremiah 31:34; Genesis 12:3, and Genesis 18:18.) We see then that the
   difference which Jeremiah points out was really true; and yet the new
   covenant so flowed from the old, that it was almost the same in
   substance, while distinguished in form.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since your only-begotten Son has appeared for us,
   who filled up all the measure of thy grace, that we may not be
   ungrateful in despising so inestimable a boon; but may we embrace with
   true and sincere faith what you offer us, namely, the mercy which we
   always need, and also the spirit of regeneration; that we may so devote
   ourselves to thee through a whole life of obedience, that at length we
   may arrive at that glory which at this day: shines upon us as in a
   mirror, until its fruition shall appear in heaven, by the same Christ
   our Lord. -- Amen.

   Ezekiel 16:62

   62. And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know
   that I am the LORD.

   62. Et stabiliam ego foedus meum tecum, et cognosces quod ego Iehovah.


   The Prophet here confirms his former teaching, namely, that although
   the Jews rendered God's covenant vain as far as they possibly could,
   yet it should be firm and fixed. But we must hold what I have
   mentioned, that this discourse is specially limited to the elect,
   because the safety of the whole people was already desperate. Hence God
   shows that the covenant which he had made with Abraham could not be
   abolished by the, perfidy of man. And this is what Paul says in the
   third chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, (Romans 3:4,) Even if the
   whole world were liars, yet God must always remain true. But we see
   that the covenant of which we are now teaching was new, and yet had its
   origin from the old, because we are so reconciled to God by Christ that
   we ought to be grafted into the body of the ancient Church, and be made
   sons of Abraham, since, as we saw before, he is not called the father
   of the faithful in vain. God says, therefore, that his own covenant
   should be firm with the people, not with that people which had been
   already deserted through its perfidy, but with the true and genuine
   children of Abraham, who followed their father in faith and piety, as
   it is said in the 102d Psalm, (Psalm 102:18,) A people shall be created
   to the praise of God. For the Prophet now shows that God's covenant
   could not be otherwise constituted afresh unless a new Church were
   formed, and God was to create a new world: for this is the meaning of
   the words, A people when created shall praise God. The Spirit,
   therefore, obliquely reproves the Israelites, as if he had said that
   the praises of God were abolished among them: but when the new people
   shall come forth, then God should be glorified. He adds, and you shall
   know that I am Jehovah. This phrase is often repeated, but in a
   different sense. For when a prophet threatened the people, he always
   added this particle, and thus a contrast must be understood between the
   people's stupidity and good sense; for all their prophecies were
   neglected by the people. God's servants indeed uttered their voice, and
   severely blamed the impious and wicked, but without any effect. Since,
   therefore, they so wantonly played with reproaches and threats, it was
   often said to them, You shall begin to feel me to be God when I shall
   cease to speak to you, and shall instruct you by scourges. But now the
   Prophet, as we see, preaches concerning the gratuitous reconciliation
   of the people with God. Hence they really felt him to be God, because
   he stood firm to his promises, although, through the fault of man, his
   covenant had fallen to pieces and become invalid. The Prophet here
   announces that they should feel God to be unlike themselves, that is,
   not to change his counsels, or to vary with the levity and inconstancy
   of men: as also it is said in Isaiah, My thoughts are not as your
   thoughts: as far as the heavens are distant from the earth, so are my
   thoughts distant from yours, and my ways from your ways. (Isaiah
   55:8,9.) God here means that the Jews acted wrong in estimating his
   pity by their own common sense: for he says that he differed very much
   from them, since his pity was unfathomable, and his truth
   incomprehensible.

   Now, therefore, we understand what the Prophet means in this verse. In
   the first clause he pronounces, that the covenant which God would make
   with his new and elect people should be firm: then he adds, that the
   Jews should know that they were dealing with God, because they could
   not take away what God was then promising. Now we can understand the
   reason why God's covenant in Christ was perpetual: because, as we read
   in Jeremiah, he inscribed his law on the hearts of the righteous, and
   remitted their iniquities. (Jeremiah 31:33.) This, then, was the cause
   of its perpetuity. Besides, although the Prophet magnifies God's grace
   in the second clause, yet at the same time he recalls the Jews from
   every perverse imagination which might entirely shake their confidence.
   For when they thought themselves plunged in an abyss, they were ready
   to collect that there was no further remedy. But if God wished to
   preserve them, why did he not send them help in time? But when he
   suffered them to be led into exile, and to be plunged into the lowest
   depths, there was no hope of restoration. For this cause Ezekiel
   announces that the faithful ought not to persist in their own thoughts,
   but rather to raise their minds to heaven, and to expect what seemed
   altogether out of place, since they thought to judge according to the
   nature of God, and to measure the effects of his promises by the
   immensity of his power rather than by their own perceptions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 16:63

   63. That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy
   mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for
   all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.

   63. Ut recorderis, et pudefias, et non sit tibi amplius apertio oris
   propter probrum tuum cum propitius fuero tibi in omnibus quae fecisti,
   dicit Dominator Iehovah.


   Ezekiel again exhorts the faithful to repentance and constant
   meditation. We have said that these members cannot be divided, namely,
   the testimony of grace with the doctrine of repentance: we have said,
   also, that this is the substance of the gospel, that God wishes those
   to repent whom he reconciles by gratuitous pardon. For he is appeased
   by us only when he makes us new creatures in Christ, and regenerates us
   by his Spirit; as it is said in Isaiah, God will be propitious to the
   people who shall have returned from their iniquity. (Isaiah 59:20.)
   That promise is restricted to those who do not indulge and revel in
   sin, but humble themselves before God, and decide their own salvation
   to be impossible without their being severe judges to their own
   condemnation. Therefore Ezekiel follows up this point when he says that
   you may remember and be ashamed. I have said that penitence is not only
   to be commended here, but the continual desire for it. And this must be
   remarked, because it is troublesome to us to be often shaking off our
   sins; and hence we escape as far as we can from the perception of them:
   for we desire our own enjoyment, and every one willingly puts his sins
   out of sight. Surely if we do look upon them, they first compel us to
   be ashamed, and then we are wounded with serious grief; conscience
   summons us to God's tribunal: we then acknowledge the formidable
   vengeance which slays even the boldest, unless they are upheld by the
   assurance of pardon. Since, then, the acknowledgment of sins brings us
   both shame and sorrow, we endeavor to put it far away from us by all
   means. But no other way of access to embracing God's favor is open to
   us, except that of repentance of sins. This, then, is the reason why
   God insists so much on this point: we do not follow him directly; hence
   it is not sufficient to show us what ought to be done, unless God
   pricks us sharply, and violently draws us to himself. This passage,
   then, must be remarked where the Prophet commands the faithful, after
   they have obtained pardon, to remember their sins, for hypocrites are
   here distinguished from the true sons of God. Hypocrites boast with
   swelling words, that they rely on the mercy of God, and speak mightily
   of the grace of Christ, but meanwhile they wish the memory of their
   sins to remain buried. On the other hand, we cannot be otherwise truly
   humble before God, unless we judge ourselves, as I have said. If we
   desire, therefore, our sins to be blotted out before God, and to be
   buried in the depths of the sea, as another Prophet says, (Micah 7:19,)
   we must recall them often and constantly to our remembrance: for when
   they are kept before our eyes we then flee seriously to God for mercy,
   and are properly prepared by humility and fear.

   The Prophet adds also, that you may be ashamed: for it is not
   sufficient simply to remember, unless we add the shame of which the
   Prophet speaks. For we see that many remember their faults and confess
   their sins, but they do it lightly, and as a matter of duty; nay, they
   acknowledge them so as to remain in their integrity, and, as they say,
   to preserve their credit. But the recognition here required is
   accompanied by shame, as Paul, when addressing the faithful, puts
   before them their past life thus:

   "What fruit could you gather from that course of life."
   (Romans 6:19-21.)

   You blush now in truth when so many crimes are heaped upon you: you
   were then blind, and wandered in darkness: but when God shone upon you
   by the gospel, you acknowledge your baseness and foulness, from which
   shame is produced. He now adds, neither may thou open thy mouth any
   more. It is not surprising if the Prophet uses many words in explaining
   one thing which is not obscure in itself. But I have already shown why
   he does so, because we are with the greatest difficulty led on to that
   shame which the Prophet mentions. We condemn ourselves indeed verbally
   at once; but scarcely one in a hundred can be found so to cast himself
   down as to sustain willingly the reproach which he deserves. Since then
   voluntary submission is not found in man, it is necessary that we
   should be impelled more hardly and sharply, as the Prophet does here.
   When he says, there shall be no opening of the mouth, he means, that no
   partial confession of sins shall be exacted by which men bear witness,
   and acknowledge themselves liable to God's judgment; but a full and
   entire confession, so that they may be held convicted on all sides. And
   this must be diligently noticed. For we see that the world is always
   endeavoring to escape God's sentence by turning away from it; and since
   it cannot do this completely, it invents subterfuges, so as to retain
   some portion of its innocence.

   Hence the fiction among the papists of partial justification: hence
   also their satisfactions; for they are compelled, whether they wish it
   or not, to confess themselves worthy of death: but afterwards they use
   the exception, that they have merited something before from God through
   their good works, and are not altogether worthy of condemnation: then
   they descend to compensations, and wish to treat with God, as if they
   could appease him by what they call works of supererogation. Whatever
   be the sense, men can scarcely be found who sincerely and honestly
   acknowledge that there exists in themselves nothing but material for
   condemnation. We confess, as I have said, that we are guilty before
   God, but only for one or two faults. What then does the Holy Spirit
   here prescribe? that there should be no opening of the mouth; as also
   Paul says, adopting his form of speech from this and similar passages.
   It is often said in the Prophets, Let all flesh be silent before God,
   (Zechariah 2:13;) but here the Prophet speaks specially of the shame by
   which God's children lie so confused, that they are altogether silent.
   Paul also says, that every mouth may be shut, and all flesh humbled
   before God. (Romans 3:19.) He afterwards shows that Jews as well as
   Gentiles were involved in the same condemnation, and that there was no
   hope of safety left except through God's mercy: he then adds, that
   God's justice truly shines forth when our mouth is stopped, that is,
   when we do not turn aside and offer any excuses, as hypocrites divide
   the merit between God and themselves. I indeed confess that I have
   sinned; but why may not my good works come into the account? why should
   I be condemned for one fault only? as if those who violate law do not
   depart from righteousness. We see, then, that we are properly humbled
   when we are silent and do not reproach God, when we do not quibble or
   allege first one thing and then another to extenuate or excuse our
   fault. God indeed wishes our mouth to be open; as Peter says, that we
   are called out of darkness into marvelous light, to show forth his
   praises who delivered us. (1 Peter 2:9.) For this purpose, then, God
   was merciful to us, that we might be heralds of his grace. And in this
   sense, also, David says, Lord, open you my lips, and my mouth shall
   declare thy praise; that is, by giving me material for a song, as he
   elsewhere says, He has put a new song into my mouth. (Psalm 51:15;
   Psalm 40:3.) God, therefore, opens the mouths or lips of the faithful
   whenever he is liberal or beneficent towards them. But he is here
   treating of the exceptions of those who would willingly transact
   business with God, as if they were not wholly worthy of condemnation.
   In fine, Ezekiel signifies that this is the true fruit of penitence
   when we do not defend ourselves, but silently confess ourselves
   convicted. A passage of Paul's may possibly be objected as apparently
   contrary to this of our Prophet, in which he reckons defense among the
   effects or fruits of penitence, (2 Corinthians 7:11;) but defense is
   not here used in our customary sense: for any one who asserts that he
   has acted rightly, and so without fault is said to defend himself. But
   a defense in Paul's sense is nothing else but a prayer against
   punishment when a sinner comes forward, and after confessing his fault,
   begs of God to pardon it, and, as it were, covers himself with mercy,
   so that his condemnation is nowhere apparent. We see, then, that the
   language of Paul is not in opposition to that of the Prophet.

   He now adds, from thy disgrace, verbally from the face of thy disgrace,
   when I shall be propitious to thee. We again see that these things
   agree well together, that God buries our sins and we recall them to
   memory. For we turn aside his judgment when we willingly accuse and
   condemn ourselves. For when conscience is asleep, it nourishes a hidden
   fire, which at length emerges into a flame and lights up God's wrath.
   If, therefore, we desire the fire of God's wrath to be extinguished,
   there is no other remedy than to shake off our sins and to set before
   our eyes the disgrace which we deserve, and God's mercy induces us to
   this. For we must remark the connection, when I shall be propitious to
   thee, you shall be silent in thy disgrace. And surely the more any one
   has tasted of the grace of God, the more ready he is to condemn
   himself, and as unbelief is proud, so the more any one proceeds in the
   faith of God's grace, he is thus humbled more and more before him. And
   that is best expressed in the words of the Prophet, since he teaches
   that silence is the effect of grace or of gratuitous reconciliation.
   When therefore he says, I shall have been propitious to thee, then you
   shall blush that thou may be mute, namely, on account of thy disgrace.
   And we see that the people were so taught by legal ceremonies to
   apprehend the mercy of God, and to be touched at the same time with the
   serious affection of penitence; for without a victim, God was never
   appeased under the law. And now although animals are not sacrificed,
   yet when we consider that no other price was sufficient to satisfy God,
   except his only-begotten Son poured forth his blood in expiation, there
   matter is set before us for embracing the grace of God, and at the same
   time we are touched, as the saying is, with the true affection of
   penitence. Besides, God amplifies the magnitude of his grace when he
   says lkl 'sr syt, lekel asher gnesith, on account of all things which,
   you have done. For the people thought not only to feel God merciful,
   but to examine their faults, and then to feel how manifold and
   remarkable was God's mercy towards them. For if the people had only
   been guilty of one kind of sin, they would have valued God's grace the
   less: but when they had been convicted of so many crimes, as we have
   seen, hence the magnitude of his grace became more apparent. [154] Let
   us now go on.

   [154] In commenting on this chapter, Calvin takes occasion to explain
   the gospel doctrines of justification, faith, and repentance, and
   refers to the adverse fictions of the papacy. This interesting subject
   is fully treated by Bishop Davenant in his Disputatio de justitia
   habituali et actuali, delivered when professor of divinity at the
   University of Cambridge (1631). The English translation by the
   Revelation Josiah Allport, 1844, is a most valuable work, and treats
   largely on this and all collateral subjects. His "Determinationes,"
   edit. 1634 and 1639, may also be consulted: with Penrose on the
   Atonement, 1843; and St. Bernard's Sermon on Isaiah 6:1, 2.
   Oecolampadius, on Ezekiel 16:55, is copious, spiritual, and practical;
   and Maldonatus gives the sense of the Hebrew remarkably well and with
   great consistency, though he adds no practical comments. Theodoret and
   Jerome are both very explanatory, especially on Ezekiel 16:45. See
   [9]Dissertations at the end of this volume.

   CHAPTER 17
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 17:1-2

   1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

   1. Et fuit sermo Iehovae ad me, dicendo,

   2. Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house
   of Israel;

   2. Fili hominis, aenigmatisa aenigma, et proverbia proverbium [155] ad
   domum Israel.


   In this chapter the Prophet shows that the Jews were utterly foolish in
   thinking themselves safe, since they had God as their adversary. At the
   end of the chapter he promises indeed the restoration of the Church,
   and heralds the kingdom of Christ: but the principal part of the
   chapter is consumed with this teaching, that the Jews were utterly
   foolish in promising themselves safety for the city, the temple, and
   their kingdom: for, as it now appeared, they had violated the covenant
   of God and he had rejected them. When deprived of God's help, what
   could they do? This was egregious folly to hope for a prosperous state
   of their kingdom when their power was diminished and cut off, and they
   were reduced almost to the very last straits. But since the Prophet's
   discourse came be understood without a knowledge of the history, I
   shall therefore make a beginning: When Nebuchadnezzar appointed
   Zedekiah king, he also made him tributary to himself. He was made king
   at the will or rather by the lust of the king of Babylon, when Jeconiah
   was led captive. (2 Kings 24:15-17; 2 Chronicles 36:10; Jeremiah 37:1.)
   Jeconiah had not sinned greatly, but when he saw himself unable to
   resist, he surrendered himself with his mother and children; he was
   carried away to Babylon, and there was treated humanely and even
   splendidly, although not royally. Nebuchadnezzar, foreseeing much
   trouble if he set any of his satraps over Judea, and fearing daily
   tumults, appointed Mattaniah king, to whom he gave the name Zedekiah;
   this was the last king: already, as I have said, the royal dignity was
   greatly diminished: it was tributary to Nebuchadnezzar, and Zedekiah's
   sway was but precarious. His position depended on the will of his
   conqueror, and he who placed him on the throne could remove him as
   often as he pleased. A little while afterwards, when he saw that
   Nebuchadnezzar was at a distance, he made an agreement with the king of
   Egypt, and thought he should have sufficient help if Nebuchadnezzar
   were to return again with an army. And the Egyptians, as we have
   elsewhere said, were sufficiently desirous of this treaty. For they saw
   the Babylonian monarchy gradually increasing, and it was probable that,
   when the Jews were utterly subdued, Nebuchadnezzar would not be content
   with those boundaries, but would attack Egypt in like manner, and
   absorb that kingdom, as he had done others. Hence a reason for their
   entering into the treaty was at hand, since the king of Egypt thought
   that Judea would be a defense if Nebuchadnezzar should come down with
   his army: and certainly the Jews must receive the assault first.
   Whatever be the meaning, Zedekiah, through despising his oath, as we
   shall see, revolted to the Egyptians, and when Nebuchadnezzar
   afterwards demanded tribute, Zedekiah refused, through reliance on that
   covenant which he had made with the Egyptians. We now see how foolish
   the Jews were in sleeping carelessly in that miserable state to which
   they had been reduced. For when their power was unbroken they could not
   sustain the attack of the king of Babylon: their king was then a mere
   dead image, and nothing but a shadow: yet they indulged in pride not
   only against Nebuchadnezzar but also against the Prophets and God
   himself, just as if they were flourishing in wealth and power and
   complete prosperity. Hence Ezekiel now refutes and rebukes this
   arrogance. He shows how easy it was for the Babylonians to overthrow
   them again, since when they attacked them before they were subdued,
   they easily compelled them to surrender.

   But I come to the words Son of man, set forth in enigma: the noun and
   the verb mutually answer to each other, hence any one may if he please
   render the Prophet's words, by saying enigmatize an enigma: for the
   Prophet here speaks of allegorical language, chydh, chideh, signifies
   the same as "allegory," where the words are different from the sense,
   that is, where the sense is wrapped up in obscure involutions: but we
   know that God sometimes spoke enigmatically when unwilling to be
   understood by the impious and disbelieving. But here the obscurity of
   the sentence has another meaning, namely, that the Jews should be waked
   up, and this prophecy should penetrate their minds: we know their
   extreme hardness, and hence if the Prophet had spoken simply and in his
   accustomed language, they had not been so attentive. This therefore is
   the reason why, God orders him to speak enigmatically. He now adds, msl
   vmsl, vemeshel meshel. We know that meshel is a remarkable sentence,
   and is the word used by Solomon as the title of his proverbs: msl,
   meshel, then, means the same as apothegm: but it is sometimes taken for
   likeness: and in this place God so denounces destruction upon the
   Israelites in an allegory, as to illustrate his language by a
   comparison, since otherwise it would have been obscure. Be this as it
   may, God so prefaced his address, that the Jews might acknowledge the
   message to be no common one, but that it ought to affect them
   seriously. The usual reason for speaking enigmatically does not hold
   good here, namely, that the Jews were unworthy of the doctrine of
   salvation, since the Prophet will very shortly explain what he had
   hitherto uttered in figure and allegory. It is indeed true, that Christ
   spoke in parables to the people, because the disciples alone were
   capable of familiar and pure teaching. Of unbelievers, also, Isaiah
   says, Prophecy shall be to you a sealed book. Hence I will speak with
   this people in a strange and barbarous tongue, and they shall not
   proceed beyond the rudiments. (Matthew 13; Mark 4; Luke 8; Isaiah
   29:11, 12.) But, as I have said, the obscurity of this teaching was
   only a preparation, that the people should strictly attend to the
   subject here set before them.

   Ezekiel 17:3-4

   3. And say, Thus says the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings,
   longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto
   Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:

   3. Et dic, Sit dicit Dominator Iehovah, aquila magna, magna alis, longa
   penna [156] plena [157] plumis quae illis variae [158] erant venit ad
   montem Libanum, et accepit summitatem cedri.

   4. He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a
   land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.

   4. Caput [159] surculorum ejus avellit, et transtulit in terram
   mercatoris, [160] in urbe mercatorum posuit eam. [161]


   Here the Prophet reasons from the greater to the less: for if
   Nebuchadnezzar was able to subdue the whole kingdom with ease, when as
   yet the Jews were untouched, how much more readily would he overthrow
   them when wretched and all but ruined: for nothing remained which was
   not threatened with ruin; and this is the meaning of the Prophet. But
   he compares King Nebuchadnezzar to an eagle, whom he says was great,
   and then with large or extended wings. There is no doubt that by wings,
   feathers, and plumes, he means the regions and peoples over which
   Nebuchadnezzar presided; for we know that the Chaldaeans possessed the
   monarchy of the East. Since, therefore, so many regions and people
   obeyed Nebuchadnezzar's sway, it is not surprising that the Prophet
   calls him [10]a great eagle, with ample wings, and with numerous
   feathers or plumes; for where he now says, ml' hnvtsh, mela henotzeh,
   full of feathers, he will shortly say, rv nvtsh, reb notzeh, many
   feathers, when speaking of the king of Egypt. He says, the wings were
   of divers colors; it is the same noun which the Prophet used in the
   last chapter, when he said that the people were clad in precious
   garments; for thus the Hebrews speak of Phrygian texture: hence he
   compares the wings of the king of Babylon to a woven garment,
   resplendent with various colors; for although Nebuchadnezzar held his
   throne at only one place, yet he had seized and subdued many
   tributaries on all sides. This, therefore, is the reason for this
   variety; -- but I cannot proceed further at present.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you have treated us so liberally by opening
   the immense and inestimable treasures of thy grace, that being mindful
   of our condition we may always bewail it, and remember what we were
   when you desire to adopt us as sons, and how often and how variously we
   have provoked thee, and rendered thy covenant vain: Grant, also, that
   we may glorify thee in our shame, and perpetually magnify thy name by
   our humility, until we become partakers of that glory which your
   only-begotten Son has procured for us through his own blood. -- Amen.

   Lecture Fifty-First

   WE began yesterday to explain the saying of the Prophet, that an eagle
   came to mount Lebanon, and there cropped off the top of a cedar, that
   is, the highest bough. Some interpreters seem to me to labor in vain
   about the word Lebanon. They think it means Jerusalem, and cite the
   passage in Zechariah where it is said, Open thy gates, O Lebanon.
   (Zechariah 11:1.) But Zecharia does not speak of the city here, but of
   the temple, because it was built of a great mass of cedar. But here
   Ezekiel means the land, and names Lebanon rather than other places, not
   only because that mountain was the remarkable ornament of the region on
   account of its lofty cedars, and balsam and aromatic trees, but because
   this was needful to complete his allegory. If he had said that an eagle
   had come to a city, it would have been absurd. Hence we see that the
   word Lebanon is taken for that part of Judea in which the most
   beautiful trees spring up and flourish. But he says, that it plucked
   off a bough, from the top of the cedars, because Nebuchadnezzar, who is
   intended by the eagle took away King Jeconiah as we said yesterday.
   Hence King Jeconiah is compared to a very lofty bough of a cedar,
   because at that time all thought that the kingdom was superior to every
   danger; for the Jews boasted that they were under God's protection, and
   that the city was impregnable: hence that occurrence was incredible.
   Now the Prophet adds, that the eagle plucked off the head or summit of
   the boughs, as the Hebrews call the tender shoots; and here the word
   means the tender branches: and it means, as we shall afterwards see,
   the elders who were dragged away into exile. It took away the head into
   the land of the merchant We said that this was a mere appellative here,
   chnaan, because it follows a little afterwards in the plural number:
   vtsyr rklym smv, begnir-reklim shemo, in the city of merchants he set
   it: he says, then, that the boughs were placed in a city of merchants.
   This name was given to Babylon, not only because it was a celebrated
   mart of trade, but because it was a firm and strong place of custody
   through the multitude of inhabitants, so that it was not easy to draw
   captives from it. For any one could easily be rescued from a solitude
   without resistance; but in a great concourse it is not so easy to plan
   or attempt anything. I do not doubt, therefore, that the Prophet means
   that the higher classes of the kingdom, together with Jeconiah, were
   shut up in firm custody that they should not escape. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 17:5-6

   5. He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful
   field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow-tree.

   5. Et sustulit [162] e semine terrae, et posuit illud in agro seminis,
   [163] sumpsit super aquas multas, tanquam salicem posuit illud.

   6. And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose
   branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it
   became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.

   6. Et germinavit, et fuit in vitem luxuriantem, humilem statura, ut
   respicerent palmites ejus ad ipsam, [164] et radices ejus sub ea
   essent: et fuit in vitem, et produxit palmites [165] et emisit
   propagines.


   After Ezekiel has narrated that Jehoiacin was carried away with his
   counselors and the flower of the whole people, and was so deprived of
   his native country as to be without hope of return, he now says, that
   the eagle took up the seed in Judea, and placed it in a fertile land;
   for he calls it a land of seed, since it was cultivated and produced
   fruit abundantly. He says, that the seed was afterwards hidden in the
   soil, that it grew immediately, and became a luxuriant vine. He says
   also, that its roots were irrigated, like a willow planted by a river's
   bed. The Prophet afterwards explains himself: hence it is sufficient to
   state briefly what he means. The seed, then, which he here means is
   Zedekiah, the last king. It is said to have been planted beside the
   waters; for his condition was tolerable, since the royal name and
   dignity and wealth was left to him. For although he was tributary, the
   kindness with which he was treated by Nebuchadnezzar was not to be
   despised, since, by the right of war, he was able to lead him captive.
   together with his nephew; for Zedekiah was the uncle of Jeconiah or
   Jehoiacin. But he said, that this vine, which sprang from a seed or
   germ, grew so that it was of low stature; the Prophet means by these
   words, as we shall afterwards see, that Zedekiah was not a king, that
   he was restrained by a bridle from daring to rebel against the king of
   Babylon; and hence it is added, that its branches turned towards the
   eagle, and its roots were under him; but in the next clause Ezekiel
   announces, that it became a vine which set forth branches, and shot
   forth boughs, which he repeats again, that Zedekiah's ingratitude may
   appear the greater, who, not content with his moderate confinement,
   perfidiously revolted from the king of Babylon, through reliance on the
   new treaty, on which we touched yesterday. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [162] "He took." -- Calvin.

   [163] That is, "a fertile or rich field." -- Calvin.

   [164] "The eagle." -- Calvin.

   [165] Or, "twigs." -- Calvin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 17:7

   7. There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
   feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and
   shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the
   furrows of her plantation.

   7. Et fuit aquila una [166] magna, magnis alis, et copiosa plumis: et
   ecce vitis ista collegit radices suas ad eam, [167] et palmites suos
   emisit ad eam, ut irrigaret ipsam alveis [168] plantationis suae. [169]


   He now detects, under a figure, the perfidy of Zedekiah, since he very
   soon applied himself to the king of Egypt, and bent his roots and
   branches towards him, that they might be irrigated. I do not disagree
   with the opinion of those who think that the Prophet alludes to an
   Egyptian custom; for we know that they dug furrows through which water
   flowed through the whole region: hence the fruitfulness of the soil;
   and thus Egypt is elsewhere compared to a garden. (Deuteronomy 11:10.)
   Whatever the meaning is, the Prophet shows that Zedekiah was deceived
   by a foolish confidence when he thought himself safe under the
   protection of the king of Egypt; for he had said that the seed was so
   planted that the vine did not rise to a great height, but spread itself
   under the wings of the eagle. But Zedekiah despised the king of
   Babylon, thinking that he should improve his condition by entering into
   a treaty with the king of Egypt. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [166] That is, "another eagle." -- Calvin.

   [167] That is, "applied." -- Calvin.

   [168] Or, "beds, or rows or furrows," rgvt, gnergoth, signifies
   properly "furrows." -- Calvin.

   [169] Or, "in its plantation," to make the sense clearer. -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 17:8

   8. It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring
   forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly
   vine.

   8. Super agrum bonum [170] juxta aquas multas [171] ipsa plantara erat,
   ut produceret folia, et proferret fructum ut esset in vitem magnificam.
   [172]


   He exaggerates the ingratitude of Zedekiah, because, as we have said,
   he had been treated humanely by the king of Babylon; for he had been
   but a private man till that time: he was elevated to a throne and to a
   sway over the people beyond his expectation, and he had an avenger if
   any one despised him. For when he was tributary to the king of Babylon,
   he would doubtless have been assisted by him in adversity: hence his
   revolt was less excusable, since he had been treated liberally beyond
   all anticipation. For this reason it is said, the vine was planted in a
   good soil, and near many waters, that it might put forth branches and
   bear fruit, so that it might be a goodly vine. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [170] That is, "in a good soil." -- Calvin.

   [171] Or, "copious." -- Calvin.

   [172] Or it is usually rendered, "others have a beautiful vine:" 'dr,
   ader, signifies properly to strengthen: hence it may be translated a
   strong vine; but here it means beautiful, elegant, or superb. --
   Calvin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 17:9-10

   9. Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not
   pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it
   wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without
   great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.

   9. Dic, Sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, An feliciter aget? [173] an non
   radices ejus evellet? et fructum ejus succidet? et siccabit omnes
   surculos germinis ipsius, ut arefiat [174] et non brachio magno et
   populo multo ad tollendum [175] e radicibus suis.

   10. Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly
   wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows
   where it grew.

   10. Et ecce plantata: an prosperabitur? [176] an non cum attigerit
   [177] ipsam ventus orientalis arescendo arescet super areas [178]
   plantationis suae scet?


   Here God announces that this vine could not flourish any longer and
   bring forth fruit; for it had been planted to flourish under the shadow
   of an eagle, and it had removed itself away. Nothing therefore remains,
   than that the former eagle should avenge the injury committed against
   it. This is the meaning of the passage: hence he says, Shall it
   prosper? Shall not the eagle tear up its roots, and cut off its fruit?
   Ezekiel assumes this principle, that the vine could not be otherwise
   preserved than by the power and aid of the eagle which had planted it;
   for when it passed away from that eagle to another, the Prophet says
   that the end of the ungrateful vine was at hand; all the leaves of its
   branches shall wither, and so be dried up, and that not in, a mighty
   branch, nor in much people. It is certain that Nebuchadnezzar was
   accompanied with a great army when he came down upon Judea. But the
   Prophet means, even if Nebuchadnezzar had only brought with him a small
   band, yet Zedekiah could not remain king, since destruction awaited him
   through perfidy and revolt, as will afterwards be said. The Prophet
   often speaks by concession, as if he had said that, by a singe blast,
   Zedekiah and all the people would wither away, since he could not
   remain in safety unless he drew sap from his own root; but he had
   removed his root elsewhere, and so Ezekiel pronounces that he must
   immediately wither away. It was not then in the power of much people to
   tear it from its own roots; for Zedekiah had purposely cut off his own
   roots, when, through his own levity, he had transferred himself to the
   king of Egypt Behold, says he, he had been planted; but should he have
   good success? as if he had said, it is vain for Zedekiah to hope for
   safety from him, whom his own perfidy prevented from befriending him;
   and therefore the comparison of an east wind is added: since then the
   east wind has struck it, will it not wither and decay, even upon the
   furrows of its branches? that is, although it has furrows whence it may
   expect perpetual moisture; for Egypt was, as we have said, artificially
   watered; and the Prophet describes Zedekiah's state just as if the king
   of Egypt were nourishing him by a stream of water: upon his beds, or
   furrows, will he wither when the east wind shall strike it. We know
   that the east wind destroys the fruits in that region, and so it is
   often mentioned in a bad sense. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [173] Or, as they commonly say, "shall it prosper?" -- Calvin.

   [174] Or, "grow dry." -- Calvin

   [175] It is a noun put in the place of an infinitive, "for taking it
   away," or" for its being taken away." -- Calvin.

   [176] That is, "shall it do prosperously or happily?" or, "shall it
   have good success?" for prosperari is not a sufficiently classical
   word, unless derived from prosperare, used by Horace, and so is
   passive. -- Calvin.

   [177] Or, "shall have struck or touched," for it signifies either. --
   Calvin.

   [178] Or, "furrows." -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 17:11-16

   11. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

   11. Et fuit sermo Iehovae ad me, dicendo,

   12. Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things
   mean? tell them, Behold the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and
   hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with
   him to Babylon;

   12. Dic quaeso, [179] domui rebelli [180] an non cognoscitis quid hoc
   sit? dic, Ecce venit rex Babylonis Hierosolymam, et abstulit regem
   ejus, et proceres ejus, et adduxit eos ad se Babylonem.

   13. And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him,
   and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the
   land:

   13. Et sumpsit e semine regio, et percussit cum eo foedus, et
   descendere fecit [181] ad jusjurandum: et fortes terrae accepit,

   14. That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up,
   but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.

   14. Ut esset regnum humile, ac ne se afferret, ut servaret foedus suum;
   ut staret in ipso.

   15. But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt,
   that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper?
   shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant,
   and be delivered?

   15. Et rebellis fuit ei ad mittendum nuntios suos in Egyptum, ut
   darentur equites, et populus multus. An feliciter aget? an evadet qui
   hoc fecit? et qui irritum fecit foedus an evadet? [182]

   16. As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king
   dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant
   he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.

   16. Vivo ego, dicit Dominator Iehovah, si non in loco regis qui regnare
   fecit eum, cujus sprevit jusjurandum, et cujus irritum fecit foedus cum
   ipso in medio Babylonis moriatur.


   An explanation of the allegory is now added. The figure being dropped,
   God shows what he had hitherto set forth enigmatically. We said the
   object of the allegory was to induce the Jews to apply their minds more
   diligently to the Prophet's destruction; for if he had used common and
   ordinary language, we know how carelessly they were accustomed to
   despise all rebukes and threatenings; but a riddle, while it held them
   in suspense, at the same time roused them, and so they were prepared
   for receiving the instruction which now follows. God says, therefore,
   that the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem. This reason has induced
   some to think that Lebanon is metaphorically called Jerusalem, but
   falsely, as we have already said. As long as the Prophet spoke
   figuratively, the parts ought to be mutually fitted to each other, as a
   tree and its branches have some connection with an eagle. The king of
   Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king away, and the elders, and
   led them off to Babylon. Although the Jews thought to be sufficiently
   moved by simple narrative, yet God here reproves them, because he saw
   how sluggish they were. First, he calls them a rebellious house; then
   he asks, Whether they know the meaning of all this? This is a kind of
   reproach by which God reminds them of their stupidity; since that
   riddle was not so obscure as to prevent them from understanding what
   had happened, unless they had been destitute of reason and judgment.
   But the Prophet thrusts at them more pointedly, by calling them a
   rebellious house, although at the same time he obliquely reproves their
   stupidity in not immediately perceiving the meaning of the riddle. He
   now adds, that the king of Babylon had taken from the royal seed. We
   said that Zedekiah was the uncle of Jehoiakim: he was placed on the
   throne beyond all expectation; because, if Jehoiakim had begat sons
   when he was still secure, they would have been his successors: hence it
   was an extraordinary advantage to Zedekiah in being placed on the
   throne. But he says, that he was so created king, that the king of
   Babylon made a covenant with him, and induced him to take an oath. Here
   God shows that, humanly speaking, Zedekiah's revolt could not prosper;
   for even profane men are always persuaded that the perfidy of him who
   breaks his word will not go unpunished, especially in treaties, which
   are held sacred by common consent. Since, therefore, the sacredness of
   treaties was so great, that they could not be violated without
   weakening the bonds of society, hence the general persuasion that the
   falsehood of all truce-breakers will turn out unhappily. Now,
   therefore, God leaves his own cause, and takes up that of King
   Nebuchadnezzar: Behold, says he, you was made king by gratuitous
   liberality: a conqueror indeed imposed conditions upon thee, but still
   thy state was desirable -- you could rule your own people splendidly
   and with moderate dignity: now, because thy covenant has been despised,
   and your oath broken, you has been ungrateful to the king of Babylon,
   who had bound thee to himself by his munificence: how can this perfidy
   prosper? Now, therefore, we see the Prophet's meaning, when he says
   that the king of Babylon made a treaty with King Zedekiah, and took an
   oath of him: this is added for the sake of amplifying; for although men
   never enter into treaties without a mutual oath, yet Ezekiel seems to
   have doubled the crime of Zedekiah, when he expresses that an oath
   intervened. He says that he took the strong of the land, namely, as
   hostages. There is no doubt that Nebuchadnezzar assembled this troop
   around him that the Jews might be more quiet: for he knew the turbulent
   character of the nation, and that the maintenance of so many was
   expensive: but, as I have said, it was his plan to hold the whole
   country at peace in this way. But Zedekiah rendered his own brothers
   and relations liable to death, since Nebuchadnezzar might be induced,
   by just anger, to slay them all. Hence Zedekiah's revolt was the
   betrayal of his brothers: for this reason the Prophet adds, that the
   strong ones of the people were led away to Babylon; that is, those of
   the first rank, who were held in honor by the people.

   He now adds, that the kingdom might be humbled. Zedekiah then could not
   pretend error, nor turn his back, as if he had been outwitted by the
   cunning and secret counsels of the king of Babylon: for Nebuchadnezzar
   dealt with him openly, and proscribed the conditions on which he wished
   him to reign. Since, then, the king of Babylon showed Zedekiah openly
   and sincerely what he wished him to do, that wretched man could not say
   that he was imposed upon, and not made sufficiently aware of the
   cunning of the king of Babylon: no such excuse was left to him. And
   therefore the Prophet clearly expresses that Nebuchadnezzar imposed
   conditions upon Zedekiah, that his kingdom should be lowly, so as not
   to lift itself up, but that it should keep the agreement. This was most
   equitable: for when he appointed a king, he might have imposed upon him
   very hard conditions, but he was content with moderation, which was
   surely tolerable even among the best friends. For he made a treaty with
   him, and then he wished the kingdom to be lowly for its preservation.
   For it is just as if the Prophet had said, that Nebuchadnezzar thought
   of nothing else than that Zedekiah might reign in peace; and since he
   saw it to be useful to the king and the whole people to be restrained
   within some bounds, he followed that plan. Since, then, Nebuchadnezzar
   consulted the public advantage by this method of action, Zedekiah was
   the more wicked in not allowing his own safety to be consulted, since
   nothing was better or more desirable than for him to remain humble, and
   not to raise himself up to his own destruction, as afterwards happened.
   It now follows, that he rebelled by sending his messengers into Egypt,
   that they might give him horses and much people. These points ought to
   be mutually compared; that the contrast might correspond:
   Nebuchadnezzar regarded nothing else but the peace of the country, for
   he wished to prevent all fears and disturbances. What, then, was
   Zedekiah? a rebel. And why? for sending messengers to Egypt to fetch
   many troops of both horse and foot to succor Judea against
   Nebuchadnezzar. After the conclusion of the war he had done nothing
   hostile, for it was a part of his paternal anxiety to give them a king
   of their own nation, and so to set the whole country at rest, that
   there should be no occasion for tumult. Why, then, should Zedekiah seek
   help from the Egyptians? Thus we see that the Prophet is removing from
   him all excuses for self-defense. He now adds, shall he prosper? shall
   he who has acted thus escape? The Prophet asks with emphasis; because,
   as I have said, this persuasion was engraved on the minds of all, that
   vengeance must overtake all the perfidious, especially if they had
   violated their oath in treaties. The Prophet, therefore, does not
   simply pronounce that Zedekiah should perish through violating the
   treaty, but he rises more confidently, and inquires, as of a thing
   settled and undoubted, Shall he prosper? shall he who has planned such
   a crime escape? He now adds, shall he who has violated a treaty escape?
   This repetition is not superfluous: he had formerly said, shall he who
   has done this escape? he immediately repeats, shall he who has violated
   a treaty escape? There was nothing obscure in the first clause: but the
   Prophet added this, not for the sake of perspicuity, but to give more
   weight. to the sentence. The conclusion is, that it was not possible to
   escape God's vengeance for such perfidy, as we shall treat the point
   more at length tomorrow.

   It now follows, As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, in the dwelling of
   the king who placed him on a throne, shall he die. Although the Prophet
   had sufficiently shown that Zedekiah could not escape the penalty of
   his revolt, yet God here again comes forward, and swears by himself, or
   by his life, that he would punish Zedekiah. Hence the great stupidity
   of the people appears, for God never acts falsely by his own name, or
   brings it forward in vain, but when necessity demands it, he swears by
   himself. And by his own example he prescribes to us, that we should not
   rush rashly upon an oath, but be sober in this respect. But God swears
   that Zedekiah should die on the spot, that is, at the capital of the
   king who put him on the throne; that is Babylon, where he died: and yet
   he did not see Babylon, because his eyes were put out at Riblath, as we
   saw elsewhere. (Jeremiah 39:7; Jeremiah 52:11.) But the Prophet simply
   denounces the penalty, that he should die in exile, and in the dwelling
   of the king who had placed him on his throne, and from whose covenant
   he had departed, and whose oath he had despised.

   Ezekiel 17:17

   17. Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make
   for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut
   off many persons:

   17. Et non in exercitu magno, et in multitudine multa faciet cum eo
   Pharao in praelio, fundendo aggerem, et extruendo turrem [183] ad
   excidendum animas multas.


   As Ezekiel has before pronounced that there was no need of great forces
   when God wished to punish Zedekiah by means of the king of Babylon; so
   he now teaches, on the other hand, how great and powerful an army
   Pharaoh would collect, and yet it would profit nothing, since
   Nebuchadnezzar would be victorious. Some interpreters explain the
   passage otherwise, namely, that Pharaoh would not perform his promise;
   for kings are accustomed to boast of their supplies when they enter
   into treaties: they promise 50,000, but only supply 10,000. They think,
   therefore, that these vain promises by which Zedekiah was deceived are
   here reproved, since Pharaoh boasted that he would come with very great
   forces, so as easily to repel the Babylonian army. But the sense which
   I propose is far more suitable, namely, that whatever Pharaoh should
   attempt, it would fail to assist him. Although he should come well
   attended, and oppose the Chaldaeans by immense forces, yet he should
   effect nothing in battle with him: although this may be true equally of
   Zedekiah as of the king of Babylon. For Pharaoh did nothing with King
   Nebuchadnezzar, since he was quickly compelled to retreat into his own
   territories, and could scarcely defend his own kingdom, for he did not
   succeed against Nebuchadnezzar: and he did Zedekiah no good, since he
   did not assist him in his misfortunes, as he had promised. But as far
   as concerns the general sense, we see that the Prophet means that
   Zedekiah would be deceived although Pharaoh should faithfully perform
   his promises, since he was undertaking an expedition against the will
   of God, which must turn out disastrous. He adds, when he shall throw up
   a mound and build a tower, (towers are meant, for there is a change of
   number,) as is customary in besieging cities. This thought to be
   referred to Nebuchadnezzar, for he began to cast up mounds and build
   towers against Jerusalem when Pharaoh led away his army. Since
   Nebuchadnezzar could not contend with both the Egyptians and Jews
   together, he raised the siege and set out to meet Pharaoh, who, when
   conquered, retreated with trembling within his own boundaries.
   Nebuchadnezzar afterwards returned, and after preparing all things, he
   did not desist till he had stormed the city. Now Ezekiel means this,
   that Pharaoh would come to his help in vain, when Nebuchadnezzar began
   to cast up his mounds and build towers against the city. It follows --

   Ezekiel 17:18

   18. Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he
   had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.

   18. Sprevit jusjurandum ad abolendum foedus, et ecce porrexit manum
   suam: et totum hoc fecit, non evadet. [184]


   Ezekiel repeals again, that, even speaking, Zedekiah could not succeed,
   since he violated the treaty for we yesterday said that this persuasion
   is always fixed in men's minds, that treaties are sacred, and cannot be
   broken with impunity. Since, therefore, the sacredness of treaties was
   always prevalent among men, Ezekiel here pronounces that the issue
   would be disastrous, because Zedekiah despised his oath when he broke
   the treaty after stretching out his hand. He describes a gesture, as I
   think, customary among men -- that of stretching forth the hand when
   they wish to witness a covenant. The alliance, then, between the
   Egyptians and the Jews is here described by an outward gesture, because
   Zedekiah stretched forth his hand, and yet had violated it in this way:
   but since he perfidiously revolted from King Nebuchadnezzar, to whom he
   had pledged his faith, he has done all this, says he, therefore he
   shall not be liberated. It follows --

   Ezekiel 17:19

   19. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that
   he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I
   recompense upon his own head.

   19. Propterea sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, Vivo ego, si non jusjurandum
   meum quod sprevit, et foedus meum quod irritum fecit, rependam [185] in
   ejus caput.


   The former sentence is confirmed. The Prophet had spoken after the
   usually received manner when he said that Zedekiah's perfidy would not
   be unrevenged; but he now brings forward God as the speaker, because,
   unless he appeared as an avenger of perfidy, mankind would scarcely
   ever be seriously persuaded that punishment was prepared for perjurers
   and truce-breakers. As I have said that this opinion was fixed in the
   hearts of all, so it must be understood that this opinion was received,
   and that men were fully persuaded of it: but persuasions which are
   called "common" [186] vanish away; there are common thoughts which are
   almost born with us, and follow nature, but they are not firm, because
   the profane do not hold the principal point, that God is the judge of
   the world: this sentence, therefore, is added of necessity. Now God
   swears that Zedekiah should suffer punishment, because he had despised
   the oath and rendered the covenant void. But we must notice the
   epithet; for God calls the oath and the covenant his own: he has
   despised, says he, not simply the oath, but mine: he has violated my
   treaty. The reason of this language is, that God wishes fidelity
   between man and man to be cultivated: and so he detests all perjury and
   all frauds. Now, since there is no more sacred method of contracting a
   treaty than by solemn rites, there also God shows his judgment in a
   peculiar manner. In fine, we may deservedly call him the guardian of
   treaties; for when heathens entered into treaties, they were accustomed
   to bring forward the name of Jupiter the supreme, because they thought
   he would inflict vengeance on all who violated their pledge. But God
   here comes forward, not like an imaginary Jupiter, but because he
   wished confidence to flourish in human society; since, unless men act
   sincerely to each other, all society would be broken up. This, then, is
   the reason why Ezekiel says that the treaty struck with King
   Nebuchadnezzar was divine, since God would be its vindicator. Meanwhile
   we must remark that this treaty was lawful and pleasing to God.
   (Jeremiah 27:17.) And we see from Jeremiah 28 and Jeremiah 29., that
   God wished the Jews to suffer under this disgrace for a time. For King
   Zedekiah, if he had truly discharged his office, was an image of the
   Messiah, the first-born among the kings of the earth: Hence it was
   unworthy of him to become tributary to a profane monarch and a cruel
   tyrant. But since God had so imposed slavery on his own people,
   Zedekiah ought to be under the yoke, as it is there said, Be you
   servants to King Nebuchadnezzar and live; that is, there is no other
   method of obtaining safety, unless you suffer the Chaldaeans to rule
   over you, and you bear their sway calmly, since Nebuchadnezzar is God's
   scourge. This covenant, as I have said, was approved by God, otherwise
   he could not have been its avenger. We know that there are three kinds
   of treaties. When there has been war between two kings, if the
   conqueror wishes to spare his enemy, he receives him into covenant, but
   imposes conditions at his own discretion. We know that the Romans
   followed that custom, since it was too difficult for them to hold in
   subjection all whom they had subdued, and especially at the beginning;
   and thus they entered into treaties with many tribes under many
   circumstances. Another sort of agreement is, that between either kings
   or people when at variance with each other; but before they actually
   engage, they make a truce with each other, and so remove the occasion
   of the war -- this is another kind. Lastly, those who never were
   enemies enter into an alliance; and such was the treaty between
   Zedekiah and the king of Egypt. For they wished to be cautious, and to
   anticipate the danger which he feared from the Chaldaeans; and hence he
   entered into the agreement,. Thus the Israelites were formerly joined
   with the Syrians, and afterwards with the Assyrians. So we saw that the
   Jews committed adultery when they ran about first to Egypt, then to
   Assyria, and then to Chaldaea. But this treaty, of which mention is now
   made, was necessary; for Zedekiah could not escape from embracing the
   conditions imposed on him by King Nebuchadnezzar. For this reason God
   pronounces himself the avenger of perfidy.

   It is now asked, Whether we may never break our word when any one has
   been violently attacked, and promised what was otherwise unjust? The
   reply is at hand, that God's name is more precious than all human
   advantages. If any one, therefore, object that he was deceived, and
   oppressed by unjust conditions, still God's name must prevail. Hence we
   must always weigh what is due to the name of God; and hence we shall
   readily conclude that those can never be excused who violate their
   engagements on the pretext of being violently compelled, or induced by
   fraud, or not allowed the liberty of considering whether their promise
   was according to equity. For this reason, also, it is said in the 15th
   Psalm, (Psalm 15:4,) that the sons of God swear and suffer loss,
   because when God's, name has been interposed, no utility ought to be of
   such importance as to outweigh the oath that has been taken. And so not
   without reason God now pronounces that he would avenge the perjury
   which Zedekiah had committed, since, in truth, we cannot depart from
   promises which have been sanctioned by an oath in God's name, without
   seeming to slight the Almighty himself. Meanwhile, it is certain that
   there was another reason why God punished the Jews; but here, as I have
   previously shown, the Prophet mentions what was more familiar to men.
   The first cause of the destruction of the city and of the whole
   kingdom, was idolatry, as we saw before, and then the many crimes of
   the people were added. For from the period of the corruption of true
   religion, the pollution of many vices increased through the city and
   the whole land. Hence it happened that God destined his people to
   destruction; hence also King Zedekiah was deprived of sight. For, as
   the sacred history testifies, God wished to destroy the whole people:
   for this reason Zedekiah fell, and provoked the Chaldaeans against him.
   We see, therefore, that there is a continued series of causes in the
   eternal providence of God, but not as the Stoics supposed; for they
   concocted their fate from complex windings or implicit causes, without
   any will of Deity in that confusion. But God, as I have said, has
   different reasons why he does one thing or another. Some causes are
   remote and incomprehensible to us, and others manifest to us: so the
   proximate cause of the destruction of the people was the revolt of
   Zedekiah from King Nebuchadnezzar; but there was another more important
   reason, namely, that the people deserved to perish. Hence Zedekiah was
   rendered blind by the just judgment of God, since he passed over
   perfidiously to the king of Egypt, and so armed himself against King
   Nebuchadnezzar. But we must hold that the reason universally manifest
   is here reviewed. It follows --

   Ezekiel 17:20

   20. And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my
   snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there
   for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.

   20. Et extendam [187] super ipsum rete meum, et capietur in plagis
   meis, [188] et venire faciam ipsum Babylonem, et judicabo [189] cum eo
   illic de transgressione [190] qua praevaricatus est contra me.


   Here he points out the kind of punishment which he was about to inflict
   on King Zedekiah. He had said generally that his perfidy should fall
   upon his own head, but he now proceeds further, namely, that Zedekiah
   should be a captive. For God might chastise him by other means, but the
   prophecy was thereby confirmed, since the Prophet had clearly
   threatened Zedekiah as we see. But he speaks in the person of God that
   his language may have more weight. I will spread my net, says God, and
   he shall be taken in my snares. The passage is metaphorical, but it
   best explains what often occurs in Scripture, namely, that while the
   impious take first one course and then another, they are agents of God
   who governs them by his own secret virtue, and directs them wherever he
   wishes. As, therefore, men false up all things confusedly, and are, as
   we see, driven about hither and thither by their lusts, and disturb
   heaven and earth; yet God moderates their attacks by his secret
   providence. We gather this from the Prophet's words when he calls the
   army of the king of Babylon, and his plans, and the apparatus of war,
   God's net and snares. Although Nebuchadnezzar was impelled by his own
   ambition and avarice, and did not suppose himself under the divine
   sway, yet we see what the Spirit pronounces. And we must diligently
   observe this doctrine, because, if we repose on the paternal solicitude
   of God, although armies surround us on all sides, yet we may confide
   securely, and await the end with quiet and tranquil minds, since men
   can do nothing without God. But when we provoke God's wrath against us,
   we must bear in mind, that while men have their reasons for being
   hostile to us, yet God governs them, or that they are his nets or
   snares, as the Prophet here says.

   I will bring him, says he, to Babylon, and there will I dispute with
   him in judgment, according to the prevarication by which he has
   prevaricated. Not only did God dispute with Zedekiah there, but he
   inflicted a heavy and formidable judgment upon him in Riblah, when he
   saw his own sons put to death first, and then his own eyes were put
   out, and then he was bound by chains. But he almost pined away in his
   captivity, and was treated shamefully even unto death; for this reason
   God says that he would judge him at Babylon: and yet there will be
   nothing out of place if we comprehend Riblah also. For although
   Zedekiah had been partially punished before he entered Babylon, yet God
   there inflicted his own sentence, after he was dragged from his country
   and led into exile. He was buried indeed not without honor, as we saw
   in Jeremiah, (Jeremiah 34:5,) for they bewailed him at his burial --
   Alas, my brother! alas, O master! as the Prophet says: yet till his
   death he was like the vilest prisoner, for he pined away in his chains,
   and was meanly clothed, when the king treated Coniah nobly and
   splendidly: hence Zedekiah's captivity was the seal of this prophecy
   for Ezekiel could not have pronounced this sentence, unless he had been
   the organ of the Holy Spirit. It follows --

   Ezekiel 17:21

   21. And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword,
   and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall
   know that I the LORD have spoken it

   21. Et omnes profugi ejus in omnibus copius ejus in gladio cadent: et
   qui residui erunt ad omnem ventum dispergentur: et cognoscetis quod ego
   Iehovah loquutus sim.


   The Prophet now descends to the whole people, especially to the
   soldiers, whom Zedekiah himself thought would be fit guardians of the
   city. He says, then, thus shall all his forces be dissipated, so that
   they shall be dispersed hither and thither and all by the sword. By
   these words he means the slaughter of the army, since as long as
   soldiers stand in their own ranks they sustain and repel a hostile
   attack; but when they are dispersed, every one is subject to the enemy,
   and hence a promiscuous slaughter arises. He says, therefore, that
   Zedekiah's soldiers would be fugitives amidst all their bands: that is,
   although he had a large army, yet all his forces should be dispersed,
   and while each should consult his own advantage, he should fall into
   the enemy's hands: thus, all shall fall by the sword; then those who
   remain shall be dispersed towards every wind. We saw the same thing
   before, for when the Prophet had declared that all the people should
   suffer by the sword, he added, at the same time, that all the survivors
   should be fugitives, just as if any one should throw out refuse or hair
   which the wind would blow hither and thither. Hence he repeats the same
   now, namely, that the whole people would be like a torn body, since if
   they escaped the sword, yet they would find no place of rest. Hence
   while a few would flee to Egypt, some to the Moabites, and others to
   the neighboring nations, the whole body of the people, would be
   dissipated. He adds, and you shall know that I Jehovah have spoken. We
   have explained the meaning of this, and why the Prophet repeats it so
   often, namely, because the Jews were untractable and derided all God's
   threats: the Prophet teaches that they should really feel that he had
   spoken, and this is the wisdom of fools, as the common proverb
   expresses it. For because they do not obey any counsels, nor admit any
   admonitions, and receive no teaching, they are instructed only by the
   event itself. It follows --

   Ezekiel 17:22

   22. Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of
   the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his
   young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and
   eminent:

   22. Sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, Et assumam [191] e summitate cedri
   excelsae, [192] et ponam e capite propaginum ejus, tenerum evellam, et
   plantabo ego super montem excelsum et elevatum.


   Here the Prophet begins to treat of the restoration of the nation and
   kingdom. Thus this prophecy without doubt refers to Christ, because
   although in some sense God had pity on the people when they enjoyed the
   liberty of returning under Cyrus and Darius, yet what is here written
   was never fully exhibited except under Christ. It is indeed true, as I
   have elsewhere expressed, that when the prophets promise restoration to
   the Church, that they do not restrict their discourse to the person of
   Christ, but begin with the return of the people for that was the
   beginning of the full and solid liberty which was at length made
   manifest in Christ. And Christian writers have erred in urging so
   precisely that anything said about the restitution of the Church must
   be understood of the person of Christ, and thus they make themselves
   ridiculous to the Jews. But, as it has been said already, as often as
   the Prophets hold out the hope of liberty to the elect and the
   faithful, they embrace the whole of the time from the return of the
   people, or from the end of their exile to the end of the kingdom of
   Christ. When, therefore, the reign of Christ is treated, we must date
   its commencement from the period of the building of the temple after
   the people's return from their seventy years captivity: and then we
   must take its boundary, not at the ascension of Christ, nor yet in the
   first or second centuries, but through the whole progress of his
   kingdom, until he shall appear at the last day. Now let us come to the
   Prophet's words, thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will take from the top
   of the lofty (or tall) cedar. God pursues the allegory which we saw:
   for as he said that the top was torn off, or that the highest branch
   was plucked from the cedar of Lebanon, so he now says, that he would
   take from the top of the cedar, and after he had plucked or wrenched
   off a bough, and planted it, such would be the increase, that all the
   trees would acknowledge that to be a wonderful work. Now this
   restoration is described to us variously, because after God had spoken
   of a lofty bough, he descends to a low and abject one; he then
   pronounces that such should be the beginning of the new kingdom, that
   he would make the dry tree to bud and humble the lofty one. These
   things at first sight seem to be opposite to each other, but they agree
   very well, because God took from the top of a lofty cedar when he
   planted a new king. For Christ, as respects God's eternal decree, was
   always more excellent than heaven and earth; at the same time God
   afterwards says that he was humble, as he certainly was. But let us
   follow up the words, I will take, says he, from the top of a lofty
   cedar, and I will set it: from the top of its twigs I will pluck a
   tender one, and I will plant it upon a lofty and elevated mountain.
   Here, as I have said, he speaks of a tall and lofty cedar, and then he
   speaks of [11]a high branch, but he adds afterwards, I will pluck a
   tender one from it, by which he means that the twig which he should
   pluck and plant would be without strength. Here, therefore, is shown
   the contemptible beginning of the reign of Christ, as the Prophet
   afterwards more clearly explains himself.

   Ezekiel 17:23

   23. In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it
   shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and
   under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the
   branches thereof shall they dwell.

   23. In monte excelso Israel plantabo illud, et tollet ramum, et faciet
   fructum, et erit in cedrum elegantem: [193] et habitabit sub eo [194]
   omnis avis [195] omne pennatum [196] in umbra surculorum [197] ejus
   habitabit.


   When God announces that the twig which he will plant shall become a
   lofty cedar, he shows by lofty words that the increase of Christ's
   kingdom shall be so wonderful, that it shall surpass the common rule of
   nature; which indeed was shadowed forth in the person of Zerubbabel,
   who was chosen to bring back the people from their sad and disgraceful
   captivity. (Ezra 2:2; Haggai 1:14.) For it does not naturally happen
   that a twig increases in a short time to a lofty cedar, for we know how
   slowly cedars grow, and hence we see the Spirit's intention in saying
   that a tree should spring from a very small twig. And this prophecy
   answers to one of Isaiah's, where he says, (Isaiah 11:1,) A branch
   shall spring from the root of Jesse: for the house of Jesse was cut
   off, and he names the house of an obscure and private man as if the
   remembrance of David were utterly lost. The house of Jesse then was cut
   off like a tree: that twig, says he, shall spring from its root. Now
   the Prophet signifies the same thing, and almost under the same
   similitude. I leave the rest for the next lecture.

   Lecture Fifty-Third.

   In the last lecture we began to explain that passage of the Prophet in
   which God. promises that he would take from the boughs of the lofty
   cedar a tender branch, which should soon grow into a tall tree. We said
   that the restoration of the people was the foretaste of this grace,
   since God already showed that he cared for his people whom he seemed
   utterly to reject when he suffered them to be dragged into exile. We
   said also, that although Zerubbabel was a captive and an exile, yet
   that he was the twig plucked from the tall tree, as he was of the royal
   stock whence Christ would at length spring forth. But at the same time
   we added that this prophet was not complete until the kingdom of Christ
   of which it was the beginning, when he was manifest in the flesh, and
   thence it made daily progress until the end of the world. Thus then we
   see that the twig was plucked from the cedar, and from a tall or lofty
   one, and it was planted upon a mountain. The mountain on which the
   branch was to be planted was called sublime and lofty, and there is no
   doubt that God meant Mount Zion: it is indeed a small hill, but Isaiah
   shows us the reason why it was called lofty, because it excelled in
   dignity and eminence all the heights of the world. (Isaiah 2:2, 3.) It
   is there said, I will make Mount Zion conspicuous above all lofty
   mountains: that eminence indeed was not perceptible by the eye, but the
   Prophet at the same time declares what he means, since a law should go
   forth from Zion and God's word from Jerusalem. We see, therefore, that
   Mount Zion, although low among hills, was eminent and conspicuous among
   the highest mountains, since God's glory shone forth from it, and it
   was rendered conspicuous to even the ends of the earth. Hence the
   Prophet repeats a second time, On a, lofty mountain of Israel will I
   plant it, namely, the twig, and it shall raise or bear a bough, and
   produce fruit, and it shall be a magnificent or elegant cedar, as we
   said, and every bird, that is, all birds, shall dwell under it, every
   winged thing, or flying thing, shall dwell under the shadow of its
   branches or boughs. The repetition shows that something rare is here
   denoted, and what would scarcely be comprehended in an ordinary sense,
   when God speaks of a high and elevated mountain. So that it confirms
   what we said, that this place thought to be understood of Mount Zion,
   which was supernaturally elevated when Christ's scepter went forth from
   it, by which he reduced the whole world under his yoke. He now adds,
   that it should be a magnificent cedar, so that the birds of the air
   should nestle in it and rest under its shadow. This simile is used by
   Daniel when treating of the sway of Nebuchadnezzar, (Daniel 4:8, 9,
   17-19,) it is common to all kingdoms to protect men under their shadow,
   as birds find their dwelling-place only in trees, and repair and
   collect themselves there. But meanwhile the Prophet shortly states that
   the kingdom of which he is would be for the common safety and advantage
   of the whole people. For as kings usually think the human race created
   for their sakes, they are taken up with their own private reasoning,
   and do not consult the interests of the wretched people whom they are
   divinely appointed to cherish under their wings. The Prophet therefore
   shows that the kingdom which God had determined to set up in his chosen
   people would be useful to all, when he says, under its shadow there
   would be safety for all birds. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 17:24

   24. And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have
   brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up
   the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have
   spoken and have done it

   24. Et cognoscent omnes arbores agri, quod ego Iehovah, qui humilio
   arborem excelsam, et extollo in sublime arborem humilem: arefacio
   arborem viridem, et fructuosam reddo arborem aridam: ego Iehovah
   loquutus sum, et feci. [198]


   In this verse the Prophet signifies that God's work would be memorable.
   For when he says that all trees should feel themselves in God's hand
   and power, to raise what was fallen, and to cast down and to prostrate
   what was elevated, he doubtless expresses no common action. By trees he
   means all the kings of the earth, and all possessed of any dignity. For
   he follows up his own metaphor: as he called the kingdom of Christ a
   tree or cedar which grew from a small twig, so he now speaks
   metaphorically of kings when he says, that all should take notice; for
   they shall know that Jehovah brings down the high tree. Ezekiel may
   here seem to be inconsistent with himself, as I have already noticed,
   because God said that he would take from a lofty cedar a little twig,
   which he wished to plant: but he now says that God would raise what was
   low and abject. But we have dissipated this absurdity, because, from
   the beginning Christ was in the glory of his Father, and thus, as Micah
   says, his beginning was from eternity. (Micah 5:2.) This excellency of
   Christ, therefore, is noticed, because, from the time when God erected
   David's throne, he at the same time gave a visible sign of the more
   excellent kingdom which was then secretly hoped for. For this reason
   Christ was taken from his lofty place, and since he not only put on the
   form of a slave, but emptied himself even unto death, (Philippians
   2:7,) it is not surprising that the Prophet should say, like a tree
   cast down. Although, as I have remarked, this sentence is not to be
   restricted to the person of Christ, but thought to be adapted to his
   kingdom; that is, to his manner and way of governing: since we know,
   and it has been lately stated, that the gospel is like a scepter, by
   which Christ subdues all people, and rules them for himself. Now if we
   reflect on what the preaching of the gospel was, we shall see, as in a
   glass, the Prophet's meaning here, that the low tree was elevated,
   since no one would have thought, that from such slender beginnings the
   increase which God afterwards bestowed on it could arise. It follows,
   then, that the height was wonderful, since it could not be comprehended
   by the human senses.

   Meanwhile he adds, I am he who humbles the lofty tree, which is not
   only understood of the Jews, but, in my judgment, embraces all the
   empires and principalities of the world. God, therefore, humbles lofty
   trees, because, whatever opposes itself to Christ's kingdom, must
   necessarily fall; and this is described more at length in Daniel.
   (Daniel 4.) For although all the empires of the world are founded in
   Christ, and sustained by his virtue, yet, since earthly kings rise up
   and desire to lay Christ prostrate, their pride is the reason why
   Christ's empire causes their ruin. This contrast, then, must be
   noticed, that God sets up low trees, or takes them away, and casts down
   lofty ones, since we are here taught to hope better of the reign of
   Christ than we can estimate by our senses; since, if we cast our eyes
   round us, many things meet us which diminish and weaken our hope. For
   what is the outward appearance of Christ's kingdom? In truth we shall
   feel nothing but despair if we judge of Christ's kingdom by the present
   state of affairs. But when we see how the gospel creeps along the
   ground, this passage should come to our minds, that God will raise up
   the tree that is abject and contemptible. At the same time, let us
   learn, that the changes which happen and are perceived in the world are
   to be imputed to the pride of those who are blinded by their own
   boasting; for kings, as we have said, forget that they are men, and so
   rebel against God: hence they must of necessity fall. If this is not
   fulfilled immediately, let us learn patiently to await the effect of
   this prophecy. Whatever happens, God has so established the kingdom of
   Christ alone, that it shall last as long as the sun and moon, but the
   other empires of the world shall vanish away with their own splendor,
   and their loftiness shall fall although at present they overtop the
   clouds. I, says Jehovah, have spoken, and I will do it. God here
   recalls the minds of the faithful to his power, because, from the time
   the people were dispersed -- I speak of the final overthrow of the city
   and temple -- there was no hope of restoration. Since, then, it was
   difficult to persuade men of what God now pronounces, he brings
   pointedly forward his own prowess, in order that men, by holding in
   check their carnal senses, should raise themselves above the world, and
   wait for the inestimable prowess of God which does not yet appear to
   them. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 18:1-4

   1. The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

   1. Et fuit sermo Iehova, ad me, dicendo,

   2. What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of
   Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's
   teeth are set on edge?

   2. Quid vobis? vos proverbiantes proverbium [199] super terram Israel,
   dicendo, Patres comederunt omphacem, [200] et dentes filiorum
   obstupescunt.

   3. As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more
   to use this proverb in Israel.

   3. Vivo ego, dicit Dominator Iehovah, Si erit vobis amplius [201] qui
   utatur hoc dicterio [202] in Israele.

   4. Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the
   soul of the son is mine: the soul that shineth, it shall die.

   4. Ecce omnes animae mihi, [203] sicut anima patris sic anima filii
   mihi. [204] Anima quae peccaverit ipsa morietur.


   We may collect from this rebuke that the Jews were perverse
   interpreters of the best teaching; yea, they purposely reviled the
   Prophet's expression, and drew it to a contrary meaning. For it, is far
   commoner than it ought to be among unbelievers, always to take occasion
   of turning backwards, twisting, distorting, and tearing the teaching of
   heaven. And at this time we see this impudence increasing greatly in
   the world. For the world is full of buffoons and other deceivers, who
   wickedly sport with God, and seek material for joking from the law and
   the gospel: and so also it appears to have been in the Prophet's time;
   for although they listened to the wrath of God hanging over them, they
   did not cease to provoke him, and that too for many years. And not only
   were their own iniquities set forth against them, but also those of
   their fathers: hence the occasion for cavil when they heard -- For so
   many ages you do not cease your warfare against God: he has borne with
   you patiently unto this day. Do you think that you can carry on your
   audacity with impunity? God wished hitherto to tame you by his
   forbearance; but your obstinacy is not to be subdued. Since, therefore,
   not only for one or two generations, but for four and five, your
   obstinacy has wrestled with God's goodness, he cannot any longer pardon
   you. Since the prophets thus gathered up the iniquities of their
   fathers, impious men scattered abroad their witticisms -- then we are
   to pay the penalty of our fathers' sins: they provoked God, but we
   suffer the punishment which they deserved. The Prophet now convinces
   them of this unfairness, and shows that they had no reason for
   transferring their faults to others, or to thrust them away from
   themselves, since God was just in taking vengeance on them. We know
   that men willingly shuffle so as to free themselves from blame, and
   then afterwards accuse God of cruel injustice. It is true, indeed, that
   they are held in such constraint by their own consciences that they are
   compelled, whether they will or not, to feel that they are suffering
   punishment justly; but afterwards they become refractory, and suffocate
   their conscience, and strive pettishly with God. Hence these words --

   Though guiltless of your fathers' crimes,
   Roman, tis thine to latest times
   The vengeance of the gods to bear,
   Till you their awful domes repair.
   Horace, lib. 3, Od. 6, as translated by Francis.

   Since so many crimes were rife at Rome, why does that trifler say that
   the men of his own age were undeservedly paying the penalty due by
   their ancestors? But, as I have said, this is the testimony of a
   corrupt nature, because we desire to throw off the blame as far from
   ourselves as we possibly can. Hence we begin to strive with God, and to
   rebel against his judgments. And hence this destruction is the more
   useful to us, since it is proposed as a remedy for a disease by far too
   common. Whatever the meaning is, this sentiment came into common use
   like a proverb -- that the children's teeth were set on edge, because
   their fathers had eaten sour grapes. By these allegorical words they
   wished to free themselves from blame, as if God was unjustly charging
   the wickedness of their fathers against them. For to [12]eat the sour
   grape or wild grape has the same meaning as to set the teeth on edge;
   for we know this to be the effect of acidity. If any one eats a sour
   grape, his teeth will suffer from its unripeness. To eat then is to
   cause this effect on the teeth -- referring to sin: for they said that
   their own teeth suffered, not through their own eating the sour grapes,
   but through its flowing down from their fathers. On the whole, they
   wished to contend with God, as if he were afflicting the innocent, and
   that, too, under the fallacious pretext which I have mentioned, as God
   announced that he would avenge the wickedness which had been
   perpetrated in former ages.

   Ye, says he, use this proverb; but as I live, says the Lord Jehovah,
   you shall not use this proverb anymore. He does not mean, by these
   words, that the Jews should repent and become more modest, and not dare
   to vomit forth such blasphemy against him; for he is not treating of
   repentance here; but it is just as if he said, I will strike from under
   you this boasting, since your iniquity shall be made manifest, and the
   whole world shall acknowledge the justice of your punishment, and that
   you have deserved it yourselves, and cannot throw it upon your fathers,
   as you have hitherto endeavored to do. The Jews indeed did not cease
   their rebellion against God, and there is no doubt that they were more
   and more exasperated, so as to expostulate with audacity against him;
   but because their wickedness was really apparent, and God was not
   hostile to them in vain, or for trifling reasons; and although he was
   severe, yet they had arrived at the highest pitch of impiety, so that
   no punishment could be sufficient or too oppressive. We now understand
   the meaning of the Prophet, or rather of the Holy Spirit, since God
   took away all pretense for shuffling from the Jews when he detected
   their impiety, and made it conspicuous that they were only suffering
   the due reward of their crimes. But God swears by himself, whence we
   gather how abominable was their blasphemy; and truly men cannot absolve
   themselves without condemning God; for God's glory then shines forth,
   when every mouth is stopped, as we saw before. (Ezekiel 16:63; Romans
   3:19.) As soon as men descend into that arena, through wishing to show
   their innocence, it is just as if they wished to reduce God's justice
   to nothing. Hence it is not surprising that God is very angry when he
   is despoiled of his justice; for he cannot exist without this
   attribute.

   We now see why an oath is interposed, while he pronounces that he will
   take care that the Jews should not ridicule any longer Behold, says he,
   all souls are mine; as the sole of the son so the soul of the father,
   all souls are mine; the soul, therefore, which has sinned it shall die.
   Some interpreters explain the beginning of the verse thus: that men
   vainly and rashly complain when God seems to treat them too severely,
   since the clay does not rise against the potter. Since God is the maker
   of the whole world, we are his workmanship: what madness, then, to rise
   up against him when he does not satisfy us: and we saw this simile used
   by Jeremiah. (Jeremiah 18:6.) The sentiment, then, is true in itself,
   that all souls are under God's sovereignty by the right of creation,
   and therefore he can arbitrarily determine for each whatever he wishes;
   and all who clamor against him reap no profit: and this teaching it is
   advantageous to notice. But this passage ought to be understood
   otherwise; namely, that nothing is more unworthy than that God should
   be accused of tyrannizing over men, when he rather defends them, as
   being his own workmanship. When, therefore, God pronounces that all
   souls are his own, he does not merely claim sovereignty and power, but
   he rather shows that he is affected with fatherly love towards the
   whole human race since he created and formed it; for, if a workman
   loves his work because he recognizes in it the fruits of his industry,
   so, when God has manifested his power and goodness in the formation of
   men, he must certainly embrace them with affection. True, indeed, we
   are abominable in God's sight, through being corrupted by original sin,
   as it is elsewhere said, (Psalm 14:1, 2;) but inasmuch as we are men,
   we must be dear to God, and our salvation must be precious in his
   sight. We now see what kind of refutation this is: all souls are mine,
   says he: I have formed all, and am the creator of all, and so I am
   affected with fatherly love towards all, and they shall rather feel my
   clemency, from the least to the greatest, than experience too much
   rigor and severity. At length he adds, the soul which sinned it shall
   die. Now, Ezekiel expresses how God restrains the Jews from daring to
   boast any longer that they are afflicted undeservedly, since no
   innocent person shall die; for this is the meaning of the sentence; for
   he does not mean that every guilty person should die, for this would
   shut against us the door of God's mercy, for we have all sinned against
   him: so it would follow that there is no hope of safety, since every
   man must perish, unless God freed sinners from death. But the Prophet's
   sense is not doubtful, as we have said, since those who perish are not
   without fault; neither can they bring up their innocence to God, nor
   complain of his cruelty in punishing them for the sins of others.
   Although here a question may arise, since no one at this day perishes
   who does not partly bear the fault of another, namely, of Adam, by
   whose fall and revolt the whole human race actually perished. Since
   therefore Adam, by his fall, brought destruction upon us, it follows
   that we perish through the fault of another. Since this question will
   be treated again in its own place, it will now be sufficient to say, in
   three words, that although we perish through the fault of another, yet
   the fault of each individual is joined with it. We are not condemned in
   Adam as if we were innocent in ourselves, but we have contracted
   pollution from his sin; and so it has come to pass that each must bear
   the punishment of his own crime, since the punishment which he deserved
   first is not simply inflicted on the whole human race, but we have been
   tainted with his sin, as will afterwards be said. Whatever the meaning,
   we shall not die innocent, since each is held convicted by the
   testimony of his own conscience. As far as relates to young children,
   they seem to perish not by their own, but for another's fault; but the
   solution is twofold; for although sin does not appear in them, yet it
   is latent, since they carry about with them corruption shut up in their
   soul, so that they are worthy of condemnation before God. This does not
   come under the notice of our senses; but we should consider how much
   more acutely God sees a thing than we do: hence, if we do not penetrate
   into that hidden judgment, yet we must hold that, before we are born,
   we are infected by the contagion of original sin, and therefore justly
   destined to ultimate destruction: -- -this is one solution. But as far
   as concerns the Prophet's expression, the dispute concerning infants is
   vain and out of place, since the Prophet only wished to refute that
   impious perverseness, as I have said, so that the people should no
   longer charge God with cruelty. The soul, says he, which has sinned;
   that is, none of you can boast of innocence when I punish you: as when
   it is said, He who does not labor, neither let him eat. (2
   Thessalonians 3:10.) Surely this cannot be extended to infants. Nature
   teaches us that they must be nourished, and yet sure enough they do not
   acquire their food by labor: but this is said of adults, who are old
   enough to acknowledge the reason why they were created, and their
   fitness for undergoing labor. So also, in this place, we are not
   treating of the tender young when newly born, but of adults, who wish
   to charge God instead of themselves, as if they are innocent; and so,
   when they cannot escape punishment, they are anxious to transfer the
   fault elsewhere -- first upon others, and then upon God himself.

   taken us from the lowest depths, and deigned to raise us to the hope of
   thy heavenly kingdom:-Grant, I say, that we may not be proud or puffed

   Ezekiel 18:5-9

   5. But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,

   5. Et vir si fuerit justus, et fecerit judicium et justitiam,

   6. And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his
   eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his
   neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,

   6. Super montes non comederit, et oculos suos non extulerit ad idola
   [205] domus Israel, et uxorem socii sui [206] non polluerit, et ad
   mulierem menstruatam non accesserit,

   7. And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his
   pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the
   hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;

   7. Et neminem afflixerit, [207] pignus suum reddiderit debitori,
   praedam non rapuerit, [208] panem suum famelico dederit, et nudum
   texerit vestimentis;

   8. He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any
   increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed
   true judgment between man and man,

   8. Cum usura non dederit et incrementum [209] non acceperit, ab
   iniquitate retraxerit manum suam, judicium fideliter fecerit inter
   virum et virum,

   9. Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal
   truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.

   9. In statutis meis ambulaverit, et judicia mea custodierit ad
   faciendum veritatem, [210] justus est, vivendo vivet, dicit Dominator
   Iehovah.


   Here the Prophet confirms his former teaching by examples. For he first
   says, if any one faithfully keep the law, he shall prosper, since God
   will repay the reward of justice: afterwards he adds, if the just man
   beget a son unlike himself, the justice of the father shall not profit
   the degenerate son, but he shall receive the reward of his iniquity.
   But if this second person should beget a son who does not imitate his
   father, God promises that this third person shall be acceptable by him,
   because he is just, and therefore enjoys prosperity and happiness. We
   see, then, that the grandfather and grandson are here spoken of, and
   that the son of the first, and father of the third, is placed between
   them. But this is the Spirit's intention, that God has prepared a
   reward for each according to their lives, so that he does not permit
   them to be deprived of their promised blessing, nor let the impious and
   despisers of his law escape. Now let us come to the words, if any one
   has been just, says he, he shall be just, therefore he shall live. He
   speaks generally first: he afterwards enumerates certain species under
   which he embraces the sum of the whole law. The full sentence is, if
   any one has been just, he shall live in consequence of his justice. But
   the Prophet defines what it is to be just, and he there chooses certain
   parts of the law: by putting a part for the whole, as I have said, he
   signifies, that whoever faithfully observes the law is esteemed just
   before God. Now we must examine each of these kinds of justice, and
   afterwards come to the general doctrine. He says first, that he is just
   who does justice and judgement. By the word judgment holy Scripture
   signifies rectitude; but when the two words are joined together,
   judgment seems to express more than justice: for justice is nothing but
   equity, fidelity, integrity, when we abstain altogether from fraud and
   violence, and deal with our brethren as we wish them to deal with us.
   Whoever so conducts himself is said to do justice; but judgment is
   extended further, namely, when we not only desire to benefit but defend
   our brethren, when unjustly oppressed, as far as we can, and when we
   oppose the lust and violence of those who would overthrow all that is
   right and holy. Hence to do judgment and justice is nothing else than
   to abstain from all injury by cultivating good faith and equity with
   our neighbors: then to defend all good causes, and to take the innocent
   under our patronage when we see them unjustly injured and oppressed.
   But these duties belong properly to the second table of the law. But it
   is clear from this that we fear God when we live justly with our
   brethren, for piety is the root of charity. Although many profane
   persons seem blameless in their life, and manifest a rare integrity,
   yet no one ever loves his neighbor from his heart, unless he fears and
   reverences God. Since, therefore, charity flows from piety and the fear
   of God, as often as we see the duties of the second table placed before
   us, we should learn them to be the testimonies to the worship of God,
   as is this place: but then the Prophet also adds certain parts of the
   first table.

   He says then, if he has not eaten upon the mountains, and not raised
   his eyes to the abominable deeds of the house of Israel. These two
   points respect the worship of God: for by the figure "a part for the
   whole" to eat, means to offer sacrifices: he refers to those to which
   banquets were added as appendages. And truly when Paul speaks of
   idolatry, he does not say, if any one bends his knees before stone or
   wood, but he quotes the words of Moses, that the people rose up to play
   after eating, that is, after banqueting. (1 Corinthians 10:7; Exodus
   32:6.) Hence a feast is there taken for that sacrilegious profaneness
   when the people made for themselves a calf, and wished to worship God
   before it. When, therefore, it is now said, if any one has not eaten
   upon, the mountains: by a feast, as I have said, a sacrifice offered to
   idols is intended. Now we know that altars were raised on high in every
   direction, because they thought that they were near God when they
   ascended to an elevated spot. Because, therefore, superstitions were so
   exercised on the mountains, hence the Prophet relates what was
   customary, if any one has not eaten, upon the mountains: then he
   explains himself more clearly, if any one has not raised his eyes to
   the idols of the house of Israel. To raise the eyes is here taken by a
   figure of speech for to be urged with eagerness towards superstitions:
   for we know that eyes are the principal outlets to the affections; for
   when the affections burst forth in the eyes, and are conspicuous there,
   it is not surprising if all our desires are marked by this form of
   speech. Thus a person is said to raise his eyes to the house of his
   neighbor when he covets it, and also towards his wife, or anything
   else, when he is seized by a depraved lusting. The meaning is, then,
   that those who do not contaminate themselves with idols are thought
   just before God, as far as concerns the first table of the law, since
   they are content with the simple and lawful worship of God, and do not
   incline from it in any direction; nor, like the superstitious, allow
   their eyes to be wandering and erratic: and so they are compared with
   harlots who seek lovers on all sides. I repeat it again. -- the meaning
   is, that the true worshipers of God are those who are content with his
   doctrine, and are not carried hither and thither by a perverse
   appetite, and so fabricate for themselves idols. Besides, the Holy
   Spirit calls idols glvlym, gelolim, "defilements," [211] since all
   superstition should be detested by us; for as we are prone by nature to
   all kinds of error, we cannot be sufficiently restrained within the
   true and pure worship of God. Since, then, unbelievers imagine their
   gods to be sacred, the Holy Spirit, on the other hand, pronounces them
   to be defiling, since their profane worship is disgusting and
   abominable. But he says, the idols of the house of Israel, so that all
   shuffling must cease: because, if he had spoken of idols only, they
   might have objected that they detested the false and foolish gods of
   the Gentiles; but since many ceremonies were through long use received
   among the elect people, these ought not to be condemned like the
   impious rites of the heathen. The Holy Spirit refutes this cavil, and
   says, that though the house of Israel has approved such defilement's,
   yet they are not to be excused for setting aside the law of God, and
   devoting themselves to human fictions.

   And has not polluted his neighbors wife. The Prophet now returns again
   to the second table, and treats here of adultery; and the language must
   be noticed, since such contamination shows how holy God considers the
   marriage tie: hence we see the atrocity of the sin, and the detestable
   nature of adultery; for both parties are equally polluted, though it
   appears stronger in the female sex through their natural modesty. We
   must hold, then, that the very body is engrained with disgrace and
   infamy, as Paul says, when such sins are committed. Other sins, says
   he, are without the body; but this is a sin against the body itself
   which thus bears the marks of shame and infamy. (1 Corinthians 6:18.)
   Here, as I have said, Ezekiel treats the case of the woman, since the
   offense is in her case more pernicious. It follows -- and has not
   approached a female when legally unclean: for we know this to be
   prohibited under the law; as being contrary to nature; for it was not
   necessary to define the matter by written law, as it speaks for itself.
   and God detests such crimes, not only because their offspring would
   contaminate cities and the nation at large, but because they are
   adverse to the instincts of human nature. (Leviticus 18:19; Leviticus
   20:18.) He afterwards adds, if he has not oppressed or afflicted any
   one. This is general, just as if the Prophet had said, if he has
   abstained from all fraud, violence, and injustice. But this is a great
   point to live so innocently among men, that no one should complain of
   any injury done to him, nor of any loss sustained. But it is not enough
   to preserve this self-restraint unless we desire to profit our
   brethren, since God wishes the good offices of life to be reciprocal:
   although, indeed, to take care to be free from all injustice ought to
   precede other duties. He says, if he has returned his pledge to the
   debtor. This ought not to be taken generally, but depends on the
   precept of the law; for we have often said, that the prophets are the
   interpreters of Moses, and so they often touch briefly on what Moses
   expresses more clearly. But if we wish to occupy ourselves usefully in
   reading them, we ought to determine the meaning of the law, and then to
   accommodate what we read in the prophets to what is there contained.
   [212] So, in this passage, to restore the pledge to, the debtor, is
   restricted to the poor and needy, who had pledged either their
   garments, or their beds, or the tools by which they acquired a
   livelihood: for God forbids taking a pledge of a widow or a poor
   person: then he forbids taking a millstone, that is, any tool which a
   workman uses to Judea his living; for if any one empties the workshop
   of the miserable, he might just as well take his life. Hence Moses
   says, His life is in the pledge, (Deuteronomy 24:6,) that is, if any
   one pledges his tools, it is like having his hands cut off, since he
   cannot carry on his trade without His tools: hence you take away his
   life. Hence God forbids taking a coverlet, or garments, or bedding, for
   a wretched man would perish with cold were he to pledge either his
   coverlet or his bedding. But if, on the other hand, men of this kind
   are assisted without taking a pledge, they will bless those who abstain
   from too much rigor. Lastly, God forbids the destruction of the poor
   man's house, lest he should be ashamed of his poverty, and then because
   it is too cruel to penetrate into the house of another, and inquire for
   its contents; nay, this is a species of robbery. We see now how Ezekiel
   thought to be understood, if he has restored a pledge to the debtor,
   that is, to the poor debtor, or the necessary pledge, as I have said,
   such as tools and needful furniture, without which a person cannot
   exercise his trade. He has not seized a prey, that is, has not preyed
   upon his neighbors. For every kind of robbery is here marked by the
   word gzl, gezel, violence. And has given his bread to the hungry. Here
   the Prophet teaches what I have lately touched on, that cautious
   self-restraint from all injury is not sufficient, and sparing our
   neighbors; but that more is required, since we ought to assist them as
   far as we possibly can. Unless this had been added, many might object
   that they injured no one, never defrauded any, nor took advantage of
   the simple. But since God has united men in the bonds of mutual
   society, hence they must mutually perform good offices for each other.
   Here, then, it is required of the rich to succor the poor, and to offer
   bread to the hungry. But it is said, His bread, lest any one should
   object, through his habit of being too restricted; but there is no
   reason to bind me to bestow my goods on others: this is my bread, and
   so I have a right to possess what is my own: if any one is oppressed by
   want, I confess it to be praiseworthy to succor him, but no one is
   compelled to this act of liberality. Lest any one should escape thus,
   behold, says the Holy Spirit, although you rightly call the bread
   yours, yet it is not so yours that you ought to refuse your brother
   when his hunger provokes you to pity. And has covered the naked with a
   garment: the rule for garment and for bread is the same. The substance
   is, that others are not deemed just before God unless they are inclined
   to benevolence, so as to supply the necessities of their brethren, and
   to succor them in their poverty. It follows, since he has not given on
   usury and has not received increase. Here, among other crimes, Ezekiel
   enumerates usury -- though the word usury is not properly suitable to
   this passage nsk, neshek, is deduced from biting, and so the Hebrews
   name usury, because it gnaws and by degrees consumes the miserable.
   Ezekiel then says, that they are considered observers of the law who
   abstain from usury. But because men are very acute and cunning on this
   point, and devise subterfuges by which they may hide their cruelty, he
   adds, and has not received increase: for we know how various are the
   schemes for gain: for whoever devotes his attention to unlawful gains,
   will find out many monstrous things which no one would ever have
   thought of. Thus it happens that the usurer will deny that he exacts
   usury, and yet he will spoil the wretched and even suck out their
   blood. Under the name, trvyt, ther-bith, Ezekiel comprehends those more
   secret kinds of usury which the avaricious use with many disguises, and
   when they spread such coverings before them, think themselves free from
   all blame. Hence the Prophet says, even if the name of usury is removed
   and is not taken into account, yet it is sufficient to condemn men if
   they receive increase, that is, make a profit at the expense of others.
   A question arises here, whether usury be in itself a crime, since God
   formerly permitted his people to take interest of strangers, and only
   forbade it among themselves. And there was the best reason for that
   law. For if its just proportion had been overthrown, there would have
   been no reciprocity, since the Gentiles could exact interest of the
   Jews; and unless that right had been mutual and reciprocal, as the
   phrase is, the condition of God's people would have been worse than
   that of the Gentiles. God therefore permitted his people to take
   interest, but not among each other, as I have said: this was only
   allowable with strangers. Besides, the law itself was political: but in
   this case the Prophet seems to condemn all kinds of interest, and
   exaggerates the weight of the sentence, when he adds increase, that is,
   whatever gains the avaricious mutually strive for. So also in the 15th
   Psalm, where a just mode of living is proscribed for us, David
   mentions, among other things -- who has not lent his money on usury,
   (Psalm 15:5.) It seems, then, from these two places, that usury is in
   itself unlawful. But because God's law embraces complete and perfect
   justice, hence we must hold that interest, unless it is opposed to
   God's law, is not altogether to be condemned, otherwise ignominy would
   clearly attach to the law of God if it did not prescribe to us a true
   and complete rule of living justly. But in the law there is that
   perfection to which nothing can be added. If then we wish to determine
   [13]whether interest is unlawful we must come to the rule of the law,
   which cannot deceive us: but we shall not find all interest contrary to
   the law, and hence it follows that interest is not always to be
   condemned. Here, too, we must remember that we must regard the subject
   rather than the words, for men trifle by their own caviling, but God
   does not admit of such fallacies. Hence, as I said, the substance ought
   to be weighed, because the words alone will not enable us to decide
   whether interest be sometimes lawful or not. For example, among the
   Latin's the word for interest is honorable in itself and has no
   disgrace attached to it, but that for usury is odious. What causes
   disgrace to be thus hidden under it, but they fancied that they
   abhorred usurers, hence the general term interest contains within it
   all kinds of usury, and there was nothing so cruel, so unjust, and so
   barbarous, which was not covered by that pretense. Now since the name
   for interest was unknown to the French, that for usury became
   detestable: hence the French devised a new craftiness by which they
   could deceive God. For since no one could bear the name of usury, they
   used "interest" instead: but what does this mean but something which
   interests us, and thus it signifies all kinds of repayment for loans,
   for there was no kind of interest among the ancients which is not now
   comprehended in this word. Now since we have said that interest cannot
   be totally and without exception condemned, (for we must not play upon
   words, but treat the real point,) we must see how far it can be proved
   not to be reckoned a crime. First of all, in a well regulated state, no
   usurer is tolerated: even the profane see this: whoever therefore
   professedly adopts this occupation, he ought to be expelled from
   intercourse with his fellow-men. For if any illiberal pursuits load
   those who pursue them with censure, that of the usurer is certainly an
   illiberal trade, and unworthy of a pious and honorable man. Hence Cato
   said that to take usury was almost the same as murder. For when asked
   concerning agriculture, after he had given his opinion, he inquired,
   But what is usury? Is it not murder? says he. And surely the usurer
   will always be a robber; that is, he will make a profit by his trade,
   and will defraud, and his iniquity will increase just as if there were
   no laws, no equity, and no mutual regard among mankind. This is one
   point: but there is another part of the occupation besides that of
   taking interest. When any one sets up his table he uses the same art as
   a farmer does in employing his labor in cultivating the fields. But any
   one may receive interest without being a professed usurer. For example,
   a person may have capital and put out a part of it on loan, and thus
   receive interest: and if he do that once, he will not be called a
   usurer; so that we must consider when and from whom a person exacts
   interest. But this sentiment ought to prevail here: "neither
   everywhere, nor always, nor all things, nor from all." This indeed was
   said of offices, and that law was imposed upon the governors of
   provinces: but it agrees best with this subject. It is not suitable
   then to receive "all things," because if the profit exceed moderation
   it must be rejected, since it is contrary to charity: we said also that
   the continual habit and custom is not without fault. Neither
   "everywhere," since the usurer, as I have said, ought not to enter or
   be brought into the Church of God. Then again, not "from all," because
   it is always wrong to exact usury from a poor man; but if a man is
   rich, and has money of his own, as the saying is, and has a very good
   estate and a large patrimony, and should borrow money of his neighbor,
   will that neighbor commit sin by receiving a profit from the loan of
   his money? Another borrower is the richer of the two, and might do
   without it and yet suffer no loss: but he wishes to buy a farm and
   enjoy its fruits: why should the creditor be deprived of his rights
   when his money brings profit to a neighbor richer than himself? We see,
   then, that it may sometimes happen that the receiver of interest is not
   to be hastily condemned, since he is not acting contrary to God's law.
   But we must always hold that the tendency of usury is to oppress one's
   brother, and hence it is to be wished that the very names of usury and
   interest were buried and blotted out from the memory of men. But since
   men cannot otherwise transact their business, we must always observe
   what is lawful, and how far it is so. I know that the subject might be
   treated at greater length, but I have shortly expressed what is
   sufficient for our purpose.

   It follows, And has withdrawn his hand from iniquity. Here again the
   Prophet commends innocence, when we are cautious that our neighbor
   should not receive any damage or injury through our fault. Hence
   abstaining from injury is again praised here, but a new form of speech
   is used, since if men are not very anxious and careful they easily
   extend the hand to iniquity: and why so? various means of gain from
   many quarters present themselves to us, and we are easily led captive
   by such enticements. Hence the Prophet, not without reason, here
   commends the servants of God to withdraw the hand from iniquity, that
   is, not only to abstain from injury, but when the sweetness of gain
   entices us, and some plausible means of profit is proposed, that they
   should restrain themselves this is the meaning of to withdraw the hand
   from iniquity. The rest I leave for tomorrow.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you have so instructed us by thy law in the
   rules of living justly, that we have no excuse for error or ignorance:
   Grant, I say, that we may be attentive to that teaching which you
   prescribe for us; and so anxiously exercise ourselves in it, that each
   of us may live innocently among the brotherhood: and then may we so
   worship thee with one consent and so glorify thy name, that we may at
   length arrive at that happy inheritance which you have promised for us
   in your only-begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Lecture Fifty-Fifth.

   We yesterday explained why the Prophet says that no one is just unless
   he withdraw his hands from iniquity, because many occasions tempt us to
   injure others: unless we restrain ourselves in a middle course we often
   hurt our neighbors. Now among the virtues of a just man he puts, to
   judge according to truth: to act truthfully, says he, between man and
   man. This seems indeed to be the proper duty of judges who discharge a
   public office, but yet it is suitable to private persons; for although
   no one argues his own cause except before some one endued with power to
   decide it, yet we see that the inclinations of men often pervert equity
   and rectitude in judgments. Again, many are chosen arbitrators who do
   not hold any public office. The meaning is, that what Ezekiel
   previously sought concerning equity is extended to the causes of
   others, that no one should turn aside from right and equity through
   private friendship. Afterwards it follows, if he has walked in my
   statutes and kept my judgments, in acting with truthfulness. Again, the
   Prophet returns to general remarks: for he has recorded certain kinds
   of justice, as we said yesterday, whence its nature may be more clearly
   perceived. Besides, because God's law contains within it more than the
   prophet has thus far mentioned; hence it was necessary to add this
   clause, who has walked in my decrees, says he. It is too cold to
   restrict this to ceremonies, as is sometimes done; hence I interpret it
   of edicts or decrees. The metaphor of walking does not require a long
   explanation, as it is very common in Scripture. Hence, to walk in God's
   precepts is nothing else than to form his life and morals according to
   the rule which has been prescribed by God; or, what is the same thing,
   so to conduct oneself, that in desiring to be deemed just a man should
   attempt nothing but what is agreeable to God's precepts. But since the
   observance of the law is difficult, first, because we are not only of a
   frail disposition, but prone to sin; hence the word "serving" is added,
   by which the Prophet commends diligence. Whoever wishes to direct his
   life according to God's precepts should attentively keep them, since
   nothing is more natural than to transgress and fall. He now adds, for
   acting truthfully. Integrity is here denoted by the word truthfulness.
   We gather, then, from this word the fruitful teaching, that the object
   of God's whole law is to conduct ourselves without deceit or fraud, and
   study to assist one another in simplicity, and to conduct ourselves
   with sincerity in every duty. If any one, then, asks the object of the
   law, the Prophet here describes it to us -- the performance of truth;
   and this is said rightly of the second table. But this may be adapted
   to the former table, since the Scripture teaches us that no dissembling
   can be pleasing to God. And we see also what Paul says when he briefly
   defines the end of the law to be charity out of any pure heart, and
   faith unfeigned. (1 Timothy 1:5.) But the word truth in this passage
   is, in my judgment, referred to that sincerity which we must cultivate,
   so that no one should deceive another, nor act fraudulently or
   knowingly, but be really simple and sincere. He adds, he is just, and
   in living he shall live, says the Lord Jehovah. At length he
   pronounces, as we said, that he is just who has faithfully observed
   God's law; then that a recompense is prepared for all the just who thus
   sincerely worship God. Now let us come to the second example.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 18:10-13

   10. If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that
   doeth the like to any one of these things,

   10. Et genuerit filium praedonem, [213] qui sanguinem effundit, et
   facit fractri: [214] fratri (ergo) unum ex his. [215]

   11. And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon
   the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,

   11. Et ipse haec omnia [216] non fecerit, quin potius omnia in montibus
   comederit, et uxorem proximi sui corruperit. [217]

   12. Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath
   not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath
   committed abomination,

   12. Pauperem et egenum oppresserit, praedas rapuerit, pignus non
   reddiderit, et ad idola oculos suos extulerit, abominationem fecerit.

   13. Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then
   live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall
   surely die; his blood shall be upon him.

   13. Cum usura dederit, et incrementum acceperit: et vivet? [218] non
   vivet: abominationes cunctas patravit, moriendo morietur, sanguis ejus
   in eo erit. [219]


   He has oppressed the poor and needy: he had simply said, He has
   oppressed a man; but now to make the greatness of the crime appear, he
   speaks of the poor and needy: for cruelty in oppressing them is less
   tolerable. Whatever the condition of the person whom we treat, with
   injustice, our wickedness is in itself sufficiently worthy of
   condemnation; but when we afflict the wretched, whose condition ought
   to excite our pity, that, inhumanity is, as I have said, far more
   atrocious. Hence this circumstance exaggerates what Ezekiel had
   formerly simply expressed. In the phrase for seizing booty, the word
   for booty is in the plural: in the next phrase he omits the word for
   debtor, because it is sufficiently understood: in the next, he does not
   add "of the house of Israel" to the word "idols;" and in the last
   clause the word "abomination" seems to refer to one kind of grossness
   only: but if any wish to extend its meaning further, I do not, object;
   but since he lately used the word in the plural, I rather take this
   word in its restricted sense. I pass thus rapidly over this second
   example, as I shall over the third, because Ezekiel preserves the same
   sentiments, and repeats almost the same words as he had just used.
   Hitherto he has taught that life is laid up for all the just as the
   reward of their justice: but he now sets before us a degenerate son,
   sprung from a just father, running headlong into all kind of
   wickedness. He says, then, if a man who desires to obey the law beget a
   son of a perverse disposition, who rejects the discipline of his
   father, and at the same time violates the whole law of God, shall he
   surely live? No, says he, he shall die, his blood shall be upon him;
   that is, he cannot escape God's judgment;, because his crimes cry out,
   and are heard. Hence none who turn aside from the right way shall
   remain unpunished: this is the simple meaning of the Prophet. Let us
   now come to the third member.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [213] Or, "a destroyer:" phrph, pheretz, signifies to corrupt, destroy;
   whence, phrtsyn, pher-tzim, means thieves who dig through the walls of
   houses. But that derivation seems to me forced: I rather interpret the
   word as "a violent man," and one who breaks through all rectitude. --
   Calvin.

   [214] So I interpret it: others read "one thing;" but we shall
   afterwards see that the word brother is better. -- Calvin.

   [215] That is, "any one." -- Calvin. Three manuscripts with the Syriac
   version omit the word 'ch, ach, brother; but the Chaldee, and
   Houbigant, with Archbishop Newcome, all agree with Calvin in inserting
   it.

   [216] The precepts of the law, which he had mentioned before. --
   Calvin.

   [217] "Polluted," as we said yesterday. -- Calvin.

   [218] That is, "shall he live?" -- Calvin.

   [219] That is, "shall rest upon himself." -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 18:14-17

   14. Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which
   he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,

   14. Et ecce genuerit filium, et viderit cuncta scelera patris sui quae
   perpetravit, et timuerit, et non fecerit secundum ipsa,

   15. That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his
   eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his
   neighbour's wife,

   15. Super montes non comederit, et oculos suos non extulerit ad idola
   [220] domus Israel [221] uxorem proximi sui non polluerit,

   16. Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither
   hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and
   hath covered the naked with a garment,

   16. Et neminem oppresserit, pignus non pigneraverit, [222] et rapinam
   [223] non rapuerit: panem suum famelico dederit, [224] et nudum
   operuerit vestimento.

   17. That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received
   usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my
   statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall
   surely live.

   17. Ab egeno retraxerit manum suam, foenus et inerementum non
   acceperit, judicia mea fecerit, in decretis meis ambulaverit, ipse non
   morietur in iniquitate patris sui, vivendo vivet.


   In this third example Ezekiel announces, that if a man be born of a
   wicked father, he may nevertheless be pleasing to God, if he be unlike
   his father and thus he refutes the proverb that was so common in Israel
   -- that the father ate the sour grapes, and the children's teeth were
   set on edge. For if the sons were sufferers through the father's eating
   the sour grapes, then the pious who drew their origin from wicked
   despisers of God would be freed from all their sins. Thus Ezekiel would
   have been punished instead of his father, Ahaz, and Josiah instead of
   Manasseh. But here the Prophet bears witness that the good, however
   they may have been born from wicked parents, should receive the reward
   of righteousness no less certainly and faithfully than if they had come
   down from heaven, and if their family had always been without the
   commission of any crime. Since, therefore, God does not punish them for
   their fathers' crimes, it follows that the Israelites uttered this
   taunt not only foolishly, but impiously, saying that their own teeth
   were set on edge, because their fathers had eaten the sour grapes.
   Besides, as there is a difference in the phrase, I shall notice briefly
   what is worthy of remark: if he begat a son who saw all that his father
   had done, and was afraid. Here the Prophet teaches that it needed the
   greatest attention for the son to forsake the example of a bad father.
   For sons are blind to their fathers' vices; and although, when duty is
   set before them, they carelessly despise it, yet they fancy themselves
   held so far by pious reverence, that they dare not condemn their
   fathers. Hence it happens that sons do not acknowledge their fathers'
   crimes, and thus a wicked father corrupts his son willingly. Bad
   discipline, therefore, is added to this, so that it is not surprising
   if the offspring is worse than his ancestors. For this reason the
   Prophet says, if he has seen, that is, if a righteous child has
   observed his father's sins, since sons shut their eyes as much as
   possible to all their fathers' crimes; nay, they embrace their vices
   for the greatest virtues.

   He then adds, if he has feared. It would not be sufficient to take
   notice of this without adding the fear of God. It is true, indeed, that
   many were unlike their parents, through being restrained by shame; for
   when they heard the reproaches of their parents, they were touched with
   ingenuous modesty, so as to be on their guard against such enormities.
   But all these followed the empty shadow of justice; and here the
   serious observance of the law is treated, which cannot flow from
   anything else but, the fear of God, and this, as Scripture says, is the
   beginning of wisdom. (Psalm 111:10; Proverbs 1:7.) A person thus may be
   blameless through his whole life, and yet not touch on any part of
   justice, since righteousness flows from only one principle -- the fear
   of God. He afterwards adds, and has not done according to them. We see,
   therefore, that those who implicate themselves in others' crimes are
   not otherwise deceived, unless they purposely stifle all difference
   between good and evil; for if they had attended to this, they would
   doubtless have been touched with some fear, and thus have governed
   their life according to God's precepts: but scarcely one in a hundred
   thinks of this, and hence every one mingles freely with his neighbors,
   and so all perish together. He afterwards adds, he has not eaten upon
   the mountains, has not raised his eyes to the idols of the house of
   Israel: we have explained all these: and has not oppressed any one, and
   has not received a pledge. We said that this ought not to be explained
   of every pledge; for it was lawful for any one, on giving money, to
   receive a pledge for its return, but not from one who is destitute of
   either garments or the necessary implements of trade: so I pass this
   by. He has not received a prey, has distributed his bread to the hungry
   He adds, what he had not touched on previously, he has withdrawn his
   hand from the poor. This seems to differ from the opinion which we had
   in the sixteenth chapter, (Ezekiel 16:49.) Among the sins of Sodom, the
   Prophet there puts this also, that they withdrew their hand from the
   poor and needy; and surely, when we stretch forth the hand for the sake
   of help, it is a true proof of charity; but if we withdraw the hand, it
   is a proof of cruelty, since we do not deign to aid a brother who ought
   to obtain some favor from us. But we must bear in mind that there are
   two senses in which the hand is either extended or withdrawn. If I
   extend my hand to the poor to supply what is wanting, and to the weak
   to render him aid, this is the duty of charity. If, on the contrary, I
   withdraw my hand, I unjustly turn away from him who implores my
   confidence, and whose misery ought to win for him some favor. But we
   extend the hand when we seize on a neighbor's goods, and violently
   deprive him of them, and despoil the innocent of their rights. On the
   contrary, he who withdraws his hand is humane in sparing his brethren,
   and not enriching himself at their expense, and profiting by their
   oppression. In this sense the Prophet now enumerates withdrawing the
   hand from the poor in the list of virtues, because the poor are subject
   to all kinds of injury. If, therefore, when we see booty already
   prepared for us, and yet we refrain from it, this is a proof of true
   charity. But again, we must remark upon what I treated but briefly
   yesterday, namely, that we must withdraw our hands from the poor,
   because nothing is more easy than to be enticed to make a gain of the
   poor; and wherever occasion and impunity offer themselves, avarice so
   seizes us, that we neither discern nor consider what is right and fair.
   Every one who wishes to preserve his self-restraint, and to subdue his
   affections, ought to attend to this with all his strength and with
   constant struggling: thus the Prophet says, we must withdraw the hand

   Now at last he concludes: he shall not die through his father's
   iniquity; he shall surely live. He does not repeat that this is just,
   yet we must understand it so; but he stops at the immediate effect,
   since God's blessing awaits all the just, as Isaiah says surely there
   is a reward to the just, (Isaiah 3:10;) and the Prophet exclaims as if
   it were believed with difficulty: for, since we see all things
   revolving promiscuously in the world, we directly imagine either that
   God is at rest in heaven, or that chance governs all things here on
   earth. But we must strive against this perverse supposition, and
   determine, as Isaiah teaches, that there is a reward for the just. The
   Prophet now expresses this, while a difficult question arises from the
   passage; for he says that he is just who has kept the law, and so God
   will bestow a recompense upon. him: hence these two things are
   connected together, and the question which I mentioned arises from the
   former clause; for the whole Scriptures teach that no one is just, and
   that none can be justified by the law. But these things are contrary to
   each other; to be just and worthy of reward through keeping the law,
   since none is just, all are transgressors, all devoid of justice, and
   so but one remedy remains -- that of seeking our safety from the
   gratuitous mercy of God. But although, at first sight, this kind of it
   consistency disturbs the rude and partially-exercised commentator, yet
   this solution is easy, since, strictly speaking, justice is the
   observance of the law. If any one asks, then, what justice is, the
   proper definition is, the observance of law. Why so? Because the law,
   as I said yesterday, lays down the solid rule of justice; whoever
   observes it will be esteemed just; and thus justification is properly
   said to be placed in works. But, on the other hand, Scripture
   pronounces what is very true, and entirely confirmed by experience,
   that no one can satisfy the law, and, on account of this defect, we are
   all deprived of justification by works. What I have said may be made
   much clearer by many testimonies of Scripture. Not the hearer of the
   law, says Paul, in the second chapter of the epistle to the Romans, but
   the doer of the law, shall be justified, (Romans 2:13.) There Paul
   speaks naturally, that those are just who conform their whole life to
   the obedience of God's law. So also John, in his canonical epistle: He
   who does righteousness is righteous. (1 John 3:7.) Now, if any one asks
   whether any perfect observer of the law can be found, or one who does
   justice in every respect, the answer is at hand, that we are all by
   nature very far gone from all righteousness, and all our senses and
   affections are enemies which contend against God's law, as Paul
   teaches: The whole soul of man is perverse, and we are not fit to think
   anything of ourselves, and that all our sufficiency is of God, since we
   are slaves of sin. (Romans 8:7; 2 Corinthians 3:5; Romans 11.) But it
   would be superfluous to heap together many testimonies. Let it suffice,
   then, that we are by nature all together rebels against God, so that
   not the slightest particle of good can be found in us. As far as
   concerns the faithful, they aspire indeed to righteousness, but lamely,
   and at a great distance from their aim; they often wander from the way,
   and they often fall, so that they do not satisfy the law, and hence
   require God's pity. Hence we must come to the second kind of
   righteousness, which is improperly so called, namely, that which we
   obtain from Christ. He who does righteousness is righteous. (l John
   3:7.) None of us does it; but Christ, who fulfilled the law, is
   esteemed just before God. Hence it is necessary that we should be
   approved by God through his righteousness; that is, it is imputed to
   us, and we are accepted through his righteousness. Hence justification
   by faith, as it is called, is not properly righteousness; but on
   account of the defect of true righteousness, it is necessary to fly to
   this as to a sacred anchor; and Paul, in the tenth chapter to the
   Romans, explains this briefly and clearly. The righteousness of the
   law, says he, thus speaks: He who has done these things shall live in
   them; but the righteousness of faith says, He who has believed shall be
   just. The Apostle here speaks of a double righteousness -- that of the
   law and of faith: he says, that the righteousness of the law is
   situated in works, since no one is thought just unless he fulfills the
   law. (Romans 10:5-8.) Since all are far distant from this standard,
   another is added and substituted, namely, that we may embrace the
   righteousness of Christ by faith, and so become just, by another
   righteousness without us: for if any one again objects that
   justification by the law is superfluous, I answer, that it profits us
   in two ways; first, because the law brings in those convicted of their
   own unrighteousness to Christ. This, then, is one fruit of the law,
   that we renounce our own righteousness, when our iniquity so discloses
   itself, that it compels us to be silent before God, as we formerly saw.
   A more fruitful result follows; because, when God regenerates his
   elect, he inscribes a law on their hearts and in their inward parts, as
   we have elsewhere seen, and shall see again in the thirty-sixth
   chapter. (Jeremiah 31:33; Ezekiel 36:26, 27.) But the difficulty is not
   yet solved; because the faithful, even if regenerated by God's Spirit,
   endeavor to conform themselves to God's law, yet, through their own
   weakness, never arrive at that point, and so are never righteous: I
   answer, although the righteousness of works is mutilated in the sons of
   God, yet it is acknowledged as perfect, since, by not imputing their
   sins to them, he proves what is his own. Hence it happens, that
   although the faithful fall back, wander, and sometimes fall, yet they
   may be called observers of the law, and walkers in the commandments of
   God, and observers of his righteousness. But this arises from
   gratuitous imputation, and hence also its reward. The works of the
   faithful are not without reward, because they please God, and pleasing
   God, they are sure of remuneration. We see, then, how these things are
   rightly united, that no one obeys the law, and that no one is worthy of
   the fruits of righteousness, and yet that God, of his own liberality,
   acknowledges as just those who aspire to righteousness, and repay them
   with a reward of which they are unworthy. When, therefore, we say that
   the faithful are esteemed just even in their deeds, this is not stated
   as a cause of their salvation, and we must diligently notice that the
   cause of salvation is excluded from this doctrine; for, when we discuss
   the cause, we must look nowhere else but to the mercy of God, and there
   we must stop. But although works tend in no way to the cause of
   justification, yet, when the elect sons of God were justified freely by
   faith, at the same time their works are esteemed righteous by the same
   gratuitous liberality. Thus it still remains true, that faith without
   works justifies, although this needs prudence and a sound
   interpretation; for this proposition, that faith without works
   justifies is true and yet false, according to the different senses
   which it bears. The proposition, that faith without works justifies by
   itself, is false, because faith without works is void. But if the
   clause "without works" is joined with the word "justifies," the
   proposition will be true, since faith cannot justify when it is without
   works, because it is dead, and a mere fiction. He who is born of God is
   just, as John says. (1 John 5:18.) Thus faith can be no more separated
   from works than the sun from his heat yet faith justifies without
   works, because works form no reason for our justification; but faith
   alone reconciles us to God, and causes him to love us, not in
   ourselves, but in his only begotten Son. Now, therefore, that question
   is solved, when the Prophet teaches that life is reposed in the just,
   even if they are born of wicked and unholy parents.

   Lastly, we must notice the word "life," since the word "living" ought
   not to be understood only of life on earth, but looks to eternal life:
   and here some expositors are mistaken: for because they could not free
   themselves from those difficulties which I lately explained, they
   interpreted the words of Moses in a civil sense -- He who has done
   these things shall live in them. But Moses is speaking of life eternal.
   Hence we must hold, not only that a reward is promised in this life to
   the just observers of the law, but that eternal life is also a promised
   reward. Besides, as I have said, since we are all destitute of
   righteousness, so we thought not to hope for any reward, since we are
   all under the law and under the curse, as Paul says: neither is there
   any means of escape, as Paul again says, (Galatians 3:10, 13,) unless
   we fly with complete and abject faith to the mercy of God alone, and to
   the satisfaction by which Christ has reconciled us to his Father. Here
   I shall finish.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you have pointed out to us the true way of

   Ezekiel 18:18-19

   18. As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
   brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people,
   lo, even he in shall die in his iniquity.

   18. Pater ejus quia opprimendo oppressit, et rapuit praedam a fratre,
   et quod non est bonum fecit in medio populi sui: ecce is morietur
   iniquitate sua.

   19. Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father?
   When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept
   all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.

   19. Et dicitis, Quare non portabit filius iniquitatem patris? eo quod
   filius fecit judicium et justitiam, et custodivit omnia statuta mea
   fecitque ea: ideo vivendo vivet.


   He inculcates the same thing more at length, not for the sake of
   ornament so much as to refute that impious saying in which the
   Israelites so perniciously persisted. Since then it was difficult to
   tear from their minds what was so deeply rooted in them, the Prophet
   often exclaims that no one was punished except he deserved it for his
   crimes. He adds in the next verse what seems superfluous and absurd:
   for the Israelites did not contend with God for sparing the innocent:
   but here Ezekiel represents them speaking as if they wished the
   innocent son to be punished equally with the wicked father. But he does
   not mean that they contended about the right, but about the fact, as we
   usually say. For since they were imbued with that error, that
   punishments extended beyond the criminals, on the other hand he
   pronounces that the just were not absolved by their own goodness, if
   they sprang from impious parents, although the people supposed so; for
   they were buried under their own depraved judgment, otherwise they must
   have perceived that justice is never deprived by God of its reward of
   life.

   Ezekiel 18:20

   20. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the
   iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of
   the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the
   wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.

   20. Anima quae peccaverit ipsa morietur: filius non portabit
   iniquitatem patris, et pater non portabit iniquitatem filii: justitia
   justi super eum erit, et impietas impii super eum erit.


   Ezekiel still pursues the sentiment which we have explained, namely,
   that God is a just judge and treats every one according to his conduct;
   as Paul says, As each has lived in the flesh, so God lays up a reward
   for him. (Romans 8:13.) But he more clearly refuted the proverb, that
   the sons should suffer for their fathers' sins. He says, then, that
   each when he comes before God's tribunal should be judged by his works.
   As far then as the general sentiment is concerned, it is in accordance
   with common sense that God should exact punishment of the wicked, and
   that they should receive the just reward of their works. But in the
   next clause, the question arises how the Spirit here pronounces that
   the son should not pay the penalty due to the father, when God so often
   declares that he visits the sins of the fathers upon the children unto
   the third and fourth generation. (Exodus 20:5.) That sentiment often
   occurs: but there are two passages peculiarly remarkable, where it is
   annexed to the second precept of the law, (Deuteronomy 5:9,) and then
   in that remarkable vision which occurred to Moses, God pronounces the
   same thing as before, namely, that the iniquity of the fathers should
   fall upon the sons. (Exodus 34:7.) These passages seem opposed to each
   other, but it will be easy to remove the contradiction by beginning
   with the fall of Adam, since if we do not consider the whole race
   fallen in Adam, we can scarcely extricate ourselves from that
   difficulty which we often feel as causing pungent scruples. But the
   principle of one universal fall in Adam removes all doubts. For when we
   consider the perishing of the whole human race, it is said with truth
   that we perish through another's fault: but it is added at the same
   time, that every one perishes through his own iniquity. If then we
   inquire into the cause of the curse which presses upon all the
   posterity of Adam, it may be said to be partly another's and partly our
   own: another's, through Adam's declension from God, in whose person the
   whole human race was spoiled of righteousness and intelligence, and all
   parts of the soul utterly corrupted. So that every one is lost in
   himself, and if he wishes to contend with God, he must always
   acknowledge that the fountain of the curse flows from himself. For
   before the child was born into the world, it was corrupt, since its
   menial intelligence was buried in darkness, and its will was
   [15]perverse and rebellious against God. As soon as infants are born
   they contract pollution from their father Adam: their reason is
   blinded, their appetites perverted, and their senses entirely vitiated.
   This does not immediately show itself in the young child, but before
   God, who discerns things more acutely than we do, the corruption of our
   whole nature is rightly treated as sin. There is no one who during the
   course of his life does not perceive himself liable to punishment
   through his own works; but original sin is sufficient for the
   condemnation of all men. When men grow up they acquire for themselves
   the new curse of what is called actual sin: so that he who is pure with
   reference to ordinary observation, is guilty before God: hence
   Scripture pronounces us all naturally children of wrath: these are
   Paul's words in the second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians,
   (Ephesians 2:3.) If then we are children of wrath, it follows that we
   are polluted from our birth: this provokes God's anger and renders him
   hostile to us: in this sense David confesses himself conceived in sin.
   (Psalm 51:5.) He does not here accuse either his father or his mother
   so as to extenuate his own wickedness; but, when he abhors the
   greatness of his sin in provoking the wrath of God, he is brought back
   to his infancy, and acknowledges that he was even then guilty before
   God. We see then that David, being reminded of a single sin,
   acknowledges himself a sinner before he was born; and since we are all
   under the curse, it follows that we are all worthy of death. Thus, the
   son properly speaking shall not die through the iniquity of his father,
   but is considered guilty before God through his own fault.

   Now let us proceed further. When God pronounces that the iniquity of
   the father returns into the bosom of the son, we must remember that
   when God involves the son in the same death with the father, he does so
   principally because the son of the impious is destitute of his Spirit:
   whence it happens that he remains in the death in which he was born.
   For if we do not consider any other punishments than those which are
   openly inflicted, a new scruple will again arise from which we cannot
   free ourselves, since this inquiry will always recur, how can the son
   perish by his own fault, if he can produce good fruit and so reconcile
   himself to God? But the first punishment with which God threatens the
   reprobate is that which I have mentioned, namely, that their offspring
   are destitute and deprived of spiritual gifts, so that they sink deeper
   and deeper into destruction: for there are two kinds of punishment, the
   one outward and the other inward, as we express it. God punishes the
   transgressors of his law by either the sword, or by famine, or by
   pestilence, as he everywhere denounces: he is also armed with other
   means of slaughter for executing his wrath, and all these punishments
   are outward and openly apparent. But there is another sort inward and
   hidden, when God takes away the spirit of rectitude from the reprobate,
   when he gives them up to a reprobate mind, subjects them to foul
   desires, and deprives them of all his gifts hence God is said to cause
   the fathers' iniquity to recoil upon the children not only when he
   outwardly punishes the little ones, but because he devotes a cursed
   offspring to eternal destruction, through being destitute of all the
   gifts of the Spirit,. Now we know that God is the fountain of life,
   (Psalm 36:9,) whence it follows that all who are separated from him are
   dead. Now therefore it is evident how God throws the iniquity of the
   fathers upon the children, since when he devotes both father and son to
   eternal destruction, he deprives them of all his gifts, blinds their
   minds, and enslaves all their appetites to the devil. Although we may,
   in one word, embrace the whole matter of the children suffering for the
   fathers when he leaves them to simple nature, as the phrase is, since
   in this way he drowns them in death and destruction. But outward
   punishments also follow afterwards, as when God sends lightning upon
   Sodom many young children perished, and all were absorbed with their
   parents. (Genesis 19:24.) If any one asks by what right they perished,
   first they were sons of Adam and so were accursed, and then God wished
   to punish the Sodomites through their offspring, and he could do so
   deservedly. Concerning the young who thus perished with their fathers,
   it is said, happy is he who dashes thy young ones against the stones or
   the pavement. (Psalm 137:9.) At first sight, indeed, that atrocity
   seems intolerable that a child whose age and judgment is thus tender
   should be so cruelly slain: but as we have already said, all are
   naturally children of wrath. (Ephesians 2:2.) No wonder, therefore,
   that God withdraws his favor from the offspring of the reprobate, even
   if he executes these outward judgments. But how will this now be
   suitable, shall not the son bear the iniquity of the father? for
   Ezekiel here speaks of adults, for he means that the son shall not bear
   his father's iniquity, since he shall receive the reward due to himself
   and sustain his own burden. Should any one wish to strive with God, he
   can be refuted in a single word: for who can boast himself innocent?
   Since therefore all are guilty through their own fault, it follows that
   the son does not bear his father's iniquity, since he has to bear his
   own at the same time. Now that question is solved.

   He now adds, the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and
   the impiety of the impious shall be upon him. We said that this was the
   legal sentence: if God used the same language everywhere, no hope of
   safety would be left to us. For who would be found just if his life
   were judged strictly by the law? But it has already been said, speaking
   accurately, that God rewards those worshipers who observe his law, and
   punish those who transgress it. But since we are all far from perfect
   obedience, Christ is offered to us, from whom we may partake of
   righteousness, and in this way be justified by faith. Meanwhile it is
   true, according to the rule of the law, that the righteousness of the
   righteous shall be upon him, since God will not disappoint any, but
   will really perform what he has promised. But he promises a reward to
   all who observe his law. If any one object that this doctrine is
   useless and superfluous, we have an answer at hand, that it is in many
   ways useful, since, first of all, we acknowledge that God, although he
   owes us nothing, yet willingly binds himself to be reconciled to us;
   and thus his surprising liberality appears. Then we again collect, that
   by transgression we cannot profit or obtain any advantage when God
   offers a reward to all who observe his law. For what can we demand more
   equitable than that God should of his own accord be our debtor? and
   should reward us while he holds us bound to himself, and completely
   subject to him with all our works? And that pattern of Christ must be
   considered, When you have done all that was commanded you, say, We are
   unprofitable servants. (Luke 17:10.) Why so? for we return nothing but
   what God has justly required of us. We gather, then, from this
   sentence, that we cannot expostulate with God, or complain of anything
   while the fault of our own condemnation resides in us for not keeping
   the law. Thirdly, we acknowledge another instance of God's mercy in his
   clothing us in the righteousness of his Son, when he sees us in want of
   a righteousness of our own, and altogether destitute of everything
   good. Fourthly, we said that they are esteemed just who do not satisfy
   the law, since God does not impute their sins to them. Hence the
   righteousness of the law is not without fruit among the faithful; since
   on account of that blessedness which is described in Psalm 32:2, their
   works are taken into account and remunerated by God. So the
   righteousness of the righteous is upon him, just as the impiety of the
   impious is upon him, and it shall recoil upon his own head. It follows
   --

   Ezekiel 18:21-22

   21. But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
   committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and
   right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

   21. Et si impius reversus fuerit ab omni iniquitate sua quam fecit, et
   servaverit omnia edicta mea, et fecerit judicium et justitiam, vivendo
   rivet, non morietur.

   22. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be
   mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall
   live.

   22. Omnes transgressiones quas fecit non venient in memoriam ei, [225]
   sed in justitia sua quam fecit rivet.


   In this sentence God proposes the hope of pardon, and invites and
   exhorts to penitence all the transgressors of his law. But this
   doctrine is specially worthy of notice, that God extends his arms, and
   is prepared to meet and receive all who betake themselves to good
   fruits: for despair hurls us into madness, and then hardens our hearts
   by abandoned obstinacy. Hence it is necessary that God should extend
   his hand towards us, and animate us to penitence. This is the meaning
   of this passage of the Prophets, as soon as the impious is turned away
   from his impiety, God will be at peace with him. Now we see that no
   excuse remains for us if this humane invitation of God does not stir us
   up when he bears witness that he is propitious to us when we heartily
   desire to be reconciled to him. But he here requires serious repentance
   when he says, if the impious has turned away from his impiety, and has
   kept my statutes, and done justice and judgment, he shall live, says
   he. For a sort of half conversion is discerned in many who think that
   in this way they are safe before God, but they are greatly deceived;
   for many mingle virtues with vices, and imagine their guilt blotted
   out, if they can only bring forward something as worthy of praise. But
   this is just as if any one should offer muddy will to his master,
   because he had mixed it not only with dregs, but even with filth: so
   are all the works of those who do not put away all depraved desires,
   and strive to free themselves from all the corruption's of the flesh.
   Thus what is here taught is worthy of notice, namely, that the
   beginning of conversion is, when any one renounces himself and his own
   lusts. But it is necessary to add another part of duty, that when any
   one bids farewell to his vices, he must devote himself obediently to
   God. The Prophet joins the two together, therefore, since one cannot be
   separated from the other. Hence the Spirit here shortly defines what
   true and legitimate conversion is. He says, that when any one is thus
   converted, that his life is prepared for God, since God will forget all
   his sins. This is a confirmation of the doctrine; for God cannot be
   entreated as long as he imputes our sins to us: hence, that we may
   determine him to be propitious to us, he promises, as soon as we
   repent, that all our sins shall be buried, and no longer come into
   remembrance. But this is the incomparable goodness of God, since he
   deigns to forget all our sins as soon as he sees us earnestly desirous
   of returning to him. On the whole, Ezekiel pronounces that all the
   penitent pass at once from death to life, since God blots out all their
   transgressions by voluntary oblivion. It afterwards follows --

   Ezekiel 18:23

   23. Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the
   Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?

   23. An cupio cupiendo mortem impii, dicit Dominator Iehovah? An non ut
   convertatur a viis suis, et vivat?


   He confirms the same sentiment in other words, that God desires nothing
   more earnestly than that those who were perishing and rushing to
   destruction should return into the way of safety. And for this reason
   not only is the Gospel spread abroad in the world, but God wished to
   bear witness through all ages how inclined he is to pity. For although
   the heathen were destitute of the law and the prophets, yet they were
   always endued with some taste of this doctrine. Truly enough they were
   suffocated by many errors: but we shall always find that they were
   induced by a secret impulse to seek for pardon, because this sense was
   in some way born with them, that God is to be appeased by all who seek
   him. Besides, God bore witness to it more clearly in the law and the
   prophets. In the Gospel we hear how familiarly he addresses us when he
   promises us pardon. (Luke 1:78.) And this is the knowledge of
   salvation, to embrace his mercy which he offers us in Christ. It
   follows, then, that what the Prophet now says is very true, that God
   wills not the death of a sinner, because he meets him of his own
   accord, and is not only prepared to receive all who fly to his pity,
   but he calls them towards him with a loud voice, when he sees how they
   are alienated from all hope of safety. But the manner must be noticed
   in which God wishes all to be saved, namely, when they turn themselves
   from their ways. God thus does not so wish all men to be saved as to
   renounce the difference between good and evil; but repentance, as we
   have said, must precede pardon. How, then, does God wish all men to be
   saved? By the Spirit's condemning the world of sin, of righteousness,
   and of judgment at this day, by the Gospel, as he did formerly by the
   law and the prophets. (John 16:8.) God makes manifest to mankind their
   great misery, that they may betake themselves to him: he wounds that he
   may cure, and slays that he may give life. We hold, then, that; God
   wills not the death of a sinner, since he calls all equally to
   repentance, and promises himself prepared to receive them if they only
   seriously repent. If any one should object -- then there is no election
   of God, by which he has predestinated a fixed number to salvation, the
   answer is at hand: the Prophet does not here speak of God's secret
   counsel, but only recalls miserable men from despair, that they may
   apprehend the hope of pardon, and repent and embrace the offered
   salvation. If any one again objects -- this is making God act with
   duplicity, the answer is ready, that God always wishes the same thing,
   though by different ways, and in a manner inscrutable to us. Although,
   therefore, God's will is simple, yet great variety is involved in it,
   as far as our senses are concerned. Besides, it is not surprising that
   our eyes should be blinded by intense light, so that we cannot
   certainly judge how God wishes all to be saved, and yet has devoted all
   the reprobate to eternal destruction, and wishes them to perish. While
   we look now through a glass darkly, we should be content with the
   measure of our own intelligence. (1 Corinthians 13:12.) When we shall
   be like God, and see him face to face, then what is now obscure will
   then become plain. But since captious men torture this and similar
   passages, it will be needful to refute them shortly, since it can be
   done without trouble.

   God is said not to wish the death of a sinner. How so? since he wishes
   all to be converted. Now we must see how God wishes all to be
   converted; for repentance is surely his peculiar gift: as it is his
   office to create men, so it is his province to renew them, and restore
   his image within them. For this reason we are said to be his
   workmanship, that is, his fashioning. (Ephesians 2:10.) Since,
   therefore, repentance is a kind of second creation, it follows that it
   is not in man's power; and if it is equally in God's power to convert
   men as well as to create them, it follows that the reprobate are not
   converted, because God does not wish their conversion; for if he wished
   it he could do it: and hence it appears that he does not wish it. But
   again they argue foolishly, since God does not wish all to be
   converted, he is himself deceptive, and nothing can be certainly stated
   concerning his paternal benevolence. But this knot is easily untied;
   for he does not leave us in suspense when he says, that he wishes all
   to be saved. Why so? for if no one repents without finding God
   propitious, then this sentence is filled up. But we must remark that
   God puts on a twofold character: for he here wishes to be taken at his
   word. As I have already said, the Prophet does not here dispute with
   subtlety about his incomprehensible plans, but wishes to keep our
   attention close to God's word. Now, what are the contents of this word?
   The law, the prophets, and the gospel. Now all are called to
   repentance, and the hope of salvation is promised them when they
   repent. this is true, since God rejects no returning sinner: he pardons
   all without exception: meanwhile, this will of God which he sets forth
   in his word does not prevent him from decreeing before the world was
   created what he would do with every individual: and as I have now said,
   the Prophet only shows here, that when we have been converted we need
   not doubt that God immediately meets us and shows himself propitious.
   The remainder tomorrow.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since we are all lost in ourselves, that we may
   desire to obtain life where it is laid up for us, and where you do
   manifest it, namely, in thy Son: and grant that we may so embrace the
   grace which has been exhibited to us in the sacrifice of his death,
   that we may be regenerated by his Spirit; and thus being born again,
   may we devote ourselves wholly to thee, and so glorify thy name in this
   world, that we may at length be partakers of that glory which the same,
   your only-begotten Son, has acquired for us. -- Amen.

   Ezekiel 18:24

   24. But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and
   committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that
   the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath
   done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed,
   and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.

   24. Et si aversus fuerit justus, a justitia sua, et fecerit
   iniquitatem, secundum omnes abominationes quas facit impius fecerit, an
   vivet? Omnes justitia, ejus quas fecit non venient in recordationem:
   [226] in transgressione qua transgressus est, et in scelere, quo
   scelerate egit, in ipsis morietur.


   As in the last lecture the Prophet offered to sinners a sure hope of
   pardon if they heartily repented, and promised that God would be
   propitious to them as soon as they shall seek reconciliation with him:
   so now, on the other hand, he pronounces, if the just shall decline
   from his justice, whatever he has hitherto done, shall not come into
   the account before God. He urged sinners to repentance when he assured
   them that God was prepared to pardon them: but he now frightens those
   who profess for the occasion to be pure and sincere worshipers of God,
   if they fall back in the midst of their course: as Paul says, Let him
   who stands take heed lest he fall. (1 Corinthians 10:12.) Besides, we
   gather from this passage, as Christ teaches, that those only are happy
   who persevere, (Matthew 24:13;) since a temporary righteousness will
   never profit those apostates who afterwards turn aside from God. We
   see, then, how these two clauses unite together, namely, that God
   invites all who are in danger of perdition with extended arms, and
   promises them salvation if they heartily return to him. Again, that he
   may restrain within the bounds of duty those who have made some
   progress, and correct their sloth and stir up their anxiety, he
   threatens, that unless they pursue the course of a holy and pious life
   to the end, their former righteousness will not profit them. But here a
   question arises, Can a truly just person deflect from the right way?
   for he who is begotten of God is so free from the tyranny of sin that
   he devotes himself wholly to righteousness: and then if any do turn
   aside, they prove that they were always strangers to God. If they had
   been of us, says John, they would never have gone out from us. (1 John
   2:19.) And regeneration is an incorruptible seed: so we must determine
   that the faithful who are truly regenerate never fall away from
   righteousness, but are retained by God's unconquered power: for God's
   calling in the elect is without repentance. (Romans 11:29.) Hence he
   continues the course of his grace even to the end. Nor are they to be
   listened to, who, in contradiction to Scripture, teach that faith is
   extinct in the elect, when, through its barrenness, they bring forth no
   fruit. In what sense, then, does Ezekiel mean that the just fall away?
   That question is easily answered, since he is not here treating of the
   living root of justice, but of the outward form or appearance, as we
   commonly say. Paul reminds us that God knows us, but adds, that this
   seal remains. (2 Timothy 2:19.) God therefore claims to himself alone
   the difference between the elect and the reprobate, since many seem to
   be members of his Church who are only outwardly such. And that passage
   of Augustine is true, that there are many wolves within, and many sheep
   without. [227] For before God demonstrates his election, the sheep
   wander, and seem altogether strangers to the hope of salvation.
   Meanwhile many hypocrites make use of the name of God, and openly boast
   themselves pre-eminent in the Church, but inwardly they are wolves. But
   because it often happens that some make the greatest show of piety and
   justice, the Prophet very properly says, that if such fall away, they
   cannot boast of their former righteousness before God, since its
   remembrance will be bloated out.

   In fine, we see that the word righteousness is referred to our senses,
   and not to God's hidden judgment; so that the Prophet does not teach
   anything but what we perceive daily: for those who seem to excel others
   desert their calling, shake off every yoke, and cast away the fear of
   God, and sometimes rush on with diabolical fury. When this result
   occurs we hear what the Spirit pronounces by the mouth of the Prophet,
   that none of their righteousness shall be taken into account. But
   weight is added to his words when he says, if you have turned aside
   from righteousness, and done according to all the abominations of the
   impious, (or wicked,) shall he live? For the Prophet separates those
   who desert God and rush into every wickedness from those who fall
   through infirmity or want of thought, and from those also who would
   fall headlong into ruin, unless God preserved them, yet do not utterly
   cast off his fear, and the desire of living piously and righteously.
   For example: every one is occasionally off his guard; and hence, in
   numberless ways, we offend God through error: and hence David exclaims,
   Who can understand his faults? (Psalm 19:12.) We fall of our own
   accord, since we are often conquered by temptations, even when our
   consciences accuse us; so that, although sanctified, we decline from
   the path of uprightness through ignorance, and depart from duty through
   infirmity. But what is far worse, the saints sometimes rush headlong,
   as though utterly desperate. For the example of David shows that the
   elect, although regenerated by God's Spirit, not only sin to a small
   extent, but, as I have said, plunge into the very lowest abyss. David
   became a perfidious homicide, and a traitor to the army of God; then
   that wretched king fell into a series of crimes: yet he failed in only
   one thing, and showed that God's grace was only suffocated within him,
   and not altogether extinguished. For as soon as Nathan reproves him, he
   confesses that he had sinned, and is prepared to undergo any punishment
   which God may inflict. Since, therefore, the saints sometimes fall, the
   Prophet here stretches forth his hand, lest they should despair, and
   bears witness that God does not reject them unless they turn aside from
   their righteousness and commit all the abominations which the impious
   do. By these words, as we see, he expresses a complete revolt, and he
   so mitigates the severity of the sentence, lest the minds of those who
   had only partially relapsed should despond. Now we see the meaning of
   this language: If he has done according to all the abominations of the
   wicked, shall he live? says he; all the righteousness which he has done
   shall not be remembered, because he shall perish. Here the Prophet
   shows that: a mere temporary righteousness will not profit us unless we
   persevere unto the end in the fear of God.

   Here again the contrast is worthy of notice, because it enables us to
   refute a fiction which is current in the schools of the papacy. They
   say that guilt is remitted by God, but the punishment is retained. Now
   what says our Prophet? If the impious turn away from his impiety, I
   will no longer remember any of his iniquities. Here the papists thrust
   for-ward the foolish distinction, that God does not remember them as to
   their guilt, but he does as to their punishment. But what follows a
   little afterwards? If the just turn away from his justice, his justice
   shall not be taken into account. But if they do not come into the
   account as to merit, and yet do as to reward, what is the meaning of
   the passage? how will the Prophet's meaning stand? But it is necessary
   thus to receive what the Prophet says; because, if the distinction of
   guilt and punishment avails, that of merit and reward will avail also.
   Hence it will follow, that as to merit God forgets all acts of
   righteousness; but as far as reward is concerned, they are remembered
   since they are not abolished. Since, then, it is sufficiently clear
   that the righteousness of the backslider is not taken into account, so
   as to lead him to hope for reward, it follows, on the other hand, that
   his sins are abolished not only as to guilt, but also as to punishment.
   It now follows --

   Ezekiel 18:25

   25. Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of
   Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?

   25. Et dixistis, Non rectificata est via Domini: audite agedum domus
   Israel, Via mea non rectificabitur? [228] An non viae vestrae non sunt
   rectae? [229]


   The Prophet here shows that those who used the vulgar taunt -- that the
   children's teeth were set on edge, because their fathers had eaten sour
   grapes -- had broken away from all restraint; and nothing further
   remained to hinder them from uttering their blasphemies arrogantly
   against God: but their insolence and madness now increases when they
   say that God's ways are not equal. And this is discerned in almost all
   hypocrites: at first they indirectly find fault with God, and yet
   pretend not to do so: while they endeavor to excuse themselves, they
   accuse him of injustice, and of too much rigor, yet they do not openly
   break out into such impiety as to dare to charge God with this crime:
   but after they profit nothing by their double dealing, the devil
   inflames them to such a pitch of boldness that they hesitate not openly
   to condemn God himself. The Prophet refers to this when he says that
   this disgraceful saying was bandied about among the Israelites, that
   the ways of the Lord are unequal. Lest, therefore, we should happen to
   resist God, and to contend with him, let us learn to restrain our
   rashness in good time before he becomes enraged against us. As soon as
   any thoughts spring up, tending to reflect upon the character of the
   Almighty, let us quickly restrain them; for if we do not, they will
   entangle us by degrees, and draw us into the extremity of folly, and
   then no sense of either religion or shame will deter us from open
   rebellion against God. But it is worth while noticing the source of
   this impiety: first of all, when we think of men's relation to God,
   they should be ashamed to rise up against their Maker: for the clay
   does not cry out against the potter; and we are a hundredfold more
   insignificant than the clay, with reference to God. (Isaiah 45:9;
   Romans 9:20, 21.)

   But let us come to another consideration. We know with how much greater
   clearness the angels are able reverently to adore God's wisdom than the
   human race. What, therefore, must we do? Not only is God's wisdom
   incomprehensible, but his justice is the most perfect rule of all
   justice. Now, if we desire to pass opinions upon God's works according
   to our own perceptions, and to weigh them in our balance, what else are
   we doing but passing judgment upon him? But we must remember that
   passage of Isaiah, As I live, says Jehovah, every knee shall bend
   before me, and every tongue shall swear by me. (Isaiah 45:23.) Paul,
   too, is a faithful interpreter of this sentiment, when he forbids
   mortals to judge arrogantly, by saying, we shall all stand before the
   judgment-seat of Christ (Romans 14:10, 11.) Since, then, it will be
   necessary for us to render an account before Christ heavenly tribunal,
   we must now acquiesce in God's judgments; because, when at length our
   license has entirely spent itself, and our petulance has had its full
   scope, God will be our judge. We see, therefore, that when men claim to
   themselves the right of daring to pronounce their own opinions on God's
   work, they first subject his wisdom to their own fictions, and then
   feel too much hostility and contempt towards his justice. But this one
   thing ought to be sufficient, that men are too forgetful of their own
   condition when they dare to open their mouth against their Maker, not
   only to murmur, but openly to condemn him, as if they were his
   superiors. Let us then obey the contrary rule; let us with sobriety and
   modesty learn to look upon those works of God which are unknown to us,
   and to concede to him the praise of supreme wisdom, although his
   counsels seem at first sight contradictory. Hosea also briefly reminds
   us of this. For after God had promised that he would be merciful to the
   people, and when he had discoursed on the slaughter which he had
   inflicted, he says, that at length he would heal them: he adds, Who is
   wise, and he shall understand these things? (Hosea 14:9;) because many
   might have thought it inconsistent to remit so many sins for the
   abandoned people; and others might object that what they heard was
   utterly incredible and absurd, since God suffered the people to be
   utterly torn to pieces, so that no hope remained. For this reason,
   then, the Prophet exclaims, that we have need of rare and singular
   prudence to comprehend and embrace that teaching. When he says, "who is
   wise?" it signifies that the number is but small of those who will wait
   patiently till God really fulfills his promises. Yet he adds, because
   the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them; but
   the impious shall stumble and perish. When he speaks here of the ways
   of the Lord, he does not mean only precepts, though the Scriptures
   often take the word in this sense; but he means the whole order of
   government which God upholds, and all the judgments which he exercises.
   He says, therefore, that all the ways of the Lord are right, and the
   just shall walk in them, since the just will give God the glory calmly,
   and with the proper docility; and when they are agitated by various
   doubts, and through their infirmity are ever in a ferment through the
   force of many temptations, yet they will always repose on the
   providence of God, and briefly determine, by cutting off every occasion
   for long and perplexing and thorny questions, that God is just. Thus
   the just walk in the ways of the Lord, because they submit to all his
   works.

   He says also, that the impious stumble and fall; for as soon as they
   begin to think that God does not act rightly or prudently, they are
   rebellious, and are carried away by blind impulse, and their pride at
   length hurries them headlong into madness. Thus they stumble in the
   ways of the Lord: because, as we see in this passage, they vomit forth
   their blasphemies against God. Hence we ought, to be influenced by this
   course of action, namely, adoring with humility the counsel of God,
   although to us incomprehensible, and attributing the praise of justice
   to all his works, though in our opinion they may not correspond, or be
   consistent with each other. -- This, then, is the sum of the whole.
   Although the Prophet speaks of the penalties which God inflicts on the
   reprobate, and of the reward which he has laid up for the just, yet we
   ought to ascend still higher; and if God in his deeds seems to pervert
   the whole course of justice, yet we should always be sustained by this
   bridle -- he is just; and if his deeds are disapproved by us, it arises
   from our error and ignorance. For example, we not only contend with God
   when he seems not to repay us a just reward for our good works, or when
   he seems too severe towards us; but when his eternal election is
   discussed, we immediately roar out, because we cannot penetrate to so
   great a height: the pious, indeed, are not altogether free from
   perplexing doubts which disturb them, but they restrain themselves
   directly as I have said. But some restive men break out in this way, --
   I do not comprehend -- I do not understand: hence God is unjust. We see
   how many blusterers in the present day betray their desperate
   impudence, whence this teaching should recur to our minds -- the ways
   of God are right. But since we do not perceive how it is so, another
   clause is added, that our ways are not right; that is, that all our
   senses are defective, and our intellect blinded, and that we are all so
   corrupt that our judgment is perverted. If, therefore, we conclude with
   the Prophet, that our ways are not right, the glory of God's justice
   will remain untarnished and entire. Afterwards he adds --

   Ezekiel 18:26-28

   26. When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and
   committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath
   done shall he die.

   26. Si aversus fuerit justus a justitia sua, et fecerit iniquitatem et
   mortuus fuerit in illis, [230] in iniquitate sua quam patravit
   morietur.

   27. Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he
   hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save
   his soul alive.

   27. Et si conversus fuerit sceleratus a sceleribus suis quae fecit, et
   fecerit judicium et justitiam, ipse animam suam vivificabit. [231]

   28. Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his
   transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall
   not die.

   28. Et viderit, et conversus fuerit ab omnibus sceleribus quae
   patravit, vivendo vivet, non morietur.


   The Prophet repeats what we formerly saw, namely, that the state of the
   case turned upon this, Whether the people had any cause of complaint
   when God absolves those who repent, and condemns the just who desert
   the course of a pious and holy life? Now, we must always return to this
   cardinal point, that God rewards every one according to his works,
   since he offers mercy to all the lost, and demands nothing else but a
   sincere and hearty return to him. Since, then, God treats the impious
   with such clemency, and is so ready to pardon them, what is the reason
   why men contend with him? If the just should retrace his steps, and
   after having shown some signs of the fear of God, throw off all
   obedience, who can object when God punishes him, and blots out the
   remembrance of his former righteousness? God, therefore, determines the
   result fairly in each case. We have explained how the phrase, the just
   should turn aside from their righteousness, ought to be understood, not
   that the elect ever utterly fall away, as many think their faith is
   extinguished, and every root of piety also in the sons of God; that is
   too absurd, because, as I have said, the gift of regeneration has
   perseverance always annexed to it: but here that righteousness which
   mankind recognize is intended. But we know how frequently it happens
   that what seemed entirely pure and perfect is deficient. Now, God
   pronounces that he would punish all who fall away from him, and would
   be accessible and propitious to miserable sinners who desire to be
   reconciled to him; and he repeats again, if the wicked have seen and
   turned away from his wickedness. We must mark this phrase, for it shows
   that thinking rightly is the commencement of repentance; because,
   though the reprobate knowingly and willingly transgress God's law, it
   is certain that they labor under blindness and madness, so that the
   Scripture does not call them foolish and beside themselves in vain. He
   does not extenuate their faults, as if they sinned ignorantly; but he
   means that they were so blinded by diabolical madness as to think of
   nothing; for surely horror would immediately possess their minds if
   they only perceived God to be their adversary, and themselves to be
   making war with him. For this reason, therefore, when the Prophet
   describes to us the conversion of the wicked, he says, if he has seen;
   that is, if at length he has returned to a sound mind, and collected
   his senses, so that he may not rush on madly, as he has been accustomed
   to do, but may look upon both God and himself. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 18:29

   29. Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O
   house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?

   29. Et dixerunt domus Israel, [232] non rectificata est [233] via
   Domini: An viae meae non rectae sunt, domus Israel? An non viae vestrae
   non rectae sunt?


   Here God briefly shows how furious those are who dare to rebel against
   him even when his justice is manifest: for what can be desired more
   justly than that God should punish all the transgressors of his law?
   and also, if sinners repent, that he should be prepared to pardon them?
   But if it seems hard that punishment should overtake the just if they
   fall away, common sense dictates that no virtue can be approved without
   perseverance. Since, therefore, it is very clear throughout this course
   of action, that God is just and without blame, what madness it is to
   vomit forth blasphemies against him, as if his ways were unjust! But
   God shows in one word, as I have mentioned, that the Israelites had no
   excuse for such dishonesty and impudence; and he repeats what he had
   formerly said, that men would always be guilty of rashness in
   insolently cursing God when their own ways are found oblique and
   perverse: but God will sufficiently vindicate his own ways. But we must
   add what follows --

   Ezekiel 18:30

   30. Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according
   to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all
   your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.

   30. Propterea quemque [234] secundum vias ejus judicabo in vobis, [235]
   domus Israel, dicit Dominator Iehovah. Convertimini et redire vos
   facite [236] ab omnibus sceleribus vestris, et non erit vobis in
   laqueum iniquitas.


   Here God precisely points out that he would discharge the office of
   judge, and then he reduces the Israelites to order, and refutes their
   audacity: for, as long as men do not feel God's judgments hanging over
   them, and are not held completely in cheek, they grow restive in their
   petulance. We see how ferocious and wanton the reprobate are, because
   they are not held in by the fear of punishment, nor do they dread the
   judgments of God. Hence that he may take away every vestige of excuse,
   he says, I will be your judge: plead now; but I will decide your
   strives in one word, since each of you shall be judged by my will. It
   is certain, then, that God here asserts for himself the praise of
   justice and rectitude; but at the same time he brings forward his own
   authority, that he may strike terror into those who thus madly dare to
   oppose his sway, and call upon him to render an account. Now,
   therefore, we understand in what sense he says that he will judge them
   all according to their ways; that is, although you do not confess
   yourselves worthy of destruction, it is sufficient that I, as the
   lawful judge, pronounce you so. I will judge you justly, therefore,
   since I pronounce sentence according to your ways and to my supreme
   power, that all your complaints and murmurs may cease. He afterwards
   exhorts them to repentance, and signifies that they have no other
   remedy than being dissatisfied with their sins, and deprecating his
   wrath. Hence we collect that men rebel so extravagantly against God,
   while they wander away from themselves, since, if they descended within
   themselves, and sincerely examined their whole life, they would be
   instantly humbled before God; hence that thought should stimulate them
   to repentance: but because their conscience is stupid, and they are
   willingly brutish, they boldly blaspheme God. On the other hand, God
   now offers a remedy on their repentance and return from their
   wickedness. The word being converted, or return, refers to the
   renovation of the mind and heart: for this also is the beginning of
   repentance, that we should be inwardly renewed in mind, as Paul says,
   and so be made new men. (Ephesians 4:22, 23.) And this deserves notice,
   because many, when repentance is spoken of, fix their eyes only on the
   outward fruits of penitence. But we must begin at the root, as the
   Prophet teaches, by saying be you converted. But he afterwards adds,
   vhsyvv, veheshibu, and return. This second word ought to be referred to
   the fruits of penitence; for as interior conversion comes first in
   order, when we leave off our peculiar vices, and renounce flesh and
   blood, the fruits and proofs of repentance thought to follow, as John
   said, Bring forth fruits as witnesses to your repentance. (Matthew 3:8;
   Luke 3:8.) We see, then, that the Prophet begins with purity of heart,
   and then comes to hands, as the Scripture elsewhere says, flint is, to
   outward works. He says, from all your iniquities or crimes, to show
   that a partial repentance is not approved by God. It is true, indeed,
   that even those who strive with all their might to act rightly, do not
   succeed in discharging their duty without many faults remaining; but we
   are not treating here of perfection, but only of sincere affection and
   serious endeavors. Let us then only strive seriously to return into the
   way, and to humble ourselves calmly and sincerely: this is the
   integrity which the Prophet now requires.

   Grant, Almighty God, since nothing is more frail than we are, and even

   Grant, I say, that being propped up by your unconquered strength, we

   perseveringly make war against all temptations, that we may at length
   enjoy in heaven the fruit of our victory, through Christ our Lord. --

   31. Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
   transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will
   ye die, O house of Israel?

   31. Projicite a vobis omnes iniquitates in quibus inique egistis: et
   facite vobis cor novum, et spiritum novum: et quare moriemini domus
   Israel?


   Ezekiel again exhorts the people to leave off complaining, and to
   acknowledge that there is no remedy for their evils but to be
   reconciled to God. But that cannot be done unless they repent. For God
   was not hostile to them in vain; nor did he, after the manner of men,
   persecute with hatred the innocent, and those who did not deserve it.
   Hence it was necessary to seek God's pardon suppliantly. Ezekiel had
   already touched upon this, but he now confirms it more at length. He
   says, therefore, that they not only lost their labor, but increased the
   flame of God's wrath by striving with him, and complaining that they
   were unworthily treated by him: cast forth, says he, your iniquities
   from you. He shows that the cause of all evils is within themselves: so
   that they have no excuse. But he afterwards expresses more clearly that
   they were entirely imbued with contempt of God, impiety, and depraved
   desires. For if he had only spoken of outward wickedness, the reproof
   would have been partial, and therefore lighter; but after he commanded
   them to bid farewell to their sins, he adds, make yourselves a new
   heart and a new spirit. He requires, therefore, from them a thorough
   renewal, so that they should not only conform their life to the rule of
   the law, but should fear God sincerely, since no one can produce good
   fruit but from a living root. Outward works, then, are the fruits of
   repentance, which must spring from some root; and this is the inward
   affection of the heart. What is added is to refute their impiety, for
   they wished their destruction to be ascribed to God. Here God takes up
   the character of a mourner, saying, Why will ye die, O house of Israel?
   while the next verse confirms this more clearly.

   Ezekiel 18:32

   32. For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, says the
   Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

   32. Quia non oblector morte morientis, dicit Dominator Iehovah:
   convertimini itaque, et vivite.


   We see, therefore, how God throws off that false reproach from himself
   with which the children of Israel taunted him, saying, that they
   perished by his immoderate rigor, and could find no reason for his
   severity against them. He announces, on the other hand, that the cause
   of death rested with themselves; and then he points out the remedy,
   that they should amend their life, not only in outward appearance, but
   in sincerity of heart: and at the same time he testifies of his
   willingness to be entreated; nay, he meets them of his own accord, if
   they only repent heartily and unfeignedly. We now understand the
   Prophet's meaning. We said, that we are admonished in this way, that if
   we desire to return to God we must begin at the beginning, namely,
   renewal of the heart and spirit; because, as Jeremiah says, he looks
   for truth and integrity, and does not value outward disguises.
   (Jeremiah 5:3.) But it may seem absurd for God to exhort the Israelites
   to form their hearts anew: and men badly trained in the Scriptures
   erect their crests under the pretense of this passage, as if it were in
   the power of man's free will to convert himself. They exclaim,
   therefore, either that God here exhorts his people deceitfully, or else
   that when alienated from him we can by our own movement repent, and
   return into the way. But the whole Scripture openly refutes this. It is
   not in vain that the saints so often pray that God would renew them;
   (Psalm 51:12, and very often elsewhere;) for it would be a feigned and
   a lying prayer, if newness of heart were not his gift. If any one
   requests of God what he is persuaded that he has already, and by his
   own inherent virtue, does he not trifle with God? But nothing occurs
   more frequently than this mode of entreaty. Since therefore, the saints
   pray to God to renew them, they doubtless confess that to be his
   peculiar gift; and unless he moves his hand, they have no strength
   remaining, so that they can never rise from the ground. Besides, in
   many passages God claims the renewal of the heart as peculiar to
   himself. We noticed that remarkable passage in the eleventh chapter of
   this Prophet, (Ezekiel 11:19,) he will repeat the same in the
   thirty-sixth chapter, (Ezekiel 36:26, 27;) and we know what Jeremiah
   says in his thirty-first chapter, (Jeremiah 31:33.) But Scripture is
   everywhere full of testimonies of this kind, so that it would be
   superfluous to heap together many passages; nay, if any one denies that
   regeneration is a gift of the Holy Spirit, he will tear up by the roots
   all the principles of piety. We have said that regeneration is like
   another creation; and if we compare it with the first creation, it far
   surpasses it. For it is much better for us to be made children of God,
   and reformed after his image within us, than to be created mortal: for
   we are born children of wrath, corrupt and degenerate; (Ephesians 2:3;)
   since all integrity was lost when God's image was removed. We see,
   then, the nature of our first creation; but when God re-fashions us, we
   are not only born sons of Adam, but we are the brothers of angels, and
   members of Christ; and this our second life consists in rectitude,
   justice, and the light of true intelligence.

   We now see that if it had been in man's free will to convert himself,
   much more would be ascribed to him than to God, because, as we have
   said, it was much more valuable to be created sons of God than of Adam.
   It ought, then, to be beyond all controversy with the pious that men
   cannot rise again when they are fallen, and turn of themselves when
   alienated from God; but this is the peculiar gift of the Holy Spirit.
   And the sophists, who in all ways endeavor to obscure God's grace,
   confess that half the act of conversion is in the power of the Holy
   Spirit: for they do not say that we are simply and totally converted by
   the motion of our own free will, but they imagine a concurrence of
   grace with free will, and of free will with grace. Thus they foolishly
   represent us as cooperating with God: they confess, indeed, that God's
   grace goes before and follows; and they seem to themselves very liberal
   towards God when they acknowledge this twofold grace in man's
   conversion. But God is not content with that partition, since he is
   deprived of half his right: for he does not say that he would assist
   men to renew themselves and to repent; but he attributes the work to
   himself entirely: I will give you a new heart and a new spirit.
   (Ezekiel 36:26.) If it is his to give, it follows that the slightest
   portion of it cannot be transferred to man without diminishing
   something from his right. But they object that the following precept is
   not in vain, that men should make for themselves a new heart. Now their
   deception arises through ignorance, from their judging of the powers of
   men by the commands of God; but the inference is incorrect, as we have
   said elsewhere: for when God teaches what is right, he does not think
   of what we are able to do, but only shows us what we ought to do. When,
   therefore, the power of our free will is estimated by the precepts of
   God, we make a great mistake, because God exacts from us the strict
   discharge of our duty, just as if our power of obedience was not
   defective. We are not absolved from our obligation because we cannot
   pay it; for God holds us bound to himself, although we are in every way
   deficient.

   They object again, God then deludes men when he says, make yourselves a
   new heart. I answer, we must always consider to what purpose God thus
   speaks, namely, that men convicted of sin may cease to throw the blame
   on any one else, as they often endeavor to do; for nothing is more
   natural than to transfer the cause of our condemnation away from
   ourselves, that we may seem just, and God appear unjust. Since, then,
   such depravity reigns among men, hence the Holy Spirit demands from us
   what all acknowledge they ought to pay: and if we do not pay it, still
   we are bound to do so, and thus all strife and complaint should cease.
   Thus, as it concerns the elect, when God shows them their duty, and
   they acknowledge that they cannot discharge it, they fly to the aid of
   the Holy Spirit, so that the outward exhortation becomes a kind of
   instrument which God uses to confer the grace of his Spirit. For
   although he gratuitously goes before us, and does not need outward
   channels, yet he desires exhortations to be useful to this end. Since,
   therefore, this doctrine stirs up the elect to deliver themselves up to
   be ruled by the Holy Spirit, we see how it becomes fruitful to us.
   Whence it follows, that God does not delude or deceive us when he
   exhorts each of us to form his heart and his spirit afresh. In fine,
   Ezekiel wished by these words to show that pardon would be prepared for
   the Israelites if they seriously repented, and showed its effects
   through their whole life. That was most true, because the elect did not
   embrace this doctrine in vain, when at the same time God worked in them
   by his Spirit, and so turned them to himself. But the reprobate, though
   they do not cease to murmur, yet they are rendered ashamed, since all
   excuse has been removed, and they must perish through their own fault,
   since they willingly remained in their wickedness, and by
   self-indulgence they cherished the old man within themselves, -- a
   fountain of all injustice. Whenever such passages occur, let us
   remember that celebrated prayer of Augustine: grant us what you
   command, and command what you wish, (Epist. 24;) for otherwise, if God
   should lay upon us the slightest burden, we should be unable to bear
   it. Besides, our strength will be sufficient to fulfill his
   requirements, if only he supply it, and we are not so foolish as to
   think anything comprehended in his precepts which he has not granted to
   us; because, as I have said before, nothing is more perverse than to
   measure the angelic righteousness of the law by our strength. By the
   word heart, I understand him to mean the seat of all the affections;
   and by spirit, the intellectual part of the soul. The heart is often
   taken for the reason and intelligence; but when these two words are
   joined together, the spirit relates to the mind, and so it is the
   intellectual faculty of the soul; but the heart is taken for the will,
   or the seat of all the affections. Hence we see how very corrupt the
   Israelites were, since they could not be otherwise reconciled to God,
   unless by being renewed in both heart and mind. Hence also we my gather
   the general doctrine, that nothing in us is sound and perfect, and
   hence all entire renovation is necessary that we may please God.

   The subjoined phrase, why will ye die, O house of Israel? suggests many
   questions. Here unskillful men think that God speculates on what men
   will do, and that the salvation or destruction of each depends on
   themselves, as if God had determined nothing concerning us before the
   foundation of the world. Hence they set him at naught, since they fancy
   that he is held in suspense and doubt as to the future end of every
   one, and that he is not so anxious for our salvation, as to wish all to
   be saved, but leaves it in the power of every one to perish or to be
   saved as he pleases. But as I have said, this would reduce God to a
   specter. But we have no need of a long dispute, because Scripture
   everywhere declares with sufficient clearness that God has determined
   what shall happen to us: for he chose his own people before the
   foundation of the world and passed by others. (Ephesians 1:4.) Nothing
   is clearer than this doctrine; for if there had been no predestination
   on God's part, there had been no deity, since he would be forced into
   order as if he were one of us: nay, men are to a certain extent
   provident, whenever God allows some sparks of his image to shine forth
   in them. If, therefore, the very smallest drop of foresight in men is
   laid hold of, how great must it be in the fountain itself? Insipid
   indeed is the comment, to fancy that God remains doubtful and waiting
   for what will happen to individuals, as if it were in their own power
   either to attain to salvation or to perish. But the Prophets words are
   plain, for God testifies with grief that he willeth not the death of a
   mortal. I answer, that there is no absurdity, as we said before, in
   God's undertaking a twofold character, not that he is two-faced
   himself, as those profane dogs blurt out against us, but because his
   counsels are incomprehensible by us. This indeed ought to be fixed,
   that before the foundation of the world we were predestinated either to
   life or death. Now because we cannot ascend to that height, it is
   needful for God to conform himself to our ignorance, and to descend in
   some way to us since we cannot ascend to him. When Scripture so often
   says that God has heard, and inquires, no one is offended: all pass
   over those forms of speech securely, and confess them adopted from
   human language. (Genesis 16:11, and often.) Very often, I say, God
   transfers to himself the properties of man, and this is admitted
   universally without either offense or controversy. Although this manner
   of speaking is rather harsh: God came to see, (Genesis 11:5,) when he
   announces that he came to inquire about things openly known; it is
   easily excused, since nothing is less in accordance with his nature:
   for the solution is at hand, namely, that God speaks metaphorically,
   and adapts his speech to the convenience of men. Now why will not the
   same reasoning avail in the present case? for with respect to the law
   and the whole teaching of the prophets, God announces his wish that all
   should be saved. And surely we consider the tendency of the heavenly
   teaching, we shall find that all are promiscuously called to salvation.
   For the law was a way of life, as Moses testifies, This is the way,
   walk you in it: again, Whosoever has done those things shall live in
   them: and, again, This is your life. (Deuteronomy 30:15, 19;
   Deuteronomy 32:47; Leviticus 18:5; Isaiah 30:21.) Then of his own
   accord God offers himself as merciful to his ancient people, so that
   this heavenly teaching ought to be life-giving. But what is the Gospel?
   It is God's power unto salvation to every believer, says Paul. (Romans
   1:16.) Therefore God delighteth not in the death of him who dieth, if
   he repent at his teaching. But if we wish to penetrate to his
   incomprehensible counsel, this will be another objection: Oh! but in
   this way God is chargeable with duplicity; -- but I have denied this,
   though he takes up a twofold character, because this was necessary for
   our comprehension. Meanwhile Ezekiel announces this very truly as far
   as doctrine is concerned, that God wills not the death of him that
   perishes: for the explanation follows directly afterwards, be you
   converted and live. Why does not God delight in the death of him who
   perishes? Because he invites all to repentance and rejects no one.
   Since this is so, it follows that he is not delighted by the death of
   him who perishes: hence there is nothing in this passage doubtful or
   thorny, and we should also hold that we are led aside by speculations
   too deep for us. For God does not wish us to inquire into his secret.
   Counsels: His secrets are with himself, says Moses, (Deuteronomy
   29:29,) but this book for ourselves and our children. Moses there
   distinguishes between the hidden counsel of God, (which if we desire to
   investigate too curiously we shall tread on a profound abyss,)and the
   teaching delivered to us. Hence let us leave to God his own secrets,
   and exercise ourselves as far as we can in the law, in which God's will
   is made plain to us and to our children. Now let us go on.

   CHAPTER 19
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 19:1-4

   1. Moreover take you up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

   1. Et tu tolle lamentu [237] super [238] principes Israel,

   2. And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions,
   she nourished her whelps among young lions.

   2. Et dices, Quare mater vestra leaena inter leones occubuit? in medio
   leonum educavit catulos suos.

   3. And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it
   learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.

   3. Et sustulit unum e catulis suis, leo factus est, et didicit praedari
   praedam, homines comedit. [239]

   4. The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they
   brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.

   4. Et audierunt de ipso Gentes, in fovea ipsarum captus est; et
   abduxerunt in cathenis in terram AEgypti.


   Here the Prophet, under the image of a lion, informs us that whatever
   evils happened to the Israelites could not be imputed to others. We
   must understand then his intention: it is not surprising that the
   Spirit of God insists on a matter not very obscure, since nothing is
   more obstinate than the pride of men, especially when God chastises
   them, although they pretend to humility and modesty, yet they swell
   with pride and are full of bitterness, and, lastly, they can scarcely
   be induced to confess God to be just, and that they deserve
   chastisement at his hand. For this reason, therefore, Ezekiel confirms
   what we formerly saw, that the Jews were not afflicted without
   deserving it. But he uses, as I have said, a simile taken from lions.
   He calls the nation itself a lioness: for when he treats of the mother
   of the people, we know that the offspring is considered. He says,
   therefore, that the people was full of insolence. The comparison to a
   lion is sometimes taken in a good sense, as when Moses uses it of the
   tribe of Judea, as a lion's whelp shall he lie down, (Genesis 49:9,) a,
   phrase used in a good sense. But here Ezekiel denotes cruelty, as if he
   had said that all the Jews were fierce and savage beasts. For under the
   name of mother, as I said, he embraces the whole nation. At the
   beginning he orders his Prophet to take up a mournful wailing: for thus
   I interpret the word qynh, kineh, but there is in my judgment an
   indirect opposition between this lamentation which God dictated to them
   by his Prophet, and the common complaints which sounded constantly from
   their tongues. For when their condition was not only ruinous, but
   utterly deplorable, they made many groanings and bewailings. But at the
   same time no one extended his thoughts beyond the pressure of present
   evils they all exclaimed that they were wretched, but no one was
   anxious to inquire why they were so or whence their miseries arose;
   nay, they avoided this contemplation. The Prophet then indirectly
   reproves them, by stating that this mournful complaint was suggested by
   God, but yet was very different from that ordinary lamentation and
   howling in which the Jews stopped at blind grief, and never inquired
   why God was so hostile to them. Take up, therefore, a lamentation, says
   he, regarding or against the princes of Israel. In this way God does
   not excuse the people from blame, he only means that not only the
   common people were lost, but the very flower of the nation and all who
   were held in honor.

   He says next, that their mother lay down among lions, alluding to the
   people's origin from lions, as we said before, when the Prophet calls
   Judea the descendant of Canaan, and the sister of Sodom and Samaria.
   When he now says, their mother lay down among lions, he means that they
   were shamefully mixed with the corruption of the Gentiles, so that they
   did not differ from them. But God had chosen them as his peculiar
   people on the very condition of being separate from all the filth of
   the Gentiles. There was, therefore, a certain withdrawing of God's
   favor when the mother of the people lay down among the lions, that is,
   when they all promiscuously gave themselves up to the perverse morals
   and superstitions of the Gentiles. He says, that she brought up whelps,
   or young lions, which she produced to these lions; since their origin
   was impure, being all Abraham's children, but, as I have said, a
   degenerate race. He afterwards adds, that the lion's whelp, or young
   lion, grew up till it became a lion: then it learnt to seize prey, says
   he, and to devour men. He refers to King Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, (2
   Kings 23:30-32:) but he had before asserted that the whole people had a
   lion's disposition, and that the princes, who were more exalted, were
   like whelps. As only one lion is here brought forward, it ought to be
   referred to the violence by which that wicked king manifested his real
   disposition. But if it be asked whence the lion went forth, the reply
   is, from amidst his brethren, for they were all lions' whelps, or young
   lions. They could not administer the government either together or
   singly, but each devoured his brother, and was devoted to robbery and
   rapine. The king only, because freed from all fear, could surpass the
   rest in rapine and robbery with impunity. We see, then, that not only
   the king was here condemned, but that he becomes the type of the whole
   nation; because, since no one could restrain his passions, he could rob
   and devour mankind with unbridled freedom.

   He afterwards adds, that the nations had heard, and were taken in their
   pit-fall. Here Ezekiel states that Jehoahaz was hurled from the royal
   throne, and taken captive by the Egyptians, not only because God had
   beheld his cruelty, but because the Gentiles had observed it; and it
   was notorious among them all. In this way he signifies that the cruelty
   of King Jehoahaz was intolerable: and he mentions him, since all the
   neighboring nations had heard of his fame, and had conspired to destroy
   him; and so he was taken in their pit, and confined by chains, and led
   away into Egypt. He means, as I said, Jehoahaz, whom King
   Pharaoh-nechoh took captive. (2 Kings 23; 2 Chronicles 36.) For when he
   thought that the Egyptians were distracted by foreign wars, he took the
   opportunity of collecting an army, and endeavored to seize on certain
   neighboring cities. But Pharaoh, after he was disengaged from other
   business, entered Judea, and since Jehoahaz was unable to resist, he
   was taken. We now understand the Prophet's meaning, namely, when this
   first calamity and destruction happened to the Jews they were justly
   chastised, because they were young lions; and a lion had sprung from
   them whose cruelty was already intolerable to the profane Gentiles:
   this is the sense of the passage. Now if we consider who was the father
   of Jehoahaz this will be more detestable. For we know, that if ever any
   king excelled in piety and every virtue, Josiah was among the number:
   and from the son being so unlike his father, we perceive his perverse
   disposition. There can be no doubt that his father desired to instruct
   him in the fear and worship of God, and to train him to the discharge
   of the royal office. But if we descend to the whole people, the prodigy
   will be yet more detestable. For we know with what fervor and zeal
   Josiah strove to form the morals of the people, so that the kingdom
   should be entirely renewed. But the people soon declined, so that the
   Holy Spirit says, their mother was a lioness, and lay down among lions,
   whence we see their depraved nature. It now follows --

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since we are all so depraved by nature that we are
   not only most deserving of being cast into the midst of lions, but are
   unworthy of being reckoned among thy creatures, that you may extend thy
   hand to us, and manifest thy wonderful power in reforming us; and may
   your image be so renewed in us, that we may daily make more and more
   progress in true piety and righteousness, until at length all the
   corruption's of the flesh may be abolished, and we may be partakers of
   that eternal glory which your only-begotten Son has acquired for us. --
   Amen.

   Lecture Fifty-Ninth.

   We yesterday read over that sentence in which the Prophet says that
   Judea produced another lion after the former had been captured and led
   into Egypt. Now this ought to be referred to King Jehoiakim, who was
   appointed by King Nebuchadnezzar, when he had laid waste a part of
   Egypt, possessed the whole of Judea, and imposed laws by establishing a
   king, according to the rights of conquest. But since he also acted
   perfidiously, he was led away into captivity. The Prophet, therefore,
   means that the nation did not repent through this single chastisement;
   nor did it change its disposition, since its mother was a lioness: and
   not only did it bring forth young lions, but taught them to seize upon
   their prey till they became grown up. He says, therefore, that she saw
   what she had hoped, and her hope was futile. Some think that the noun
   "hope" is here repeated by the Prophet -- she saw that her hope was
   lost; lost hope, I say. But the other reading is better -- she saw that
   she had hoped; that is, she saw that her hope had not produced any
   fruit for some time, because the royal throne remained deserted;
   therefore she took another of her whelps, says he, and made him a lion.
   The Prophet again briefly teaches that the whole royal offspring was
   like young lions. Although, therefore, the lion alone is called king,
   yet he is said to be taken from a number of whelps; and hence it
   follows that this denotes the depraved and cruel nature of all. Thus we
   see that the Jews are indirectly reproved for not returning to
   soundness of mind, when God punished them severely, and King Jehoahaz
   was taken. Since, therefore, that punishment did not result in their
   correction, it follows that their dispositions were depraved; and the
   Prophet means this when he says, that she took one of her whelps, and
   again made it a lion. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 19:6

   6. And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and
   learned to catch the prey, and devoured. men.

   6. Et incessit in medio leonum, leo fuit, et didicit praedari praedam,
   [242] homines voravit.


   Ezekiel confirms what I have already briefly touched on, that this
   second lion was no less savage and cruel than the former, of which he
   had spoken. As to the phrase, he walked among lions, it means that his
   government was tyrannical, since there was then such foul barbarity in
   those regions, that, kings were scarcely human in their conduct. Since,
   therefore, kings were then everywhere like lions, the Prophet says that
   Jehoiakim was not different from them, but in every sense their ally.
   He walked, therefore, he says, in the midst of lions, since he imitated
   their ferocity, which at length he expresses more clearly, that he
   became a lion, and was taught to seize his prey, so as to devour not
   only animals, but men, thus marking his extreme cruelty. He afterwards
   adds --

   [242] Or, "to seize booty" -- an expression more in agreement with the
   Latin idiom. -- Calvin.

   Ezekiel 19:7

   7. And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities;
   and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his
   roaring.

   7. Et contrivit, [243] palatia ejus, et urbes eorum destruxit, et
   redacta fuit in solitudinem terra, et plenitudo ejus a voce rugitus
   illius.


   He again confirms what he said of the cruelty of King Jehoiakim: but
   the phrase is mixed, since he retains but a part of the simile, and
   then speaks without a figure of palaces and cities. Although
   interpreters incline to a different opinion, and translate -- and took
   notice of his widows: and if the remaining words had suited, this
   reading would have been better; but I do not see how things so
   different can be united, as destroying cities and noticing widows.
   First, those who adopt this comment are obliged to adopt the notion
   that Jehoiakim destroyed the men and deflowered their widows, since he
   could not possess them in freedom till they were widows. Every one will
   admit that this is far-fetched. But the word "afflict" suits tolerably
   well. And truly the 53rd chapter of Isaiah, where Christ is said to be
   bruised for our grieves, cannot be better explained, (Isaiah 53:3.)
   Some translate, that he experienced sorrows, or knew them, or was
   acquainted with them, in the passive signification. But those who say
   that he saw sorrows, or experienced them, do not consider how it suits
   the passage; and those who say that he was cognizant of grieves,
   meaning his own, also distort the Prophet's words. I doubt not,
   therefore, that in this passage it means to afflict. Respecting the
   noun, I suppose the letter, l (l) taken for r (r); and in Isaiah
   (Isaiah 13:22) this word is used for palaces: wild beasts shall howl,
   says the Prophet, v'lmnvtyv, bal-meno-thiv, that is, in her palaces.
   The word cannot here mean widows, and all are agreed to take it for
   palaces; and when the Prophet adds, that he destroyed cities, the
   subject shows us that in the former clause the palaces were afflicted,
   and then the cities destroyed: the Prophet asserts this simply, and
   without a figure, though he soon returns to the simile, that the land
   was reduced to a desert by the voice of roaring. Again, he compares
   King Jehoiakim to a lion; whence it follows, as I said, that the
   Prophet's language is mixed. Elsewhere, also, the prophets reprove the
   pride of their king. (Jeremiah 22:15; Jeremiah 36:30.) For although he
   was contemptible, yet he raised himself above other kings; hence he is
   derided, since he was not content with the condition and moderation of
   his father, who ate and drank, -- that is, lived like mankind, -- but
   he desired to raise himself above the race of men. For this cause the
   Prophet now says, that cities were destroyed by him, and palaces
   afflicted by him. There is a change of number in the pronouns, because
   the singular number is put in the word "palaces," and the plural in
   cities. But we know how frequently this change occurs in the Hebrew
   Language; while as to the sense there is no obscurity, for King
   Jehoiakim was like a fierce and cruel beast, because he destroyed
   cities and pulled down palaces. But afterwards he adds, the land was
   laid waste and made solitary by the voice of his roaring. Here the
   Prophet enlarges upon the atrocity of that king, since by his roaring
   alone he had reduced the land to a desert. He does not speak of claws
   or teeth, but says that they were all so frightened at the sound of his
   roaring that the land was waste and solitary. He adds, the fullness of
   the land, by which expression Scripture usually denotes the ornaments
   of a country. The word comprehends trees, and fruits, and animals, as
   well as inhabitants; for a land is empty and bare without that
   clothing; that is, if trees and fruits are taken away as well as men
   and animals, the face of the land is deserted and deformed, and its
   state displays its emptiness. It afterwards follow: --

   Ezekiel 19:8

   8. Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces,
   and spread their net over him: he was in taken in their pit.

   8. Et posuerunt [244] super eum gentes in circuitu, et regionibus, et
   expanderunt super ipsum rete suum: in fovea ipsarum captus est.


   Since the word ntn, nethen, is often taken for "to utter a voice," some
   explain this passage, that the nations came with great clamor against
   King Jehoiakim, as when an attack is made against a wild beast, the
   assailants mutually excite and encourage each other. They understand
   it, that such a clamor was raised on all sides that they rushed with
   one consent against King Jehoiakim. But since the same word means "to
   put," it may, in my opinion, be properly applied to counsel, since they
   took counsel, that is, determined among themselves to take him captive.
   The passive sense does not suit at all. Now, then, we understand the
   Prophet's meaning when he says, that the Gentiles had resolved against
   him, that is, had conspired to take him. No doubt the Chaldaeans were
   assisted by all their neighbors. First, we know that the Jews were
   hated by other nations; then the audacity and rashness of this king
   provoked many to send for the Babylonians, and eagerly to assist them;
   and because they scarcely dared to engage in the war by themselves,
   they conspired against King Jehoiakim under the protection of others.
   Thus far concerning other nations, for this cannot, be meant of the
   Chaldaeans alone; because, although they had other tribes under their
   sway, yet that monarchy had devoured the Assyrians, whose people made a
   portion of the Chaldaean army. Then the Prophet speaks of a circuit,
   and says, that King Jehoiakim was shut in on all sides: hence this must
   be ascribed to the neighboring nations, who not only favored the
   Babylonians, but assisted them with troops and wealth, as is
   sufficiently gathered from other passages.

   At length he says, they expanded their net, by which metaphor he means
   plans, desires, and efforts. For before the neighboring nations openly
   declared war against the Jews, there is no doubt that they took secret
   counsel as to the best way of attracting the Chaldaeans to their side,
   and of insinuating themselves by various arts, as if they were laying
   snares; although by the word net we may also understand whatsoever
   apparatus they used for destroying King Jehoiakim. In fine, he says
   that he was taken in the pit of the nations, that is, was oppressed as
   well by snares as by open violence. He uses the word pitfall, in
   accordance with the resemblance of the king to a lion; but there is
   nothing absurd in extending the phrase to any hostile violence by which
   Jehoiakim was oppressed. It follows --

   Ezekiel 19:9

   9. And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of
   Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be
   heard upon the mountains of Israel.

   9. Et posuerunt eum in clausuram [245] et adduxerunt in cathenis ad
   regem Babylonis, deduxerunt in munitiones [246] ut non audiatur vox
   ejus amplius in montibus Israel.


   He pursues the same subject, saying that King Jehoiakim, after being
   taken captive, was bound with fetters and chains, adding, that he was
   brought to the king of Babylon; and thirdly, was cast into prison. He
   shows, therefore, how severely God punished the vicious obstinacy of
   that nation: for when King Jehoiakim was chastised, it thought to have
   been enough to correct then; but since the people were not improved by
   this, the severity was doubled; and here Ezekiel says, that King
   Jehoiakim was cast into a fortified dungeon. He adds, that his voice,
   that is, his roaring, should be no longer heard in the mountains of
   Israel. For although he was reduced to straits, through a great part of
   his kingdom being cut off, yet he did not desist from his ferocity. The
   Prophet, therefore, sharply derides his insolence, since he did not
   cease to cry out, and to roar even in the mountains of Israel. It
   follows --

   Ezekiel 19:10-12

   10. Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she
   was fruitful, and full of branches by reason of many waters.

   10. Mater tua tanquam vitis in sanguine tuo super aquas plantata fuit:
   fructifera et ramosa [247] fuit ob aquas multas.

   11. And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule,
   and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared
   in her height with the multitude of her branches.

   11. Et fuerunt illi virgae roboris [248] ad sceptra dominantium: et
   elevata fuit statura ejus supra, [249] et apparuit in altitudine sua,
   in multitudine ramorum suorum.

   12. But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground,
   and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and
   withered; the fire consumed them.

   12. Et evulsa fuit in furore, [250] terram projecta: et ventus
   Orientalis arefecit fructum ejus discerpti sunt, [251] et arefacti;
   virga robusta, [252] ignis voravit eas.


   Here Ezekiel places before our eyes the twofold state of the Jews, that
   they may acknowledge themselves fallen into extreme misery, because
   they had provoked God. For they did not sufficiently consider their
   present state, unless the former dignity and happiness with which they
   were adorned was brought to their remembrance. Now, in some way they
   had grown callous to all evils: although scarcely anything remained
   safe but Jerusalem, they did not look back, but were just as wanton as
   when their affairs were prosperous. Since they had not yet been humbled
   by so many slaughters, the Prophet, therefore, on the one hand, reminds
   them of their former condition, and then shows them how they had
   fallen. This comparison, then, thought to prick their consciences
   sharply, that they may at length feel that God was hostile to them. We
   now understand the Prophet's intention in saying, that the people's
   mother was at first like a flourishing and fruit-bearing vine. It is
   not surprising that he says, the vine was planted near the waters: for
   there the vines do not require lofty and dry situations, as in cold
   climates, but rather seek their nourishment from water, as we gather
   from many passages of Scripture. The Prophet, therefore, stays, that
   the people at, the beginning was like a vine planted in a mild and
   choice situation. He says, that the vine was flourishing, or branching,
   and fruitful, since it drew its juices from the waters.

   Respecting the word "blood," I think those who take it for vigor are
   mistaken; it rather refers to birth: he says, the mother of the people
   in her blood, that is, in bringing forth the people. Thus Ezekiel
   recalls the Jews to their first origin, as we previously saw the word
   used in this sense. When you was in thy blood, meaning, when you was
   born, as we know this to be the state of the young offspring, as the
   metaphor was explained in the sixteenth chapter. Live in thy blood,
   said God, (Ezekiel 16:6,) since the Jews were still defiled through not
   being cleansed from pollution. In fine, blood is taken for birth, as if
   it had been said, that the Jews, when first brought to light, were
   planted so as to take root, since God led them into the land of Canaan.
   Here he says they were brought to light when God restored them. He
   omits the intervening space of time which we saw elsewhere, because he
   passes directly from the end to the beginning. On the whole, he means
   that the Jews at their nativity were placed in the land of Canaan,
   which was very fruitful, so that they should bring forth their own
   fruit, that is, spend their time happily, and enjoy an abundance of all
   things. Now we understand the meaning of the phrase, the mother of the
   people was planted near the waters, as a flourishing and fruitful vine

   He adds, she had branches, that is, vine twigs, for the scepters of
   those who bear rule. Those who translate with or above the scepters of
   rulers do not seem to me to comprehend the Prophet's meaning. I have no
   doubt he intends that scepters were gathered from these vine branches,
   or rather that they were so formed as to be like royal scepters.
   Although this translation seems rather rough, yet the sense is not
   doubtful; because the Prophet means that kings were taken from the
   people just as branches from the vine, as God chose king's from David
   to Zedekiah. In this sense he says that the vine branches became
   scepters of the rulers. He afterwards adds, her stature was
   conspicuous, that she was remarkable for her loftiness even in the
   multitude of the vine branches. This is extended to the whole body of
   the people. Since mention is made of the king, there is no doubt that
   God commends his grace towards the whole people, whose safety and
   happiness were placed in the king, as we saw elsewhere. But he asserts
   more clearly that the people had increased, so that they excelled in
   population, power, and wealth. On the whole, the Prophet teaches that
   the Jews were adorned from the beginning with all kinds of advantages,
   since God's best gifts shone forth there, and their dignity was
   conspicuous, and their opulence great, since he unites the multitude of
   the boughs or vine branches with their height.

   Let us come now to the second clause. He says that the vine was torn
   away in wrath, thrown on the ground, and dried by the east wind, and
   that its boughs were broken off and withered, and consumed by fire. I
   have now briefly explained the Prophet's meaning. As the Jews had grown
   stupid in their calamity, and were not humbled so as suppliantly to fly
   to God's mercy, the Prophet corrects their torpor when he shows them
   their origin. He now says that they were reduced to extreme
   wretchedness by a sudden assault; for a change which took place in a
   short space of time ought to affect them to the quick; but if they had
   been slowly diminished, the change had not been so remarkable: but when
   the vine was struck by lightning, torn up, withered, and burnt, that
   instantaneous slaughter, as I have said, showed that it was not by
   chance, but by the evident wrath of God. For this reason he says that
   the vine was violently torn up, and cast upon the ground. If the vine
   had been dried up by degrees, it, would not have been so wonderful; but
   its sudden tearing up ought to have made them sensible of the wrath of
   God, towards which they had grown callous. This is the reason why the
   Prophet adds one simile to another. The plucking up would have been
   sufficient; but he adds, it was cast upon the ground, that it should
   wither away completely. He adds, the east wind, which destroys both
   fruits and trees, as is sufficiently evident from many passages; and
   not only so, but he says that the boughs were broken, or plucked off,
   and withered: lastly, they were consumed with fire In fine, the hand of
   God appeared visibly in that horrible slaughter of the people, when
   they were torn up, cut off, withered, and burnt. It follows --

   Ezekiel 19:13

   13. And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
   ground.

   13. Et nunc plantata est in deserto, in terra siccitatis et sitis.
   [253]


   The Prophet seems here inconsistent with himself, since these two
   clauses are openly at variance, that the vine was not, only withered,
   but burnt up, and yet planted in a desert place; for if it was
   withered, it could not take root again; but the burning removed the
   slightest hope; for when the twigs were reduced to ashes, who ever saw
   a vine spring up and grow from its ashes? But when the Prophet says
   that the vine was withered and burnt up, he refers to the conclusion
   which men must arrive at by their own senses when the city was utterly
   ruined; for that was in truth a horrible spectacle, when the people
   were made tributary after their king was taken, the temple, plundered,
   the city ruined, and their safety dependent on the lust of their
   conqueror. Since, therefore, neither the royal name and dignity, nor
   freedom and security, remained, and especially when they were led to
   the slaughter-house, was not their ruin very like a burning? Now,
   therefore, we see why the Prophet said that the vine was torn and burnt
   up, for that most severe destruction took away all hope of restoration
   for a short time. Hence he spoke according to common sense: then he
   kept in view that form of horrible ruin, or rather deformity, which was
   like a burning and a final destruction of the people. But now, when he
   says that the vine was planted again, he commends the mercy of God, who
   wished some seed to remain for the production of young plants; as it is
   said in the first chapter of Isaiah, Lest you should be in like Sodom
   and Gomorrah, some small seed has been wonderfully preserved. Although,
   therefore, the people were burnt up after being violently plucked up,
   and all their lives subjected to the will of the proudest, of
   conquerors, yet God took some twigs or vine branches, which he planted,
   that he might propagate a new nation, which was done at the people's
   return.

   But he says that those vine branches were planted in the desert in the
   dry and thirsty land, since God preserves the religion of his people
   even in death. Hence he compares their exile to a desert and a
   wilderness. It may seem absurd at first sight that, Chaldaea should be
   likened to a desert, since that district we know to be remarkable for
   its fertility and other advantages; we know, too, that it was well
   watered, though called dry. But the Prophet here does not, consider the
   material character of the country, but the condition of the people in
   it. Although Chaldaea was most lovely, and full of all kinds of fruits,
   yet, since the people were cruelly oppressed and contemptuously
   treated, hence the land was called a desert. We say that no prison is
   beautiful, so that their exile could not be agreeable to the children
   of Israel; for they were ashamed of their life, and did not dare to
   raise their eyes upwards. Since, then, they were drowned in a deep
   abyss of evils, the land was to them a desert; hence there was no
   splendor, dignity, or opulence; and liberty, the most precious of all
   boons, was wrested from them. Now we see the sense of the words. It
   follows at length --

   Ezekiel 19:14

   14. And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured
   her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This
   is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

   14. Et egressus est ignis a virga ramorum ejus, fructum ejus voravit,
   [254] et non fuit in ea virga fortitudinis, [255] sceptrum ad
   dominandum. Lamentatio haec, et erit in lamentationem.


   Here the Prophet comes down to the close of their woes, when Zedekiah
   was dragged into captivity, and so the people's independence was
   abolished. God had formerly planted that vine, or at least some of the
   branches, in a desert spot, since first four tribes, and afterwards
   seven, were led away, and last of all, the greater part of the tribe of
   Judea; but the little that remained with King Zedekiah perished. He
   says, therefore, that the fire went forth from the vine branches: thus
   he shows that the last slaughter proceeded only from the people
   themselves; and lest they should utter their accustomed complaints, the
   Prophet meets them by saying that they were consumed by intestine fire;
   that is, their slaughter could not be ascribed to their Chaldaean
   conquerors, but to themselves; because King Zedekiah, by his own
   perfidy, had stirred up the king of Babylon against himself; for he
   might have spent his time in his kingdom, but he could not refrain
   himself from throwing off the yoke; for this reason he armed himself
   against the king of Babylon, because he was a breaker of treaties: and
   thus the Prophet says, with propriety, that a fire went forth from one
   rod, or twig of its branches, and hence the fruit of the whole vine was
   consumed; that is, the remnant was lost by the fault of that perfidious
   king. He now adds, there was no scepter for ruling among its rods.
   Hence it appears that the exposition which I have advanced suits best,
   and is entirely genuine. He said first that the rods were for a scepter
   of the rulers; but he here says there was no scepter for them among
   these rods. What follows we will treat tomorrow.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you have once deigned to insert us into the

   undertaken to cultivate: that by the power of thy Spirit we may be so
   watered as never to be deficient in spiritual rigor: and may we so bear

   fountain of our faith when we enjoy the celestial glory to which you
   have adopted us in the same, your only-begotten

   Lecture Sixtieth.

   Time did not permit us yesterday to explain the words at the close of
   this nineteenth chapter: this is a lamentation, and it shall be a
   lamentation. Some think this to be said of the Jews, that is, of all
   the, Israelites, since they should all be lamentable, because God would
   not cease to inflict his judgments upon them until he had utterly
   consumed them. But I had rather refer it to the prophecy, and this is
   the more correct sense This lamentation: thus the Prophet designates
   this sad and mournful prophecy because it contains the last slaughter
   of the people. Secondly, he adds, it shall be for a lamentation,
   because it suggests material for wailing, since remarkable miseries are
   accustomed to be more celebrated. If anything usual occurs, men soon
   forget it; but if any slaughter happens worthy of notice and of
   remembrance it is everywhere spread abroad, nay, it supplies posterity
   with material for their poems. Hence the Prophet signifies not only
   that this prophecy was mournful, but that God's wrath would fly about
   in common conversation through so rare and memorable an example. I now
   come to the twentieth chapter.

   CHAPTER 20
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 20:1

   1. And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the
   tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to
   inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.

   1. Et fuit anno septimo, quinto mense, decimo mensis venerunt viri e
   senioribus Israel ad consulendum Jehovam: et sederunt coram facie mea.
   [256]


   Here he does not narrate a vision but an event which really happened.
   It is a simple historical narrative, that some of the elders of Israel
   were chosen to interrogate him. We know this to be customary, and when
   God separates His people from the profane nations, he opposes his
   prophets to the soothsayers and magi, augurs and astrologers. For he
   says that the Gentiles inquire what concerns them in various ways, and
   so interrogate their deities; but that he prescribes to the chosen
   people but one method: I will raise for them a prophet from the midst
   of their brethren, says Moses, (Deuteronomy 18:18;) that is, they need
   not wander about, like the wretched gentiles, destitute of counsel,
   first to their soothsayers, then to magi, and then to astrologers:
   there is no end to them' but I will meet them, says he, by my prophets,
   who shall always exist among the people. In this sense Ezekiel says
   that the elders of Israel came to consult God. The verb, drs, deresh,
   properly signifies "to seek" but it is here received for "to consult"
   or "inquire into," as in many other places. Now it is not surprising
   that the elders came by public consent to the Prophet: for the
   Israelites were already worn out by long weariness, and thought that
   they had almost perished through their long exile. But there was
   another reason, since false prophets, as we saw, tickled the ears of
   the simple by offering them daily some new hope. Since therefore they
   were agitated between hope and fear, and the devil scattered false
   prophecies which distracted the minds of the vulgar, it is probable
   that the elders of Israel came and were sent to inquire concerning
   either the prosperous or disastrous event of their captivity. They come
   therefore to the prophets; he says it happened in the seventh year,
   that is, after the captivity of Jehoiakim. They reckoned the years from
   that change, and deservedly so: for so remarkable an act of God's
   vengeance ought to be kept constantly in remembrance. There was also
   another reason, since God gave some hope of restoration. The reckoning
   of the years, then, which the Israelites dated from Jehoiakim's exile,
   had a twofold use and end, first, that God's judgment might remain
   fixed in their minds, and next, that they might nevertheless refresh
   their spirits by the hope of good. Hence as often as they dated the
   first year or the second, it was just as if they kept before their eyes
   that slaughter by which God testified himself grievously offended. But
   for another reason they ought to cheer their spirits by good hopes,
   because if the kingdom had been utterly abolished and no promise added
   to lighten their sorrow, that reckoning was superfluous, since in a
   state of desperation we do not take an account of years: but when
   seventy years were fixed, they nourished and cherished hope in this
   way, because they renewed the remembrance of their liberty, which had
   been promised them by the mouth of Jeremiah. (Jeremiah 25:12, 13, and
   Jeremiah 29:10.) Now therefore we understand why he simply says the
   seventh year he mentions also the day and the month.

   Now the Clause which I have noticed contains some useful instruction,
   -- the elders of Israel came to consult God and sat before the Prophet.
   We see, then, as far as concerns outward forms, that they followed what
   God had commanded in his law; lest you should say, Who shall ascend
   above the clouds? who shall descend into the abyss? who shall cross the
   sea? The word is ever there, in thy heart and in thy mouth.
   (Deuteronomy 30:12-14; Romans 10:6-8.) Since therefore God in some way
   brought himself forward whenever he instructed his servants by the
   spirit of prophecy, so when the elders of Israel came to the Prophet,
   they are said to come to God himself, because God was unwilling to
   utter his own oracles either from heaven or by means of angels, but he
   appointed his servant by whom he would speak, and suggested what he
   should say. Hence we gather that our faith is not rightly founded
   unless when we listen to God alone, who only deserves and claims us as
   listeners. But at the same time, we must remark that faith was joined
   with humility and modesty. Hence if any one desires to ascend to the
   clouds to inquire what God will answer, he departs far from him,
   although he pretends to approach him. Hence this moderation is to be
   observed, that our faith may acquiesce in the authority of the one God,
   and not be carried hither and thither by the will of men; and yet it
   should not object to here God speak through his servants, but calmly
   submit itself to the prophets. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 20:2-3

   2. Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

   2. Et fuit sermo Iehovae ad me dicendo,

   3. Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus
   saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to inquire of me? As I live, saith the
   Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.

   3. Fili hominis, loquere ad seniores Israel, et dic illis, Sic dicit
   Dominator Iehovah, An ad quaerendum me, [257] venistis? Vivo ego si
   quaerar a vobis, dicit Dominator Iehovah.


   Here the Prophet is ordered to blame those elders, although they
   pretended to rare piety in inquiring of him: God says that they did not
   come with a right disposition. Many translate otherwise -- if I shall
   be found, or be en-treated by you, or if I shall answer: thus they take
   the word, drs, deresh, in a double sense: in the first clause, for to
   seek or interrogate; but when it is added, as I live, etc., they do not
   take the word by "to be sought" or "interrogated," but by "to answer"
   or "be entreated." But this seems far-fetched and in Ezekiel 14:3, a
   phrase not unlike this was explained; and hence we may gather, that God
   rather inveighs against the people's hypocrisy than rejects them, and
   refuses to answer. There the Prophet said that the elders came to
   consult him, as if they had been his best disciples; but as Ezekiel
   might be deceived by that deceptive picture, God meets him, and says,
   Do you think that they come to inquire of me? They are fixed upon their
   idols; for their heart is towards them, and they raise their eyes to
   their own abominations: As I live, if they seek me, says he; that is,
   it is easy to convict them of bad faith, when they come suppliantly to
   inquire of thee. For if they truly and heartily sought me, they would
   renounce their idols, and would no longer partake of their
   abominations; but they do not repent, but remain obstinate in their
   wickedness. It is certain, therefore, that they are by no means
   sincere: there is no reason why you should delay them, or trouble
   yourself about them, since their conduct is mere dissimulation. So,
   therefore, in this passage God pronounced by his Prophet, are you come
   to seek me? that is, to consult me. I will not be inquired of by you,
   says he: the reason is, because, as we saw in the Ezekiel 14th, they
   always remained the same, since therefore they were at the greatest
   distance from God, and remained wrapped up in their own abominations,
   their seeking God was only fallacious. The conclusion is, that God
   rejected them, because, though they pretended a holy zeal, they were
   still perverse in their disposition; hence God refuses to discharge the
   office of a master towards them since they did not come to learn: this
   is one point. He then says, if I shall be inquired of by you. And
   because their hypocrisy was stained by various colors, God swears that
   their disposition was perverse, and that they did not come with pious
   and holy affections, and were neither docile nor obedient, nor desirous
   of making progress, and hence were unworthy of having him for a
   teacher. Now let us go on.

   Ezekiel 20:4

   4. Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt you judge them? cause them to
   know the abominations of their fathers:

   4. An judicabo eos? an judicabo eos, fili hominis? abominationes patrum
   ipsorum indica [258] illis.


   The context flows very well if we embrace this sense, that God swears
   that the Israelites did not come to be subject to his Prophet, and to
   submit themselves modestly to his instructions. If this sense pleases,
   it is well added, shall you judge them? that is, shall you spend thy
   breath in arguing with them? He means that they are rather to be
   dismissed than instructed; as Christ says, You shall not cast pearls
   before swine. (Matthew 7:6.) And we know what God pronounces: My Spirit
   shall not always strive with man, because he is flesh. (Genesis 6:3.)
   He now means that there was no need of any dispute, since there was no
   means of carrying it on; so in this passage, since the Prophet was
   dealing with men utterly broken down, who never listened to wise
   counsels, nor obeyed any admonitions, nor were softened by any
   chastisement, he adds, therefore, shall you judge them? Some indeed
   coldly and insipidly explain this of taking away the part of a judge,
   since God rather wishes them to be called to repentance than to be
   condemned. But here judging embraces within itself all reproaches and
   threats. On the whole, since they acted deceitfully, and by no means
   proposed to submit themselves to God, hence he uses this bitterness,
   What! are they worthy of your judging them? that is, of your contending
   with them? for the Prophet's duty is to argue with sinners, to threaten
   them, and to cite them to God's tribunal. God, therefore, pronounces
   them unworthy of such disputing, because they are not only deaf, but,
   hardened by abandoned obstinacy. Now, therefore, we understand the
   sense of the words, wilt you judge them? will you judge them? The
   repetition is emphatic, that God may strongly express the obstinacy of
   that desperate people. He afterwards adds, If this be done, then show
   them the abominations of their fathers. God here mitigates the asperity
   which he had used, and by means of a correction descends to a reason
   for it, namely, that he may for once try whether or not they are
   curable. If then they are to be judged, that is, if he chooses to enter
   into any dispute, and to argue with them, he says that he ought to
   begin not with themselves, but with their fathers. God wishes them to
   be judged, not only on account of the wickedness of a few years, but
   because before they were born their fathers were obstinately attached
   to their abominations. In fine, God shows that the wound was deep, and
   could not be cured, unless the hidden poison was carefully examined,
   which otherwise would cause putrid matter, from which at length
   inflammation would arise. For many think that they have properly
   discharged their duty when they have but lightly probed their wounds:
   but sometimes it is necessary to penetrate to the inmost parts, as the
   people had not only provoked God lightly, and for a short time, but
   their impiety had been growing for ages, and their sins had become a
   kind of inheritance to them. Since, then, this hidden poison existed,
   which could not be cured either easily or by any slight remedy, hence
   God orders them to begin with their fathers. Show them, therefore, the
   abominations of their fathers. It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:5-8

   5. And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose
   Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob,
   and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up
   mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;

   5. Et dices illis, Sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, Die quo elegi Israelem,
   et sustuli manum meam ad semen domus Iacob, et cognitus fui illis in
   terrae Ægypti, et sustuli manum meam illis dicendo, Ego Iehovah Deus
   vester;

   6. In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth
   of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing
   with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:

   6. Die illo sustuii manum meam ad ipsos, ut educerem eos e terra Ægypti
   in terram quam prospexi illis fluentem lacte et melle, desiderium [259]
   prae omnibus terris:

   7. Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of
   his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the
   LORD your God.

   7. Et dixi illis, Quisque spurcitias oculorum suorum projicite et in
   idolis [260] Ægypti ne polluamini: ego Iehovah Deus vester.

   8. But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they
   did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did
   they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury
   upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land
   of Egypt.

   8. Et rebelles fuerunt mihi, et noluerunt audire me, et quae sequuntur.


   God confirms what I said before, that the Jews were not to be reproved
   for beginning lately to sin: it was not sufficient to bring recent
   offenses before them; but God orders the Prophet to begin with their
   fathers, as if he had said that the nation was abandoned from the very
   beginning, as Stephen reproaches them: Uncircumcised in heart, you
   still resist the Holy Spirit, as your fathers always did. (Acts 7:51.)
   And Christ had said the same thing before: You fill up the measure of
   your fathers. (Matthew 23:32.) We know also how frequently rebukes of
   this kind occur in the Prophets. God therefore says, that from the time
   when he chose the seed of Israel, he had experienced both the
   wickedness and obstinacy of the people; for he says that they were not
   drawn aside by either error or ignorance, but because they were
   unwilling to hear, when they were over and over again admonished as to
   their duty. Hence three things are to be marked, namely, that the
   people were bound to God, since he had gratuitously adopted them; for
   God here commends his gratuitous election, together with the singular
   benefits which he had conferred on that people: this is one point. The
   second is, that he not only took them once to himself, but showed them
   what was right, so that they could not mistake, except knowingly and
   willfully: this is the second point. Then the third is, that they
   rebelled purposely, because they would not listen: for if they had been
   left at the meeting of two roads, their error had been excusable if
   they had turned to the left instead of the right. But if God by his law
   so shone before them, that he was prepared to direct them straight to
   the mark, and they turned aside; thus their obstinacy and rebellion is
   plainly detected. This is the sense.

   Now as far as words are concerned, he says, that he had chosen Israel.
   But election, as I have already briefly touched upon, is opposed to all
   merits: for if anything had been found in the people which should cause
   them to be preferred to others, it would be improperly said that God
   had elected them. But since all were in the same condition, as Moses
   says in his song (Deuteronomy 32:8, 9,) there was scope for God's
   grace, since he separated them from others of his own accord: for they
   were just like the rest, and God did not find any difference between
   them; we see, then, that they were bound to God more sacredly, since he
   had joined them to himself gratuitously. He now adds, that he lifted up
   his hand to the seed of Jacob. The lifting up the hand seems to be
   taken here in different senses. Since it was a customary method of
   swearing, God is said sometimes to lift up his hand when he swears.
   That is indeed harsh, since the lifting up the hand does not suit God:
   for we lift up the hand when we call God to witness; but God swears by
   himself, and cannot raise his hand above himself. But we know that he
   uses forms of speech according to the common customs of men: hence
   there is nothing absurd in this phrase, he lifted up his hand, that is,
   he swore. Hence, if we may so explain it, this was a confirmation of
   the covenant, when God by interposing a oath promised himself to be
   Israel's God. But since he shortly afterwards adds, that he was known,
   the other sense suits pretty well, since it refers to the benefits
   which he had conferred upon the people. And truly experimental
   knowledge is intended, since God really proved himself to be worthy of
   credit, and thus illustrated his own power in preserving the people.
   Hence I said that to lift up the hand is to be received variously in
   this chapter, since, if we read the two clauses conjointly, I lifted up
   my hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and was made known to
   them, truly the lifting up the hand will imply a display of power. That
   also has been said by means of a simile; but shortly afterwards the
   lifting up of the hand must be taken for to swear, by the figure of
   rhetoric called catachresis, which is the use of a word in a different
   signification, and yet there is no absurdity.

   I have raised my hand, therefore, to the seed of the house of Jacob,
   saying, I Jehovah am your God. (Ezekiel 20:5.)

   We see, then, that God raised his hand to sanction the covenant which
   he had made; for when he pronounces himself their God, he binds them to
   himself, and claims them for his peculiar people, and thus confirms his
   covenant. But at the same time he had raised his hand or arm by so many
   miracles performed in freeing the people. He says, in that day I raised
   my hand to, or towards them, to bring them out. Again, the raising the
   hand refers to God's power, since he brought them forth by an extended
   arm from that miserable slavery. Since, therefore, he so raised his
   hand, he acquired them as his own, that they should no longer be free,
   but belong altogether to him. He afterwards adds other benefits, since
   he not only snatched them from the tyranny of Pharaoh, but brought them
   into a land flowing with milk and honey, which he had espied for them.
   We see how briefly God enlarges upon that remarkable benefit which he
   had bestowed upon his people. Not only was he their Redeemer, but he
   looked out for a place of residence for them, not only commodious, but
   abounding with plenty; for this phrase is common enough with Moses. In
   that same day in which I led them out of Egypt, I brought them into a
   land, the desire of all lands; that is, which is desirable and superior
   to all other lands. It is true, indeed, that other nations were not
   less fruitful; but God, in thus praising the land of Canaan. considers
   it, clothed and adorned by his bounty. But there was no region under
   heaven to be compared with the land of Canaan in one point, namely,
   God's choosing it as his earthly dwelling place. Since the land of
   Canaan excelled all others in this respect, it is deservedly called the
   desire of all lands, or desirable beyond all lands.

   Another clause now follows, that God instructed the Jews in piety, and
   withdrew them from all the idolatries to which they had been devoted.
   Instruction then went before, which showed them the right way of
   salvation, and recalled them from their superstitions. The meaning is,
   that when God adopted the people, he gave them the rule of living
   piously, that they should not be tossed about hither and thither, but.
   have an aim, to which they might direct the whole course of their life.
   I said, therefore, to each of them: this seems more emphatic than if he
   had spoken to all promiscuously and generally: but this familiar
   invitation ought to penetrate more into their minds, when he speaks to
   each individually, just as if he said, let each of you cast away your
   abominations, and not pollute himself anymore with the idols of Egypt.
   When therefore God thus attached them to himself, he shows that he
   could not be rightly worshipped by them unless they bid their
   idolatries farewell, and formed their whole life according to the rule
   of his law. He calls their enticements defilements or idols of the
   eyes: but we know that the Prophet often speaks thus, that unbelievers
   should consider their idols. Hence it is just as if God recalled them
   from all the wiles of Satan in which they were enticed, and were so
   devoted to them as to have their eyes exclusively fixed on them. He
   speaks by name of the idols of Egypt: whence it easily appears that
   they were corrupted by depraved desires, so as for the most part to
   worship the fictitious gods of Egypt. Yet they knew themselves elected
   by the true God, and boasted in circumcision as a symbol of divorce
   from all nations. Yet though they wished to be thought illustrious on
   the one hand, they afterwards prostituted themselves so as to differ in
   nothing from the Egyptians. We see then that the desire of piety was
   almost extinct in their hearts, since they had so contaminated
   themselves with the superstitions of Egypt. That he might retain them
   the better, he says at the same time that he was their God: for without
   this principle men are tossed hither and thither, for we know that we
   are lighter than vanity. Hence the devil will always find us subject to
   his fallacies unless God restrains us in our duty, until he appears to
   us and shows himself the only God: we see then the necessity for this
   remedy, lest men should be carried away by idolatries, namely, the
   knowledge of the true God. The third clause will follow afterwards, but
   we shall explain it in its turn.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you have once stretched forth your hand to
   us by your only-begotten Son, and have not only bound thyself to us by
   an oath, but have sealed your eternal covenant by the blood of the
   same, thy Son: Grant, I pray thee, that we in return may be faithful to
   thee, and persevere in the pure worship of thy name, until at length we
   enjoy the fruit of our faith in thy heavenly kingdom by the same Christ
   our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Sixty-First.

   In the last lecture I began to explain the eighth verse, where God
   complains that he was exasperated by the children of Israel when he had
   begun to extend his hand to free them. He says, then, that they had
   rejected his grace. But at the same time we see that all pretense of
   ignorance was removed, because unless Moses had exhorted them to good
   hope, they would have pretended. to be so deserted through two
   centuries, that they had hoped for help from God in vain. But since
   Moses was a witness of their redemption, hence their ingratitude was
   the more without excuse, since they were unwilling to embrace the
   message which they had so greatly desired. Nor is the language of Moses
   vain, that they often cried out in their calamities. Although their
   clamor was turbulent, yet they doubtless remembered what they had heard
   from their fathers, that the end of those evils was at hand to which
   God had fixed an appointed time. But more is expressed in this passage
   than Moses relates, who simply says, because they saw themselves
   treated too roughly, that they were worn down and disgusted: hence
   those expostulations -- You have made our name to stink before Pharaoh:
   God shall judge between you and us: Judea you gone from us. (Exodus
   5:21.) We do not then clearly collect from Moses that they were rebels
   against God, since they had not cast away their idols and
   superstitions, but the probable conjecture is that they were, so rooted
   in their filth, that they repelled God's hand from succoring them. And
   truly if they had promptly embraced what Moses had promised them in
   God's name, the accomplishment would have been readier and swifter: but
   we may understand that their sloth was the hindrance to the exertion of
   God's hand in their favor and to the real fulfillment of his promises.
   God ought indeed to contend, with Pharaoh, that his power might be more
   conspicuous: but the people would not have been so tyrannously
   afflicted, unless they had closed the door against God's mercy. They
   were, as we have said, immersed in their defilement's from which God
   wished to withdraw them. He now accuses them of ingratitude, because
   they did not cast away their idols, but obstinately persisted in their
   usual and customary superstitions. He speaks of the time of their
   captivity in Egypt, and this passage assures us that while there they
   were infected and polluted by Egyptian defilement's. For the contagion
   of idolatry is wonderful: for since we are all naturally inclined to it
   as soon as any example is offered to us, we are snatched in that
   direction by a violent impulse. It is not surprising then that the
   children of Israel contracted pollution from the superstitions of
   Egypt, especially as they lived there as slaves, and were desirous of
   gratifying the Egyptians: for if they had been treated liberally, they
   might have lived freely after their custom, but since they were not
   free and were oppressed as slaves, it happened that they pretended to
   worship the gods of Egypt according to the will of those by whom they
   saw themselves oppressed: and not only did they sin by pretending, but
   it is probable that they were impelled by their own lusts as well as by
   fear: for it will soon be evident that they were too inclined to
   impiety of their own accord.

   On the whole, Ezekiel here testifies that they were rebels against God,
   because they did not listen to God by casting away the idols of their
   eyes, that is, to the worship of which they were too attentive, nor did
   they desert the idols of Egypt. When he speaks of the idols of their
   eyes, we gather what I have touched upon, that they were not impelled
   to idolatry by fear and necessity, but by their own depraved appetites:
   For unless they had been eagerly devoted to Egyptian superstitions,
   Ezekiel would not have called them idols of the eyes. Hence by this
   word he means that they were not only superstitious through obedience
   to the Egyptians, but were spontaneously inclined towards them.
   Besides, when he adds the idols of Egypt, he points out as the occasion
   of their corruption their spending time under that tyranny, and their
   being compelled to bear many evils, since slavery commonly draws with
   it dissimulation. It now follows, And I said I would pour forth, that
   is, I determined to pour forth. God here signifies that he was inflamed
   by anger, and unless they had respect to his name he would not withdraw
   his hand from the vengeance to which it was armed and prepared. We know
   that this does not properly belong to God, but this is, the language of
   accommodation, since first of all, God is not subject to vengeance,
   and, secondly, does not decree what he may afterwards retract. But
   since these things are not in character with God, simile and
   accommodation are used. As often as the Holy Spirit uses these forms of
   speech, let us learn that they refer rather to the matter in hand than
   to the character of God. God determined to pour forth his anger, that
   is, the Israelites had so deserved it through their crimes, that it was
   necessary to execute punishment upon them. The Prophet simply means
   that the people's disposition was sinful, and hence God's wrath would
   have been poured out, unless he had been held back from some other
   cause. I have already touched upon the obstacle, because he consulted
   his honor lest it should be profaned.

   I have decreed, therefore, to pour forth my burning fury upon them in
   the midst of the land of Egypt. Some translate, to consume them, but
   improperly, for the word, klh, keleh, signifies to fill up or
   accomplish, as well as to consume. But although God sometimes says that
   he consumes all his weapons or scourges in the punishment of men's
   sins, yet it is not suitable to transfer this to his wrath itself.
   Hence another sense will suit better, namely, that God decreed to pour
   out his wrath until he satisfied himself. For here, as we have said, he
   puts on the character of an angry man, who cannot appease his mind
   otherwise than by satiating it by the exaction of punishment: for anger
   is usually inexhaustible. But God on the whole here expresses that such
   was the atrocity of their wickedness, that the Israelites deserved
   destruction through the pouring forth of God's wrath and the filling up
   of the measure of his indignation; and that in the midst of the land of
   Egypt; because they had shown themselves unworthy of his redemption,
   and hence it was enough for them to perish in the midst of the land of
   Egypt. But he afterwards added --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 20:9

   9. But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted
   before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself
   known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.

   9. Et feci propter nomen meum ne profanaretur in oculis gentium, in
   quibus ipsi in medio eorum, quibus cognitus fui ipsis in oculis eorum,
   ad educendum eos e terra Ægypti.


   Here God signifies that he was restrained for one reason only from
   entirely blotting out so ungrateful and wicked a nation, namely, since
   he saw his own sacred name would be exposed to the Gentiles as a
   laughing-stock. He teaches, therefore, that he spared them, and
   suspended his rigor for the time, rather through being induced by
   regard to his own glory than by pity to them. Hence, by the word I did
   it, we ought to understand what will be more clearly explained. The
   sense is, that he abstained from the final act of vengeance for his
   name's sake, that it should not be profaned among the Gentiles.
   Although God here pronounces that he had respect rather to himself than
   to them, yet there is no doubt that he spared them, because he saw that
   they could not be otherwise preserved than by his pardoning them even
   in such hardness and obstinacy; and certainly God's glory and the
   salvation of the Church are things almost inseparably united. When I
   speak of the salvation of the Church, I do not comprehend all those who
   profess to be its members, but I mean only the elect. Since, therefore,
   God had adopted that nation, he must preserve the remnant in safety,
   otherwise his truth would have failed, and thus his name would have
   been much more severely profaned. Hence we may gather, whenever God
   pardons us, though he regards himself, and wishes in this way to
   exercise his clemency, yet his pity towards us is another reason for
   his pardoning us: but when he says that he has withdrawn his hand from
   vengeance through regard for His own glory, he in this way prostrates
   still more the pride of this nation, since, whenever he had pity on
   them, they thought it a concession to their own worthiness and merits.
   The Prophet therefore shows here that they were snatched from
   destruction, while they were remaining in the land of Egypt, for no
   other reason than this, that God was unwilling to expose his name to
   the contempt of the nations. He says, therefore, in the eyes of the
   Gentiles, among whom they were, regarding not the Egyptians only, but
   others.

   Yet the question arises, in what sense, he adds by and by, that he was
   known to them? for as yet he had given no specimen of his power among
   the Gentiles. He had borne witness by two miracles that Moses should be
   the agent in their redemption, (Exodus 4:2, and following:) afterwards
   Moses approached Pharaoh himself: there God put forth the signs of his
   power, which deservedly frightened all the Egyptians; but his fame had
   not yet reached other nations. But this knowledge ought not to be
   simply restricted to past time; for God only means that he had already
   begun to show, by certain and remarkable proofs, that Moses was chosen,
   by whose hand he wished to redeem his own people. Since, therefore, God
   had. already come forward with those remarkable signs, he says, that he
   was known to those nations, not that his fame had reached them, but
   because he had gone there himself, so that the event could not be in
   obscurity, and all must know that miracles had been performed by the
   hand of Moses, by which it was evident that he wished to claim the
   Israelites as his own. Now, therefore, we understand in what sense
   Ezekiel says that God was known. Some explain this relatively thus: I
   was known to them, meaning the Israelites, in their eyes, meaning the
   Gentiles: but this sense seems to me forced; for in my opinion this one
   word "their," in the Prophet's language, is superfluous. He simply
   means that God was manifested in the eyes of all the nations in leading
   them forth. This clause shows the kind of knowledge intended, since God
   showed his power in liberating the people by remarkable miracles. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 20:10

   10. Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and
   brought them into the wilderness.

   10. Et eduxi (eduxi ergo) eos e terra AEgypti, et adduxi in desertum.


   After Ezekiel had taught that the Israelites deserved to perish in
   Egypt, unless God had spared them for his name's sake rather than for
   their own, he now adds the cause of their coming forth, which was the
   promotion of his own glory. Hence, therefore, we gather that the
   Israelites falsely imagined any other cause of their deliverance than
   that respect of which the Prophet now speaks. But this is more than if
   he had simply said that they were snatched from the tyranny of Egypt by
   God's gratuitous pity, since God gratuitously stretched out his hand
   towards them, and was so induced by feelings of humanity and clemency
   as to snatch away from their miseries the innocent who were unjustly
   afflicted; but he here excludes them from God's clemency, because they
   were unworthy of his notice. I said, indeed, that two things were
   united, the salvation of the Church and the glory of God; but at the
   same time I noticed that the Prophet's intention must be considered,
   since he wished to withdraw all confidence from such a proud people,
   and to show that, as far as they could, they had always repelled God's
   favor by their obstacles, unless he had overcome their wickedness by
   his untiring goodness. It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:11

   11. And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if
   a man do, he shall even live in them.

   11. Et dedi illis decreta mea, [261] et judicia mea patefeci ipsis,
   qua, qui fecerit homo vivet in ipsis.


   Here God enlarges upon his favors, since he had given his law to the
   Israelites, as if he would prescribe to them a certain rule of living.
   If they had only been brought out of Egypt, that would have been an
   inestimable benefit: but God was much more generous, since he deigned
   to rule them familiarly with his doctrine, lest they should wander to
   one side or the other; and in this way he testified that he would be
   their God. He adds a promise: for God might precisely enjoin what he
   wished on the people of his choice; but he spontaneously adopts the
   method of indulgence by promising them life. Now, then, we understand
   why this promise is mentioned; for God might simply command anything,
   and say, this pleases me, and use but a monosyllable, after the manner
   of kings issuing a command. Since, then, God not only exacted of the
   Israelites what he might justly require, but, by annexing a promise,
   enticed them gently to the pursuit of obedience, this was certainly a
   mark of his fatherly indulgence. Hence he now exaggerates the people's
   ingratitude by this circumstances, that neither by commands nor by
   kindness could he induce these obstinate and perverse dispositions to
   bend to the yoke. I gave them, therefore, my statutes and my laws; and
   afterwards, which if a man do, he shall live in them. He thus briefly
   reminds them, that it was not his fault if the Israelites were not in
   any sense happy; for when he stipulated with them for the observance of
   his law, he bound them in turn to himself, that they should want
   nothing which contributed to a good and happy life; for in the name of
   life solid happiness is comprehended.

   Yet it is here asked how the Prophet testifies that men should live by
   the works of the law, when the law, on the testimony of Paul, can only
   bring us death. (Romans 4:15; Deuteronomy 30:15.) He took this
   testimony from Moses, and we shall see immediately that he cites it in
   a different sense. Moses there pronounces that the life of man rests on
   the observance of the law; that is, -- life was surely to be expected
   through satisfying the law. Some think this absurd, and so restrict
   what is said to the present life, taking he shall live in them
   politically or civilly: but this is a cold and trifling comment. The
   reasoning which influenced them is readily answered: they object, that
   we owe all things to God; that we ourselves and our possessions are all
   his by the right of possession; so that if we keep the law a hundred
   times over, still we are not, worthy of such a reward. But the solution
   is at hand, that we deserve nothing, but God graciously binds himself
   to us by this promise, as I have already touched upon. And from this
   passage it is easy to infer that works are of no value before God, and
   are not estimated for their intrinsic value, so to speak, but only by
   agreement. Since, then, it pleased God to descend so far as to promise
   life to men if they kept his law, they ought to accept this offer as
   springing from his liberality. There is no absurdity, then, if men do
   live, that is, if they deserve eternal life according to agreement. But
   if any one keeps the law, it will follow that he has no need of the
   grace of Christ. For of what advantage is Christ to us unless we
   recover life in him? but if this is placed in ourselves, the remedy
   must not be thought anywhere but in ourselves. Every one, then, may be
   his own savior if life is placed the observance of the law. But Paul
   solves this difficulty for us when he determines for us a twofold
   righteousness of the law and of faith. (Romans 10:5, 6.) He says that
   this righteousness is of the law when we keep God's precepts. Now,
   since we are far distant from such obedience, nay, the very faculty of
   keeping the law is altogether defective in us: hence it follows that we
   must fly to the righteousness of faith. For he defines the
   righteousness of faith, if we believe Christ to be dead, and to be
   risen again for our justification. We see, therefore, although God
   promised salvation to his ancient people, if they only kept the law,
   yet that promise was useless, since no one could satisfy the law and
   perform God's commands. Here another question arises. For if this
   promise does not take effect, God vainly reckons that as a benefit to
   the Israelites which we see was offered them in vain: hence no utility
   or fruit would arise from it. But some one may say that the imagination
   was fallacious, when God promised life, and now by his Prophet blames
   the Israelites for despising such a benefit. But the reply is easy:
   although men are not endued with the power of obeying the law, yet they
   ought not on that account to depart from the goodness of God; for men's
   declension by no means hinders them from estimating the value of so
   liberal a promise: God is treating with men: he might then, as I have
   said, imperiously demand whatever he pleased, and exact it with the
   utmost rigor; but he treats according to an agreement, and so there is
   a mutual obligation between himself and the people. No one will surely
   deny that God here exhibits a specimen of his mercy when he deigns thus
   familiarly to make a covenant with men. "Ah! but this is all in vain:
   God's promise is of no effect, because no one is able to keep the law."
   I confess it: but man's declension cannot, as I have said, abolish the
   glory of God's goodness, since that always remains fixed, and God still
   acts liberally in being willing thus to enter into covenant with His
   people. We must then consider the subject simply, and by itself: man's
   declension is accidental. God then put forth a remarkable proof of His
   goodness, in promising life to all who kept His law: and this will
   remain perfect and entire. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 20:12

   12. Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and
   them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.

   12. Atque etiam sabbatha mea dedi ipsis, ut essent in signum inter me
   et ipsos, ut cognoscerent quod ego sim (vel, ego sum) Iehovah, qui
   ipsos sanctifico.


   Besides the law God here commends his Sabbaths, which we know to be
   only a part of His law: nay, whoever compares the commandments one by
   one, will at first sight perceive more weight in others than in the
   fourth. For what is the meaning of that commandment, You shall not have
   any strange god? You shall not make any idols? Afterwards, Do not take
   God's name in vain? (Exodus 20:3, 4, 7; Deuteronomy 5:7, 8, 11.) I
   answer, that the Prophet takes one precept of the law the better to
   explain what I have already touched on before, namely, that the law was
   given to the Israelites to bind them more and more to their benefactor.
   For God was unwilling to cast them away after redeeming them: but he
   testified by his law that he would be the guide of their whole life.
   Still the Prophet looked further, meaning, that the law consisted not
   only of the commandments, but embraced the whole grace of God, on which
   the adoption of the nation depended. For if God had simply commanded
   either one thing or another, it would not have been easy to perceive
   and taste his goodness. Why so? because when he calls upon us to
   discharge a duty, every one, feels that a greater burden is imposed on
   him than he can bear. Even if the promise should entice us by its
   sweetness, -- he who does these things shall live in them; yet when we
   try, we are deficient through being destitute of all power. But the
   Prophet means that something else was intended by the Sabbath, that the
   Israelites might acknowledge themselves separated by God, so as to
   experience him for their Father in all things. Hence, though the
   precepts of the law were somewhat distasteful; yet, as the fourth
   commandment has in it a gratuitous promise, it has a different savor,
   since the people thus recognizes itself as elected by God for a
   peculiar nation: and this the Prophet sufficiently expresses by the
   word sanctifying, for it means that the people were separated from the
   profane nations to be God's peculiar inheritance. If any one wishes to
   render sanctify by one word it will be, "to separate." But the meaning
   of separation ought to be explained. How, then, did God separate a
   certain people from the whole world? Why, by promising to Abraham that
   he would be a God to his seed. (Genesis 22:17.) Then he could not
   otherwise be their God than by gratuitously loving his elect, by
   regenerating them by his Spirit, and becoming propitious and easily
   entreated: and besides, a single people could not be separated from
   others without a mediator. For separation cannot last unless the people
   be united to God; and what bond of union is there without a mediator?

   Now, therefor, we understand why the Prophet speaks of the Sabbath,
   since he had formerly commended the whole law, of which the Sabbath was
   a part, namely, because it displayed God's gratuitous adoption; and at
   the same time the Israelites might acknowledge that the way of approach
   to God was open to them, and he was rendered placable; then that they
   were not adopted in vain, but were sought by God, that he should renew
   them by his Spirit, and rule the whole course of their life. It was,
   then, the greatest ingratitude to break the Sabbath, as will be said
   shortly afterwards. But this passage teaches that God was not pleased
   with the people's quiet or ease when he commanded them to keep the
   seventh day holy, but he has another intention. Whence we gather that
   that precept was shadowy: for there are some things which please God of
   themselves, and must be performed; but others have a different object.
   For to worship one God, to abominate idols, to use God's name
   reverently, these things are, as I have said, the simple duties of
   piety in themselves: so the honor which sons pay to their parents is a
   duty pleasing to God in itself, like chastity, abstinence, and such
   like. But Sabbaths do not please God simply and by themselves. We
   ought, therefore, to look for another purpose, if we wish to understand
   the reason of this precept. And hence Paul says, that Sabbaths were
   shadows of those things of which Christ is the substance. (Colossians
   2:16, 17.) This, therefore, is one point. Ezekiel is not the first who
   says so, though he took it from Moses; for though he does not clearly
   say in so many words that the Sabbath was the symbol of sanctification,
   yet he afterwards shows this to be its object, (Exodus 31:13, 14,) and
   that God commanded the people to rest on the seventh day with this
   intent. Moses then himself shows that the command had another object,
   which Ezekiel interprets for us; but the matter is made much clearer in
   the Gospel, since in Christ the truth and substance of this precept is
   set forth, which Paul calls the body. I have, then, sufficiently
   explained this object., namely, that the Israelites might know God to
   be their sanctifier. But if we desire to understand the matter better,
   we ought first to lay it down that the Sabbath was the sign of
   mortification. God, therefore, sanctifies us; because when we remain in
   our natural state we are there mixed with others, and have nothing
   different from unbelievers: hence, therefore, it is necessary to begin
   by dying to ourselves and the world, and by exercising self-denial; and
   this depends on the grace of God. But I perceive that I cannot complete
   the subject today so I shall put it off till tomorrow.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you have not only deigned to bestow upon us
   a rule for living rightly, but has so shown thyself our Father in
   Christ as to be prepared to engrave thy law in our inward parts: Grant,
   I pray thee, that we may not cast away that inestimable boon through
   either ingratitude or sloth; but may we offer up ourselves to thee as a
   sacrifice: and then do you so pardon us that our infirmities may not
   hinder us from finding thee always propitious whenever we fly to thy
   mercy in Christ, your only-begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Lecture Sixty-Second.

   We said in yesterday's lecture, that God's Church was separated from
   the profane nations that he might regenerate it by his Spirit: we said
   also, that the Sabbath was a proof of this favor; but now a
   confirmation of this teaching must be added. This is easily gathered
   from the institution of the Sabbath, when God is said to have rested
   from his work on the seventh day. (Genesis 2:2; Exodus 20:11, and
   31:17; Deuteronomy 5:14.) Now there is no doubt that he wished to bring
   the faithful to imitate his example: it follows, then, that rest was
   enjoined upon the ancient people, that they should each rest from their
   works, and so conform themselves to God's example. For we are said to
   rest from our works when we are dead to ourselves; and allow ourselves
   to be governed by God's Spirit, when we live in him, and he in us. Now,
   therefore, we see that the grace of regeneration was promised to the
   ancient people when God consecrated the seventh day; and the Apostle
   also shows this in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where he treats of the
   true and lawful use of the Sabbath, and refutes the gross supposition
   with which the Jews were imbued, that God was properly worshipped by an
   outward rest. (Hebrews 4:5.) he shows them that it was only an outward
   symbol, and that it contained a spiritual mystery. It now follows, as I
   lately touched on it, that the Sabbath was a sacrament, since it was a
   visible figure of an invisible grace. And this also is expressed with
   sufficient clearness by the Prophet, when he says, the Sabbath was
   given for a sign. By this word, therefore, he shows that regeneration
   was promised to the ancient people; and if I may use the expression by
   a visible word, since God not only spoke, but wished some symbol or
   pledge or mark of his promise to be perpetual. The phrase between me
   and you must be noticed: from which we gather that there is a mutual
   agreement in the sacraments, by which God binds us to himself, and we
   mutually pledge our faith. And hence also their foolishness is refuted
   who think the sacraments nothing but marks of outward separation: for
   if the sacraments concern only the profession of faith, it is
   inconsistent with the Prophet's teaching that they are a mutual and
   reciprocal sign, as I may express it, since God requires faith on the
   part of his people; and he promises in return what he witnesses and
   prefigures by an outward sign. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 20:13-14

   13. But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they
   walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a
   man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly
   polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the
   wilderness, to consume them.

   13. Et rebelles fuerunt in me [262] domus Israel [263] in deserto: in
   decretis meis non ambularunt, et judicia mea spreverunt: qua qui
   fecerit homo rivet in ipsis: et Sabbatha mea violarunt valde: et dixi
   [264] effundere excandescentiam meam super eos in deserto ad
   consumendum eos.

   14. But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted
   before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.

   14. Et feci propter nomen meum, ut non profanaretur in oculis gentium,
   sub quarum oculis eduxeram ipsos.


   Here God pronounces that the sons were like their fathers; and that the
   people, after their deliverance from Egypt, were so obstinate in their
   wickedness as not to profit in any way. He had complained already
   before of their rejecting his grace: for it is equivalent to rejecting
   all offers to be corrupted by superstitions, and not to cleanse
   themselves from that defilement, although they knew it to be abominable
   before God. But after the law was promulgated, they then might have put
   away their perverse affections. And surely redemption ought to have
   conformed them to obey God; when they beheld his hand stretched out as
   it were from heaven, how was it that this spectacle did not avail to
   humble them, and to make them submissive to God? But in addition to the
   teaching of the law, God's promise was given, by which he bore witness
   to them, that, if they sought from him the spirit of regeneration,
   [16]the Sabbath would be really given them as a pledge and sign of it;
   and since all these things produced no effect, that was a proof of
   astounding contumacy. God says, therefore, that he obtained nothing
   more in the desert than he had formerly experienced from the people
   under their Egyptian tyranny: then, also, says he, the house of Israel
   exasperated me in the desert. The circumstance of place must be
   noticed, because they were wonderfully rescued by God's incredible
   power, and they depended every moment on his good pleasure; for there
   they wanted food and drink: God daily rained down manna from heaven,
   and brought them water from the rock. (Exodus 16:14; Numbers 11:9;
   Deuteronomy 8:15, 16.) Since, therefore, necessity compelled them every
   moment to look to God, was it not more than brutal stupidity to
   exasperate God? When men grow wanton, it arises from becoming
   intoxicated by prosperity, and forgetful of their lot through not
   feeling how much they need God's help. But when death is presented to
   our view, when terror hems us in on every side, when God is up in arms
   against us, what madness it is to despise him! We see, then, why the
   Prophet dwells so on this point.

   He says too, they did not walk in God's precepts, and they despised his
   judgments. He confirms what was said yesterday, that they were not
   deceived through ignorance, but manifested utter contempt of God, since
   they knew well enough what was pleasing to him. Since, then, they had a
   sure rule which could not deceive them, we see how they wandered away
   after their own superstitions by deliberate wickedness. This is the
   reason, then, why Ezekiel says that they despised God's judgments. He
   repeats the promise which I expounded yesterday. For this reason also
   availed to exaggerate their crime, namely, the mildness of God in
   deigning to allure, them: he did not command them, exactingly and
   imperiously, as he might have done, but he entered into a covenant with
   them, and testified that a reward was prepared for them if they kept
   the law. Since, therefore, they neglected this promise, we see that
   they were not only rebels, but ungrateful to God. He adds, they had
   polluted his Sabbaths; which I refer not only to the outward rite, but
   rather to the inward spirit. It is true, indeed, that their impiety was
   sufficiently notorious as to outward desecration, as it appears from
   the seventeenth chapter of Jeremiah, when he says, that they carried
   their burdens on the Sabbath, and occupied themselves in common
   business. (Jeremiah 17:21, 22.) There is no doubt that they broke the
   Sabbath when they then promiscuously transacted their own business. But
   when it is added, that they violated the Sabbath greatly or grievously,
   we may understand that profanation is denoted in the mystery itself,
   since they struck off the yoke, and gave the rein to their own desires:
   for Isaiah also shows that the Sabbath was violated in this way,
   especially when the will of men is consulted. (Isaiah 58:13.) For
   hypocrites think they have discharged every duty by abstaining from all
   work; but the Prophet replies that this is a mere laughing-stock, since
   they fast on a Sabbath for strife and contention, and then that they
   gratify their will, which is opposed to self-denial. Hence God not only
   accuses the ancient people here for not hallowing the Sabbath, but also
   for neglecting its legitimate object and use. He now repeats what we
   saw yesterday. I have determined, therefore, to pour out upon them mine
   anger in the desert to consume them. If it is asked when this was done,
   it is sufficient to reply, that God's wrath was frequently inflamed by
   the people's wickedness. For although Moses does not verbally relate
   every event, yet there is no doubt that God often threatened the people
   with destruction, as we shall soon see with reference to their
   dispersion. It follows, I did it for my name's sake, that it should not
   be profaned in the eyes of the Gentiles. God repeats again that he was
   appeased, not because he pardoned them, but because he was unwilling to
   allow his name to become a laughing-stock among the nations. We said
   that in this way God's twofold pity is commended, as he had already
   gratuitously adopted the people: hence their redemption could only be
   ascribed to his sole and gratuitous liberality, since it flowed from
   the election or adoption which we have mentioned. But though this was
   one kind of mercy, yet it did not suffice to render the people worthy
   of the grace offered them. Hence it came to pass that the promise given
   to Abraham could not profit them, unless God conquered the nation's
   iniquity. This is the meaning of the Prophet when he says, that the
   people were preserved, although unworthy of it, since God saw that
   otherwise his name would be profaned among the nations. Without doubt
   he had respect to the covenant, since the Israelites had perished a
   hundred times over without any help from the name of God unless he had
   adopted them. It was necessary, therefore, that God should spare them,
   since their preservation was connected with his sacred name and regard
   for his covenant. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 20:15

   15. Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I
   would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with
   milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;

   15. Atque etiam ego manure meam sustuli ipsis in deserto, ne inducerem
   eos in terram quam dederam ipsis fluentem lacte et melle, quae
   desiderium est cunctis terris. [265]


   God here shows that his threats were ineffectual, even when he
   inflicted severe punishment, yet the people were not broken down and
   subdued: and this is a sign of a most perverse disposition. The foolish
   are at length corrected with rods, but when those who are chastised
   become worse instead of repenting, they betray their desperate
   character. God therefore here signifies that the Israelites were of an
   abandoned disposition, because there were no means of bringing them
   back to good conduct. At first he enticed them by his mercy, then gave
   them the law, and added a sacrament, as we have seen; but this proved
   wholly useless: what remained then, except to terrify them partly by
   threats and partly by punishments? He tried both, for he threatened
   them when they sinned, without any advantage: then he showed them in
   reality that theirs was no vain terror, since all those died in the
   desert who had refused to go forward when he called them into the land
   of Canaan. (Numbers 32:10.) Since, they were not bent by those signs of
   God's wrath, their contumacy appears so great, that they ought to
   perish a hundred times over. I also, says he, raised my hand; he
   doubtless means that he swore, as we gather from Moses and from the
   Psalms, I swore in my wrath if they should enter into my rest. (Psalm
   95:11.) He says then that he raised his hand; we have explained whence
   the simile is taken, that I would not bring them into the land which I
   had given them. Here God emphatically shows how formidable that
   punishment was, as it deprived them of that sure heritage which he had
   bestowed on them: for before they were born they were lords of the land
   of Canaan -- since four hundred years before it was promised to Abraham
   in their name. Since they cast themselves off from this inheritance,
   they plainly displayed their slothfulness: I had given them an
   inheritance, says he, for they compelled me to swear: I swore that they
   should not reach it. He adds, a land flowing with milk and honey,
   desired by all nations. By these words he enlarges upon the people's
   ingratitude, since they despised no mean benefit, but a land in which
   they might dwell happily. For God had so enriched it with his gifts,
   that they might have been as it were in paradise. Since then such
   fertility did not attract them to obey God, hence it appears, that they
   were in every way refractory. It afterwards follows --

   Ezekiel 20:16

   16. Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes,
   but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.

   16. Propterea quod in judiciis meis spreverunt: [266] in decretis meis
   non ambularunt et sabbatha mea polluerunt, [267] quia post idola sua
   [268] cot eorum ambulavit.


   The reason of the oath of which mention has been made is expressed by
   Moses, because being frightened by a false report they wished to return
   to Egypt: but here a cause is assigned to their superstitions. (Numbers
   13:32, 33, and Numbers 14:1-3.) But it suits each case well, since if
   they had been sincerely obedient to God, they would never have refused
   to remove their camp, and fearlessly to proceed where he commanded
   them. But since they first detested the land, and then terror and
   despair seized their minds so that they rejected the inestimable
   blessing of God, it is clear that not a drop of piety existed in their
   hearts. Although therefore the special reason why they did not enter
   the land of Canaan was their refusing to obey the call of God, yet the
   Prophet adds also their superstitions. For impiety and contempt of God
   was the reason why they so boldly, proudly, and furiously rejected the
   grace of God, and wished even to stone Moses, and then when penitent
   they encouraged each other to return to live again under the tyranny of
   Egypt. We see, therefore, how the Prophet here lays down general causes
   from which that impious dislike of the land proceeded, as well as the
   rejection of the grace of God. He says, therefore, because they had
   despised my judgments and had not walked in my statutes. He here
   inverts the order: he had formerly said that they had not walked in his
   statutes and had despised my judgments; but now he begins with the
   contempt: and have polluted my Sabbaths, because their hearts went
   after their idols. The sense is, that they always treated God
   deceitfully: and although they held that he was to be worshipped
   formally, yet they were always addicted to various superstitions: as
   also Stephen reproves them, (Acts 7:40-43,) for he agrees entirely with
   our Prophet. As he puts Sabbaths in the plural number, I do not
   interpret it so strictly as some do, thinking that the Prophet means
   Sabbaths of years, and afterwards the jubilee: for there were three
   Sabbaths among the Jews; that is, every seventh day was consecrated to
   God, and every seventh year, and every fiftieth. Although it is true
   that years were sabbatical as well as days, yet I do not think that the
   Prophet is making any subtle distinctions here but I take Sabbath to
   mean the seventh day. It now follows --

   facerem ipsos [270] consumptionem in deserto.


   This is added, because God often afflicted the people with heavy
   punishments, but he restrained himself, that he should not utterly
   destroy both their persons and their name. He says, then, that he
   spared them through respect for his own name, as he formerly said, that
   he should not execute consumption on them; that is, that he should not
   utterly blot out the memory of them. He did not spare them entirely to
   foster their depravity by his indulgence, but as we shall afterwards
   see, he withdrew his hand that he should not consume them, as he might
   most justly have done. It now follows --

   vestrorum ne ambuletis, et indicia ipsorum ne servetis: et in idolis
   [272] ipsorum ne polluamini.

   19. I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments,
   and do them;

   19. Ego Iehovah Deus vester, in decretis meis ambulate, et judicia mea
   servate, et facite ea.


   After God has shown that the obstinate wickedness of the people was
   such that they profited by neither rigor nor clemency, he now says that
   the sons were altogether like their fathers. For when he says that he
   turned his discourse to their sons, he obliquely indicates that he was
   so broken down by their disgust, that he is unwilling to address the
   deaf. I said, therefore, to their sons: why not to themselves? because
   they had become obdurate in their impiety, and gave no hope of
   repentance. Since then God had experienced their utmost obstinacy, he
   says that he turned his discourse to their sons; Do not walk in the
   statutes of your fathers, and do not observe their judgments. Here God
   does not speak of bad examples and of plain and palpable crimes, but he
   uses words seemingly favorable -- judgments and statutes. If he had
   simply said that their fathers were wicked, and hence the sons must
   take care not to imitate them, that would have been ordinary teaching;
   but by adaptation he uses honorable expressions, namely, my statutes
   and judgments. Meanwhile he forbids their posterity to conform to the
   statutes and laws of their fathers, meaning to their ceremonies and
   rites. Lest any should object that those statutes were to be observed
   which tend to a right end, he adds, that you pollute not yourselves
   with their filth and defilements. Here the former language of
   accommodation is removed, and God as it were wipes away the coloring,
   that it may be clearly apparent that those statutes and precepts
   differed in nothing from thefts, robberies, and adulteries: this is the
   Prophet's meaning.

   Besides, this passage is worthy of notice, because we may learn from it
   how frivolous is the excuse of those who boast of their fathers, and
   arrogantly predict that they will be pardoned if they conform
   themselves to their example. For God not only forbids us to imitate the
   gross and open wickedness of our parents, but their laws, statutes, and
   ceremonies, and whatever is apparently plausible, and seems to the
   common sense of mankind worthy of praise. And thus the foolishness of
   the papists is detected, who think that they lie safely concealed under
   the shield of Ajax, when they boast to us of the examples of their
   fathers, and the value of antiquity: we clearly see how plainly God's
   Spirit refutes them when he pronounces that they must obey his statutes
   and precepts, and not listen to open wickedness only, but not even to
   good intentions, as they say, and devotions, and the traditions of the
   fathers. But what is the worship of God in the papacy in these days but
   a confused jumble, which they have thrown together from numberless
   fictions? for whoever will examine all their trifling, will find them
   fabricated by the will of man; and they are not ashamed to oppose the
   traditions of their fathers to the word of God. Now, therefore, we see
   the whole papacy laid prostrate, and all the remarkable traditions of
   the fathers in which they boast, when the Prophet says, walk you not in
   the statutes of your fathers. But since antiquity deserves some
   reverence, it would be gross and barbarous promiscuously to reject all
   the examples of the fathers: hence we need prudence and selection here,
   and God's Spirit suggests this to us when he adds pollution's or idols.
   Hence the traditions of the fathers must be examined; and it is a mark
   of prudent discretion to observe what they contain, and whence they
   proceed. If we discover that they have no other tendency than to the
   pure worship of God, we may embrace them; but if they draw us away from
   the pure and simple worship of God, if they infect true and sincere
   religion by their own mixtures, we must utterly reject them.

   Let us proceed then. I, says he, am Jehovah your God; walk you in my
   statutes, and observe my judgments. God confirms the former sentence,
   and at the same time provides a remedy for all corruption's when he
   says, walk you in my precepts, because I am your God: for by these
   words he claims as peculiarly his own what men commonly arrogate to
   themselves. They do not dare, indeed, to despoil God of his authority,
   but they carry themselves as his allies, and infect his law with their
   commentaries, as if it was not sufficient for complete and solid
   wisdom. Here, therefore, God pronounces himself to be the only
   lawgiver. If, therefore, I am your God, walk you in. my statutes. Hence
   it follows, that we indirectly deny God when we turn aside even a
   little from his law. The passage is remarkable, if we only estimate the
   Prophet's language aright. For the two clauses must be read together,
   because I am your God, therefore walk you in precepts, and thus show
   that you are my people. But if they are not content with God's precepts
   only, but mingle human comments with them, God indirectly teaches that
   he is not acknowledged, since they deprive him of a portion of his
   rights; for if God is one, he also is the only lawgiver. It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:20

   20. And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and
   you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.

   20. Et sabbatha mea sanctificate, et erunt in signum inter me et vos,
   ad cognoscendum [273] quod ego Iehovah Deus vester.


   What he had said generally concerning the commandments he now applies
   again to the Sabbath, and not without reason. For, as we said
   yesterday, God not only wished by that day of rest to exact from the
   people what was due to him, but he rather commands it for another
   purpose, namely, that his Sabbaths should be sanctified. But the manner
   of keeping it holy was formerly explained, since mere rest was
   insufficient. God was not satisfied by the people's resting from their
   occupations, but the inward sanctification was always the chief end in
   view. And for this reason he also repeats again, that they may be a
   sign between me and you to show you that I Jehovah am your God. In this
   passage God bears witness, that if the Jews rightly observed their
   Sabbaths they should feel the effects of that favor which he wished to
   be represented thereby. For we said that the Sabbath was a sacrament of
   regeneration: now therefore he promises the efficacy of his Spirit, if
   they did not shut the door by their own impiety and contempt. Hence we
   see that sacraments are never destitute of the virtue of the Spirit
   unless when men render themselves unworthy of the grace offered them.
   When papists speak of the sacraments they say that they are
   efficacious, if we only remove the obstacle of mortal sin: they make no
   mention of faith. If a person is neither a thief, nor an adulterer, nor
   a homicide, they say that the sacraments produce their own effect: for
   example, if any one without a single particle of faith intrudes himself
   at the table of Christ, they say that he receives not only his body and
   blood, but the fruit of his death and resurrection, and only because he
   has not committed mortal sin; that is, cannot be convicted of theft or
   homicide. We see how they are steeped in blindness, according to God's
   just judgment. We must hold, therefore, that there is a mutual relation
   between faith and the sacraments, and hence, that the sacraments are
   effective through faith. Man's unworthiness does not detract anything
   from them, for they always retain their nature. Baptism is the laver of
   regeneration, although the whole world should be incredulous (Titus
   3:5:) the Supper of Christ is the communication of his body and blood,
   (1 Corinthians 10:16,) although there were not a spark of faith in the
   world: but we do not perceive the grace which is offered to us; and
   although spiritual things always remain the same, yet we do not obtain
   their effect nor perceive their value, unless we cautious that our want
   of faith should not profane what God has consecrated our salvation.
   [274]

   [273] That is, "that you may recognize, or know." -- Calvin.

   [274] At a period when the controversy concerning the efficacy of
   sacraments is revived with all its former virulence, and the authority
   of Calvin is often called in to decide between conflicting statements,
   the language of this passage is worthy of special notice. It would
   startle some of our modern critics to find Calvin calling the Sabbath
   "a Sacrament of regeneration." In treating this class of subjects, it
   is essential to ascertain the exact ideas of the medieval
   controversialists, and to perceive how very different they were from
   our own. For example, Protestants of the present day would pronounce
   any man unsound who allowed of more sacraments than two, while
   Romanists would require all men to admit them to be seven; yet Calvin
   would have no objection to the assertion that there are seventy. He
   used the word for what is now currently expressed by the phrase "the
   means of grace." All aids and helps to the cultivation of the life of
   God in the soul have been termed sacramental; and by using the word in
   a comprehensive sense, the assertion is strictly true. Sabbaths are to
   us, as well as to the Jews, means of grace, conducive to regeneration.
   Calvin also asserts that these means of grace are never destitute of
   the Holy Spirit's virtue, except we render ourselves unworthy of the
   grace which they contain. He differs from the papists, not with
   reference to what a sacrament is in itself, but as to the need of faith
   in the recipient for the personal advantage to be derived from it. The
   opinion is absolutely expressed, that they always retain their nature,
   on the principle that spiritual things always remain the same: man's
   unbelief is said to make no difference as to the reality of the grace
   inherent in the sacrament; it only affects our reception of it. The
   spiritual blessing is there: our want of faith is the only cause why
   the blessing does not pass by the appointed channel to the unworthy
   recipient. As the sentiments of our Reformer are sometimes quoted in
   support of views very different from this, the reader's attention is
   particularly directed to his commentary on this verse, since the
   greatest errors arise from interpreting controversial phrases by the
   modern meaning which the words have acquired. The history of opinions
   which have formerly prevailed on subjects deeply interesting to
   ourselves is always serviceable towards the formation of accurate
   opinions. Hence we may here refer to Dr. Lawrence's Bampton Lectures
   for the year 1804, in which the lecturer has distinctly stated the
   different views taken by the Papists and the Schoolmen, the Lutherans
   and the followers of Zwingle and Calvin. In Sermon 6, page 123, he
   makes the same statement with reference to the papists as Calvin does
   in his comment on this verse, viz., "asserting, among other
   extravagancies, that the Sacraments are in themselves efficacious by
   virtue of their own operation, exclusively of all merit in the
   recipient." In notes on Sermon 3, page 276, he adds, "The Lutherans
   contended that the Holy Spirit was efficacious in baptism;" and quotes
   Calvin's letter to Melancthon, "non inanes esse figuras sed reipsa
   praestari, quidquid figurant. In baptismo adesse spiritus efficaciam,
   ut nos abluat et regeneret." See also his opinion on the state of the
   children of Christians dying unbaptized. Instit., lib. 4. cap. 15,
   section 22. The view of Zwingle will be found in his Declaratio de
   peccato originali, Op., volume 2 page 118; and Epist. Urbano Regio,
   volume 1, p. 383; and of Bullinger, in his treathese adversus
   Cala-baptistarum prava dogmata, page 57. It will not be expected that
   the admirers of Calvin will be satisfied with Dr. Lawrence's reasonings
   and conclusions; but the notes to his discourses form a most valuable
   digest of the views of the Schoolmen and the various Reformers of
   celebrity, selected with judgment from the voluminous disputations of
   those stirring times. See also the [17]Dissertation on this verse at
   the end of this volume.

   Grant, Almighty God, since the doctrine of thy Gospel sounds daily in
   our ears, when you invite us so kindly by thy amazing clemency, and
   stretch out your hand by your only-begotten Son, -- Grant, I pray thee,
   that we may be of a teachable and flexible disposition, and that we may
   sincerely submit to thee: and since thy law contains so many dreadful
   examples of thy wrath, may we be moved by them, and may we walk with
   fear and trembling in obedience to thy word, that at length we may
   enjoy that inheritance which you have promised for us in thy heavenly
   kingdom, by the same Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Ezekiel 20:21-24

   21. Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not
   in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if man do,
   he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I
   would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them
   in the wilderness.

   21. Et rebelles fuerunt [275] me filii: in decretis meis non
   ambulaverunt, et judicia mea non servarunt, ut ea facerent: quae qui
   fecerit homo rivet in ipsis: sabbatha mea profanarunt: et dixi [276]
   effundere iracundiam meam, [277] super eos ad complendum iram meam in
   ipsis in deserto.

   22. Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake,
   that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose
   sight I brought them forth.

   22. Et retraxi [278] manure meam: et feci propter nomen meum, ne
   profanaretur in oculis gentium e quarum oculis eduxeram eos.

   23. I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I
   would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the
   countries;

   23. Etiam ego levavi [279] ad disjiciendos ipsos inter gentes, et
   spargendos per terras;

   24. Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my
   statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their
   fathers' idols.

   24. Eo quod judicia mea non fecerunt, et statuta mea repudiarunt, et
   sabbatha mea violarunt, et post idola patrum suorum fuerunt eorum
   oculi.


   I join these four verses together, because they have been already
   explained, and I do not wish to burden you with useless repetitions. In
   short, God accuses the whole posterity, because they were by no means
   more obedient than their fathers. Again, he charges them with
   rebellion, since they neither obeyed His commands, nor were persuaded
   by mild promises; for, on the one hand, he demanded the worship due to
   him, and invited them softly by the promise of reward. He complains
   that; neither plan succeeded. He adds, what we have already seen, that
   he proposed to scatter them through various quarters of the world, and
   utterly to dissipate them. He assigns as a reason for his moderation
   his unwillingness that his name should be profaned among the nations:
   he also announces that they had never restrained their impiety from
   bursting forth, and hence it was only through his own incredible
   patience and indulgence that they had not perished a hundred, nay, a
   thousand times. The rest may be gathered from the previous context. It
   follows --

   Ezekiel 20:25

   25. Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and
   judgments whereby they should not live;

   25. Ego quoque dedi illis decreta non bona, et judicia in quibus ton
   vivent.


   Here God announces that he had taken vengeance upon people so hard and
   obstinate, by permitting them to endure another yoke, since they would
   not be ruled by the doctrine of the law; for we saw that, when God
   imposed the law upon the Israelites, they would have been extremely
   happy, had they only considered how honorable it was to be in covenant
   with God, who deigned to bind them to himself in mutual fidelity. This
   was a remarkable honor and privilege, since God not only showed them
   what was right, but promised them a reward which he by no means owed
   them. But what was the conduct of that unteachable nation? It threw off
   the yoke of the law; hence it deserved to experience a different
   government. God, therefore, gave them laws that were not good, when he
   suffered them to be miserably subjected to an immense heap of errors:
   such laws as these were not good. Some writers have violently distorted
   this passage, by thinking the law itself, as promulgated by Moses, "not
   good," since Paul calls it deadly; but they corrupt the Prophet's
   sense, since God is comparing his law with the superstitions of the
   Gentiles: others explain it of the tributes which the people were
   compelled to pay to foreigners. But, first of all, God does not speak
   here of only one age; nay, during the, time of the Israelites' freedom
   his vengeance was nevertheless severe.

   Thus, in the next verse, the Prophet confirms what I have briefly
   touched on, namely, that the laws called not good are all the fictions
   of men, by which they harass themselves, while they think that God is
   worshipped acceptably in this way: for we know how miserably men labor
   and distract themselves when Satan has fascinated them with his toils,
   and when they anxiously invent numerous rites, because there is no end
   of their superstitions; hence these statutes are not good: for when
   they have undergone much labor in their idolatry, no other reward
   awaits them than God's appearance against them as an avenger to punish
   the profanation of his own lawful worship. They indeed by no means look
   for this, but they utterly deceive themselves; hence they must hope for
   no reward but what is founded on the covenant and promise of God; for
   all false and vicious forms of worship, all adventitious rites, which
   men heap together from all sides, have no promise from God, and hence
   they vainly trust to them for life. God began to show them this in the
   wilderness; but in succeeding ages he did not fail to exercise the same
   vengeance. We see how they fell in with the superstitions of the
   Moabites; and why so? unless God blinded them by his just judgments.
   (Numbers 25:1-3.) He had experienced their untamed dispositions, and so
   he set them free from control; and not only so, but afterwards gave
   them up to Satan, and so he says that he gave them laws that were not
   good. The Prophet might indeed have said, that they despised God's law
   through their own wisdom, that they foolishly and rashly legislated for
   themselves: this was indeed true; but he wished to express the penalty
   of which Paul speaks, when he says that the impious were delivered to a
   reprobate mind, and to obedience to a lie, (Romans 1:24-26,) since they
   did not submit to the truth, and did not suffer themselves to be ruled
   by God, and thus were given up to the tyranny of Satan and to the
   service of mere creatures. Now, therefore, we understand the Prophet's
   meaning, I have given them also, says he, laws not good, as if he had
   said that the people so threw themselves into various idolatries, that
   God desired in this way to avenge their incredible obstinacy; for if
   the Jews had calmly acquiesced in God's sovereignty, he had not given
   them evil laws, that is, he had not suffered them to be so tormented
   under Satan's tyranny; but when they were entangled in his snares, God
   openly shows them to be unworthy of his government and care, since they
   were too refractory. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 20:26

   26. And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass
   through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them
   desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.

   26. Et contaminavi ipsos in suis muneribus, trajiciendo quidquid aperit
   vulvam, ut perderem ipsos, ut quod, (sed supervacuum est,) ut
   cognoscant quod ego Iehovah.


   There is no doubt that God here continues the same doctrine' hence we
   gather that injurious laws were given to the people when they adopted
   various errors and worshipped idols of their own fabrication instead of
   God: hence it is added, I polluted them in their gifts. This, then, was
   added by the Prophet, lest the Jews should object that they had not
   altogether rejected the worship of God; for they mingled the ceremonies
   of the laws with the fictions of the Gentiles, as we saw before, and
   the Prophet will shortly repeat: in this way they thought they
   discharged their duty to God, though they added mixtures of their own.
   Here the Prophet meets them, and cuts off all occasion for turning
   aside, since they were polluted in their gifts, and nothing was pure or
   sincere when they thus corrupted God's precepts by their comments.
   However, they daily offered their gifts, and professed to present them
   to the true God; yet they obtained no advantage, because God abominated
   mixtures of this kind, as we have previously said; for he cannot bear
   to be worshipped by the will of men, but wishes his children to be
   simply content with his commands. Now, we perceive the meaning of the
   Prophet -- God pollutes them in their gifts; that is, renders their
   gifts polluting whenever they think that they discharge their duty; --
   but how? why, he says, when they cause whatever opens the womb to pass
   through. [280] Here the Prophet touches on only one kind of
   superstition, but, by a figure of speech, he means all kinds, by which
   the Jews vitiated God's pure worship; for this superstition was very
   detestable, to pass their sons through the fire, and to consecrate them
   to idols. But in this passage God speaks only of the first-born, so as
   greatly to exaggerate the crime: that ceremony was indeed general; but
   since God claimed the first-born as his own, and wished them to be
   redeemed at a fixed price, (Exodus 13:2, Exodus 22:29, and Exodus
   34:19, 20,) and by this act wished the remembrance of their redemption
   to be kept up, since all the first-born of Israel, as well as of
   animals, had escaped, while those of the Egyptians perished, (Numbers
   3:13, and Numbers 8:16,) was it not monstrous to pass through the fire,
   and to offer to idols those who were specially devoted and sacred to
   God? We see, then, that the Prophet does not speak in vain of the
   first-born.

   That I should destroy thou, says he, and they should know that I am
   Jehovah. God here shows that he had proceeded gradually to the final
   vengeance; and for this reason the people were the more convicted of
   stupidity, since they never perceived God's judgments manifest. If God
   had suddenly and impetuously issued his vengeance from heaven, men's
   astonishment would not have been wonderful; but when he grants them
   space of time and a truce that they may weigh the matter at leisure,
   and admonishes them to repentance, not once only, but often; and then
   if they remain always the same and are not effected, they show
   themselves utterly desperate by this slothfulness, as the Prophet now
   asserts. But when he adds, that they may know that I am Jehovah, he
   means that as he was not acknowledged as a father by the Jews, he would
   be their judge, and compel them whether they would or not to feel the
   formidable nature of that power which they despised. Since we have
   treated this subject fully before, we now pass it by more lightly. Yet
   we must notice this, that God is recognized by the reprobate, since,
   when his fatherly goodness has been for a long time despised by them,
   he at length appears as a judge, and draws them against their will to
   his tribunal, and executes his vengeance, so that they cannot escape.
   It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:27-28

   27. Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto
   them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed
   me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.

   27. Propterea loquere ad domum Israel, fili hominis, et dic illis, Sic
   dicit Dominator Iehovah: Adhuc in hoc contumeliosi in me fuerunt me,
   patres vestri praevaricando in me praevaricatione.

   28. For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted
   up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all
   the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there
   they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made
   their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink-offerings.

   28. Nam introduxi [281] in terram pro qua sustuleram manum meam ad
   dandum eam ipsis: et viderunt omnem collem excelsum, et omnem arborem
   frondosam: et sacrificarunt illic sacrificia sua, et obtulerunt illic
   irritationem oblationis suae, et posuerunt illic odorem bonae
   fragrantiae suae, et fuderunt illic sua libamina.


   He now descends to the wickedness of the people, by which God was
   provoked after they had taken possession of the land of Canaan, since
   they despised God after being so carefully warned. He complains,
   therefore, that this was very disgraceful, since, after he had put them
   in possession of the land of promise, they had never desisted from
   purposely insulting him. This disgrace was intolerable, since he had
   profited nothing by them in the wilderness: this witnessing was
   sufficiently serious to stir them up. "Walk you not in the decrees of
   your fathers: I am your God, observe you my law." Since. therefore, God
   drew them under obedience to himself, what a mark of pride it was not
   to attend to that witness-bearing, but to pursue their own mad career?
   In truth, the crime was the more atrocious when at length they entered
   the land of Canaan, and had obtained so many victories, that they did
   not learn by experience how God declared his pourer for the very
   purpose of binding them closer to himself. For the numerous benefits
   which God had conferred upon them were but so many bonds by which they
   were bound more closely to him. This expostulation, then, is not in
   vain, when he reproaches them by saying, when they dishonored me, or
   rebelled against me. This was not a single crime, or simple perfidy,
   but a continual delight in wantonly insulting him; for gdph, gedef,
   signifies to reject, treat contumeliously, or disdain. God, therefore,
   by this word wishes to express the deliberate insolence of the people,
   while they rose so wickedly against him as if they would spit in his
   face. The full meaning is, that they were not only breakers of treaties
   and rebels when they contaminated the land of Canaan with their
   superstitions, but were so petulant that they professedly threw scorn
   upon God.

   Hence, after I had brought them into the land for which, or concerning
   which, I had lifted up my hand to give it them, they saw, says he,
   every high hill, and every green or branching tree, and there they
   sacrificed. God wished to have one altar built for himself, and
   sacrifices to be offered in one place; nay, before the people had any
   certain and fixed station, God was unwilling that any altar should be
   built to him of polished stones, that no trace of it should remain; but
   a mound only was to be made of either turf or rough stones. (Exodus
   20:25; Deuteronomy 27:5, 6.) Now he says, whenever hills and branching
   trees were lying before them, there they found enticements to
   superstition. This, therefore, is the reproach which God now complains
   was offered to him. But this passage, like many others, teaches, that
   not only is God's worship corrupted when his honor is transferred to
   idols, but also when men heap up their own fictions, and contaminate
   God's commands by the mixture. We must remember, then, that there are
   two kinds of idolatries; the one being grossest when idols are
   worshipped openly, and Moloch, or any Baal, is substituted for the
   living God: that is a palpable superstition, because God is in some
   sense cast down from his throne. But the other kind of idolatry,
   although more hidden, is abominable before God, namely, when, under the
   disguise of a name, men boldly mingle whatever comes into their minds,
   and invent various modes of worship; as at present we see in the papacy
   statues adored, and dead men invoiced, and God's honor violated in
   various ways. Hence, however, the papists chatter, they are
   self-convicted, and the wonder is that they are not utterly silenced,
   since their superstitions are so gross that even boys perceive them.
   But there are other superstitions more specious and refined; for when
   they have invented many things in honor of God, they will not bring
   forward the names of either St. Barbara or St. Christopher, but the
   name of God covers all those abominations. But we see that this excuse
   is frivolous, when men assert that they have nothing else in their mind
   than the worship of God. Not only does God wish worship to be offered
   to himself alone, but that it should be without any dependence on human
   will: he wishes the law to be the single rule of true worship; and thus
   he rejects all fictitious rites. Hence the Prophet deservedly excuses
   the Israelites, because they turned their eyes towards every high hill
   and every branching tree, and there offered the provocation of their
   offering. He calls it the provocation of their offering, since they not
   only foolishly poured forth much money on those vitiated rites, but
   also provoked God to anger. We see, therefore, that men not only lose
   their labor when they decline from God's commands, and rashly fatigue
   themselves with their own superstitions, but they provoke God to a
   contest, because they snatch from him the right of a lawgiver: for it
   is in his power to determine how he ought to be worshipped; and when
   men claim this power to themselves, it is like ascending to the very
   throne of God. But if they follow the inventions of others, still it is
   setting them up as lawgivers, while God is degraded from his tribunal.
   Thus it is not surprising if God's wrath is provoked by any sacrifices,
   besides those which the law prescribes. And this is expressed very
   clearly by Isaiah, when God announces that he will do what will
   frighten them all as an unexpected prodigy: I will blind the eyes of
   the wise, says he, and I will take away prudence from the aged. (Isaiah
   29:14.) And why so? because they worship me by the precepts of men.

   It follows, And they offered their sweet odor, or agreeable fragrance.
   These two things seem contrary to each other, that their offerings
   inflamed God's wrath, and yet their savor was sweet. But the Prophet.
   speaks ironically when he says, their incense was sweet-smelling. By
   conceding this he derides them, since they falsely supposed God was
   appeased in this way, although he reproves them at the same time for
   defiling, by their corruption's, that incense which ought to have been
   of delightful fragrance. For the language of Moses is repeated: The
   scent shall reach God's nostrils, and he shall be appeased.
   (Deuteronomy 33:10.) Since, then, the incense of the law was
   sweet-smelling, God here bitterly reproaches the Jews for infecting
   that good odor with their foulness. Hence the phrase is used in a sense
   contrary to its direct meaning. Lastly, he says, they have poured out
   their drink-offerings there. Here God reviews the various kinds of
   oblations which he had fully prescribed in the law but he shows that
   the Jews were rebellious against them all; and he further detects their
   unbridled petulance, since they had not only violated the law in one
   point, but had left no part untouched by their superstitions. God had
   commanded sacrifices, but these they rendered polluting: he added
   various oblations, yet all these they defiled: he desired libations to
   be made, and will to be poured out, but this part of the service was
   not kept pure from superstitions. Thus he shows that the people
   purposely took all means of declaring war against God, when they
   falsely pretended that nothing more was prescribed than to worship him
   as they pleased. It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:29

   29. Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And
   the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.

   29. Et dixi illis, ut quid [282] excelsum quod vos ingredimini? [283]
   et vocatum fuit nomen ejus excelsum usque ad hunc diem.


   Although there is no ambiguity in the Prophet's words, yet the sentence
   seems frigid, and interpreters, in my judgment, have not understood the
   Prophet's meaning. It may seem spiritless, that God should ask, what is
   the high place? But it means that they were not deceived through
   ignorance, since he had often cautioned them against profaning the true
   and genuine worship, for he often endeavored to draw them back again
   when he saw them wandering after their own superstitions. Hence they
   are continually rebuked by the prophets; and their obstinacy is the
   more apparent, since, nevertheless, they followed their own
   perverseness. But because all these reproaches were useless, God here
   enlarges upon their crime, since they were deaf. I have said,
   therefore; that is, by means of prophets. For we know how constantly
   the prophets discharged their duty, by urging them to worship at one
   altar only. For this reason the people's wickedness was greater; whence
   God says, What is this? and why do you so greatly desire your high
   places when they displease me, and you know my commands? your ears are
   deaf, and obstructed by wickedness. On the whole, he asks how could
   such madness seize upon them as to approach these high places, since he
   had pointed out a place where he was to be sought and invoked. My
   temple, says he, is neglected; meanwhile you run to high places, and
   yet it is known by the name of a high place. There is no mystery in
   this word; but God means that no reproaches or threats of his prophets
   could prevent the people from worshipping on these high places. He
   says, then, that the name was still used, since the same dignity and
   religious regard for them still flourished, when their remembrance
   ought to be utterly abolished. If God had only once pronounced that
   those high places were not approved by him, all ought to have changed
   their course instantly: he, exclaimed against them long and vehemently
   by his prophets, and yet the name "high places" was constantly in
   everybody's mouth; it was famous among them, as if God ought to be
   sought there. Now therefore we see that the Jews were condemned for too
   much pride, because they not only failed to desert their high places
   when repeatedly admonished, but they perniciously wished to oppose
   those places to God's sanctuary, although they were so many
   pollution's. Hence we gather the condemnation of the people's obstinate
   malice, since fathers handed down the name to their sons, so that
   through a continued posterity they opposed these high places to the
   only sanctuary of God. It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:30

   30. Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
   Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye
   whoredom after their abominations?

   30. Propterea dic ad domum Israel, Sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, An in
   via patrum vestrorum vos polluti estis? et post idola ipsorum [284] vos
   scortamini?


   Now at length the Prophet openly attacks those by whom he was
   consulted. After showing that they sprang from impure fathers -- which
   was sufficiently manifest from their never ceasing to provoke God in
   every age from the very beginning to the end -- he turns their own
   language against them, and asks, whether they were polluted after the
   superstitions of their fathers? The old interpretation is "truly;" but
   h, he, the mark of interrogation, does not allow of that. I am
   surprised at the rendering of some expositors, are you not polluted?"
   as if the word were hlv', hel-va, for in my opinion they pervert the
   Prophet's sense, for this would make him ask absurdly, what? are you
   polluted in the way of your fathers? and are you gone astray after
   their idols? For when they were in exile, that disinheriting ought to
   subdue them although they had been endued with a more than iron pride:
   and then they pretended to piety, when they came to the Prophet and
   desired to receive some consolation from him. Since, therefore, they
   pretended to some modesty, God here asks them how they could pollute
   themselves in the way of their fathers? what could it all mean? the
   things are quite contrary: you approach my servant as if you intended
   to submit your minds and your senses to my word; but when you so feign
   yourselves to be attentive to my answers, how does it happen that you
   pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers? This seems to me the
   Spirit's meaning. You shall say, then, are you polluted in the way of
   your fathers? that is, are you so obstinate as not to reflect upon your
   course, and never to look back? for you see how severely God was
   revenged on your obstinacy: you now seek me in appearance, as if this
   were your only refuge; then how is it that you pollute yourselves in
   the way of your fathers? and why do you commit fornication after their
   idols? It now follows --

   Ezekiel 20:31

   31. For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons pass through
   the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this
   day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live,
   saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.

   31. Et offerendo dona vestra, [285] et trajiciendo filios vestros per
   ignem vos polluimini in omnibus idolis vestris usque hodie: et ego
   inquirar a vobis, domus Israel? Vivo ego dicit Dominator Iehovah, si
   inquirar a vobis.


   He follows up the same sentiment, that it was a monstrous sin that they
   so perniciously remained fixed in the perverse imitation of their
   fathers: for they had been drawn off from their lusts by God's numerous
   chastisements, and then they pretended to be afterwards disposed to
   obedience: God therefore here says, why, then, by offering your gifts,
   do you make your sons pass through the fire, and pollute yourselves
   with all your idols even to this day? For this question concerns what
   is quite incredible and worthy of the greatest surprise, since there
   was no way of reconciling the sufferings of the Israelites in exile
   with their remaining obstinate in their wickedness. But the Prophet
   here again deprives them of that vain pretense with which they covered
   themselves in offering their gifts: he concedes to them what was true,
   yet, at the same time, he objects, that they passed their sons through
   the fire, and were polluted in all their idols. He adds, at length,
   shall I be inquired of by you? I have elsewhere explained that clause,
   which is now for the third time repeated. Many take it in a different
   sense, that God will not deign to answer them any more: but, in my
   opinion, he simply reproaches their perfidy, because, when they
   approached the Prophet, they wished to blind his eyes. Shall I, says
   he, be inquired of you? For drs, deresh, means to seek, and to attain
   the end of our search, when the person asked answers, and the person
   sought presents himself. But here God simply shows that they do not
   come in a right mind, and that nothing else was imposed on them except
   seeking him. But because that was almost incredible, hence he swears
   that they were merely hypocritical in pretending to true piety in
   suppliantly applying to the Prophet for an answer in God's name, and
   then wantonly deriding it, and impiously and wickedly using his name,
   and thus profaning it.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, since you do not cease thy daily exhortations to
   repentance, but indulge us, and bear with us, while you correct us by
   thy word and thy chastisements, that we may not remain obstinate, but
   may learn to submit ourselves to thee: Grant, I pray thee, that we may
   not offer ourselves as thy disciples with feigned repentance, but be so
   sincerely and cordially devoted to thee, that we may desire nothing
   else than to progress more and more in the knowledge of thy heavenly
   doctrine, till at length we enjoy that full light which we hope for
   through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- Amen.

   Ezekiel 20:32-33

   32. And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye
   say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to
   serve wood and stone.

   32. Et ascendit [286] super spiritum vestrum non erit, quia vos
   dixistis, [287] Erimus sicut gentes, sicut familiae terrarum, ut
   serviamus ligno et lapidi.

   33. As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a
   stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:

   33. Vivo ego, dicit Dominator Iehovah, Si non in manu robusta et
   brachio extento, et excandescentia effusa dominabor super vos.


   Now God discloses what those old men had in their minds who, as well as
   the rest of the captives, came to the Prophet for the purpose of
   inquiry, namely, a feeling of despair, since they thought nothing would
   be more useful to themselves than to revolt utterly from God, and to
   form themselves after the manner and rites of the Gentiles; for they
   found themselves specially hated by the profane nations, because they
   worshipped a peculiar God. Since, therefore, the law separated them
   from all the rest of the world, that they might escape that hatred and
   envy, they encouraged the perverse intention of deserting God's worship
   and passing over to the Gentiles. For they hoped that those who had
   been formerly hostile would have shown themselves favor-able. Now God
   not only announces that he would not suffer it, but he asserts with an
   oath, what you are thinking of shall not come to pass, since I will
   draw you back with a strong hand, and with an extended arm, and poured
   out wrath. The meaning is, that although those miserable captives
   desired to throw off God's yoke and to mingle themselves with the
   profane nations, yet God would have respect to his covenant and not
   suffer them to be snatched away from him, just as a master fetches back
   his fugitive slave; or like a prince who might destroy the perfidious
   and rebellious, yet only chastises them that they may groan under a
   hard slavery: this is the complete sense.

   But this passage is worthy of observation, since in the present day the
   same thought makes many anxious; for the name of sincere piety
   distresses them, and so they consult their love of ease, and satisfy
   both themselves and others by uniting with the rest of the world, and
   avoiding the hatred of mankind in consequence of their religion. Others
   again desire to escape in any way from God, because they feel him
   hostile to them, for the condition of the Church seems to them much
   worse than that of the world at large. And truly as God takes special
   care of it, so he chastises its faults more severely. We see then how
   he spares unbelievers and foreigners, as if he connived at their
   crimes: meanwhile his hand is always extended to chastise all who
   profess to be in the number of the pious. But some would desire to bid
   farewell to God, if they could choose for themselves. Hence I said we
   must observe this passage. The Israelites thought that nothing would be
   better than to be joined to the Gentiles and to become in all respects
   like them, since they imagined that in this way they would enjoy
   relaxation, since God was more lenient to the Gentiles than he had been
   to them, and because they perceived themselves exposed to many dangers
   and troubles, harassed by assaults and subject to daily threats. Hence
   that perverse deliberation which is here reproved; -- what arises in
   your mind, says he, shall not come to pass, because you say we shall be
   as the nations and the families of the earth. But we must also consider
   the end, because the people's folly was so great that they thought they
   would be free from God's chastisements, if they utterly rejected all
   religion. God therefore denies that he would suffer it. Now a clearer
   explanation follows: As I live, says he, if I will not rule over you
   with a strong hand and a stretched-out arm; in this sense -- when they
   had removed all refuges he would yet be an avenger of his rights and
   empire, so as to compel them to return to him, as we have said, and
   thus violently to bring back the fugitives. We now see the great
   stupidity of the people in thinking the only remedy for their troubles
   to be in declining from true piety. Let us then be careful that we do
   not harden ourselves when God chastises us, and desire to withdraw from
   his power and dominion. Meanwhile God shows that he will rule, but in
   some other way; because we know with what humanity he treated his
   people, and what patience he exercised towards them, when they so often
   provoked his wrath. He now announces that he would be the Lord, but
   with a strong hand and a stretched-out arm, since he would forget his
   former clemency and subject them to perverse bondage. As when a master
   sees that he cannot obtain voluntary obedience from his slaves, he
   compels them to the galleys, or other laborious works, until they
   become half dead. God denounces that such will be the condemnation
   which he will use against them, since they never profited by either
   clemency or pardon. It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:34

   34. And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out
   of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with
   a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.

   34. Et educam vos e populis, et colligam vose terris per quas fuistis
   dispersi, in manu valida, (vel robusta,) et brachio extento, et
   excandescentia effusa.


   He confirms the same sentiment, and at the same time marks out the
   manner of his dominion. For when the Jews were dispersed in captivity,
   they were like strangers to God's jurisdiction: they were mingled with
   the Gentiles, and their condition seemed very like an exemption from
   God's power. Now God signifies when he wishes to recover his right,
   that he had a place at hand, since he will bring them out from the
   Gentiles, and gather them from the lands through which they were
   dispersed. We are aware, as we have often said before, that it was a
   kind of abdication, when God expelled the ten tribes from the land of
   Canaan and a part also of that of Judea. Since then they were
   disinherited, they thought themselves free on their part, and they no
   longer regarded the authority of God, since they ceased to be his
   peculiar heritage when they were deprived of the promised land. Here
   God reminds them that although he had emancipated them for the time,
   yet they were in some sense under his hand, since he would collect them
   again, and so subdue them, that they should not escape his authority. I
   will draw you back, says he, and gather you with an outstretched arm
   and with a strong hand. But what he adds concerning the fury of his
   wrath does not seem consistent with this. For it was a sign of favor to
   collect them again, although hard and sorrowful slavery awaited them;
   yet they might perceive some taste of the divine goodness in gathering
   them from exile. For we know the bitterness of their captivity;
   especially under the Chaldaeans, by whom they were subdued. But the
   phrase wrath may relate as much to the Gentiles as to the Israelites
   themselves: yet I explain it more willingly of the Israelites, because
   although God in reality shows that he did not altogether neglect them,
   yet he asserts his right as a master grievously offended. Just as a
   person who had lost his slave may afterwards receive him into his
   house, and yet that house may be like a sepulcher, because he is either
   thrust into a deep dungeon, or three or four times as much is exacted
   of him as he can bear. So therefore God pronounces, although he may
   gather the Israelites again under his hand, yet they shall feel him to
   be displeased with them, since he nevertheless will require the
   punishment of their impiety; and this will be better understood from
   the context.

   Ezekiel 20:35-36

   35. And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there
   will I plead with you face to face.

   35. Et introducem vos in desertum gentium, et judicabor vobiscum illic
   [288] facie ad faciem.

   36. Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land
   of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

   36. Quemadmodum judicatus sum [289] cum patribus vestris in deserto
   terrae Ægypti, sic disceptabo vobiscum dicit Dominator Iehovah.


   He specially marks this reason here, which is a medium between
   rejection and reconciliation to favor: for God's bringing the
   Israelites out of Chaldaea might seem a sign of favor, as if he were
   again their deliverer. But he here defines why he intended to bring
   them forth, namely, to plead with them in the desert as with their
   fathers. We know that when the people came out of Egypt they did not
   possess the promised land, because they shut the door against
   themselves by their ingratitude: but if there had been no hope left, it
   was better for the people to spend their time under the tyranny of
   Egypt than to pine away in the desert. For it was a kind of life
   scarcely human to wander in a wilderness and to behold nothing pleasant
   or agreeable; a mere solitude instead of cultivated fields, and nothing
   but discomfort instead of beautiful flowers and trees and undulating
   ground: and besides this, to feed on nothing but manna, to taste no
   wine, to drink only water from the rock, and to endure heat and cold in
   the, open air. Such freedom then was by no means agreeable, unless they
   had hoped to become possessors of the land of Canaan. But a whole
   generation was deprived of that advantage through their ingratitude.
   God therefore appositely compares them to their fathers, who had gone
   forth into the wilderness, and he says, I will make you pass into the
   desert of the nations. Here he compares the desert of Egypt to that of
   the Gentiles. Although the passage from the land of Canaan to Chaldaea
   is partly across an unfruitful wilderness, yet I do not doubt that God
   here metaphorically points out the state of the people after their
   return from exile.

   The complete meaning is, as he surrounded their fathers throughout
   their whole life in the wilderness, so after they were brought back
   from Chaldaea their life should be as solitary as if they were banished
   to an obscure corner of the world, and to a miserable and deserted
   land. Here, therefore, another region is not intended, but the state of
   the people when dwelling in the land of Canaan; although he speaks not
   only of that small band which returned to their country, but of the
   liberty promiscuously given to all. He calls that state a desert of the
   Gentiles, to which all were subjected, whether they remained in distant
   regions or returned home. We must hold, then, that God would be so far
   the deliverer of the people that the benefit would reach only a few,
   since, when the multitude wandered in the desert, they perished there,
   and did not enjoy the promised inheritance. We now see how God
   established his sway over the Israelites, when he did not suffer them
   to be perpetually captive, and yet did not show himself appeased when
   he brought them back, since he still remained a severe judge. I will
   bring you, therefore, into the desert of the nations; this is the heat
   of anger of which he had spoken, and I will judge you, or plead with
   you, face to face. He signifies by these words, that although their
   return to Judea was evident, yet he was not propitious, since he met
   them as an adversary. There, says he, I will meet with you face to
   face, as when contention is rife, adversaries become opposed, and
   contend hand to hand: thus God here points out the extremity of rigor
   when he says, that he will dispute with them face to face. But he says,
   that he was a pleader in the desert of Egypt, and the sense extends to
   the future; not that it ought to be understood that God descended to
   plead a cause, and place himself at another's tribunal; still it was a
   kind of pleading when the people were compelled to feel that their
   impiety and obstinacy was not excusable; and also when experience at
   the same time taught them that God was by no means appeased, since his
   wrath was again stirred up. Isaiah's language is slightly different:
   Come you, says he, let us reason together, I will plead with you.
   (Isaiah 1.) He is there prepared to argue his cause, as if with an
   equal. But the case is soon closed and the sentence passed, since it is
   evident that the people are deservedly punished by God on account of
   their sins. Thus he pleaded with their fathers in the Egyptian desert
   when he deprived them all of entrance into the promised land. And
   afterwards he often punished them for their murmurs, perverse cravings,
   lusts, idolatries, and other crimes. Hence, let us learn that God is
   pleading with us whenever any signs of his anger appear; for we cannot
   derive any advantage from obstinate resistance: and hence nothing
   remains but to accuse ourselves for our faults. It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:37

   37. And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you
   into the bond of the covenant:

   37. Et transire faciam vos sub virga, et adducam vos in vinculo
   foederis.


   He follows up the same kind of instruction, that the people were not
   permitted to perish because they belonged to him, as if he had said
   that they should be always his, whether they liked it or not. And yet
   he seems to promise here what was very agreeable, that he would always
   esteem them as his flock. This is the meaning of to pass under the rod;
   for svt, shebet, does not mean a scepter here, nor a staff by which a
   delinquent is struck, but it means a shepherd's crook. It is, then, a
   simile taken from a shepherd who numbers and marks his flock; and this
   phrase often recurs. It means, because God has once acquired the people
   as his own, he cannot be rightly deprived of them. The exiles, indeed,
   had imagined themselves free if they could blot out of their minds and
   memories the name of the true God, and pollute themselves with the
   defilement's of the Gentiles. But God, on the other hand, pronounces,
   that as a shepherd notices his sheep, and counts their number, and
   makes them pass under his staff, like a king reviewing his army, so he
   would reckon up his people, and not suffer any one to snatch them from
   him, since he claims authority over them all without exception. Now,
   therefore, we understand the sense of the words: whence we gather
   again, that abandoned men gain nothing by their obstinacy, but God's
   really showing that the dominion which he has once assumed cannot by
   any means be snatched away from him. So this passage teaches us the
   kind of reward which awaits all apostates who think themselves
   emancipated when they brutally indulge in impiety, because God at
   length will make them pass under the rod, that is, he will call and
   compel them to render an account, as if their profession of faith was
   like a brand burnt in to their hearts.

   He says, in the bonds of a covenant, but in a different sense from what
   Hosea denominates a bond of affection. (Hosea 11:4.) He is there
   treating of reconciliation; but in this passage God pronounces that he
   will no longer be en-treated by the Israelites. Hence, the bond of the
   covenant means the constancy of his covenant, as far as he is
   concerned: and the, simile is suitable, because God had bound his
   people to himself, on the condition that they should be always
   surrounded with these bonds. Hence, when they petulantly wandered like
   untamed beasts, yet God had hidden bonds of his covenant: that is, he
   persevered in his own covenant, so that he collected them all again to
   himself, not to rule over them as a father, but to punish their revolt
   more severely. Here is a tacit comparison between the Israelites and
   the Gentiles; for the Gentiles, through their never approaching nearer
   to God, wandered away in their licentiousness without restraint. But
   the state of the elect people was different, since the end of their
   covenant was this, that God held them bound to him, even if the whole
   world should escape from him. It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:38

   38. And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that
   transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where
   they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye
   shall know that I am the LORD.

   38. Et purgabo [290] e vobis rebelles et perfidos in me: e terra
   habitationum suarum educam impios, et ad terrain Israel non
   ingredientur: et cognoscetis quod ego Iehovah.


   He continues the discourse which he had commenced, namely, that God
   would not suffer the exiles to withdraw themselves from him from the
   time he had adopted them. Then, since they were bound by the blessing
   of redemption, although they thought themselves far removed from the
   sight of God, after they were cast into exile, he says he would be
   present to gather them from the land of their dwellings; that is,
   wherever they were dispersed to bring them out. Some suppose the phrase
   to include a promise of favor, because it is said, I will purge you;
   but the word to choose, as I prefer to render it, or to discern, means,
   that God will drag to light those who think they have obtained
   hiding-places in which they can escape his eyes. Although, therefore,
   they promise themselves complete exemption from God's authority, he, on
   the other hand, pronounces them deceived, since he would collect them
   all together from the land of their habitations, although they were
   dispersed in different places. God's threatenings are sufficiently
   evident from the second clause of the verse, they shall not come, says
   he, into the land of Israel, and you shall know that I am Jehovah. He
   confirms what we saw before, that when liberty was granted them, they
   did not on that account become God's Church, since he had another
   reason for ruling over them, namely, to chastise them severely for
   their wickedness. They shall not come, therefore, into the land of
   Israel; that is, they shall remain, and grow corrupt in the desert, as
   we know that to be a most severe punishment, when God swore, that
   except two persons, Caleb and Joshua, no one should enter the land of
   Canaan. (Numbers 14:23, 24.) So also in this passage, I will free you,
   that is, when your return to your country shall be evident, a new light
   shall seem to have shone forth, but yet reflect on what happened to
   your fathers; for although redeemed, they perished in the desert, and
   never possessed the land of Canaan. The same thing shall happen to you
   also:, since your return is only a prelude to my favor: but you shall
   never return to the land of Israel. But this is extended to those who
   returned and dwelt in their native land. But we said that Judea was a
   place of exile since the course of God's favor was broken off, and God
   begun to plead with them afresh, even when he had led them from their
   captivity at Babylon And you shall know that I am Jehovah: as we said
   yesterday, God is recognized by the reprobate, while they are compelled
   to acknowledged a judge whose fatherly clemency they had despised. It
   follows --

   Ezekiel 20:39

   39. As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye,
   serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not
   hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts,
   and with your idols.

   39. Et vos domus Israel, sic dicit Dominator Iehovah, Quisque idolis
   suis ite servite, postquam non auditis me, et nomen sanctitatis meae,
   [291] ne profanetis amplius in muneribus vestris, et idolis vestris.


   Now again God expressly bears witness that he rejects the Israelites
   because they infected the pure worship of the law with their mixtures;
   for we said that they were deceived by a vain imagination when they
   thought God pleased with their obedience, while they worshipped him
   only half-heartedly. When they heaped up fictions, they thought this
   diligence would be pleasing to God, because they professed to
   acknowledge the true God as their redeemer. Here again he announces
   that he rejects all half-worship, since he wished to have the entire
   affections, and to admit no rival: Now, says he, O house of Israel,
   thus says Jehovah, Go each of you and serve your idols, just as if he
   would cast them off from his family. And yet we see that they were
   always under his dominion; and thus some kind of inconsistency arises
   when God rejects them from his sway, and yet retains them as his right.
   But the liberty which is now granted is to show them that it is in vain
   to worship God by halves.

   This passage is peculiarly remarkable, since at this time many are
   deceived, while they rest upon their own inventions, and think that
   they best discharge their duty towards God when they partially obey his
   commandments, and then pile up a great heap of superstitions, partly
   received from their fathers and partly fabricated by themselves. Again,
   scarcely one in a hundred will be found who does not think it better
   partially to worship God than entirely to devote themselves to idols;
   and this indeed is true as far as man is concerned; for the impiety is
   more foul and detestable when men openly reject God, and divorce
   themselves from him, and devote themselves to idols, than if they
   partly worshipped God and partly idols. But in the meantime, we see
   that God pronounces that he cannot bear this profanation; and we must
   diligently notice the reason which is added; for when gross and
   palpable impiety is indulged in, God's name is not so profaned as when
   clever men reconcile the pure worship of God with superstitions: and
   for this reason, that monstrous Indecision [292] was in God's sight
   worse than the papacy; and why so? for although the papists profane
   God's name, yet their madness is at present so detected, that it openly
   appears that they are idolaters; but that invention mingled darkness
   with light, and infected the pure doctrine with its leaven. But God
   here exclaims that he could not endure this deception when men profess
   to worship him, for they defile themselves with superstitions, since
   profaneness is added to impiety, and both are the result of hypocrisy.
   The rest tomorrow.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since you have once redeemed us by the death of
   your only-begotten Son, that we may not interrupt the course of thy
   favor by our ingratitude; but may we so proceed in obedience to thy
   Gospel, that we may be brought at length to the perfection of that
   grace which is commenced within us, and may proceed more and more every
   day in true piety, till at length we are gathered into thy heavenly
   kingdom, and enjoy the inheritance promised and obtained for us by the
   same Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Sixty-Fifth.

   We yesterday saw the reason why God prefers that men should be entirely
   devoted to their superstitions rather than mingle them with the
   resemblance of true piety, since this is but a profanation of his holy
   name. He wishes to be kept separate from all idols. Hence it is not
   surprising that he loosens the reins from the Israelites, that they
   should cast themselves entirely on their idolatries; and he repeats
   again what he had said, that his name was profaned by gifts and idols,
   since the unbelievers pretended to worship him, but at the same time
   transferred his glory to idols. Hence he does not suffer himself to be
   trifled with in this way; so wherever offerings and idols occur, we
   should notice that all mixtures by which the pure simplicity of lawful
   worship is corrupted are condemned. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 20:40

   40. For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,
   saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in
   the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require
   your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your
   holy things.

   40. Quia in monte sanctitatis meae, in monte excelso Israel, dicit
   Dominator Iehovah, illic colent me tota domus Israel, tota inquam in
   terra, illic propitius ero illis: [293] et illic requiram oblationes
   vestras et primitias donorum vestrorum in omnibus sanctificationibus
   vestris.


   God now directs his address to the elect, or the remnant in whom he
   wished his Church to survive. Thus far he has spoken of the whole body
   of the people: he says, although he should free them from the hand of
   the Gentiles, yet that redemption would be but partial, because they
   should perish in the desert, and never enjoy the promised land. On the
   whole, he shows that those to whom a free return to their own country
   was given were no less strangers than if they had been exiles at the
   time, and always remained outlaws, since their impiety prevented their
   restoration. God now addresses the true Israelites, who were not only
   naturally descended from their fathers, but were genuine and spiritual
   children, as Paul distinguishes between those sons of Abraham born
   according to the flesh and to promise. (Romans 9:7-9.) For this reason
   also it is said in Psalm 73. -- And surely God is good to Israel -- to
   those who are upright in heart for the Prophet here asserts that God is
   gracious towards the Israelites; but since many hypocrites boast
   themselves to be members of the Church, for the sake of correcting
   them, he restricts the sentence, and does not reckon any, as true
   Israelites except the upright in heart. So the same thing is repeated
   in Psalms 15 and Psalms 24. -- Who shall ascend into the mount of the
   Lord? But the perfidious and the wicked did mingle themselves with the
   sincere worshipers; yet the Prophet excludes them from the list of the
   faithful, since he says that none should have a fixed station in God's
   sanctuary unless the sound in heart and the clean in hand. In the same
   sense also the Prophet formerly taught, that although hypocrites
   proudly boasted themselves to be God's people, yet their names were not
   written in the secret catalogue of the righteous. (Ezekiel 13:9.) We
   now see how well those things which seem inconsistent agree together,
   namely, that the Lord's redeeming Israel from the tyranny of the
   Gentiles would not profit them, and yet, that they should come into the
   mountain of Israel and worship him sincerely. Israel is here placed
   before us in a twofold light: for many were Israelites in name; but
   here the Prophet is treating of the elect, whom Paul calls a remnant of
   grace. (Romans 11:5.)

   In the mountain, says he, of my holiness, in the lofty mountain of
   Israel. He does not call the mountain high, because it was loftier than
   others, for we know that there were many lofty mountains in the land of
   Judea; and Zion was but a small hill; but we have elsewhere seen that
   it was preferred to lofty mountains, because it excelled in dignity.
   Here our Prophet does not regard the height of Mount Zion, but the
   singular glory with which it was adorned; as if he had said that God
   resided there, and his glory shone forth over all the loftiness of the
   world. Meanwhile I do not doubt that this epithet is obliquely opposed
   to the high places, which were consecrated everywhere, as we saw
   before. Since, therefore, the people had erected altars in all elevated
   places of all kinds, here God opposes one lofty mountain to all these,
   whose height had deceived those wretched men who thought themselves
   when there, nearer to heaven. This, therefore, is the reason why he
   calls it a high mountain. He says, there shall the whole house of
   Israel worship me, the whole, I say, in the land. It is not surprising
   that the whole house of Israel is placed here without exception,
   because, as I have said, the Prophet does not comprehend all those who
   boasted in that title, but he only means the pure worshipers of God,
   who were the spiritual children of Abraham. But here God describes the
   agreement in faith among all the faithful, as if he had said that the
   people would be fresh, and would not follow various speculations, as
   they formerly wandered, each after his own superstitions, but there
   should be one common rule for all. So we are taught by this passage
   that our worship does not please God except we are bent upon a simple
   agreement of faith, and the celebration of his name with our mouth. The
   impious often subscribe to different modes of belief, but they have no
   regard to God: but, here we must hold the principle, that God cannot be
   worshipped unless the doctrine of his law flourishes. The whole house
   of Israel, I say, in the land. He signifies by these words that the
   whole land of Israel, so long contaminated by much filth, should be so
   sacred that the pure and perfect worship of God should alone be beheld
   there. In the land, then, purged from all defilement's by which it was
   before polluted, he adds a promise, there will I be propitious to you.
   We formerly saw that all the people's sacrifices were rejected, and
   that for one reason, because they mixed them with their own inventions.
   Now, God pronounces that he would be propitious to them, because he
   will be purely worshipped, and his service shall no longer be vitiated
   by the perverse comments of men. We here see, therefore, that God's
   complacency or favor is accompanied with a detestation of all
   superstitions, as we have often mentioned previously. As, therefore,
   God abominates whatever is added to the simple teaching of the law, so
   he asserts that he will be propitious where he is purely worshipped
   according to the law. He adds, and there will I require your oblations:
   the person is changed, but the sense flows on readily: he says, I will
   require your oblations: he puts one kind of oblation, but he includes
   them all, as will be seen at the end of the verse. Although I confess
   that two different kinds of offering are signified by the words, trvmh,
   theromeh, and, tnvphh, thenopheh, yet they are often taken for any kind
   of offering when used separately, a part being put for the whole, as I
   have said. He says, then, that the offerings were grateful to him, and
   he implies that by the word requiring, because we have seen that the
   people's gifts were refused when corrupted by foreign superstitions,
   and God is said to exact the gifts which he approves. And the
   first-fruits of your gifts, he says, that is, the flower or excellence
   of your gifts, in all your sanctifications, that is, in all my worship.
   It signifies, on the whole, when the Israelites betake themselves to
   the simple doctrine of the law, their obedience is so grateful to God,
   that their gifts please him, their offerings are taken into account,
   and their whole worship is accepted. It now follows --

   Ezekiel 20:41

   41. I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from
   the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been
   scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.

   41. In odore bonae fragrantiae propitius ero vobis cum eduxero vos e
   populis, et collegero vos ex terris, per quas dispersi eritis, et
   sanctificabor in vobis in oculis gentium.


   He continues the same sentiment, namely, that the people's worship
   would be acceptable, when those who had formerly been deceived by their
   superstitions had bidden them farewell, and follow the law only. He
   uses the word "savor," according to the customary legal form, not
   because incense was pleasing to God, but because external ceremonies
   were no vain discipline for the people when they retained the truth.
   For surely incense of itself is of no consequence, but God wished in a
   palpable manner to testify that he did not reject the sacrifices which
   he had commanded. Hence, by these forms of speech, the Holy Spirit
   signifies that God was truly appeased when men approach him with
   sincere faith and repentance, and desire to be reconciled, and
   suppliantly pray for pardon by ingenuous confession of sin, and look up
   to Christ this is the savor which Moses everywhere teaches was sweet,
   to God. But as the incense of the law was always sweet, so all others
   were offensive, as we have already seen. The Prophet, therefore, adds
   nothing new here, but confirms his former teaching, that God delights
   in the pure and sincere worship of the faithful, when they try nothing
   but by his law. Afterwards, says he, I will lead you out frown the
   people, and will collect you frown the lands through which you have
   been dispersed. He repeats the same words which were formerly used, but
   with another sense and purpose; since, while he redeems alike the
   hypocrites and his elect, the offered liberty does not profit the
   hypocrites: because, wherever they might dwell, their station was in
   the wilderness; and even in the very bosom of the land of Canaan they
   were exiles, and their life was erratic, and they were without any
   enjoyment of the promised inheritance, but wandered in the desert, and
   through distant regions. For although they dwelt in the midst of a
   crowd, yet such was their condition that God had deservedly threatened
   them with remaining in the wilderness of the Gentiles even till death.
   But now, when he speaks of the elect and the faithful, he makes a
   difference between them and the hypocrites. For a question might
   otherwise arise, since all were apparently alike, What was the tendency
   of the promise, that some should be exiles and others return to their
   inheritance? For Daniel never returned to his country, and there is no
   doubt that other pious worshipers of God were at, the same time held
   back: but we know how sinful a multitude returned to Judea when the
   edict of Cyrus permitted them. For all were afterwards attentive to
   their own private business: the temple was neglected; God was defrauded
   of his first-fruits and offerings; they married strange wives; and
   mingled polygamy with their sacrifices. (Haggai 1:4.) We have already
   seen how sharply and severely the three last prophets inveigh against
   them. Since many returned into the land of Canaan in their unchanged
   state, and who had better remained in Chaldaea: for this reason the
   Prophet directs his discourse to the elect, and says that they should
   not only be brought back, but when restored, as if by stealth, their
   worship would be pleasing to God in the land. When, therefore, I shall
   have brought you forth, I shall be sanctified in you before the eyes of
   the Gentiles. God was in some sense sanctified in the wicked, because
   they became an illustrious specimen of his power when the Chaldaeans
   were slain, and his temple erected a second time. But here the Prophet,
   as I have said, separates the elect from the reprobate, since God was
   sanctified in them in a special manner, when a new Church emerged
   again, in which piety, true religion, and holiness of life flourished.
   When, therefore, such a spectacle was offered to the eyes of the
   Gentiles, then God asserted his glory among his faithful ones. Lastly,
   these passages are to be read conjointly, that he will be propitious to
   them, and will be pleased with their first-fruits and offerings, and he
   will be sanctified in the eyes of the Gentiles: as it is said in Psalm
   114:2, When Israel went out of Egypt, Israel was God's power, and Judea
   his sanctification, or sanctity. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ezekiel 20:42

   42. And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into
   the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine
   hand to give it to your fathers.

   42. Et cognoscetis quod ego Iehovah, cum vos introduxero in terrain
   Israel, in terram [294] pro qua levavi manum meam, ut darem ipsam
   patribus vestris.


   For the sake of frightening them, he threatened that he would be
   conspicuous to the reprobate, saying, you shall know that I am Jehovah,
   -- meaning, that he would be their judge: hence he was known to the
   reprobate by proofs of his anger or wrath. But now another kind of
   knowledge is denoted, namely, that which brings a sweet taste of
   paternal love: you shall know, says he, that I am, Jehovah your God,
   when I shall have brought you in again. He here shows his full and
   complete benefit towards the faithful, which we saw before was withheld
   from the reprobate. For they were brought back, because, without
   exception, all were permitted to return to their country; for then the
   yoke of an imperious tyranny was broken when they were freed from the
   dominion of the Chaldees, and the king of the Medes had permitted them
   to build the temple, and to dwell in the land of Canaan. All were set
   at liberty, as I have said; but that was the only favor conferred upon
   the wicked, since they all perished in the desert of the Gentiles: but
   God's elect were led by the hand to the land of Israel, and there they
   really possessed the promised inheritance, since they dwelt there as
   sons and lawful heirs. The hypocrites returned, as I have said, but
   they never possessed the land by right of inheritance, for they
   wandered hither and thither in the desert, and although they resided at
   home, were always wandering exiles. We see, then, that a singular
   privilege is intended when it is said, I will be known by you, when I
   shall have brought you back from the nations and the lands through
   which you were dispersed, into the land concerning which I swore that I
   would give it to your fathers. Here a mark is inscribed, that the
   faithful may know that this promise was not common to all: for the
   dwelling in the land of Canaan of itself was not a matter of much
   consequence, but here a value is expressed, that they should arrive at
   that land as God's heirs, and succeed their sacred fathers, to whom the
   inheritance was promised. As God swore that he would give the land to
   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, this ought not to be restricted to them
   personally, as we very well know; and yet they were its true heirs and
   lords, as their sepulchers bear witness. They suffered vexation by
   constantly changing their settlements, and were never at rest in one
   residence. During life they were strangers, but their sepulcher was a
   proof of true and lawful dominion: and in this way they transmitted the
   hope of the promised inheritance to their posterity. Now, therefore, we
   see with what intention the Prophet here says that the land was
   promised to their fathers, that its value might raise the minds of the
   faithful to consider the magnitude of the benefit. It follows --

   Ezekiel 20:43

   43. And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein
   ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight
   for all your evils that ye have committed.

   43. Et recordabimini illic viarum vestrarum, et omnium operum
   vestrorum, in quibus polluti estis: et eritis excisi [295] in faciebus
   vestris, in cunctis sceleribus vestris quae perpetrastis.


   Here God shows that he would at length be propitious to his elect when
   they repented. Thus he signifies that there was no other means of
   reconciliation than by the intervention of repentance. And we must
   carefully remark this, as I have previously mentioned. For we know with
   what security all men usually indulge themselves, nor are the pious
   themselves affected with grief sufficiently serious, when God invites
   them to the hope of safety and at the same time offers pardon. They
   embrace indeed greedily what they hear, but meanwhile they bury their
   sins. But God wishes us to taste his goodness, that the remembrance of
   our crimes should be bitter, and also that every one should judge
   himself that he may obtain pardon from him. Now, therefore, we
   understand the Prophet's intention. We saw a similar passage in
   Jeremiah: this teaching occurs throughout the Prophets, there, says he,
   you shall remember me. The circumstance of place is to be noticed,
   because the Prophet means that after the elect shall have returned to
   God's favor, and he shall account them as true Members of his Church,
   then they thought to be mindful of their former life and to repent of
   their sins. As if he had said, as long as God afflicts you and you
   remain under the tyranny of the Gentiles in exile, the sense of your
   evils will compel you to groan, so the remembrance of your sins should
   return, since, whether you will or not, their punishment will ever be
   before your eyes, since they would be easily persuaded that their
   sentence was usual and common. But he shows them that the sons of God
   were not only mindful of their sins, when they feel themselves
   chastised by him, and experience shows his hostility, but when received
   into favor and in the enjoyment of their inheritance, they live under
   God's wings, and he cherishes them as a tender offspring: when,
   therefore, the faithful are treated so humanely by God, yet the Prophet
   shows that in their condition they ought to be mindful of their sins,
   and all your works in which you have been polluted, says he. He now
   shows to what purpose they were to be mindful. For the wicked are
   compelled to call their sins to remembrance when God, by forcibly
   turning their attention to them, draws them to consider what they
   desire to bury in oblivion. But it is here said, you shall be
   confounded in your own sight. Since the Hebrew word qvt, kot, signifies
   to cut off, many interpreters take it for "ye shall be cut off;" that
   is, you shall judge yourselves worthy of destruction among those whom
   God will cut off and blot out of the earth. But this seems forced.
   Since the same word sometimes signifies to litigate, and to become
   abominable, I willingly take this meaning, that they shall be
   abominable, or contemptible, in their own sight: that is, they shall be
   so ashamed, as willingly and fully to acknowledge themselves utterly
   disgraced. Hence Ezekiel means that the faithful should suffer
   voluntary disgrace, that they may glorify God by the pure and genuine
   confession of their shame. If any one prefers to expound it, you shall
   be condemned or convinced, that sense will suit well enough; but I have
   already brought forward what seemed more simple. For I said that this
   was the fruit of penitence, when we he confounded before God and are
   vile and despicable in our own eyes, and when we not only suffer
   ourselves to be condemned by others, but inwardly reflect upon our own
   disgrace, and so of our own accord prostrate ourselves before God. This
   then is the fruit of penitence, this is true humility, flowing from
   genuine shame. At length it follows --

   Ezekiel 20:44

   44. And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have wrought with you
   for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to
   your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

   44. Et cognoscetis quod ego Iehovah, cum fecero vobiscum propter nomen
   meum, non secundum vias vestras malas, et secundum opera vestra
   corrupta, domus Israel, dicit Dominator Iehovah.


   Here at length God pronounces that his glory would be chiefly
   conspicuous in the pity which he bestowed upon those who were desperate
   and abandoned, gratuitously and solely with respect to his own name.
   Hence Paul so specially celebrates; the grace of God in the first
   chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, as that mercy by which God
   deigns to call his own elect in a peculiar sense -- his glory; for his
   glory extends farther than his pity. (Ephesians 1:6, 12, 14.)

   As thy name, so thy praise is extended through all lands,
   (Psalm 48:10)

   for God deserves no less glory when he destroys the wicked than when he
   pities his own people. But Paul calls that gratuitous favor glory par
   excellence, by which God embraced his own elect when he adopted them.
   So also it is said in this passage, then you shall know that I am
   Jehovah, since I shall deal with you on behalf of my name, and not
   according to your sins. But when God wishes his glory to shine
   conspicuously in gratuitous pity, hence we gather that the enemies of
   his glory were too gross and open, who obscure his mercy, or extenuate
   it, or as far as they can, endeavor to reduce it to nothing. But we
   know the teaching of the papacy to be that God's gratuitous goodness
   either is buried or enfolded in dark obscurity, or utterly vanish away:
   for they have invented a system of general merits which they oppose to
   God's gratuitous favor. For they distinguish merits into preparations,
   good works acquiring God's favor, and satisfactions, by which they buy
   off the penalties to which they were subjected. Afterwards they add
   what they call the suffrages of the saints; for they fabricate for
   themselves numberless patrons, and various reasonings are concocted for
   the purpose of obscuring God's glory, or at least of allowing only a
   few sparks to be visible. Since therefore the whole papacy tends that
   way, we see that they professedly oppose God's glory, and those who
   defend such abominations are sworn enemies of God's glory.

   For ourselves, then, let. us learn that we cannot otherwise worship God
   with acceptance unless we adopt whatever pleases him as pertaining to
   our salvation. For if we wish to come to a debtor and creditor account,
   or to consider that he is in the slightest degree indebted to us, we in
   this way diminish his glory, and as far as is in our power we despoil
   ourselves of that inestimable privilege which the Prophet now commends.
   Hence let us desire to acknowledge God in this way, since he treats us
   with amazing clemency and pity out of regard for his own name, and not
   according to our sins. And since that was said to his ancient people
   because they returned to the land of Canaan, how much more ought God's
   gratuitous goodness to be extolled by us, when his heavenly kingdom is
   at this day open to us, and when he openly calls us to himself in
   heaven, and to the hope of that happy immortality which has been
   obtained for us through Christ?
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, since we have already entered in hope upon the
   threshold of our eternal inheritance, and know that there is a certain
   mansion for us in heaven after Christ has been received there, who is
   our head, and the first-fruits of our salvation: Grant, I say, that we
   may proceed more and more in the course of thy holy calling until at
   length we reach the goal, and so enjoy that eternal glory of which you
   afford us a taste in this world, by the same Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   PRAISE TO GOD.

   After finishing this last Lecture, that most illustrious man, John
   Calvin, the Divine, who had previously been sick, then began to be so
   much weaker that he was compelled to recline on a couch, and could no
   longer proceed with the explanation of Ezekiel. This accounts for his
   stopping at the close of the Twentieth Chapter, and not finishing the
   work so auspiciously begun. Nothing remains, kind Reader, but that you
   receive most favorably and graciously what is now sent forth to the
   world.

   These closing Visions and Consolations are singularly striking, and
   afford scope for copious illustration; but as our Commentator did not
   live to expound them, it would in become his Translator to obtrude on
   the reader his own research into these deep things of the Spirit of
   God.

   A minute description of The Temple Scenery has been attempted by a
   learned Jew, Soloman Bennett, R.A. of Berlin, (Edit. London, 1834.) His
   work contains a most elaborate account of every interesting particular.
   Ezekiel 40, Ezekiel 41, and Ezekiel 42 are explained verse by verse;
   and a ground-plan and bird's-eye view are subjoined.

   These chapters are also explained by Fry on The Second Advent, volume
   1. Section 13.

   A TRANSLATION OF THE

   FIRST TWENTY CHAPTERS

   OF THE PROPHECIES OF EZEKIEL,

   AS MODIFIED BY THESE COMMENTARIES.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 NOW it came to pass in the thirtieth year, [296] in the fourth month,
   on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river
   Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

   2 In the fifth day of the month, in the fifth year of the captivity of
   King Jehoiakim,

   3 The word of Jehovah came to Ezekiel, son of Buzi the priest, in the
   land of the Chaldreans, near the river Chebar, and the land of Jehovah
   was upon him there.

   4 And I looked, and, behold, tempestuous wind coming from the north; a
   great cloud, and a fire folding round itself, and a brightness was
   round about it; and out of the midst there was, as it were, the
   appearance of Hasmal in the midst of the fire.

   5 And in the middle of this, was the likeness of four living creatures,
   and their aspect was the likeness of a man:

   6 They had each four faces and four wings,

   7 Their feet were straight, and the sole of their feet like that of a
   calf's foot, (or round, volume 1,) and they cast forth sparks like the
   appearance of polished brass:

   8 And they had human hands under their wings on their four sides; and
   they had four faces and wings.

   9 And each wing was connected with the next wing: when they moved they
   did not turn back: each animal went forward in the direction of his
   face.

   10 As to the likeness of their faces, these four had the face of a man
   and the face of a lion on the right side; and on the left, these four
   had the face of an ox and the face of an eagle.

   11 Their faces, then, and their wings were extended [297] from above,
   and each wing was bound to its neighbor, and two covered their body.

   12 And each walked in the direction of its face; and wheresoever the
   spirit (or will,) proceeded, they proceeded they did not return in
   their course.

   13 As to the likeness of the living creatures, their aspect was like
   coals of burning fire, like the appearance of lamps passing up and down
   between the living creatures: and the fire was bright, and lightning'
   issued from it.

   14 And the living creatures ran and returned like lightning.

   15 While I was; beholding' the living creatures, behold one wheel on
   the earth, near each living, creature, at right angles, [298] at the
   face of each.

   16 The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like
   chrysolite: and they were all alike' and their appearance and their
   form were like one wheel within another.

   17 When they moved forward, they went upon their four sides: they did
   not turn back when they proceeded.

   18 And I beheld their circumferences, and their size, and their
   terribleness; and their strakes were full of eyes, round about these
   four.

   19 And when the living creatures walked, the wheels moved beside them;
   and when the living creatures were raised from the earth, the wheels
   were raised with them. [299]

   20 Withersoever the spirit led the living creatures, tither it also led
   the wheels: the wheels were raised up also with the living creatures,
   because their spirit was in the wheels also.

   21 When the animals moved forward, the wheels did the same: they both
   were stationary and both elevated together; because the spirit of the
   animals was in the wheels.

   22 Above the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of a
   firmament, as the appearance of terrible crystal stretched over and
   above their heads.

   23 And under the firmament their wings were straight, each towards its
   neighbor: and each living creature had two wings, which covered their
   bodies on this side and on that.

   24 And I heard the voice of their wings, like the voice of mighty
   waters, and like the voice of God' the voice of their speech was like
   the sound of an army when they moved forward; and when they stood, they
   let down their wings.

   25 And there was a voice from the firmament over their heads when they
   stood and let down their wings.

   26 And above the firmament over their heads was the likeness of a
   throne, like the vision of a sapphire stone: and above the likeness of
   the throne was an image like the aspect of a man upon it.

   27 And I saw, as it were, the color of amber, like the appearance of
   fire round about within it: from the appearance of his loins, both
   upwards and downwards, I saw the aspect of fire, and a brightness all
   round about him.

   28 Like the appearance of a bow in a cloud on a rainy day, such was the
   aspect of his brightness round about. This was a vision of the
   similitude of Jehovah's glory: and I gazed at it, and fell upon my
   face, and heard a voice speaking unto me. And he said unto me, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [296] The thirtieth year. The date at which this reckoning commences is
   doubful Calvin dates from a Jubilee, ([18]vol. 1, p. 52.,) but Jerome
   from the 18th year of King Josiah, when the book of the law was found.
   Origen, Hom. I., understands it of Ezekiel's age; and so does Gregory,
   Hom. II. Maldonatus interprets it of the captivity, and quotes the
   authority of Theodoret. Pradus, as quoted by Rosenmfiner, agrees with
   Jerome. The Editor refers his readers once for all to the valuable
   commentary of Rosenmuller on this Prophet for all kinds of valuable
   critical information; while the English student will find the notes to
   Archbishop Newcome's version very judicious.

   [297] Or, "divided." See [19]vol. 1, p. 75, note.. The MSS. vary
   slightly. Calvin has translated very literally; and the Prophet's
   language being so elliptical, it is almost impossible to present a
   perfectly accurate representation of "a cherub" to a modern inquirer.

   [298] Explained in a note, [20]p. 82, vol. 1 See Jerome in Comment. ad
   Heseam, cap. 12, and Chrysos. Orat. 35, p. 448, ed. Morell...Rosen. in
   ver.

   [299] Alexander Knox, who beautifies whatever he touches upon, has
   applied this verse most happily in illustration of the "exquisitely
   regular" movements of the almighty, and the "attendant machinery of
   Providence." -- Remains, Ezekiel 6:9.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.

   2 And the Spirit came to me when he addressed me, and placed me upon my
   feet: and I heard him address me; and he said unto me --

   3 Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, To revolting
   tribes who have rebelled against me: They and their fathers have acted
   perfidiously against me, Even to this very day.

   4 They are children of a hard face, and of a stiff heart. Therefore I
   send thee unto them; And you shall say to them -- Thus says the Lord
   Jehovah

   5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will not, For they
   are a rebellious house, Yet shall know that a Prophet has been among
   them.

   6 And you, son of man, be not afraid of them; Fear not their words,
   though they are rebellious, And are thorns towards time, and you
   dwellest with scorpions. Be not afraid of their language; Be not
   dismayed at their looks, Since they are a rebellious house.

   7 And you shall utter my words unto them, Whether they will hear, or
   whether they will forbear; For they are rebels.

   8 And you, son of man, hear what I say unto thee: Be not you rebellious
   like that. rebellious house; Open thy mouth, and eat what I put before
   thee.

   9 Then I looked up, and, behold, a hand extended to me; And lo! a roll
   of a book was in it:

   10 Then he spread it before my face; And lo! The roll was written
   behind and before, And the writing was lamentations, and morning, and
   wo.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 After that he said to me, Son of man, eat completely what you has
   found; namely, this roll, And go and speak to the house of Israel.

   2 So I opened my mouth, and he fed me with that roll.

   3 And said to me, Son of man, Feed thy belly, and fill thy bowels with
   this roll which I give thee. So I ate it, and it was in my mouth Like
   honey for sweetness.

   4 Then he said to me, Son of man! Go to the house of Israel and address
   them in my words,

   5 Since you art not sent to a people profound in lip and hard of
   speech, You art sent to the house of Israel:

   6 Not to many peoples profound in lip and heavy in speech, Whom you
   canst not understand; [300] Had I sent thee unto them, they would have
   hearkened unto thee.

   7 But the house of Israel will not hear thee; Because they will not
   hear me; Since the whole house of Israel are hard of front and stout of
   heart.

   8 Lo! I have made thy face hard against their faces, And thy forehead
   hard, against their forehead.

   9 As an adamant, harder than flint, Have I made thy forehead: fear them
   not: Be not broken down at their presence, For they are a house of
   rebellion.

   10 Moreover, he said to me, Son of man! All my words which I shall
   speak to thee, Receive in your heart and hear with your ears:

   11 And go -- Judea thee to the captives, to the children of thy people,
   And speak unto them and tell them, -- Thus saith the Lord Jehovah,
   Whether they will hear, or whether they will not.

   12 Then the Spirit raised me up: and I heard behind me A voice of
   mighty rustling, which said, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his
   place!

   13 1 heard also the sound of the wings of the living' creatures, Each
   kissing that of its companion, And the noise of the wheels beside them
   -- the sound of a mighty shaking.

   14 Then the Spirit raised me, and took me away, And I set forth in
   bitterness and indignation of spirit, And the hand of Jehovah was
   strong upon me.

   15 Then I came to the captives at Thel-abib, They were seated by the
   river Chebar: there they sat: And I also sat there seven days desolate
   in the midst of them.

   16 Then it happened at the end of the seven days, Thai the word of
   Jehovah came to me, saying,

   17 Son of man! I have appointed thee a watchman over the house of
   Israel; Hence you shalt hear words from my mouth, And shall warn them
   from me.

   18 When I say unto the wicked, You shall surely die: And you warnest
   him not, and speakest not unto him; And warnest him not from his wicked
   way to save his life: That wicked man shall die in his iniquity; But
   his blood. will I require at thy hand.

   19 Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his impious and
   evil way, He shall die in his iniquity; But you has freed your own
   soul.

   20 If a just man shall turn from his righteousness, and commit
   iniquity: And I put a stumbling-block before his face, he shall die:
   Because you has not warned him, he shall die in his sins, The
   righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; But his blood
   will I require at thy hand.

   21 Then if you warn the righteous that he sin not, And he doth not sin,
   he shall surely live, because he is warned, You also has delivered your
   own soul.

   22 Then the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he said to me, Arise, go
   unto the plain, and there I will speak to thee.

   23 Then I arose, and went to the plain, and lo! The glory of Iehovah
   stood there, As the glory which I had beheld by the river Chebar:

   24 And I fell upon my face, and the Spirit entered into me, And placed
   me upon my feet, and addressed me, and said, Go -- shut thyself within
   your house.

   25 And now -- son of man! -- lo! they shall put chains upon thee, And
   shall bind thee with them, and you shall not go forth into the midst of
   them:

   26 Then I will make thy tongue cleave to thy palate, And you shall be
   dumb, and be no longer a reprover to them: Because they are a house; of
   rebellion.

   27 But when I shall speak to thee, and shall open thy mouth, You shall
   say unto them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, He who hears, may hear: he
   who forbears, may forbear; Since they are a house of rebellion. [301]

   CHAPTER 4

   1 Thou also, son of man! take thee a tile, And put it before thy face,
   And paint upon it the city Jerusalem:

   2 Lay siege against it, and build a tower against it: Cast a mound
   against it, and set a camp against it: Set battering rams against it
   all round.

   3 Then take an iron pan, and set it for a wall between thee and the
   city; Strengthen thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, And you
   shall besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel.

   4 He you also on thy left; side, and place the iniquity of the house of
   Israel upon it; According to the number of the days during which you
   shall he upon it You shall bear their iniquity.

   5 For I have appointed unto thee the years of their iniquity, According
   to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: Thus shall
   you bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

   6 And when you have finished those days, Then again you shall he on thy
   right side, And you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judea forty
   days; Each day for a year, as I have appointed thee.

   7 Then you shall direct thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, And
   thine arm shall be uncovered, And you shall not prophesy against it.

   8 Lo! I have put cords upon thee, And you shall not turn from side to
   side Until you have fulfilled the days of thy sieges.

   9 Take you also wheat; and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet,
   and fitches, And put them in one vessel, and make it into bread for
   time, According to the number of the days on which you shall he on thy
   side: Three hundred and ninety days shall you eat it.

   10 And the food which you shall eat by weight, Shall be twenty shekels
   a day: from time to time shall you eat it.

   11 And water shall thou drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin: From
   time to time shall you drink it.

   12 Then you shall eat barley cake, and shall bake it With human dung
   before their eyes: And Jehovah said,

   13 Even thus shall the children of Israel cat their defiled bread Among
   the Gentiles wither I have driven them.

   14 Then I said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! Lo! my soul has not been
   polluted, And from my youth up never have I eaten What died of itself,
   or was torn to pieces; And abominable flesh has never entered my mouth.

   15 Then he said, See! I have given thee The dung of oxen for that of
   men, And you shall cook thy bread with this. [302]

   16 Moreover, he said to me, Son of man! Lo! I break the staff of bread
   in Jerusalem; And they shall eat bread by weight and with fear; And
   shall drink water by measure and with astonishment,

   17 So that bread and water shall fail them, And they shall be
   astonished one with another, And consume away in their iniquity. [303]

   CHAPTER 5

   1 And you, son of man f take thee a sharp sword, Take thee a barber's
   razor, and pass it over thy head and thy beard: Then take thee a just
   balance and divide the hair.

   2 A third part you shall burn in the midst of the city, When the days
   of the siege are fulfilled; A third part shall you smite about with the
   sword; And another third shall you scatter to the wind; And I will
   unsheathe the sword after them.

   3 Then you shall take a few of them, And bind them in thy skirts.

   4 Then take some of them. and cast them into the fire, And burn them;
   for thence shall fire go forth Upon all the house of Israel.

   5 Then says the Lord Jehovah, This is Jerusalem: In the midst of the
   nations and of the surrounding countries Have I placed her.

   6 And she has changed my judgments into wickedness Beyond all the
   nations, and my statutes beyond all the surrounding people: They have
   despised my judgments, And have not walked in my statutes.

   7 Therefore, thus says the, Lord Jehovah, Because of your
   multiplication more than the nations round about you, And your not
   walking in my statutes, and not keeping my judgments, And your not
   acting like the nations around you,

   8 Wherefore, thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I ant against thee,
   even I: And I will execute my judgments in the midst of thee Before the
   eyes of the Gentiles.

   9 And I will execute against thee what I never yet have done, Nor will
   ever do in future, On account of all your abominations.

   10 Therefore fathers shall devour their sons, And sons their fathers,
   in the midst of thee: I will execute judgments against thee, And
   disperse all thy remnants to all winds of heaven.

   11 Because I live, says the Lord Jehovah, Since you has polluted my
   sanctuary [304] With all thy detestable and abominable things,
   Therefore I will break thee in pieces: My eye shall not spare, neither
   will I pity thee.

   12 A third part shall die of the pestilence, And be consumed by famine
   in the midst of thee; A third part shall be consumed by the sword round
   about thee; A third part will I disperse towards every wind, And will
   draw out a sword after them.

   13 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, And I will cause my burning
   anger to rest upon them; And I will enjoy consolation; and they shall
   know that I am Jehovah, Who have spoken in my zeal, when I shall have
   accomplished my fury on them.

   14 Moreover, I will lay thee waste, And make thee a reproach among the
   nations around thee In the eyes of every passer by.

   15 So you shall be a reproach and a reviling, A chastisement and an
   astonishment to the nations round about thee, While I shall execute
   judgments against thee In anger and burning, and furious rebukes. I
   Jehovah have spoken it.

   16 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine For their
   destruction, which I shall dart upon them to destroy them; [305] Then
   will I add famine against them, And will break their staff of bread.

   17 Then will I send against you famine and wild beasts, And they shall
   bereave you: and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; And I
   will cause the sword to come upon thee. [306] I Jehovah have spoken it.

   CHAPTER 6

   1 The word also of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   2 Son of man! set thy face towards the mountain of Israel, And prophesy
   against them, and say,

   3 You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus says
   the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and the inns, To the rivers and the
   valleys: Behold! I will bring the sword against you, and destroy your
   high places;

   4 And your altars shall be desolate, Your idols shall be broken; And I
   will cast down your slain before your idols.

   5 Then I will place the carcass of the sons of Israel Before your
   idols; I will scatter them before the idols. I will sprinkle your bones
   round about your altars.

   6 In all your habitations cities shall be desolate, [307] And high
   places shall be reduced to devastation, That your altars may be wasted
   and desolated, And your idols may be broken up and abolished, And your
   images cut. down, and your works blotted out.

   7 Then the slain shall fall in the midst of you, And you shall know
   that I am Jehovah.

   8 Still, I will leave a remnant, that you may have some Who shall
   escape the sword among the nations, When you shall be scattered through
   the countries.

   9 And the remnant shall remember me among the nations, Among which they
   shall become captives, Because I am. broken down with their adulterous
   heart, Which has departed from me, and with their eyes, Which are full
   of lust after their idols; And they shall loathe themselves for all the
   evils Which they have committed in all their abominations.

   10 Then they shall know that I Jehovah said not in vain, I will cause
   them to suffer this evil. [308]

   11 Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Strike with thy hand, and stamp with thy
   feet, And say, Alas! for all the evil abominations of the house of
   Israel, For they shall fall by the sword, and famine, and pestilence.

   12 He who shall be afar off shall die by the pestilence; He who shall
   be near shall fall by the sword; [309] He who shall remain and be
   besieged shall die through hunger; And I will fulfill my indignation
   upon them.

   13 And you shall know that I am Jehovah, When their wounded shall be
   among their idols round about their altars, Upon every high hill, in,
   on all the heads of the mountains, Under every green tree and every
   thick oak, In the place where they offered the incense of sweet
   fragrance to all their idols.

   14 So I will stretch out my hand upon them, And I will make the land
   desert and desolate -- More than the desert of Diblathah, in all their
   dwellings; And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

   CHAPTER 7

   1 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   2 You also, son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah Concerning the land
   of Israel, All end, an end is come Upon the four quarters of the land.

   3 Now an end is come upon thee, And I will send my indignation against
   thee, And I will judge thee according to thy ways, And I will put upon
   thee all your abominations.

   4 Then mine eye shall not spare thee, nor will I pity thee; Because I
   will recompense thy ways upon thee, And thy abominations shall be in
   the midst of thee, And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

   5 Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Lo! evil, and only evil shall come. [310]

   6 An end is come -- an end is come; It has watched against thee;
   behold! it is come.

   7 The morning is come upon thee, e dweller in the land; The time is
   come; the day of tumult is near, and not the clamor of the mountains.

   8 Now I will shortly pour out my indignation upon thee, And I will
   accomplish my anger against thee, And I will judge thee according to
   thy ways, And I will put upon thee all thine abominations.

   9 Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I pity; According to thy ways
   will I put upon thee, And your abominations shall be in the midst of
   thee; And you shall know that I Jehovah am smiting thee.

   10 Behold the day: behold it is come; The morning has advanced, the rod
   has flourished;

   11 Pride has flourished: violence has sprung up into a staff of
   impiety: None of them, nor yet their opulence, shall remain: There
   shall be no noise nor any lamentation for them:

   12 The appointed time is come; the day has approached: The buyer shall
   not rejoice; the seller shall not be sorrowful; Because indignation
   shall be on all their multitude.

   13 Since the seller shall not return to his merchandise, And their life
   is yet among the living; Because the vision is concerning the whole
   multitude, [311] It shall not return; and no man shall strengthen his
   soul in his iniquity.

   14 They have blown the trumpet; they have prepared all things; But none
   is gone out to battle, because my wrath Is upon the whole multitude.

   15 The sword abroad; pestilence and famine at home. He that is in the
   field shall die by the sword; He that is in the city shall be consumed
   by famine and pestilence.

   16 And the escapers of them shall escape, And shall be upon the inns
   like doves of the valleys, All mourning, [312] every one in his
   iniquity.

   17 All hands shall be loosened; all knees shall flow like water.

   18 And they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, And dread shall cover
   them, And shame shall be upon all faces, And baldness upon all heads.

   19 They shall east their silver into the street, And their gold shall
   be an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold shall not deliver them
   In the day of. Jehovah's wrath: They shall neither satisfy their souls
   nor fill their bellies, Because it was; the stumbling-block of their
   iniquity.

   20 As to the beauty of their ornaments, they turned it to pride, And
   they made the images of their abominations And of their defilement's
   out of it (i.e., gold) [313] Therefore I have east it from them.

   21 And I will deliver it into the hand of strangers for a prey, And of
   the wicked of the land for a spoil; And they shall profane it.

   22 My face also will I turn from them, For they will profane my secret
   place: And robbers will enter into it and profane it.

   23 Make a chain: -- for the, land is fined With a judgment of bloods,
   The city, too, is full of violence.

   24 For I will bring on it the wicked among the Gentiles; And they shall
   possess their houses: I will also cause their pride to cease, And their
   sanctuaries shall be polluted.

   25 Destruction is come and they shall seek peace when there is none.

   26 Calamity shall come upon calamity, and rumor upon rumor; Then they
   shall seek a vision from a prophet; But the law shall perish from the
   priest, And counsel from the aged.

   27 The king shall mourn, and the princes shall be clothed with
   desolation, And the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled:
   According to their ways will I act towards them, According to their
   judgments will I judge them. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

   CHAPTER 8

   1 And it happened in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth
   day, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judea were sitting
   before my face, and there the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell upon me.

   2 I looked, and behold a likeness as the appearance of fire: From the
   appearance of its loins downwards, fire; And from its loins upwards, as
   the appearance of brightness, Like the figure of Hasmal.

   3 And he sent the likeness of a hand, And raised ma by a lock of my
   head; And the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, And led me
   to Jerusalem in the visions of God, To the door of the inner gate
   looking towards the north; Where was the seat of the idol jealousy,
   causing jealousy.

   4 Then lo! there was the glory of the God of Israel, According to the
   vision which I saw in the plain.

   5 And said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now To the way of the
   north: So I raised my eyes towards the north, And lo! towards the north
   at the gate of the altar, That idol -- jealousy -- at the entrance.

   6 And he said to me, Son of man, seest you their deeds? The great
   abominations which the house of Israel perpetrate here, That I should
   depart far from my sanctuary? But turn thee yet again, and you shall
   see greater abominations.

   7 Then he led m, to the door of the court, And I looked, and lo! an
   opening in the wall. Then he said to me, Son of man, dig now into the
   wall; And I dug in the wall, and behold a door.

   8 Then he said to me, Enter and see the evil abominations which they
   do.

   9 Then I entered and beheld, and lo! every likeness of a reptile,

   10 And abominations of animals, and, all idols of the house of Israel,
   Were depicted on the wall round about.

   11 And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, And Jazaniah,
   son of Saphan, stood in the midst of them, Who stood before them, and
   to each r, censer in his hand, And a thick cloud of incense ascended.

   12 Then he said to, me, Has you seen, son of mall, What the elders of
   the house of Israel do in darkness, Each in the hidden places of his
   imagery? Who say, Jehovah does not see us; Jehovah has deserted the
   land.

   13 Then he said to me, Turn thee again, And you shall see the great
   abominations which they do.

   14 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Jehovah's house, Which
   looks to the north: and lo! there sat women Lamenting for Thammuz.

   15 Then he said to me, Son of man, turn thee again, And you shall see
   greater abominations than these.

   16 Then he led me to the inner court of Jehovah's house, And lo! at the
   gate of Jehovah's temple, between the entrance and the altar, About
   five and twenty men, with their backs towards Jehovah's temple, And
   their faces towards the east, worshipping the rising sun.

   17 Then he said to me, Has you seen this, son of man? Is it a light
   thing to the house of Judea To do these abominations which they have
   done there? Because they have fined the land with violence, And have
   returned to provoke me, And lo! they put the branch to their nose.

   18 I also in return will deal in my fury: Mine eye shall neither spare
   nor pity; And when they cry in mine ears with a loud voice I will not
   hear them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 9

   1 He cried also in mine ear with a loud voice, saying, Let the rulers
   of the city approach, Every one with his weapon of destruction in his
   hand.

   2 And lo! six men coming from the way of the higher gate, which is
   towards the north, And each had his slaughter-weapon in his hand; And
   one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, With a writer's inkhorn
   at his side: Then they went in and stood near the brazen altar.

   3 Then the glory of the God of Israel ascended from the cherubim Above
   which it rested, to the threshold of the house, And cried to the man
   clothed in linen, with the inkhorn at his side;

   4 Then Jehovah said to him, Pass through the midst of the city, through
   the midst of Jerusalem, And make a sign upon the foreheads of the men
   who sigh And cry for all the abominations which they suffer in the
   midst of it.

   5 But to the others he said in my hearing, Go you after, him through
   the city, and smite; Let not your eye spare, and do not pity:

   6 Old and young, girl, boy, and woman slay to the death; Yet approach
   not any who bears the sign, And begin from my sanctuary. Then they
   began at the elders who were in front of the house.

   7 And he said to them, Pollute the house, and fill the altars with the
   slain: Go you forth. And they went forth, and made a slaughter in the
   city.

   8 And it happened while they were slaying that I was left: Then I fell
   upon my face, and cried out and said, Aha! Lord Jehovah, wilt you slay
   all the relics of Israel By pouring forth your anger upon Jerusalem?

   9 Then he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judea Is
   great beyond measure, and the land is full of blood, And the city is
   full of perversity: because they said, Jehovah has deserted the land:
   Jehovah regardeth it not.

   10 As for me also, mine eye shall not spare them, I will not pity them
   their ways will I recompense on their heads.

   11 And lo! the man clad in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side,
   Returned and made his report., saying, I have done as you did command
   me.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 10

   1 Then I looked, and lo! above the firmament, which was above the head
   of the cherubim, As it were a sapphire-stone, Like the appearance of a
   throne which was seen above them.

   2 Then he spoke to the mall clad in linen garments, and said, Go in to
   the midst of the wheels under the cherub, And fill thy palms with coals
   of fire from the midst of the cherubim, And scatter them over the cry.
   And he went in my sight.

   3 And the cherubim stood on the right of the house when the man came.
   And a cloud fined the inner court.

   4 Then the glory of Jehovah was raised above the cherub towards the
   threshold of the house; And the house was fined with cloud, And the
   court was fined with the brightness of Jehovah's glory.

   5 Then the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard to the outer
   court, Like the voice of the Omnipotent God when he speaketh.

   6 And it happened when he had commanded the man clothed with linen,
   Saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from the midst of the
   cherubim; Then he went in and stood beside the wheel.

   7 And one cherub stretched His hand from the midst of the cherubim, To
   the fire which was in the midst of the cherubim, And he took it, and
   put it into the palms of the man clothed in linen; Then he took it and
   departed.

   8 And there appeared in the cherubim themselves, The likeness of a
   man's hand under their wings.

   9 Then I looked, and lo! four wheels near the cherubhis, One wheel by
   one cherub, another wheel near another cherub: And the appearance of
   the wheels was like the stone tharsis.

   10 And as for their aspect, the appearance of each was the same, [314]
   As if a wheel was in the midst of a wheel.

   11 When they moved, they went on their four sides; They did not return
   in going forward, Since they moved towards the direction of their head;
   They did not return as they went.

   12 And their whole body, and backs, and hands, and wings, The four
   wheels, indeed, themselves were full of eyes all round.

   13 He cried to the wheels in my hearing, O wheel!

   14 And each living creature had four faces: The face of the first that
   of a cherub; The face of the second that of a. man; Of the third that
   of a lion; and the fourth an eagle's.

   15 And the cherubim were raised up. This is the living creature which I
   saw by the river Chebar.

   16 Then when the cherubim moved, the wheels moved near them; And when
   the cherubim raised their wings aloft From the earth, The wheels did
   not turn away from the side of them.

   17 When the living creatures stood, they stood; When they were lifted
   up, the wheels also were raised: Because the spirit of the living
   creature was in them.

   18 Then the glory of Jehovah went forth from the threshold of the
   house, And stood over the cherubim.

   19 Then the cherubim raised their wings, and went up from the earth in
   my sight: When they went forth, the wheels also went before them, And
   each stood above the threshold of the east gate of Jehovah's house; And
   the glory of the God of Israel was above them.

   20 It is the very living creature which I saw Under the God of Israel
   by the river Chebar; And I knew them to be cherubim.

   21 Each had four faces apiece, and four wings; And the likeness of the
   hands of a man under their wings.

   22 And the likeness of their faces was that which I saw at the river
   Chebar, Both their appearance and themselves: [315] Each moved towards
   his own face.

   CHAPTER 11

   1 Then the spirit raised me up, and brought me To the eastern gate of
   Jehovah's house; and lo! At the threshold of the gate, five and twenty
   men; Then I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah, son of Asur; And
   Pelthiah, son of Benaiah, princes of the people.

   2 Then he said to me, Son of man, these men divine vanity, And plan
   perverse counsel in this city;

   3 Who say, It is not near; let us build houses: The city is the
   caldron, and we are the flesh:

   4 Wherefore, prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.

   5 Then the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and said to me, Say, Thus
   saith Jehovah, Thus have you spoken, O house of Israel, The mountings
   of your spirit, I know them:

   6 You have multiplied your slain in this city, And you have fined its
   streets with the slain.

   7 Wherefore, thus says the Lord Jehovah, Your slain, Whom you placed in
   the midst -- they shall be the flesh, And the city the caldron; and I
   will cast you forth from the midst of it:

   8 You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith
   the Lord Jehovah:

   9 And I will eas, you out of the midst of it. And will deliver you h,
   to the hand of strangers, And will exercise judgments against you.

   10 Then you shall fall by the sword: in the border of Israel Will I
   judge you; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

   11 It shall not be your caldron, And you shall not be in the midst of
   it for flesh; In the border of Israel will I judge you.

   12 And you shall, Know that I am Jehovah; Because you ha, re not;
   walked in my statutes, And have not executed my judgments; But you have
   done according to the judgments of the nations around you.

   13 And it happened, while I prophesied, That Phalatias, the son of
   Benaiah, died: Then I fell upon my face, and cried with loud voice, and
   said, Ah! Lord Jehovah! will you consume the remnant of Israel!

   14 Then the word of Jehovah came to me again, saying,

   15 Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, Thy kindred, and all the
   whole house of Israel, To these the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said,
   Depart you far from Jehovah, the land is given as an heritage to us.

   16 Wherefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because you have been
   east far away among the Gentiles, And dispersed through the lands,
   Therefore will I be to them a sanctuary of fewness [316] In the lands
   to which they have come.

   17 Wherefore you shall say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will gather
   you out of the peoples, and collect you out of the lands To which you
   have been driven, and I will give you the land of Israel.

   18 And they shall come there, and take away all its idols, And all its
   abominations out of it.

   19 Then I will give them one hear, and will put a new Spirit within
   them; And I will take away the stony heart from their flesh, And will
   give them a heart of flesh:

   20 That. they may walk in my statutes, And keep my judgments, and do
   them: Then they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

   21 Then I will repay on their own head the way of those Whose heart
   walks after, heart of foulness [317] and grossness, Saith the Lord
   Jehovah.

   22 Then the cherubim raised their wings, and the wheels beside them,
   And the glory of the God of Israel was over above them.

   23 And the glory of Jehovah ascended out of the midst of the city, And
   stood over the mount on the east of the city.

   24 Then the spirit raised me, and brought me to Chaldsea, To the
   captivity, In a vision, in t. he Spirit of God. Then the vision which I
   saw went up from me.

   25 And I spoke to the captivity All the words of Jehovah which he had
   shown me.

   CHAPTER 12

   1 The word of Jehovah came also unto me, saying,

   2 Son of man, you dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house: They
   have eyes to see, and they see not; They have ears to hear, and they
   hear not, Because their house is revoking.

   3 And you, son of man, make thyself vessels for removal, And remove in
   the day-time before their eyes: Then you shall move from thy place to
   another in their sight, Since perhaps they may consider, for they are a
   rebellious house

   4 And bring forth vessels like vessels for removal In the day-time in
   their sight: And you shall go forth at even in their sight, Like a
   departure into captivity.

   5 In their sight; you shall dig thyself a wall, And carry out (thy
   goods) by it:

   6 In their eyes upon thy shoulder shall you carry (them); In darkness
   shall you go forth: You shall cover thy face, and not look upon the
   ground, Because I have placed thee as a sign to the house of Israel.

   7 Then I did as I was commanded. My vessels I carried forth like
   vessels for captivity In the daytime; Then in the evening I dug through
   the wall by my hand; [318] In the darkness I led them forth, Upon my
   shoulder I carried them in their sight.

   8 Then in the morning the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   9 Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said
   to thee,

   10 What doest you? Say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This
   burden [319] relates to the prince in Jerusalem, And to all the house
   of Israel in the midst of them.

   11 Say unto them, I am your portent: As I have done, so shall it be
   done to them: They shall be taken away and led into captivity.

   12 Then the prince in the midst of them Shall carry on his shoulder in
   the darkness, And go forth through the wall, Through which they have
   dug for carrying out by it: He shall cover his face so as not to look
   upon the ground.

   13 Then I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my
   snare: Then I will lead him away to Babylon in the land of Chaldea; Yet
   he shall not see it, though he shall die there.

   14 And all who are about him to help him, and all his garrison, Will I
   scatter to every wind, and I will unsheath my sword after them [320]

   15 Then they shall know that I ant Jehovah, After I shall have
   scattered them among the nations, And shall have dispersed them through
   their lands.

   16 And I will make the remnant of them but few By the sword, and
   famine, and pestilence; That they may narrate all their abominations
   Among the Gentiles to whom they come; And they shall know that; I am
   Jehovah.

   17 Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   18 Son of man, eat thy bread with trembling, and drink thy water With
   tumult and anxiety: And you shall say to the people of the land,

   19 Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the dwellers at Jerusalem, And on the
   land of Israel, They shall eat their bread in torture, [321] And shall
   drink their water in desolation, That the land rosy be spoiled of its
   fullness, On account of the violence of all its inhabitants.

   20 And inhabited cities shall be reduced to solitude, And the land laid
   waste; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

   21 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   22 Son of man, What is this proverb of yours in the land of Israel,
   saying, The days are prostrated, and all prophecy has ceased?

   23 Wherefore you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will
   make this proverb cease, And they shall no more use this proverb in
   Israel; But rather say to them, The days are at hand, And the word of
   every vision.

   24 Because there shall no longer be any lying vision, Nor any
   flattering divination in the midst of the house of Israel.

   25 Since I Jehovah will speak: And the word which I shall speak, I will
   also perform; It shall no longer be prolonged: Since in your days, O
   exasperating house, The word which I shall speak, I will perform, says
   the Lord Jehovah.

   26 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   27 Son of man, behold the house of Israel say, The vision which he saw
   is extended to many days, And he prophesieth for times afar off.

   28 Wherefore you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, It
   shall not be put off any longer; All the words which I have spoken,
   even every word, Will I fulfill, says the Lord Jehovah.

   CHAPTER 13.

   1 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   2 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel That prophesy,
   and say unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear you the
   word of Jehovah;

   3 Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Wo unto the foolish prophets, Who walk
   after their own spirit, and have seen nothing! [322]

   4 Like foxes in the deserts, are thy prophets, O Israel.

   5 You have not gone up to the broken places, Nor repaired the hedge
   around the house of Israel, To stand in the battle in the day of
   Jehovah.

   6 They have seen vanity, they have divined a he, Saying, Jehovah says,
   and Jehovah has not sent them; And they caused men to hope for the
   confirmation of their word.

   7 Have you not seen a vision of vanity, and spoken a divination of is?
   And yet you say Jehovah says it, and I have not spoken it.

   8 Wherefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, [323] Because you have spoken
   vanity, and have seen a he, Wherefore behold! I am against t. hem, Says
   the Lord Jehovah.

   9 And my hand shall be against the prophets who see vanity and divine a
   lie: They shall not be in the counsel of my people, And shall not be
   written in the catalogue of the house of Israel, And they shall not
   return to the land of Israel; And you shall know that I am the Lord
   Jehovah.

   10 Because, even because, they have deceived my people, By saying,
   Peace, and there was no peace: And one built up a wall, and, behold,
   others daubed it with untempered mortar:

   11 Say to those who daub it with untempered mortar, It shall fall:
   There shall be an inundating shower: And I will send hailstones; And
   the breath of whirlwinds shall rend it.

   12 Lo! the wall shall fall: shall it not be said to you, Where is the
   daubing with which you have daubed it?

   13 Besides, thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will make it fall: [324]
   There shall be the breath. of tempests in my wrath, And an inundating
   shower in my anger, And hailstones in my fury to consume them.

   14 Then I will overthrow the wall which you have daubed with untempered
   mortar, And I will bring it down to the ground; Then its foundation
   shall be discovered when it shall fall, And you shall be consumed in
   the midst of it; And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

   15 I will also satisfy mine indignation upon the wall As well as upon
   its daubing, and will say to them, The wall is gone, and the daubers of
   it are no more.

   16 The prophets of Israel prophesied concerning Jerusalem, And saw a
   vision of peace for it; Yet there is no peace, says the Lord Jehovah.

   17 Son of man, do you set thy face against the daughters of thy people,
   Who prophesy out of their own heart, and prophesy against them,

   18 And you shall say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Wo to those who sow
   pillows to all armholes, And make coverings for the head of every
   stature, To hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people? And will
   you preserve your own souls alive?

   19 Will you profane me before my people for handfuls of barley and
   pieces of bread, To slay the souls that were not dying, And to give
   life to the souls that were not alive, By deceiving my people who
   listen to your is?

   20 Because thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold! I am against your
   pillows by which you there hunt souls for their escape; And I will tear
   them from your arms, And set free the souls which you have hunted, that
   they may escape.

   21 I will also rend your coverings, and deliver my people out of your
   hands; They shall no longer be a prey in your hands; And you shall know
   that I am Jehovah.

   22 Because you have grieved the heart of the just by falsehood, And I
   have not grieved him; And you have strengthened the hands of the
   wicked, So that he should not be converted from his evil way

   23 For saving his life: wherefore you shall not see a he Nor divine a
   divination any more; For I will rescue my people from your hands: And
   you shall know that I am Jehovah.

   CHAPTER 14

   1 Then men came to me from the elders of Israel, And sat before my
   face.

   2 Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying,

   3 Son of man, these men have set their idols up in their heart, And
   have put a stumbling block of iniquity before their face. Shall I
   verily be inquired of by them?

   4 Wherefore speak unto them, and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Every
   man of the house of Israel, who setteth up his idols in his heart, And
   has put the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, And has
   come to the Prophet; I Jehovah Will answer him according to the
   multitude of his idols; [325]

   5 That I may seize the house of Israel in their own heart, Because they
   have entirely separated themselves from me by their idols.

   6 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah,
   Turn you, Even turn yourselves from your idols; And turn your faces
   from all your abominations.

   7 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers sojourning
   in Israel, Who is separated [326] from following after me, And has set
   up his idols in his heart, And put the stumbling-block of his iniquity
   before his face, And cometh to the Prophet to inquire of me through
   him; I Jehovah will answer him for myself.

   8 Then will I set my face against that man, And set him for a sign and
   a proverb, And I will cut him off from the midst of my people; And you
   shall know that I am Jehovah.

   9 And when a prophet is deceived in uttering his speech, I Jehovah have
   deceived that prophet; And I will stretch forth my hand upon him, And
   will blot him out of the midst of my people Israel.

   10 They shall also bear their iniquity; As the iniquity of the
   inquirer, so shall be the iniquity of the prophet;

   11 That the house of Israel may stray from me no more, Neither be
   polluted any more with all their wickedness; That they may be my
   people, and I may be their God, says the Lord Jehovah.

   12 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   13 Son of man, when a land has acted wickedly against me, [327] And I
   shall stretch out my hand upon it, And shall break the staff of its
   bread, And shall send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and
   beast:

   14 Though these three men were in it, Noah, Daniel, and Job, They shall
   deliver but their own souls in their righteousness, Says the Lord
   Jehovah.

   15 If I cause an evil beast to pass through the land, And it bereave it
   and lay it waste, So that no man can pass through on account of the
   beast:

   16 Though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah,
   If they shall deliver their own souls, They alone shall be delivered,
   and the land shall be laid waste.

   17 Or if I make a sword pass through that land, And I say to the sword,
   Pass through the land, So that: man. and beast may be cut off from it:

   18 And these three men are in the midst of it, As I live, says the Lord
   Jehovah, They shall not deliver their sons and their daughters, Since
   they alone shall be set free.

   19 Or if I shall send a pestilence upon that land, And pour out my
   wrath upon it in blood, To destroy from it man and beast:

   20 And Noah, Daniel, and Job were in the midst of it, As I live, says
   the Lord Jehovah, They shall not deliver either son or daughter; They
   shall free their own soul in their righteousness.

   21 Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, How much more when I send my
   four grievous judgments against Jerusalem, The sword, and famine, and
   evil beast, to destroy from it man and beast?

   22 And lo! the remnant that is left in it, [328] The remnant of those
   who go forth, namely, sons and daughters, They shall go forth unto you:
   And you shall see their ways and their works, And you shall console
   yourselves for all the evil Which I have brought upon Jerusalem, Yea,
   all that I have brought upon her.

   23 Then shall you be comforted when you shall see their ways and their
   works: And you shall know that I have not done in vain Whatever I have
   done in it, says the Lord Jehovah.

   CHAPTER 15

   1 Then came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,

   2 Son of man, What is the wood of the vine Better than any
   branching-tree among the trees of the wood?

   3 Shall wood be taken from it to form any work? Or will it make a peg
   to hang any vessel thereon?

   4 Behold, it is east into the fire for burning; The fire devoured both
   ends of it, and its middle is burnt [329] Is it useful for any purpose?

   5 Lo! when it was entire, it was not used for any purpose: How much
   less when the fire has consumed it, And it is burnt up, shall it be
   useful for any purpose?

   6 Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, As the wood of the vine among
   the trees of the forest, Which I have cast into the fire for fuel, So
   have I given the inhabitants of Jerusalem:

   7 Then will I set my face against them; They shall pass through fire,
   and fire shall consume them; And they shall know that I am Jehovah,
   When I have set my face against them.

   8 Then will I make the land desolate, Because they have transgressed
   with transgression [330] Says the Lord Jehovah.

   CHAPTER 16

   1 Then the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

   2 Son of man, lay open to Jerusalem her abominations.

   3 Thus shall you say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem, Thy
   source and thy birth-place was the land of Canaan; Thy father was an
   Amorite, thy mother a Hittite.

   4 Then as to thy nativity, in the day of thy birth, Thy navel was not
   cut: you was not washed with water To supple thee: you was not salted
   with salt, [331] Nor wrapped in swaddling clothes.

   5 No eye pitied thee, to do unto thee any one of these things, In
   considering thee; and you was cast forth On the surface of the field,
   to the disgrace of thy person, in the day of thy birth.

   6 Then I passed near thee and saw thy defilement's, And I said to thee
   in thy bloods, Live; Yea, I said to thee in thy bloods, Live.

   7 Then I made thee grow as a germ of the field, And you did increase
   and flourish; You became remarkably beautiful; [332] Thy breasts became
   prominent and your hair profuse, Yet you was naked and bare.

   8 Then I passed by and saw thee: and lo! the time, the time for love:
   Then I stretched out my skirt over thee, And covered thy nakedness; and
   I swore to thee, And made a covenant with thee, And you was mine, saith
   the Lord Jehovah.

   9 Then I washed thee with water, and cleansed thy blood from thee, And
   anointed thee with oil. and clothed thee in a Phrygian robe;

   10 Then I shod thee with badgers' skin, and dressed thee in fine linen;
   Then I arrayed thee in silk, and adorned thee with ornaments,

   11 And put bracelets on thy hands, and a chain round thy Deck.

   12 Then I put a ring through thy nose, [333] and earrings in your ears,
   And a crown of comeliness on thy head.

   13 I adorned thee with gold and silver, and clothed thee with fine
   linen, And silk and broidered work you did eat fine flour, and honey,
   and oil; And you was beautiful exceedingly, And you did proceed
   prosperously to thy kingdom.

   14 Then thy fame went forth among the nations for beauty, Because you
   was perfect in the beauty Which I caused unto thee, says the Lord
   Jehovah.

   15 But you did trust in thy beauty, and commit fornication through thy
   renown, And did pour out thy fornications to every passer by;

   16 His it was. -- Then you has taken of thy garments, And made thee
   high places sprinkled with spots, And has committed fornication upon
   them: They do not come, and it shall not be. [334]

   17 You has also taken vessels of thy beauty of my gold And of my silver
   which I had given thee; And you has made for thyself images of men, And
   has committed fornication with them.

   18 Then you has taken of thy variegated garments, And has clothed them:
   and my oil and mine incense Has you set before them.

   19 My bread also which, I gave thee, fine flour and oil, And honey with
   which I fed thee, You has set it before them for a sweet savor; And so
   it has happened, says the Lord Jehovah.

   20 Then you has taken thy sons and thy daughters which you has borne to
   me, And has slain them to be devoured: Are then thy fornications a
   small thing?

   21 Then you has slain my sons, and caused them to be thrown to idols.
   [335]

   22 And in all your abominations and thy lewdness You has not remembered
   the days of thy youth, When you was naked and bare, and defiled in thy
   bloods.

   23 So after all thy wickedness it has happened to thee, Wo! wo! unto
   thee, says the Lord Jehovah.

   24 Then you has built a high place for thyself, And has made thee a
   raised spot in every street.

   25 At the head of every way you has built thy high place; Then you has
   made thy beauty abominable, And has spread thy feet to every passer by,
   And has multiplied thy lewdness'.

   26 You has also committed adultery with the Egyptians Thy neighbors,
   great of flesh: and over and over again Has committed lewdness to
   irritate me.

   27 Then lo! I stretched out my hand over thee, And I diminished thy
   portion, and delivered thee up To the lust of the daughters of the
   Philistines, who hated thee, And were ashamed of your abandoned ways.

   28 Then you has committed adultery with the sons of Ashur, Since you
   was not satisfied, you has been lewd with them; Yet even then you was
   not, satisfied.

   29 Then you has increased thy lewdnesses In the land of Canaan unto
   Chaldea; And even this did not satiate thee.

   30 How soft is your heart, says the Lord Jehovah, Since you doest all
   the work of a bold abandoned woman!

   31 Since you has raised your high place at the head of every way, And
   has made thy lofty place in every celebrated spot; And has not been
   like a harlot in scorning hire. [336]

   32 An adulterous woman receiving strangers instead of her husband!

   33 To all harlots men give a reward; But you has given thy gifts to all
   thy lovers, And you has hired them to come to thee from all sides

   34 For thy fornications -- for in thy lewdness You have inverted the
   custom of other women; Since there is no fornication like thine:
   Because you has given instead of receiving a gift, Then you has acted
   contrary to others.

   35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear Jehovah's word!

   36 Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because thy shamelessness is poured out,
   And thy baseness detected in thy lewdness towards thy lovers, And
   towards all the idols of your abominations, And in the bloods of thy
   children whom you has given to them;

   37 Wherefore lo! I will assemble all thy lovers Whom you has attracted,
   and all whom you has loved and hated; I will assemble them from all
   around thee, And I will lay bare thy nakedness before them, And they
   shall behold all thy turpitude.

   38 Then will I judge thee with the judgment of adulteresses, And of
   those who pour out blood; and I will give thee The blood of fury and of
   jealousy.

   39 And I will give thee into their hand, And they shall pull down thy
   high place, And destroy thy raised places, and shall spoil thee of thy
   robes; They shall also take the vessels of thy glory, And send thee
   away, naked and bare.

   40 Then they shall stir up a crowd against thee, And stone thee with
   stones, and thrust at thee with swords.

   41 Then they shall burn thy houses with fire, And shall execute
   judgments against thee in the eyes of many women: Then will I cause
   thee to cease from fornication, Neither shall you offer a gift any
   more.

   42 And I will cause my fury towards thee to rest, And my jealousy shall
   depart from thee, And I will rest and be no longer angry.

   43 Because you has not remembered the days of thy youth, But has
   provoked me in all those things; I will even recompense thy way upon
   your head, Says the Lord Jehovah; since you has taken no thought For
   all your abominations. [337]

   44 Lo! every user of proverbs shall use this proverb against thee,
   Saying, As the mother is, so is the daughter.

   45 You art the daughter of thy mother, who has east away her husband
   and her sons; And the sister of thy sisters, who loathe their husbands
   and children; Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite:

   46 And your elder sister is Samaria, and her daughters those who dwell
   at thy left hand; And thy younger sister, who dwells at thy right hand,
   is Sodom and her daughters.

   47 Yet you has not walked in their ways, And you has not done according
   to their abominations, As if it had been a very small firing, And you
   has been more corrupt than they in all thy ways.

   48 As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, If Sodom thy sister and her
   daughters have done As you and thy daughters have done.

   49 Lo! this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, Pride, fullness of
   bread, and security of ease Belonged to her and her daughters and she
   did not lay hold Of the hand of the poor and needy; but she was
   haughty,

   50 And did abomination before me, Hence I took them away as it pleased
   me. [338]

   51 And Samaria has not committed half of thy sins; But you has
   multiplied your abominations beyond them, And has justified thy sisters
   in all the abominations which you has done.

   52 Bear you, then, thy disgrace by which you has pleaded for thy
   sister, By thy crimes which you has committed beyond them; They are
   justified more than you be you then ashamed, And bear thy disgrace,
   since you has justified thy sisters.

   53 Yet will I turn the captivity, yea, the captivity of Sodom and her
   daughters, And the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, And the
   captivity of thy captivities in the midst of them,

   54 That you mayest bear thy reproach, and mayest be ashamed Of all that
   you has done in consoling them.

   55 And thy sisters Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former
   state, And Samaria and her daughters shall return to theirs, And you
   and thy daughters shall return to yours.

   56 Then thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thee, In the day of thy
   pride, before thy wickedness was detected;

   57 As in the time of thy reproach from the daughters of Syria, And from
   all around of the daughters of the Philistines, Who despised thee round
   about.

   58 As for thy depraved thoughts and abominations, You has borne them,
   says Jehovah.

   59 For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will also do to thee as you has
   done, Who has despised the oath and broken the covenant.

   60 Yet I will remember my covenant with thee In the days of thy youth,
   and I will establish a perpetual covenant with thee.

   61 Then you shall remember thy ways and be ashamed, When you shall
   receive thy sisters, both elder and younger than thyself; And I will
   give them unto thee for daughters, But not by thy covenant.

   62 For I will establish my covenant with thee, And you shall know that
   I am Jehovah.

   63 That you mayest remember and be ashamed, And not open thy mouth any
   more because of thy disgrace, When I am propitious to thee for all thy
   deeds, Says the Lord Jehovah.

   CHAPTER 17

   1 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   2 Son of man, put forth an enigma and utter a proverb to the house of
   Israel;

   3 And say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, A mighty eagle, with great
   wings, long feathers, and full of plumage, Of various colors, came to
   Mount Lebanon, And took the highest branch of a cedar;

   4 He cropped off the top of its young twigs, And carried it into the
   land of the merchant; He planted it in a city of merchants.

   5 He took also of the seed of the land, And put it in a fruitful field;
   He planted it near many waters, like a willow. [339]

   6 Then it grew and became a luxuriant vine, low of stature, So that its
   branches turned towards the eagle, And its roots were under him; and it
   became a vine, And brought forth branches, and sent out boughs.

   7 There was also another large eagle, [340] of great wings and of
   copious plumage, And lo! this vine bent its roots towards him, And sent
   forth its branches towards him, That he might water it from the beds of
   his plantation.

   8 In a good soil near many streams was it planted, That it should
   produce leaves and bring forth fruit, So as to be a magnificent vine.

   9 Say you, Thus says the, Lord Jehovah, Shall it prosper? Shall not one
   pluck up its roots and cut down its fruits, And dry up all its
   branches, that it may wither? Then it shall not be for a great arm or
   much people To take it [341] away from its roots.

   10 Yet, behold, when planed, shall it prosper? Shall it not completely
   wither when the east wind has touched it.? Upon the beds of its
   plantation shall it wither.

   11 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   12 Say, I pray thee, to the rebellious house, Know you not what this
   means? Say, Lo! the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, And has taken
   away its king and its elders, and carried them with him to Babylon;

   13 Then he took from the royal seed, and struck an agreement with him,
   And made him descend to an oath; Then he took also the mighty of the
   land;

   14 That the kingdom should be low, and not raise itself up, And keep
   its agreement and stand in it.

   15 But he rebelled against him, by sending his ambassadors To Egypt,
   that horses and much people might be given him: Shall he who doeth
   these things prosper and escape? Shall he who breaks the treaty get
   off?

   16 As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if he shall not die In the place
   of the king who made him reign, Whose oath he has despised, and whose
   treaty he has made vain, In the midst of Babylon.

   17 Neither with a mighty army nor a great host Shall Pharaoh meet with
   him in battle, By throwing up a mound and by building a tower, to cut
   off many souls.

   18 Through breaking the covenant he has despised his oath, And, behold,
   he has stretched forth his hand, And has done all this, and shall not
   escape.

   19 Besides, thus says the Lord Jehovah, As I live, If I do not
   recompense on his own head My oath which he has despised, and my
   covenant which he has broken,

   20 Then I will stretch my net over him, and he shall be taken in my
   snare; And I will lead him to Babylon, and will plead with him there,
   Concerning the transgression which he has transgressed against me.

   21 And all his fugitives,. with all his forces, shall fall by the
   sword; And the remnant shall be scattered to every wind; And you shall
   know that I Jehovah have spoken.

   22 Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will take from the top of the lofty
   cedar, And I will tear off a tender branch from its twigs and will set
   it: And I will plant it on a lofty and elevated mountain;

   23 On a lofty mountain of Israel will I plant it; And it shall bring
   forth a bough and bear fruit, and shall be a tall cedar; [342] Then
   every bird shall dwell under it; Every winged thing shall shelter
   itself under the shadow of its branches.

   24 Then all the trees of the field shall know that I am Jehovah, Who
   humble the high tree and raise aloft the low tree; I dry up the green
   tree, and make the dry tree fruitful I Jehovah have spoken and have
   done it.

   CHAPTER 18

   1 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

   2 What mean you by using this proverb [343] about the land of Israel,
   Saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children's teeth
   are set on edge?

   3 As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, You shall not hereafter Use this
   proverb any more in Israel.

   4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, So the soul of
   the son is mine. The soul which has sinned shall die itself.

   5 But if a man have been just, and done judgment and justice,

   6 And have neither eaten upon the mountains, nor raised his eyes To the
   idols of the house of Israel, and have not polluted His neighbor's
   wife, nor approached a female when separated;

   7 If he have not afflicted any one, and have restored to the debtor his
   pledge, Have not seized the prey, have given his bread to the hungry,
   And have covered the naked with a garment:

   8 Have not given upon usury, and have taken no increase, Have withdrawn
   his hand from iniquity, And have done justice faithfully between man
   and man;

   9 Have walked in my statutes, and kept my judgments, to do the truth
   [344] He is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah.

   10 But if he beget a son, who is a robber and a shedder of blood, And
   who doeth to his brother [345] any one of these things,

   11 And has not done all these precepts of the law, But has eaten on the
   mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife;

   12 Has oppressed the poor and needy, has spoiled by violence, Has not
   restored the pledge, has lifted up his eyes unto idols;

   13 Has done abomination, has given on usury and taken increase; Shall
   he live? He shall not live; he has done all these abominations; He
   shall surely die: his blood shall be on him.

   14 And lo! if he beget a son, and he see all the wickedness which his
   father has committed, And feared, and hath not done according to them;

   15 Has not eaten upon the mountains, and has not raised his eyes To the
   idols of the house of Israel, and has not defiled his neighbor's wife;
   Hath oppressed no one, has not taken a pledge,

   16 Hath not spoiled by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry,
   And has covered the naked with a garment;

   17 Has withdrawn his hand from the poor, Has not received increase and
   usury, has done my judgments, Has walked in my decrees; he shall not
   die Through the ]iniquity of his father; he shall surely live.

   18 His father, -- because by oppressing he has oppressed, And has
   snatched the prey from his brother, And has done that which is not good
   in the midst of the people, -- Behold, he shall die in his iniquity.

   19 And you say, Why? shall not the son bear his father's iniquity?
   Because the son has done judgment and justice, And has kept all my
   statutes and has done them, Therefore shall he surely live.

   20 The soul which has sinned, that shall die. The son shall not bear
   the father's iniquity, And the father shall not bear the son's
   iniquity; The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, And the
   impiety of the impious shall be upon him.

   21 Then, if the wicked man shall withdraw from all the wickedness which
   he has done, And have kept all my sayings, and have done justice and
   judgement, He shall surely live -- he shall not die.

   22 All the transgressions which he has committed Shall not come into
   memory to him; But in his righteousness; which he has done shall he
   live.

   23 Do I earnestly desire the death of the wicked, says the Lord
   Jehovah? Do I not desire that he turn from his evil ways and live?

   24 Then, if a just man turn aside from his justice, And do iniquity,
   according to all the abominations Which the wicked man has done, shall
   he live? All his righteous deeds shall not come into remembrance? [346]
   In the transgression which he has transgressed, And in the wickedness
   which he has wickedly done, In them shall he die -- yet you have said
   --

   25 The way of the Lord is not upright. Hear you then, O house of
   Israel, is not my way upright? Are not your ways perverse? [347]

   26 If the just man has turned aside from his justice, And has done
   iniquity, and has died in it, In his own iniquity which he has
   committed shall he die.

   27 And if the wicked man has turned aside from the wickedness which he
   has done, And has done judgment and justice, he shall preserve his soul
   alive. [348]

   28 Then, if he have seen and have turned away from all the wickedness
   Which he has done, he shall surely live -- he shall not die.

   29 Yet, the house of Israel have said, The way of the Lord is not
   upright. Are not my ways upright, O house of Israel? Are not your ways
   perverse?

   30 Wherefore I will judge each of you according to his ways, O house of
   Israel, says the Lord Jehovah. Turn you, and depart from all your
   transgressions, And let not iniquity be your snare.

   31 Cast away from you all your iniquities whereby you have
   transgressed; And make you a new heart and a new spirit: For why will
   you die, O house of Israel?

   32 Since I do not delight in the death of the dying, Says the Lord
   Jehovah -- wherefore turn you, and live.

   CHAPTER 19

   1 Wherefore take you up this mournful strain against the princes of
   Israel,

   2 And say, Why did thy mother -- a lioness -- Lie down among lions? she
   brought up her whelps In the midst of lions.

   3 Then she bore one of her whelps, and he was made a lion: Then he
   learnt to seize his prey, and he devoured men.

   4 Then the Gentiles heard of him; he was taken in their pit, And they
   led him in chains into the land of Egypt.

   5 Then she saw what she had hoped for, and how her hope had perished;
   And she took another of her whelps, and made him a lion.

   6 Then he walked in the midst of lions, and became a lion; And he
   learnt to seize the prey, and devoured men.

   7 Then he harassed their palaces and destroyed their cities; And the
   land was rendered desolate, and all its fullness, By the voice of his
   roaring.

   8 Then the nations set themselves against him From all sides and
   regions, and spread their net over him. He was taken in their pitfall:
   and they put him in ward,

   9 And brought him in chains to the king of Babylon. They led him into
   strongholds, that his voice Might be no longer heard in the mountains
   of Israel.

   10 Thy mother, when she bore thee, [349] was planted like a vine near
   the waters: She was fruitful and branching beside many waters.

   11 And the rods of her strength were for scepters for rulers, And her
   stature was elevated, and appeared aloft In the multitude of her
   branches.

   12 Then she was torn in fury, and cast on the ground; And the east wind
   dried up her fruit; Her strong rods were broken off and dried up; The
   fire consumed them; and now she is planted

   13 In the desert, in a land of dryness and thirst.

   14 Then a fire went forth from the rod of her branches, and devoured
   her fruit; And there was not a rod of strength in her -- a scepter for
   ruling. This is the lamentation, and shall be for a wailing.

   [349] Calvin translates with the authorized version in tuo sanguine,
   "in thy blood," and explains it as above, dum peperit. Capellus and
   Pradus, by a slight alteration of the Hebrew letters from vdmk,

   in his Annotations on Grotius, prefers this sense; but Jerome, Rab.

   CHAPTER 20

   1 It occurred in the seventh year, the fifth month, the tenth day of
   the month, Men from the elders of Israel came to consult Jehovah, And
   sat before my face. And the word of Jehovah

   2 Came to me, saying, Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel,

   3 And say unto there, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Are you come. to
   inquire of me? As I live, If I will be sought by you, saith the Lord
   Jehovah,

   4 Wilt you judge them, wilt you judge them, son of man? Explain to them
   the abominations of their fathers;

   5 Then you shall say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, In the day
   on which I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand To the seed of the house
   of Jacob, and was known to them in the land of Egypt, Then I raised my
   hand to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God:

   6 In that day I lifted up my hand towards them, To bring them from the
   land of Egypt into a land which I espied for them, Flowing with milk
   and honey, desirable beyond all lands.

   7 Then I said to them, Cast you away every one the abominations of his
   eyes, And pollute not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I Jehovah am
   your God; and they rebelled against me,

   8 And were unwilling to hear me: they did not cast away The idols of
   their eyes: they did not desert the idols of Egypt: Then I said that I
   would pour out my wrath upon them; To fill up nay fury against them in
   the midst of the land of Egypt.

   9 But, I acted for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in
   the eyes of the nations, In the midst of which they were; in whose
   sight I was known to them, By bringing them forth from the land of
   Egypt.

   10 Then I led them out from the land of Egypt, and brought them into
   the desert.

   11 And I gave them my decrees, and made known my judgments unto them,
   Which if a man do, he shall live in them.

   12 Moreover I gave them my Sabbaths for a sign between me and them,
   That they might know that I am he who sanctifieth them.

   13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the desert: They
   walked not in my decrees, And despised my judgments, Which if a mall
   do, he shall live in them. And my sabbaths they greatly violated: Then
   I said I would pour out my wrath in the desert to consume them.

   14 Then I acted for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned In
   the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I led them out.

   15 Yet I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, That I should not
   lead them into the land which I had given them, Flowing with milk and
   honey, the desire of all lands,

   16 Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my decrees,
   And polluted my sabbaths; because their heart walked after their idols.

   17 Then mine eye spared them, so that I did not destroy them, And did
   not consume them in the desert.

   18 Then I said unto their sons in the desert, Walk you not in the
   decrees of your fathers, And keep not their judgments, and pollute not
   yourselves with their idols:

   19 I Jehovah am your God, walk you in my decrees, And keep my
   judgments, and do them:

   20 And hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you,
   That you may know that I Jehovah am your God.

   21 Then these sons became rebels against me: They walked not in my
   decrees, and kept not my judgments To do them, which if a man do, he
   shall live in them; They profaned my Sabbaths: and I said That I would
   pour out my wrath upon them, To accomplish my fury against them in the
   desert.

   22 Then I withdrew my hand, and acted for my name's sake, That it
   should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, Before whose sight I
   led them out.

   23 I also lifted up my hand to them in the desert To scatter them among
   the nations, and disperse them through the lands;

   24 Because they did not perform my judgments, And despised my statutes,
   and violated my Sabbaths; And their eyes were after their fathers'
   idols.

   25 I therefore gave them decrees that were not good, And judgments by
   which they could not live;

   26 And I contaminated them in their gifts, By casting away every
   first-born offspring, To destroy them, that. they may know that I am
   Jehovah.

   27 Wherefore, speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to
   them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Hither to your fathers Have
   dishonored me in this by prevaricating greatly against me:

   28 For I introduced them into the land, for which I raised my hand to
   give it them; And they saw every high inn, and every branching tree:
   Then they sacrificed there their offerings, And offered there the
   irritation of their oblation, And placed there the odor of their sweet
   fragrance, And poured out there their libations.

   29 Then said I unto them, What is the high place to which you approach?
   For its name is called "Lofty" unto this day.

   30 Wherefore, say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah,
   Are you polluted after the way of your fathers? And do you commit
   adultery after their idols?

   31 For in offering your gifts, and in passing your sons through the
   fire, You pollute yourselves in all your idols unto this day Then shall
   I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel! As I live, says the Lord
   Jehovah, if I shall be inquired of by you.

   32 That also which comes it to your mind shall not happen, Since you
   say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the lands,

   33 To serve wood and stone. As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, If I will
   not rule over you with a strong hand, and an extended arm, and in fury
   poured forth.

   34 And I will lead you out from the people, and collect you from the
   lands Through which you were dispersed, by a strong hand, and with an
   extended arm,

   35 And with fury poured forth. Then I will lead you into the desert of
   the Gentiles, And will plead with you there face to face.

   36 As I pleaded with your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt,
   So will I dispute with you, says the Lord Jehovah.

   37 Then I will make you pass under the rod, And bring you within the
   bond of a covenant:

   38 Then will I purge out from among you the rebels, And the
   transgressors against me from the land of their habitation Will I bring
   the impious, and they shall not enter the land of Israel; And you shall
   know that I am Jehovah.

   39 As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah, Go you,
   let each serve his idols, since you do not hear me, And the name of my
   sanctity profane no longer

   40 With your gifts and your idols, since in the mountain of my
   sanctity, In a lofty mountain of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, There
   shall the whole house of Israel worship me; All, I say, in the land
   there will I be propitious to them; And there will I require your
   oblations, And the first-fruits of your gifts in all your
   purification's.

   41 In the odor of sweet fragrance will I be propitious to you, When I
   shall have brought you from the people, And gathered you from the lands
   through which you will be dispersed; And I will be sanctified in you in
   the eyes of the nations.

   42 Then shall you know that I am Jehovah, When I shall have brought you
   back into the land of Israel, Into the region about which I raised my
   hand to give it to your fathers.

   43 And there I will remember your ways, and all your works, In which
   you were polluted; and you shall be confused in face [350] Through all
   your wickedness which you have committed.

   44 Then shall you know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have done among
   you According to. my name, not according to your evil ways, Nor
   according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, says the Lord
   Jehovah.

   As Calvin's Latin Translation ends here, so the version by the
   Translator comes naturally to a close. It has not been thought
   necessary to re-translate from the original the remainder of Ezekiel,
   as the previously quoted labors of Newcome and Rosenmuller are
   sufficiently accessible and explanatory.

   A LIST OF THE CHIEF INTERPRETERS,
   ANCIENT AND MODERN.

   1. Jewish Commentators.

   Schelomoh Jarchi Ben Jizchak, commonly called Solomon Jarchi, son of
   Isaac, known to the Jews by the word Raschi, made up of the initials of
   rvy slmh yrchy, Rabbi Schelomoh Jarchi, was an eminent commentator on
   the whole of the Old Testament. the was born at Troyes, in Champagne, a
   province of France, and died A.D. 1180. His chief value arises from his
   having collected the best traditionary interpretations of his ancestors
   from the earliest times.

   David Kimchi, son of Joseph, known to the Jews by the name of Radak,
   from the initial letters of rvy dvr qmchy, Rabbi David Kimchi, was a
   Spaniard. Though he lived so lately as the twelfth ten bury, his
   interpretation is much valued by both Jews and. Christians for its
   grammatical accuracy. His commentary on Ezekiel is found in the
   Rabbinical Writings, edited by Buxtorf, A. D. 1618. Basil, 2 volumes.;
   and also 1724, Amsterdam.

   Isaac Abarbanel, a Portuguese Jew, born at Lisbon, A.D. 1437, and died
   in Apulia, A.D. 1508. His comments on Ezekiel appeared first at Pesaro,
   in Italy, A.D. 1520; and then again at Amsterdam, A.D. 1641. He is
   highly esteemed for his extensive erudition and his clear style.

   Shelomoh Ben Melech, a Spaniard, who lived at Constantinople in the
   middle of the sixteenth century. Under the title, The Perfection of
   Beauty, he wrote an elaborate commentary on the Old Testament,
   Constantinople, A.D. 1554, It was reprinted at Amsterdam, A.D. 1661 and
   1685, fol., with the additions of Jacob Abendana. Tympius and Danzius
   have illustrated the manner in which he has improved upon or
   misunderstood D. Kimchi, according to Wolf, Bibliothec. Hebr., volume 4
   pages 989, 991.

   These references to Jewish interpreters will enable the reader to judge
   how far their opinion on the sense of a passage is decisive. It must be
   remembered that they all lived more than a thousand years after the
   Christian era., and that consequently they are not to be esteemed of
   decisive authority.

   Further information may be obtained from Jo. Christ. Wolf's Bibliotheca
   Hebraee, volume 2, page 368, and elsewhere. Le Long and Boerner's Bib.
   Sac. ab. A. G. Masch, pt. 1, p. 135; and De Rossi's Annal. Hebrews
   Typ., Parmae, 1795, page 131; and Hartwell Horne, volume 2, part 2,
   where he has chiefly followed Carpzov.

   2. The Early Fathers.

   Origin (between A.D. 185 and 254) appears to have commented very
   voluminously on Ezekiel, as, from the fragments which remain, it
   appears that the twentieth volume only reached to chap. 11. Jerome has
   translated fourteen homilies of Origen's on Ezekiel into Latin, which
   are found in his works. Edit., Vallarsii, Venet. 1736, tom. 5 page 877;
   and in De La Rue's collected edition of Origen's Works, volume 3, page
   325.

   Ephrem of Edessa, who lived about A.D. 370, wrote a Commentary on this
   Prophet in Syriac, which is found in volume H of his works, as edited
   by Pet. Benedict, in Syriac and Latin, at Rome, 1740, fol.

   Eusebius Hieronymus -- the well-known Jerome -- wrote fourteen books of
   Comments on Ezekiel. See his works, edit. Martiani, volume 3, and
   Valarsii, volume 5 Rosenmuller esteems his interpretations highly, and
   often quotes them at length. Smith's Biographical Dictionary, Art.
   Ineronymus, page 465, states, that the fourteen books of his Comments
   on this Prophet were written at intervals, between A.D. 411 and 414,
   having been commenced immediately after his Comments on Isaiah, but
   repeatedly broken off. See also the prolegomena to the 126th Epistle to
   Marcellinus, etc.; the Benedictine edition, volume 3, page 1072.

   Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus, in Syria, who lived about A.D. 420, wrote a
   Commentary on Ezekiel, found in his works, edited by Jac. Sirmond,
   volume 2 page 300; and in the edit. Halen., volume 2 part 2.

   3. Commentators of the
   Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries.

   1587, 8vo.

   Hieron. Padri Et Jo. Bapt. Villalpandi, in Ezechielem Explanationes.
   Romae, 1596, 3 vols. fol.

   This work is much praised and quoted by Rosenmuller. The first volume
   contains the Comments of Pradus on the first six-and-twenty chapters:
   he died before it was published; so that his coadjutor edited it, and
   compiled the two latter volumes. They had access to a Catena Patrum
   Graecorum in Ezechielem, preserved in the Vatican Library, which they
   inserted, translated into Latin by a member of their own order; and
   they enriched their work with valuable illustrations of the city and
   temple at Jerusalem. A full description of the work will be found in
   den Nachrichten von einer Hallischen Bibliothek, part 8 page 18, and
   foll.

   Amandi Polani A Polansdorf Commentaria in Ezechielem. Basileae, 1601,
   4to; and 1608, 4to.

   and 1610, 8vo.

   Jo. Maldonati Commentarii in Ezechielem. Moguntiae, 1611, small 4to.

   This work, by a learned Jesuit, is very explanatory. The Latin
   translation is good, and the Jewish interpretations freely used. Many
   Hebrew words we have found well explained.

   A NOTICE OF THE
   ANCIENT VERSIONS AND CODEXES

   WHICH CONTAIN
   EZEKIEL'S PROPHECIES.

   The Arabic Version Of Ezekiel. It was made from the Septuagint, and is
   contained in the London Polyglot,,. It agrees throughout with that
   Greek text which exists in the Alexandrine Codex, now in the British
   Museum. It was executed from Hesychius's edition of the Septuagint, and
   is valuable for the comparison of cognate words and phrases with the
   Hebrew.

   The Chaldee Version, said to have been made by Jonathan, the son of
   Uzziel, is found in the London Polyglott, and is praised in Buxtorf's
   Rabbinical Commentaries.

   The Alexandrine Codex is esteemed the most ancient MS. existing,
   written probably in the fourth century, though some authorities place
   it much later. [351] The book of Ezekiel was translated for this
   version during the reign of Ptolemy Philometer. Of all the prophets,
   Jeremiah seems the best executed: then Amos, and Ezekiel, and Isaiah
   the worst of all, except Daniel. Edited by Jo. Ern. Grabe, 1707-1720. 4
   vols. fol. Oxon.

   The Codices Of Kennicott And De Rossi. Only some of them contain
   Ezekiel; that formerly belonging to the learned Reuchlin (No. 154)
   contains this Prophet, with a Targum also. The Codex Norimburgensis,
   (No. 198,) written about A.D. 1290, is noticed here only for the order
   in which Ezekiel is placed: it is neither that of the Masorites nor the
   Talmudists. Again, in Codex No. 224, the order is Jeremiah, Ezekiel,
   Isaiah.

   The Codex Romanus Or Vaticanus is of great antiquity. A facsimile of
   this MS. was made for Dr. Grabe in 1704, and Horne has given an
   accurate specimen of Ezekiel, Ezekiel 1:1-3. This facsimile is at long
   the MSS. of the Bodleian Library. Cardinal Anton. Carasa executed an
   edition under the auspices of Pope Sixtus V. Rome, 1587. Fol.

   The Syro. Estranghelae Version is a translation into Syriac of Origen's
   Hexaplar edition of the Septuagint A MS. exists in the Ambrosian
   Library at Milan. It contains Scholia of the Greek and Syrian fathers,
   and various valuable annotations. Matth. Norberg edited from it the
   Prophecies of Ezekiel and Jeremiah, in 1787, 4to, Londini Gothorum;
   giving it the title of Codex Syriaco-Hexaplaris
   Ambrosiano-Mediolanensis. See Eichhorn's account of it in his Allgem.
   Bib. der Bibl. Lit., volume 1 page 837, and foll.

   The Vulgate Version needs mention here only to point out the
   differences in rendering Ezekiel between the editions of Sixtus 5. and
   Clement 8. In Ezekiel 14:22, the former has egredientur, which is
   correct, and the latter ingredientur

   Among The Five Gothic Mss. discovered by Ang. Mai, in the Ambrosian
   Library at Milan, amidst the Codices Rescripti, the homilies of Gregory
   the Great on this Prophet were found written over various portions of
   St. Paul's Epistles. These homilies were executed before the eighth
   century.

   Dissertation First.

   ON THE CHERUBIM.

   THE Visions recorded in the first and tenth chapters of this Prophet
   have received much illustration, and yet remain involved in great
   obscurity. It seems desirable to supply some information, even at the
   risk of being tedious and minute. The living creatures of the first
   chapter are called in the ninth and tenth -- cherubim. The derivation
   of the word is a point of some importance. Castell, in his elaborate
   Lex. Hept., connects it with the Chaldee root krv, kereb, signifying
   "to plough," and quotes Ezekiel 1:10, where "an ox" occurs, "a strong
   animal, of great labor, especially in ploughing; and being used for the
   expiation of sins, becomes a type of Christ, who is there perhaps to be
   understood; for as the ox is the leader of the herd, so Christ is the
   head of the faithful." Josephus says they were animals never seen by
   any one. (Antiq., lib. 3. chapter 6, and lib. 8 chapter 2.) The Arabic
   root of the same three letters, kereb, signifies anxiety and oppressive
   labor, anxit animum, invertit aratio terram; while the cognate forms of
   the Syriac signify ploughing and laborious effort. "The most probable,"
   says Gesenius, "among the many derivations of this word which have been
   proposed, is that from the Syriac, potens magnus fortis." Professor Lee
   writes, in evident despair, "It would be idle to offer anything on the
   etymology: nothing satisfactory having yet been discovered. Castell,
   Simonis, Gesenius, etc., may be consulted by those who wish to see what
   has been said on this subject." The cherubic form has been fully
   portrayed by our Commentator; and by engravings in the Cyclopcedia of
   Biblical Literature we are enabled to compare Egyptian and Persian
   winged symbols with those of the Hebrews. A sculptured bas-relief of a
   winged human figure as it existed before the time of Moses, and placed
   by the Egyptians over their sacred arcs, is worthy of comparison with
   the descriptions of Scripture. The Persian bas-relief at Moung-Aub, is
   a human figure arrayed in an embroidered robe, "with such quadruple
   wings as the vision of Ezekiel ascribes to the cherubim, with the
   addition of ample horns, the well-known symbols of regal power." The
   opinions of divines relative to their design and signification are very
   diversified. Among the ancients Philo supposed them to signify the two
   hemispheres, the flaming sword showing the motion of the planets, and
   the lion and the man being Leo and Aquarius, the signs of the Zodiac.
   Irenaeus (Adv. Heres. 3:11) treats them as emblems of the four
   elements, the four quarters of the globe, the four gospels, and the
   four covenants. Tertullian (Apolog. cap. 47.) referred them to the
   torrid zone, while Justin Martyr treats Ezekiel's figures as relating
   to Nebuchadnezzar eating grass like the ox, with his hand like a
   lion's, and his nails like the claws of a bird, (Quaest. et Respons.
   44, page 325, edit. Heidelbergae, 1593;) and that they were consolatory
   to the captive Israelites by setting before them the prospect of their
   own return, and their oppressor's downfall. The analogy to the four
   gospels, as presented to us by Irenaeus, is peculiarly ingenious, and
   worthy of perusal. Spencer, in his Ritual Observances of the Hebrews,
   has ingeniously explained their form and description. (Lib. 3. Dissert.
   5 cap. 3. and 4 section 2.) Grotius considers them to represent "the
   properties of God, and his actions towards his people," (Annot. in Vet.
   Test.;) and Doederlin, while conceding the praise of ingenuity to the
   conjectures of his author, yet treats his speculations as the abortion
   rather than the legitimate offspring of a luxuriant fancy. (Vogel's
   edit. Grot. continued by Doeder., volume 2 page 247.) Further
   information as to the views of ancient writers has been collected by
   Rosenmuller, on Ezekiel 1:10, edit. see. Lipsiae, 1826. The translation
   of Houbigant may be consulted, and Spencer on the Laws and Ritual of
   the Hebrews, lib. 3. Dissert. 5, chapter 1, and folk The various
   readings on which different translations are founded are rendered very
   accessible to the English reader by the simple and comprehensive notes
   of Archbishop Newcome.

   It is interesting to observe the way in which the learned Jesuit
   Maldonatus comments on this first: chapter. He interprets the four
   visions separately first, the tempest; next, the figure of the four
   animals; the third, the form of the wheels; and the fourth, the
   firmament., and the man sitting on the throne. He objects to the
   allegorical interpretation of Origen and in school, and considers that
   the tempest signifies the calamities which the Chaldaeans caused to the
   Jews and their city. By the whirlwind, the nearness of the calamities
   is pointed out; and by the north wind, its rapidity and destructive
   force. Some, he says, refer it to Babylon, making it symbolize the
   manners of the Chaldaeans, which were rough and boisterous. The great
   cloud seems to him to signify the army of the king of Babylon; and the
   fire, his wrath and fury: the surrounding brightness is an indication
   of the divine majesty, and the amber color is an image of God himself.
   Jerome takes the amber as a symbol of pity, since amber has an
   attractive power, and by placing it in connection with the army of the
   king of Babylon, it implies that God directed every event concerning
   the captivity. Gregory and others interpret the amber of Christ.

   The Second Vision he considers more difficult; he first gives the views
   of other interpreters, and then brings forward his own formed divino
   beneficio, meditando, legendo, orando. Origen (Hom. 1. in Ezekiel)
   takes the four living creatures for the four affections of man's
   nature: the man representing the reasoning faculty, the lion the
   inflammable passions, the ox concupiscence, and the eagle, as it soars
   upwards, the divine spirit, within us. St. Ambrose (Lib. 3. de
   virinibus) refers them to prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice.
   Jerome and Gregory understand them of the four evangelists; and the
   details respecting the wheels, the wings, and the sparks of fire, are
   consistently interpreted. Catina Syrius refers them to the camp of
   Israel in the desert: the face of a man meaning all Israel, that of a
   lion the tribe of Judea, that of an ox the tribe of Levi, and that of
   an eagle God looking down from above, and taking vengeance on the
   people. Theodoret (Comment. in loc.) considers them to represent the
   majesty and glory of God resident in these cherubim. It appears that in
   his day the opinion of Jerome was most popular; and it was necessary to
   give many reasons why the four evangelists were not signified by this
   vision. Philosophical interpreters also existed, no unworthy
   predecessors of the German rationalists. They supposed all things
   indiscriminately signified by these representatives of animated nature,
   while some preferred the changes of the events of providence to the
   manifestations of external nature. His own opinion he records as
   follows: that the cherubim represent four heathen kingdoms, Chaldean,
   Assyrian, Egyptian, and Tyrian. He supposes them placed under the
   firmament, and under the sapphire throne, to indicate the supreme power
   of the Almighty over all things. The wings are the human guards by
   which kings protect themselves; the hands represent human industry,
   strength, and labor; the fire indicates the Spirit of God in kings; and
   the various motions forwards and backwards show the changes in
   governments and the perturbations of empires, all under the control of
   a supreme governor. This scheme is well fortified by passages of
   Scripture, and has the merit of great exactness and ingenuity. [352]

   We now turn to a very different interpreter -- Oecolampadius. His
   comments of this chapter is essentially spiritual. He sees in it a
   representation of God judging the world through Christ. The great
   truths of revelation he sees obscurely shadowed forth under carnal and
   Jewish images; and he is anxious to point out the spiritual reign of
   Christ as promulgated by these outward and visible representations of
   God's glory. He refers these visions, first of all, to the Jews and
   their captivity; but he claims for them the office of tangibly
   illustrating the abiding glory of the universal assembly of the
   faithful. "The universal Church," he says, "has three parts' first, its
   head is Hasmal, represented as an old man seated on a throne next,
   animals, the just or living members, are those more perfect in the
   Church, adorned with a variety of gifts' the wheels are the weaker and
   more ordinary members, which belong to the body, and form the common
   herd of believers, who belong to the more solid parts of the Church,
   since they are under the influence of the same Spirit, although they
   have not attained that fullness of which St. Paul speaks, and have not
   drunk into the peculiar and interior spirit of the Gospel." [353] He
   then confesses the great difficulty of ascertaining the correct
   interpretation' he rejects all Jewish comments, and approves of the
   spiritualizing method of referring it to the coming kingdom of Christ.
   The whirlwind, for instance, he asserts to be a figure of the
   devastation which preceded Christ's first coming, and shall also
   signalize his second advent- the great cloud expresses God's judgments
   on the world, and the fire the process of trial through which all
   things are to pass. Hasmal he regards as the name of an angel or fiery
   living one speaking, and blames Jerome for following the Septuagint,
   and translating it electrum.

   This spiritually-minded reformer has furnished a valuable exposition of
   the mystery contained in the vision recorded in the tenth chapter,
   which is worthy of notice. The likeness of a man upon the throne he
   assumes to be our Savior, whose reign is supreme "in the consciences of
   his elect." Most properly is he called Hasmal, "quod de eo admirabunda
   taciturnitate, et per cogitationes arcanas magnifica loquamur, opus dei
   in illo admirantes." The cherubim are beneath him, because he is adored
   by angels, and has spirits for his messengers and attendants. The
   firmament, he says, is grace offered through Christ, which strengthens
   the hearts of the elect by being infused with in them. The living
   creatures, their wheels and machinery for motion, represent the
   progress of the Church, suffering as yet under corruption, but waiting
   and groaning for the redemption of the body. In each living creature
   all qualities are bound together; for the four faces represent the
   spiritual endowments of advancing Christians; the same animal is a man
   in judgment, a lion in patient endurance, a calf in usefulness and
   guileless sincerity, and an eagle in prompt and cheerful obedience to
   its lord the wings are faith and divine love, which veil the face,
   which is conscience, and of this there are four kinds corresponding Lo
   the human, the leonine, the infantile, and the aquiline appearances.
   "It is the property of a good conscience to by raised upwards towards
   God when confirmed in grace, and, forgetful of thing's past to be more
   and more anxious to reach the firmament of grace." The hands under each
   wing represent those good works by which living faith and active love
   manifest their divine power; while the wheels signify the inferior
   members of the Church, who, though not attaining to the same righteous
   standard, are animated by a similar spirit. The feet being straight and
   equable, and turning easily and constantly in all directions, are said
   to signify the messengers of God proclaiming' his salvation throughout
   the world, and "bearing" all things to all men, that they may bring
   many profitably to Christ." The sound produced by the motion of the
   wings means the fame of salvation arriving at, distant regions; and
   when the Prophet hears the voice exhorting the wheels, it seems to him
   to say, "O wheels, follow with alacrity the spirit of the living
   creature within you; let; nothing; delay you; let nothing tear you from
   the fourfold figure, which is the body of Christ; for if you cleave to
   this, even in its lowest part, you shall be raised up together with
   it." The motion of each animal, in the direction of its face, signifies
   every Christian acting according to his conscience; and although there
   are differences of gifts, and each exercises his own independently, yet
   all follow one common leader, being animated by a common spirit. Thus
   the companion of Zuingle spiritualizes the passage with much
   consistency and at great length, affording a singular example of the
   method of throwing the light of matured Christian experience upon a
   scene so exclusively Jewish. To enable us to decide whether the view of
   Calvin or Ecolampadius is the correct one, we must state some general
   principles, which will be found in the following section.

   Dissertation Second.

   CALVINUS JUDAIZANS AN ORTHODOXUS?

   "Calvinus Judaizans" was the title of a work published at Wittemberg,
   A.D. 1595, by AEgidius Hunnius. It contained a sharp censure for
   applying to the temporal state and circumstances of the Jews those
   prophecies which were supposed to refer spiritually to the Christian
   Church. The year, however, did not pass away before David Pareus
   replied, under the title of "Calvinus Orthodoxus." And all who have
   perused his comments on this Prophet must vindicate him from the charge
   of favoring Judaism, and applaud him for wisely neglecting all
   allegorical significations and mystical expositions. While it will be
   impossible to discuss the whole question of prophetic interpretation,
   it will be necessary to state some general views by which we ought to
   be guided.

   The prophecies of the Old Testament were in many instances a divinely
   provided introduction to the events of the New. In them we may see the
   outlines of the process by which God was ever educating man for
   ultimate restoration to His image. They contain a suggestive method of
   destruction by palpable signs and. wonders, which addressed the soul
   through their influence on the senses. Their value to the Jew was very
   different from that to the Christian. To the former they were the
   highest revelation attainable, while for us they do not reveal a single
   attribute or purpose of Deity which is not more fully made known
   through the Gospel dispensation. The Hebrew visions stand to us in the
   relation of porch to temple, and of dawn to day. They are to the
   Christian a divine first lesson-book, and contain a series of
   condescending instructions suited to a low stage of religious and
   mental life. They were specially appropriate to the people to whom they
   were bestowed, and of a structure and material in accordance with the
   dispensation to which they ministered. They were prefigurative and
   preformative throughout. They were preparatory and thus far excellent,
   but not "chiefest of all" because not permanent. Like the scaffolding,
   the growing blade, the finished portrait, they fail in comparison with
   the stately building, the ripened corn, the living person. Now Calvin
   avoids the extremes of the merely literal system and of the mystical
   allegories of the double sense. The former system treats the Old
   Testament as if it were all written at the same time, and every part of
   it addressed equally to all men. It excepts the ceremonial observances,
   and then considers that every sentence is reconcilable with all the
   rest by a spiritual process of traditionary reasoning. It is sternly
   opposed to all discrimination between the records of different eras; it
   admits of nothing gradual, variable, or local. Of the latter system we
   have an excellent example in the quotation just made from the
   comparison of Zuingle. He sees Christ and justification by faith
   everywhere. Not only must Hasmal -- a mere color -- be an emblem of the
   Son of God, but all who cannot receive this are branded as
   unenlightened. The truths which he has received through the gospel are
   so vividly impressed upon his soul and so thoroughly leaven his spirit,
   that he sees everything scriptural by this bright light of his inner
   man. His deficiency is of judgment, not of grace. The question thought
   not to be, what series of Christian doctrine can be grafted upon the
   cherubic emblem, but what truths it was intended to convey to the soul
   of the Prophet and the people, -- surely not those of the Augsburgh
   Confession of Faith. We have to guard against a twofold error: on the
   one hand, a merely critical and rationalistic interpretation which
   never proceeds beyond the surface; and, on the other, against a
   fanciful exposition of figurative language, as if in every case the
   doctrines, the graces, and the experiences of the New Covenant were
   intended to be revealed to Hebrew prophets.

   Apposite, indeed, was the exclamation of the Jew, when he said of
   Ezekiel, "Doth he not speak parables?" He had to take a the and draw a
   city upon it; to shave his head, and divide the her into three
   significant parts; and the Jew might fairly ask, How is all this to
   benefit his soul? It could only do so by appealing to the spiritual
   principle in man's soul. As the Prophet must eat the roll, so we must
   to comprehend the meaning of divine emblems, that they may become to us
   the bread of life. There is a husk around many a spiritual fruit, and
   often times a stone within it, which seems devoid of nutriment; but
   still this is the way in which it pleases our heavenly Father to
   nourish us. All signs, emblems, and sacraments of any true religion are
   beneficial to us only when we spiritually perceive their inward and
   animating grace. All that is outward in form and ceremony and machinery
   is only the vehicle, not the substance, of our support as God's
   children, and our growth in his likeness. This foundation truth must be
   laid firmly as a basis for every portion of the superstructure. The
   carnal mind never did and never can comprehend the things of the Spirit
   of God. The power of understanding the meaning must come from the same
   Deity who sends the vision. On this broad rock of truth we may build
   every sound interpretation of all the figurative language of Scripture.
   This principle we may gather from the way in which the early Christian
   writers explain the symbols of Holy Writ. St. Chrysostom, for instance,
   treats clearly the lesson we should learn from the seraph's taking the
   coal from the altar and touching the Prophet's lips with its hallowed
   fire. [354] St. Ambrose seems scarcely satisfied with the image --
   bread of life: he must "eat life." "Whoso then," says he, "eateth life
   cannot die. How should he die whose food is life?" [355] "and this
   bread," he adds, "is the remission of sins." St. Augustine speaks of
   "angels feeding on the eternal word," and of "men eating angels' food."
   [356] Language like this implies the struggle of the spiritual mind to
   express itself fully through the medium of carnal language; and what
   were the Shechinnah and the Seraphim, the Urim and the Thummim, the
   live goat and the slain goat, but symbols receiving all their
   significance from the Divine truths which they conveyed to the soul?
   The worship of the one God through the appointed Mediator was ever the
   same in its hidden essence, and ever must be, while it is ever varying
   in its, form, according to the divers needs of our frail humanity. It
   is flexible exceedingly to the eye and the ear, and unchangeable only
   in its living spirit. All nature, organic and inorganic, has been used
   to illustrate it and communicate it, but this never has made, nor can
   make, the unseen visible. Still the question will recur, Where must we
   draw the line between the human and the divine in these prophetic
   visions? No man can draw such a line with accuracy except for himself.
   Let all who doubt this assertion try to divide mind from matter in the
   living man. Many have attempted it, and their failures remain to mark
   the narrow lib, its of their knowledge and the assumed regions of their
   ignorance. The matured Christian instincts of the cultivate worshipper
   will be every man's best guide under the promised teaching of the Holy
   Spirit. An infallible interpreter is not for us in the flesh; the
   interpreting Spirit must dwell within us, otherwise we shall see
   nothing but the outward aspect of the gorgeous vision. The inspiration
   within must harmonize with that without, which is not verbal but ideal.
   The heaven-wrought ideas of the Hebrew Prophets protect themselves.

   We do not require either a verbal or literal theopneustia: the truths
   themselves by their own imperishableness defeat the mortality of the
   language with which they are associated. They reverberate and percolate
   through all the pages of the mighty record; they hide themselves
   obscurely in one chapter only to emerge more clearly in another; they
   diverge in one book only to recombine in another; so that to the
   sympathizing soul Scripture is ever a self-sufficing interpreter. Hence
   we are not careful to defend Calvin's interpretations as faultless:
   theology as a science has advanced rapidly during three hundred years;
   and while some of his expositions have become antiquated, we still
   uphold him as "orthodoxus." The law of development operates in the
   moral as well as in the physical universe. "Draw a cordon sanitaire,"
   says a modern reviewer, "against dandelion or thistle-down, and see if
   the armies of earth would suffice to interrupt this process of
   radiation, which yet is but the distribution of weeds. The secret
   implications of the truth have escaped at a thousand points in vast
   arches above our heads, rising high above the garden wall, and have
   sown the earth with memorials of the mystery which they envelop." [357]

   A second principle which we must bear in mind is, that every prophetic
   revelation was expressly adapted to the capacity of its original
   recipients. The extrinsic agency is always transitory. We of later
   generations learn enough if we profit by the latent and permanent
   essence. Hence the interpretation of the cherubim by the four
   evangelists is utterly untenable: and all such suppositions are indexes
   of a state of mind wholly incompetent to unfold prophetic mysteries.
   The very occurrence of hundreds of crude guesses like this, implies the
   necessity of submitting the prophetic emblems to some general laws of
   exposition. The highest criticism and the profoundest scholarship
   should be applied to them, that we may at once ignore all traditions
   which are proved to be corruptions. These prophecies presuppose a moral
   responsibility in the people to whom they were addressed; and hence
   they were fitted to awaken this feeling when dormant, to frighten it
   when morbidly perverted, and to animate it when righteously sensitive.
   Calvin's assertion that the living creatures and the wheels imply that
   God by his angels guides the physical motions of the earth, the air,
   and the sea, (Ezekiel 1:21,) is altogether untenable. Revelation does
   not teach anything which human philosophy can discover. It manifests
   its whole aim and essence to be moral, lying in that region of our
   nature which is under the sway of the conscience, and the will rather
   than of the intellect. These emblematic visions appeal to the
   affections and aspirations of soul, to the energies of reverence and
   faith, of wonder and of love. They have to do with what is infinite and
   unseen, the immeasurable and the unattainable. Hence they are rather
   divine agencies for quickening, stimulating, and directing man's
   highest nature. They assist us towards attaining a true idea of God,
   they show us our own insignificant vileness and littleness, and suggest
   the possibility of an atonement of these two. They stir up our
   attention to the threatenings and the promises of an Invisible Person,
   which can influence us only by being believed, and enforce the commands
   of ineffable wisdom, which can benefit us only by being obeyed. They
   present to our thoughts the idea of condescending mediation, the
   infinitely holy condescending to purify and to abide with the morally
   unclean. They may further imply the general providence over the chosen
   race, as well as the special guidance of individuals; the molding into
   its preordained shape all their future history, and yet not sensibly
   controlling the will of agents left responsible for their every action.
   No discoveries of science can ever interfere with such an
   interpretation as this, and those who adopt it need never fear the
   necessity for changing it when the progress of physical knowledge must
   lead us to alter our views of other interpretations. It, belongs to a
   region of our nature completely separable from that which comprehends
   either the niceties of language, or the laws of the physical universe.
   There is a wide gulf, deep and impassable, between the moral and the
   intellectual departments of our nature. The imperfect state of physical
   science at the time of the Reformation is a sufficient apology for the
   mistakes of reformers; but their ignorance is not pardonable in us. We
   need not Judaize, and yet we may be apt scholars in all Hebrew lore,
   and orthodox interpreters of the Sacred Word of the Most high.

   CALVIN'S SEVERITY TOWARDS THE JEWS.

   IN addition to the charge of Judaizing, our author has been accused of
   dwelling too copiously on our Prophet's severity towards the Jews. And
   if we can read the signs of the times in modern publications, there is
   reason to fear that various delusions are abroad on this subject. There
   are those who treat the Jews as in the present day, so peculiarly
   favored by God, that they invest them with the halo of a special
   sanctity. Reverencing as Christians thought the designs of the Almighty
   in past ages, they entertain far too exalted ideas of the personal
   holiness of the agents by whom those designs were accomplished. Old
   Testament characters are too often treated as "saints," when they have
   few moral or religious qualities which entitle them to that sacred
   appellation. And regarding the people as a body, it is scarcely
   possible to find anywhere worse specimens of moral culture. If we
   estimate responsibility according to the amount of light and guidance
   and privilege, then, indeed, Tyre and Sidon were far less culpable than
   Hebron and Jerusalem. How opposite, for instance, is their history to
   what might have been expected from reading the book of Deuteronomy.
   Instead of binding their written law "as frontlets between their eyes,"
   no ancient nation were so careless of its sacred books. The Hindus
   cling tenaciously to their shasters, while Israel utterly neglected
   their Mosaic code. One would have supposed that they would have been
   superstitiously careful of the five books of their inspired leaders.
   Why should they not have multiplied copies of them? Why not have
   constituted the Levites the authorized guardians and expounders of
   them? From the time of Joshua to David there is no notice of the
   existence of any sacred books which now belong to us: and more than
   this, reference is made to other records not now existing. And after
   Solomon's temple was solemnly dedicated, how soon ten of the tribes
   relapsed into the grossest idolatry; and even in Judea, how remarkable
   is the occurrence in Josiah's time. The very priests seem to have been
   ignorant of the existence of a written copy of the law. The unexpected
   discovery of one has such an effect upon the king and the people, that
   it led to a thorough restoration of the national worship; and you, we
   find a command that every king should write for himself a copy of the
   law from that preserved by the priests. Both kings and priests seem to
   have neglected their duty; and even the prophets do not charge them
   with this crime among others. The loss of the original autographs is
   never mentioned; nor have we the slightest hint of what became of the
   second original of the two stone-tables. During the short period of
   their captivity they lost their spoken language and the characters in
   which it was written, so that on their return they were obliged to read
   Hebrew through an interpreter. Was not this an unmatched instance of
   want of reverence for the will of Jehovah? When a nation could act with
   such deliberate carelessness and irreverence in various epochs, can we
   be surprised at their falling into the grossest depths of immoral
   profanity? When the divine records have been thus despised, all folly
   and all wickedness is possible for such a people, and both are
   generated with a fearful rapidity. How different, then, is their real
   history from what one might expect of a people chosen by the Almighty
   as his earthly representatives of religion before the heathen! They
   were miraculously trained to typify and receive the Messiah, and yet
   they constantly appear to be frustrating the very purpose of their
   choice. If we speak of the mass of the nation, they seem in every
   respect to have thrown away their privileges, and to have sudiously
   incurred God's anger, and to have determined to brave his vengeance.
   Under such a view of the ancient people, no language of Calvin's can be
   too strong; and it is only to obviate the consequences of modern
   erroneous suppositions that it becomes necessary to defend him. In
   stimulating the compassion of the Christian Church towards the
   salvation of Jews at present existing, the most fallacious views are
   sometimes presented of their past history and their loveliness in God's
   sight. To be beloved for their fathers' sake by no means implies ally
   innate moral loveliness in the conduct of those fathers; and every
   erroneous view of Jewish history, and every false interpretation of
   Jewish prophecy, does but Judaize the Christian Church, and prevent it
   from going onwards to perfection, by keeping it in trammels to either
   exploded prejudices or to unwise innovations. False views of the Jewish
   history are now so very common, that they naturally create a distaste
   for that emphatic condemnation of their conduct which prevails through
   these Lectures.

   Dissertation Fourth.

   ON THE FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS OF EZEKIEL.

   THE most cursory observers of Ezekiel's peculiarities must notice the
   highly figurative character of his visions. The princes of Israel are
   whelps, their mother a lioness. A great eagle comes down with one fell
   swoop upon the mountains of Lebanon, and plucks off the topmost boughs
   of its lofty cedars. Here we have to connect what logicians call the
   protasis with the Apodosis, and out of the sensible similitude to
   ascertain the mystical explanation. The canon laid down by Glasse is of
   constant utility: -- "In parabolis, si integre accipiantur, tria, sunt:
   radix, cortex, et medulla sive fructus. Radix est scopus in quem tendit
   parabola. Cortex est similitudo sensibilis, quae adhibetur, et suo
   sensu literali constat. Medulla seu fructus est sensus parabolae
   mysticus, seu ipsa res ad quam parabolae fit accommodatio, seu quae per
   similitudinem propositam significatur." Philologia Sacra, lib. 2 pars.
   1 tr. 2, sect. 5, canon 3: Lipsiae, 1725. It only is it necessary to
   ascertain the literal meaning of the figurative expression, but we must
   always proceed one step farther before we can profi, by the metaphor.
   The medulla -- the res ipsa -- is still to be discovered, and this
   alone it is which brings profit to the soul. We must not only
   comprehend the figure and its literal interpretation, but we must take
   one step beyond this, and comprehend what divines call the mystical
   sense. We may attain to the "science of correspondences" without
   adopting the fancies of Emmanuel Swedenborg; but what he diligently and
   erroneously thought we must endeavor to find. With VanMildert, in his
   Bampton Lectures, we use the word mystical in its true and classical
   rather than in its present and popular meaning; and though we have no
   special affection for the word: we contend earnestly with the lecturer
   for the idea which it expresses. This inner sense will not, from its
   very nature, be crippled by the details of the natural allegory. The
   very essence of spiritual thought is mobility and indefiniteness. The
   great master of Roman eloquence has wisely observed -- "Non enim res
   tota toti rei necesse est similis sit: sed ad ipsum, ad quod
   conferetur, similitudinem habeat, oportet." [358] The same idea is
   expressed by Saurin in his Historical Discourses -- "Non seulement il
   n'est pas necessaire que chacun de leur membres ait une veu
   particuliere, qui se rapporte directement au but de celui qui la
   propose: il faut meme que ce but soit en quelque sort cache sous des
   images etrangeres destinees a l'enveloper." [359] As the correct
   elucidation of these points is of the greatest importance, every light
   which can be thrown on them has its value. Bishop Warburton, for
   instance, in the midst of his elaborate and in-digested paradoxes, is
   led to discuss the nature of types and symbols, visions and figures,
   and he treats them with clearness, precision, and ability. He lays the
   foundation for their use in the compound nature of man. He shows how
   the Egyptians, Mexicans, and Chinese, communicated ideas through the
   senses by signs, hieroglyphics, and picture-writing of all kinds. He
   quotes Ezekiel 31 as a striking instance of well-applied metaphor: "for
   men," says he, "so conversant in matters, still wanted sensible images
   to convey abstract ideas." [360] He adduces Ezekiel 24, as an instance
   of a parable purposely used "to throw obscurity over the information,"
   just as the tropical hieroglyphic was turned into the tropical symbol.
   He treats the "dark saying" of Ezekiel 17:2, as a riddle more involved
   than a parable; "for the nature of God's dispensations required
   enigmas, and the genius of those times made them natural." The course
   of his argument leads him to comment at full length on the celebrated
   vision of the dry bones in Ezekiel 37, [361] and to discuss the logical
   value of the assertion, "All words that are used in a figurative sense
   must be first understood in a literal." Perhaps it may be better to
   say, All figures of speech are intended to convey to the mind an image
   of something real, and they are useless to us unless we thus apprehend
   their literal meaning. But Warburton did not see the next step in the
   process of deriving spiritual destruction from the visions of the Holy
   Spirit of God. He was not spiritually enlightened, and failed to do
   more than expound the letter of Scripture. We need, besides this, the
   divine teaching of the Holy Spirit, that we may apprehend what Bishop
   Van Mildert calls, in his celebrated Bampton Lectures, the mystical
   sense. "The importance" says Bishop Horne, in his preface to the
   Psalms, "of the mystical interpretation can hardly be called in
   question;" "without it, the spirit and power of many passages will
   almost wholly evaporate." The learned Rambach, in his Sacred
   Hermeneutics, (page 81,) has adduced several instances in confirmation
   of these observations. The spiritual man only can thus pierce through
   the letter, and grasp the very marrow of God's word: the carnal mind is
   in this respect utterly blind, for these things are only spiritually
   discerned. The word mystical may seem fanatical to some, but, taken in
   its scholastic sense, it is easily appreciable by all who know anything
   of profound criticism. Rambach has justly laid it down -- "Est regula
   theologorum, sensum mysticum non esse argumentativum." (Just. Hem.
   Sac., p. 72.) It appeals not so much to the intellect as to the
   conscience, not to the mental comprehension, but to the heaven-born
   life of the soul; and if this be wanting, all argument on the point is
   thrown away. The spiritual interpretation may be abused, like all other
   good things. Cocceius, for instance, affords a remarkable instance of
   this error, as well as some of the Puritan Divines; but no sensible man
   denies the value of a possession because some are foolish enough to
   misuse it. [362]

   On all sides we have to tread with the utmost caution, and may well
   listen to the voice of Jerome on Galatians 1. "Nec putemus in verbis
   Scripturarum esse Evangelium, sed in sensu. Non in superficie, sed in
   medulla: non in sermonum foliis, sed in radice rationis." But even this
   view, truthful as it seems, may be abused; for in our own day we find
   the anti-materialism of the universe denied. Who would suppose, that at
   the close of the first half of this nineteenth century we should hear
   of a publication, bearing' the ominous title, "The Anti-Materialist:
   Denying the reality of Matter, and Vindicating' the Universality of
   Spirit?" [363] If this were the whole title, it would not concern us
   here; but when it is added, "proved chiefly by a reference to Holy
   Writ," with another sentence, implying that such speculations can
   settle the points in dispute between those who affirm and those who
   deny the orthodoxy of Established Churches, such assumptions cause us
   to sigh over the endless follies of our nature. Such reasoners first of
   all assume what is Holy Writ., and then apply their own
   previously-conceived notions to distort and derange it. The very title
   of such a work implies the greatest possible irreverence for the Divine
   Oracles; the most unjustifiable assumptions, and the most unfair
   contrasts. "The universality of spirit" is strictly and essentially
   co-existent with "the reality of matter." Every word which we have
   uttered in this short epilogue is intended to uphold and illustrate
   such a proposition' it is only necessary to append to it, that through
   material existences -- as trees, cities, food, and clothing -- we
   become capable of comprehending the wants, the nourishment, and the
   nature of our spiritual manhood. Suitable in every respect; is the
   judicious reasoning of Origen, which sixteen centuries have rather
   confirmed than confuted. "If ever, in reading Holy Scripture, you
   encounter an idea which becomes to thee a stone of stumbling or a rock
   of offense, accuse only thyself: doubt not that this stone of stumbling
   and rock of offense has an important meaning: noemata -- food for thy
   mind. Begin by believing, and you shall soon find, under this imaginary
   source of offense, abundant utility." He then compares the skillful
   interpreter of Scripture to an intelligent botanist, knowing the
   different uses and properties of various plants, and shows how every
   "holy and spiritual botanist of the word of God" will find the virtue
   of the word, without esteeming the slightest portion of it either
   redundant or superfluous. [364] The preceding Lectures are a good
   illustration of the sagacious wisdom of these remarks.

   Dissertation Fifth

   a. ON EATING THE ROLL.

   Chapter 3:1

   This method of conveying destruction is peculiarly Oriental. Jarchi,
   for instance, writes: "Parabolica est locutio, ac si dicat: attende
   aurem tuam et audi." The Septuagint translate, mglt-sphr,
   megleth-sepher, volumen libri by lis bibliou, which does not seem
   sufficiently accurate. Both Fuller, in his Miscell. S.S., book 2nd,
   chapter 10, and Vossius de Sept. Int. agree with Jerome in remarking
   the inaccuracy. Pro involuto libro, he says, 70 capitulum libri
   transrulerunt; capitulum intelligamus exordium. The opinion of J. H.
   Maii, Jun., is preferred by Rosenmuller, viz., that, mnlh, menleh,
   signifies the roller on which the volumes of the Ancients were rolled,
   as we learn from Maimonides, in his sphr tvrh, sepher-toreh, chapter
   9:2, 14. The writing on both sides was very uncommon the Greeks call it
   opisthographon, which is illustrated by Juvenal, Sat. 1:5, 6.

   -- aut summi plene jam margine libri
   Scriptus, et in tergo, necdum finitus Orestes?

   The Chaldee paraphrast explains the sense of eating the roll correctly
   -- "anima tua saturabitur;" and in this way the Prophet was to be
   strengthened to become literally "firm of forehead, and hard of heart,"
   for contending with "peoples deep of lip and heavy of tongue." This
   firmness is represented by the gem, smyr, shemir, which Bochart terms
   smiris, adamant according to Jerome, since the corresponding Arabic
   word is samoor. See also Schindler's Lex. Pentag. col. 1897, and R.
   Sal. Jarchi in loc., who gives the view of the Jerusalem Targum.

   b. THE GREAT RUSHING.

   Ezekiel 3:12.

   The physical disturbances accompanying the prophetic visions are worthy
   of notice. It is impossible to reduce them to any class of natural
   phenomena. The Prophet is suddenly removed by the Spirit into the midst
   of the exiles; in extasi, says Rosenmuller -- "the mind was separated
   from the body by a divine instinct." Oecolampadius considers that he
   seemed to be seized as by a wind," and "thought he heard the voice of a
   great tumult" "The glory of the Lord," he adds, "came out of its place,
   and left the temple and the people," "and the Church and heavenly
   Jerusalem praise the Lord for this act of his grace." He then comments
   most spiritually on this removal of the visible glory from the natural
   temple, taking it as an instance of populus credentium, being at all
   times locus Dei. Maldonatus takes the same view when he writes, "I
   seemed to be seized by the Spirit, or an angel, and. to be transferred
   to Jerusalem." He considers it too Rabbinical to treat the Spirit as if
   it were merely wind, and the voice only thunder, as R. David and
   Jonathan do. tie prefers the opinion of Jerome to that of the Jewish
   interpreters. R. Sal. Jarchi implies that the Spirit really raised him:
   "Deus praecepit Spiritui ut eum portaret ad locum ubi Judaei exules
   degebant." As to the last word in this verse, mmqvmv, memkomo, it seems
   to refer to the place where the vision was seen: scil. personent ejus
   laudes per mundum universum, uti Malachi 1:5. If the whole scene is
   treated simply as a vision offered to the Prophet's mind through his
   senses, it becomes very intelligible and impressive.

   g ON TEL-ABIB.

   Ezekiel 3:15.

   We notice these words simply to caution the reader against
   over-allegorizing. There can be no doubt that it is the name of a
   place; as, tl chrs', tel chersha, and tl mlch, tel melech, in Ezra and
   Nehemiah. Syrian villages often have the name of tel, which simply
   means inn or mountain. Burckhardt (Travels in Syria, p. 149) observes
   this: but Jerome and Cocceius, who adopt the allegorizing system, are
   not content with this. The former takes the words for "a heap of new
   fruits," which is symbolical of the state of the Israelites: the latter
   translates "the time of new fruit;" both interpretations being
   systematically erroneous. As the Chebar runs into the Euphrates from
   Mount Masius, the captives were situated up the river to the north of
   Babylon. A various reading, too, in this verse has been the source of
   some perplexity. The common text (chetib) has v'sr, vasher, derived
   from, sr', shera, habitavit, commoratus est; but some MSS. adopt v'sv,
   vasheb, "and I sat" (keri); according to Kennicott and De Rossi, "etiam
   Hispanici, Soncinensis Bibliorum editio, Brixiensis et Complutensis."
   The Septuagint adopts the former reading; and Vogel, in his edit. of
   Capell. Crit. Sac., page 231, adopts the latter. The sense will then
   be, "And I dwelt, since they dwelt there, I even dwelt." Both Dathe and
   Rosenmuller reject this, and agree with Calvin's version. His critique
   on the word smm, shemem, Ezekiel 3:15, is quite in accordance with the
   English version, and with foreign comments. Newcome paraphrases thus:
   "Astonished at the commission with which I was entrusted; and affected
   by the overpowering splendor of the visions." The Chaldee has stq,
   shethek, "silent." Maldonatus adds, "so that I could not speak for
   seven days."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Dissertation Sixth.

   a JERUSALEM PAINTED ON A BRICK.

   Ezekiel 4:1

   Bishop Warburton (book 4 section 4 of his Divine Legation) has ably
   discussed the Oriental and Egyptian methods of symbolical writing. He
   explains Ezekiel's method of hieroglyphics, volume 2, page 57, edit.
   1837. Oecolampadius comments very practically on this exercise of the
   ars skiographike. "The Church is besieged by its enemies, because it is
   a despiser of God's word. Heretics erect the towers of human
   traditions, and oppose the tower and doctrine of David, since it is not
   defended by any shield. They set up human righteousness, and are not
   subject to that of God." The whole passage is worthy of perusal, and is
   in striking contrast with the sober and unimaginative comment of
   Calvin. The custom of writing on bricks is thus noticed by Pliny:
   "Epigenes informs us that the Babylonians had inscribed their
   observations on the stars for 720 years on burnt bricks, coctilibus
   laterculis." Hist. Nat., book 8 section 57. The chief point of interest
   in this narrative is its visionary character. The best commentators
   agree that none of these actions were real the lying on the left side
   for 390 days was only in a vision. the left hand is supposed to refer
   to the ten tribes, as Samaria was situated to the left of Jerusalem. In
   the 4th verse, "you shall bear the punishment of their iniquity," is
   correctly interpreted by Newcome, "you shall presignify the punishment
   which they shall bear." This is the only sense which similar passages
   can have -- St. Paul having shown us, that the picture-writing of the
   Jewish law had its real fulfillment in the work of Messiah.

   b THE THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY DAYS.

   Ezekiel 4:5

   There is a difference in the number of days between the Hebrew text and
   that of the Septuagint. The latter assigns but 190 days to the kingdom
   of Israel, and yet agrees with the Hebrew in assigning forty days to
   the kingdom of Judea. Theodoret, in his comment on the passage,
   explains the Septuagint as follows. Although in the reign of Rehoboam
   the people were divided, yet they are considered as one nation, being
   separate, and yet conjoined. When, therefore, the Prophet had assigned
   150 days to Israel and 40 to Judea, he combines them again, and makes
   190 days. These forty days represent the forty years which remained of
   the original seventy. Thirty years of captivity were now passed for
   Ezekiel began to prophesy in the thirtieth year of the captivity; and
   Jeremiah shows us, that in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of
   Jeconiah, Evilad-marodach raised his head and led him from his
   prison-house in the first year of his reign. Then came Baltasar, and
   Darius the Mede; whence the forty days of Judea signify the forty
   remaining years and the 150 concerning Israel indicate the 150 years
   after the building of the city, and its becoming fined with
   inhabitants. This happened in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, the son
   of Xerxes, in the time of Nehemiah. Beginning, then, at the fifth year
   of Jeconiah's captivity, we shall find it forty years to the first year
   of Cyrus the Persian, then twenty-nine years for the reign of Cyrus,
   seven for Cambyses, thirty-five for Darius Hystaspes, twenty for
   Xerxes, and nineteen for Artaxerxes, since in the next year the walls
   were built. The Israelites participated in this return for though
   formerly destined from the tribe of Judea, they were afterwards united,
   and all inhabited their common metropolis together.

   Jerome also notices this difference of numbering, being surprised that
   the common reading in his day was 190 years; while the Hebrew text, and
   Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, all read 390 years, and even those
   copies of the Septuagint which are not, vitiated. Some, he adds,
   compute it from the baptism of our Savior to the end of the world;
   others again from the destruction of Jerusalem, in the reign of
   Vespasian, to a period of prosperity for the once favored nation. The
   events of history have shown the fallacy of these computations. Ephrem,
   in his comments on this passage, speaks of the 430 years as beginning
   with the reign of Solomon, and as extending to the eleventh year of
   King Zedekiah. Jerome's method of computing this period is worthy of
   notice. He dates its commencement from the reign of Pekah, the son of
   Remaliah, (2 Kings 15:29,) and its close during the reign of Artaxerxes
   Mnemon, who is the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther. He reckons the
   length of the reign of each thing in succession, and satisfies himself
   that he has computed the number which he finds it the prophets, since
   he reckons this historical period to consist of 389 years and four
   months. The sleeping on the right side for forty days he interprets,
   from Nebuchadnezzar's carrying away Jehoiakim to Babylon, to the first,
   year of the sway of Cyrus, under whom the Jews obtained their freedom.
   The writers on Biblical Chronology do not acquiesce in this
   computation. J. G. Frank commences the period with the revolt under
   Jeroboam, and concludes it with the destruction of Solomon's temple.
   Jeroboam's first year agrees with the year 3215 of the Jubilee period,
   and the destruction of the kingdom of Israel in 3470. "If, therefore,"
   says he, "you add 390 years to 3214, the date of Jeroboam's revolt, you
   will obtain 3604 Jub. per., corresponding to the destruction of
   Solomon's temple." [365]

   The Hebrew commentators, R. Solomon and David, do not suppose that a
   time of punishment for sin is represented, but the time during which it
   was committed, and so they date the beginning of the period during the
   early judges, and close it in the reign of Hosea. (Ecolampadius adopts
   this comment with approval, but Maldonatus pronounces it to be
   erroneous, "for the Prophet is not speaking of their sins, but of their
   punishment." Grotius supposes it to represent the time of God's patient
   endurance of the sins of the people. The settlement of this question
   depends upon the use of the phrase ns' vn, nasa ghon, to bear iniquity,
   or the punishment of iniquity. The word is used in both senses; it
   occurs in Genesis 4:13, and Genesis 19:15; Psalm 69:27, where the
   authorized version and the marginal readings imply that our translators
   were aware of the twofold use of the word. The idea of "punishment"
   seems most suitable here; and the adoption of this translation would
   cause us to neglect the Jewish interpretation, and to count the years
   forward from the times of Ezekiel, and to seek for the fulfillment of
   the prophecy in those events of Israel's history which were then
   future.

   THE SEPTUAGINT ORDER.

   Ezekiel 7:3-13

   These verses are much confused in the Septuagint, and this seems to
   have been the case in Jerome's time. The Greek Codexes of the
   Alexandrian version do not agree, as we find from Theodoret and the
   Arabic version. Theodoret and the Chaldee paraphrast follow the Hebrew
   order; and the latter, from gyny, gnini, "my eye," puts mymry, mimri,
   "my word," for the sake of avoiding "these anthropomorphic phrases."
   The thirteenth verse evidently refers to the year of jubilee. Both
   Theodoret and the Vulgate translate correctly, and Jerome explains it
   satisfactorily. There is a difference in reading between the Hebrew and
   the Septuagint here also; the last clause is sufficiently important to
   note these differences. Jerome explains it thus' "Non proderit homini
   iniquitas sua, nec ei praebebit aliquam similitudinem." The translation
   of the Syriac is, "et vir iniquitate sua non conservabit vitam suam;"
   and of the Chaldee paraphrast, "quisque sibi in peccatis suis sibi
   placet, et dum viri permanent, poenitentiam non apprehendent." The
   Syriac reading makes the sense as follows: "Neither shall any
   strengthen his life by his iniquity."

   THE IMAGE OF JEALOUSY.

   Ezekiel 8:1-14

   THE singularity of the Vision of this chapter renders it worthy of
   special notice. It illustrates very strikingly the difference between
   the worship of Judaism and of the Gospel. The contrast is so
   remarkable, that every inference from it respecting Christian
   obligation must be most indirect. These "visions of God" occurred to
   the Prophet in the place of his captivity. Jerusalem and its temple,
   and its chambers of imagery, are all brought rapidly before his mind.
   Theodoret and Jerome maintain that the Prophet was not removed to
   Jerusalem, but that the scene was presented to his mind in a trance.
   Newcome continues the trance to the twenty-fourth verse of chapter 11,
   Ezekiel 11:24. The appearance of fire in the second verse (Ezekiel 8:2)
   is supposed by some to be better changed to "man," by reading 'ys,
   aish, for 's, eesh, with various codexes of the Septuagint, the
   Complutensian edition of the Arabic version; but, in the second clause,
   zhr, zohar, signifies the brightness of a star, just as zoharat, in
   Arabic and Amharic, means the planet Venus. In the Complutensian and
   Aldine editions of the Septuagint it is translated "breeze," or "light
   air," according to the view of Theodotion. The best translation seems
   to be, to take the first clause as "the appearance of a man," and the
   second as "the appearance of brightness."

   This remarkable vision is a singular instance of the manner in which
   the Almighty instructed his prophets. The sixth year of (Ezekiel 8:1)
   is to be understood of the reign of Jeconiah. "The appearance of fire"
   thought most probably to be "of a man;" (Ezekiel 8:2) for 's, ash,
   "fire," may have been substituted for, 'vs, aish, "a man." The
   Septuagint, Theodoret, the Complutensian and Arabic versions, all take
   it so; but the De Rossi does not find it in any of the codexes; and
   only one of Kennicott's (No. 89) has 'vs, aish. Still the best, modern
   critics prefer it. Ezekiel 8:3. When the Prophet is taken by a lock of
   his hair, Kimchi supposes it to signify the violence by which the
   exiles of Judea would be treated; but all modern writers suppose that
   this was only a vision: ou toinun somatike en metathesis oude ton tos
   sarkos ophthalmon he Theoria "there was no bodily change of place, nor
   any real view by the eyes of the flesh," says Theodoret. The first
   object presented to the visionary eye of the Prophet was an idolatrous
   image, metaphorically denominated "jealousy," from the provocation
   which the idolatries of the people occasioned. The derivation of the
   word "Tammuz" (Ezekiel 8:14) is obscure. It is supposed to refer to
   Adonis, as worshipped by the Syrians. Lucian de Dea, Syria, volume 3,
   and Maerobii Saturnalia, chapter 21., illustrate this point; but what
   "The Image of Jealousy," which rivaled Jehovah and provoked his anger,
   really was, cannot be determined; most probably it was a statue of
   Moloch or Baal. Selden "on the Syrian Deities" enters at large on the
   subject. [366] The whole of this scenery Bishop Warburton pronounces to
   be Egyptian, and versed as he was in Egyptian antiquities, his judgment
   is deserving of notice. "They contain." says he, "a very lively and
   circumstantial description of the so celebrated mysteries of His and
   Osiris." [367] The rites were celebrated in a subterraneous place by
   the Sanhedrim or elders of Israel, and the paintings on the wall
   correspond with the descriptions of the mystic cells of Egypt. The
   woman "weeping for Tammuz" (Ezekiel 8:13) he treats as a Phoenician
   superstition, while the worship of "the sun towards the east" (Ezekiel
   8:15) is a Persian custom. "When the Prophet is bid to turn from the
   Egyptian to the Phoenician rites, he is then said to look towards the
   north, which was the situation of Phoenicia witch regard to Jerusalem
   consequently, he before stood southward, the situation of Egypt with
   regard to the same place. And when from thence he is bid to turn into
   the inner court of the Lord's house, to see the Persian rites, this was
   east, the situation of Persia. With such exactness is the
   representation of the whole vision conducted." He sees "these three
   capital superstitions" portrayed again in Ezekiel 16, when the
   Egyptians are described as "great of flesh." This phrase Warburton
   considers to apply to Egypt, because it was "the grand origin and
   invention of idolatry." The "mark upon the forehead," in Ezekiel 9:4,
   he treats as an expression of God's special and particular providence.
   Jehovah was their Tutelary Deity, and their sin was immeasurably
   heightened by the theocratic privileges which they preeminently
   enjoyed. Hence this learned writer is enabled to press into his service
   Ezekiel 14:13, and Ezekiel 25:8, while he forcibly illustrates both the
   language and the idea of the Prophet. His view is confirmed by a
   passage in Diodorus Sieulus, who, in lib. 1 p. 59, edit. Wess.,
   records: "Round the room in Thebes where the body of King Osymanduas
   seemed to be buried, a multitude of chambers were built, which had
   elegant paintings of all the beasts sacred in Egypt." Notices of the
   worship of the Persians will be found in Perronius's Itinerary, p. 665,
   and D'Auquetil's Voyages, tab. 3. n. 3, 4. Hebenstreit has written a
   dissertation on the rites of Bacchus to illustrate this chapter; and
   Hyde's Religion of the Ancient Persians, lib. 1 chap. 27 edit. Oxon.,
   1760, may be consulted with advantage.

   THE MAN IN THE LINEN GARMENT.

   Ezekiel 9:2

   Calvin (Ezekiel 9:2) does not altogether reject the idea that this
   person prefigured Messiah. Theodoret's view seems judicious. "The dress
   of the seventh person was that of a priest: for he did not belong to
   those who punished, but to those who redeemed those worthy of
   preservation." In Jerome's day it was thought to represent the Savior,
   "who is a priest," says he, and quotes Psalm 110:4, very appropriately.
   C. D. Michaelis has remarked the customary method of carrying the
   inkhorn in the East in the present day. Syl. Com. Theol. Edit. Pott.,
   volume 2, page 75. The fourth verse explains the reason why it was
   carried. Calvin's allusion to the use of the mark tv, tho, (Ezekiel
   9:3, 4,) is fully explained by Origen, as quoted by Montfaucon in his
   notes to the Hexapla. The invention which Calvin calls "puerile" is
   recorded by Jerome, who made good use of Origen, and added other
   conjectures. Rosenmuller has quoted in full the passages to which
   Calvin merely alludes. Pradus and Vitringa have also amply illustrated
   the point.

   On Ezekiel 9:9, Calvin translates correctly "fined with bloods."
   (Ezekiel 9:9,) Although this is the common reading, it is not without
   exception., chms, chemes, "violence," has been found instead of dmym,
   demim, "bloods." A Jewish critic of some note, R. Sal. Norzi, published
   a critical commentary in 1742, at Mantua, and states that the reading
   "violence" is found in one accurate and ancient MS., and in one ancient
   edition. Kimchi attests the same thing; but neither De Rossi nor
   Kennicott were able to verify the statement. This destruction was to
   begin at the sanctuary, or, as the Septuagint and Theodoret understand
   it, with the holy ones, (apo ton hagion autou,) meaning the priests,
   who were the leaders in the desecration of the temple worship. Pradus
   agrees with Calvin in the reason given for the slaughter of the priests
   and elders first. (Ezekiel 9:6.) Although the person mentioned in
   Ezekiel 9:11 is clothed as before, yet the Septuagint omits the word
   "linen," using simply podere: Theodotion is satisfied with the Hebrew
   word Baddein, and Aquila has stola. There is a marginal reading, too,
   suggested by the Masoretes; but most of the codexes of Kennicott and Be
   Rossi support the received text, as well as the Soncine and
   Complutensian editions, and the Babylonian Talmud. Calvin's translation
   and interpretation of this chapter is in accordance with the researches
   of modern critics. Maldonatus may be consulted for the opinions of
   Jewish writers on important words and phrases.

   Dissertation Tenth.

   THE COALS SCATTERED OVER THE CITY.

   Ezekiel 10:2

   Jerome, explains this scattering of the coals over the city as a symbol
   of its punishment and cleansing by fire, and quotes Isaiah 10:17, in
   support of his interpretation; and in accordance with Psalm 120:3, he
   calls them "hot burning coals," the penalty of "the false tongue" --
   remedium lingua, atque mendacii, and justifies his idea of purifying by
   Isaiah 6. S. Jarcin explains as follows: "Sanctus ine Benedictus dixit
   Gabrieli, qui petiit a cherubino, ut ine sibi daret prunes quo ini
   paululum refrigescerent leviusque efticerentur decretum pcena, quoad
   Judmos sive urbem Heirosolyroam;" and refers to the commentary of
   Abarbenel, fol. 170, col. 4 reed. Maldonatus supposes the coals to
   indicate not the cleansing but the destruction of the city; and their
   collection by the angel at the command of God, and "from amidst the
   wheels," implies that this burning did not arise by chance and by man's
   design, but by God's providence and commandment. At Ezekiel 10, we have
   already referred to OEcolampadius, but as his comments are most
   spiritual, and very inaccessible to the ordinary student of prophecy,
   we shall quote a few explanatory passages here. The sprinkling of the
   coal, he thinks, to be an image of the burning city," quod ex neglecto
   aut certo male administrando cultu." Has real he supposes to represent
   "those celestial tabernacles into which the Great high Priest entered
   once by his own blood, after procuring eternal redemption." In the
   whole vision he sees "Christ the head of his body, in which the law and
   spirit of life is included," and "how the golden consummation of the
   elect turns its face towards Christ. For the are of the Church contains
   all its parts most elegantly (elegantissime)." He sees Christ in all
   parts of the Scriptures, as their end, scope, and spirit; and
   especially the man clothed in linen he says is "Christ acting in this
   dispensation on the outside of the eternal tabernacles which he at
   length entered with his blood." The third verse refers to "that
   judgment which Christ as man shall exercise by God's authority." The
   voice of the wings signifies "horrenda vox mah ingruentis," and the
   motion of the wheels "summa in administratione concordia." To us these
   comments seem very fanciful, as it is obvious that any writer may put
   forth similar guesses according to his own private though fallible
   judgment. The cherubim on the right side Jerome considers as
   representing those holy and exalted beings who dwell at God's right
   hand, while evil spirits dwell on his left hand. Michaelis, however,
   with less display of fancy, takes a simpler new, not dwelling on
   reproaching punishment, but upon the departure of God's glory from the
   temple and city. See Sylog. Corn. Theol., volume 5 page 134; Eichhorn
   die Bibl. Proph., part 2, page 456; and Pradus in loc. especially on
   Ezekiel 10:20.

   Dissertation Eleventh.

   THE FIVE-AND-TWENTY EVIL COUNSELLORS.

   Ezekiel 11:1

   IT is very probable, says Pradus, that as there were twenty-four
   rulers, and as many regions into which Jerusalem was divided, and a
   chief over them all, so the magistracy of the city is here brought
   before us. He recognizes the analogy to the twenty-four elders in the
   Apocalypse. But there seems to be no authority for this division of the
   city into twenty-four "regions" or wards. See on this point Jahn Bibl.
   Arch., part 2 volume 2 section 187. The conduct of these evil
   counselors is well portrayed by Theodoret. Some commentators take this
   third verse as a question, so do the Arabic and Syriac versions, "Is
   it. not near?" but Calvin's view is the best, and he is supported by
   good authorities. Jarcin understands the prophetic denunciations to be
   intended, "ina mala de quibus prophetic vaticinantur nec in propinqua
   est poena." The death of Pelatiah (in Ezekiel 11:13,) as well as the
   12th verse, (Ezekiel 11:12) are omitted in the Roman and Alexandrian
   codexes; and in the Arabic version of the London and Paris Polyglotts.
   See Wakon's Proleg. 14:21. There are some minor variations in the
   readings of Theodoret, the Complutensian edition, and the Syriac
   version. From the concluding verses of the chapter, the old
   commentators understand that the prophets were not bodily transferred
   to either Jerusalem or Chaldeea. The whole scene is called an
   "ecstasy." The Spirit of God acting on that of the Prophet, and enduing
   him with this celestial eye sight.

   Dissertation Twelfth.

   a THE FALSE PROPHETS.

   Ezekiel 13:1

   The very existence of such a chapter as this suggests some instructive
   reflections. It may first remind us of the great moral difference
   between the position of the Jew and our own. The existence of prophets
   implies the corresponding possession of miraculous witness. A new
   prophet was a new herald of a fresh truth; and before he could claim
   attention he was called upon to show his new credentials. The false
   prophets had in reality no such proofs that they were sent, of God, and
   yet by speaking smooth things they succeeded in deluding the people. If
   surprised at the possibility of such complete success, we may be
   reminded of similar instances in the practice of medicine in our own
   day among the uneducated. How blindly they rush to any clever impostor
   who settles among them with no better credentials than his ready skin
   and his audacious pretensions. The more unenlightened men are the more
   they catch at any prophet who asserts roundly and audaciously his
   mission from God. Now the Jew was called upon not to inquire first into
   the doctrine taught, but into "the sign" worked by the teacher -- his
   first inquiry was to be not what God had revealed, but whom he has
   commissioned to teach it. Our position is rather the reverse. St. Paul
   assures us, that if an angel from heaven were to teach any other gospel
   than that taught by him we are to reject it. We, then, the readers of
   the Old Testament prophecies, are not to find in them a revelation of
   the Gospel, but, pointing to the coming Author of the Gospel. "Search
   the Scriptures," but for what? "they testify of Me." Types are
   fulfilled in the great Antitype -- shadows become substance, and
   dimness splendor. This chapter of Ezekiel makes the teacher and his
   authority the subject of questioning, not the matter of his
   instructions. His coming in his own name is his first and all absorbing
   sin. However smooth his after communications, this is the great test of
   his unholy imposture. The Reformers, in the earnestness of their zeal,
   often append such chapters as these directly to themselves and their
   enemies. This led them to deal forth the wrath of God with too
   indiscriminating a name, and has given rise to the assertion that their
   system was a compound of "Moses and the Inquisition." [368]
   CEcolampadius, for instance, designates the false teachers of his day,
   "pinlauti, indocti, stulti, somniatores, caeci, vuloes dolosae,
   rapaces, in desertis et it neglectis locis agentes, timidi, et canes
   muti." [369] Whenever there is a strict parallel between true and false
   teachers in our own times, such language may be justifiable, but where
   the right of private judgment is so largely exercised by ourselves, it
   is but consistent to allow others an equally extensive sphere for its
   operation. Contending earnestly for the faith and the truth is
   possible, without the accumulation of strong epithets on the heads of
   others.

   B ON THE PRINCIPLE OF ACCOMMODATION.

   Ezekiel 13

   Our Commentator, in various passages throughout this Prophet, finds it
   necessary to introduce the principle of accommodation. And as this
   necessity has been so largely insisted on by succeeding interpreters,
   we may well attempt to discover the true method of applying so elastic
   a principle. For instance, in this thirteenth chapter, on Ezekiel 13:9,
   he says -- "Ezekiel here accommodates his language to the common usage
   of mankind," attemperat sermonera; and also, "pro modulo et ruditate
   roentis nostrae;" on Ezekiel 13:16, he asserts that false prophets are
   so called "improprie," not implying any want of propriety in using the
   name; but showing that the name only is intended, and that the reality
   is not asserted. The formidable list. of German writers on this
   important point, collected by Wegscheider in his Institutiones
   Theologicae, page 99, Hal. 1826, shows it to be worthy of our attentive
   notice; for when once we permit ourselves to resolve everything into
   "dictio gnomica et parabolica," we may refine away the force and
   meaning of the prophecies altogether. While we confine ourselves to the
   topic immediately before us, a few general suggestions may be here
   thrown out. 1. In judging of the correctness of Calvin's language, we
   should remember the peculiar intellectual tendencies of the Reformers,
   in consequence of their religious antagonism to the prevailing
   doctrines of their day. They saw all around them the grosset
   superstitions; they lived among a people who believed in a real and
   permanent moral efficacy, proceeding from sacred rites and ceremonies.
   They naturally supposed an analogy to exist between the false teachers
   of Rome then rampant, and of Israel once beloved. The majority of the
   divines of the day were in all their habits of thought and reasoning --
   realists; that is, they treated abstract religious ideas as if they
   were undoubted realities. "Grace," for instance, must be something
   infused, and must be received only through one holy rite, and
   communicated fresh and fresh, in union with the elements of another.
   The schoolmen, who taught that our nature was actually stained and
   polluted by the propagation of original infection, held also that the
   laver of regeneration actually washed away this original depravity: if,
   in after life, fresh pollution was incurred, then through penance and
   the eucharist, fresh grace was transfused by actual and corporal union
   with the real body and blood of Christ. The language of Dr. M'Hale in
   the present day states the peculiarity of a sacrament to be, that it
   impresses an indelible character. [370] Chateaubriand speaks of those
   "who receive their God" at the altar, "while each incorporates with his
   own flesh and blood the flesh and blood of his God." [371]

   This is Realism run to seed' and against all this the Nominalist
   contended, not by denying the spiritual realities, but by looking for
   them in the right places. In the fourteenth century the University of
   Paris was famous for its learning, its resources, and influence over
   the mind of Europe. The majority in power and rank were Realists. At
   length William Occam, an English friar, assailed their philosophy, and
   damaged their religious influence. Himself a disciple of the great
   Scotus Erigena, he gathered around him a band of devoted adherents, and
   became in philosophy what Luther and Calvin afterwards were in
   religion. He succeeded sufficiently to attract the notice of the
   reigning pope, John 22nd. who was sharp-sighted enough to see that if
   Nominalism spread Romanism must perish. Hence by his command in 1339,
   the University of Paris publicly condemned and denounced the philosophy
   of Occam. [372] As usual, when the man is denounced, the principles
   take root and flourish. In another age, Luther and Melancthon own him
   as their master and their guide. The former calls him "Carus maister
   meus;" the latter "Deliciae quondam nostrae." [373] The next century
   finds the disputes at Paris as fierce as ever. The famous Gerson and
   his persevering disciples caused their enemies to respect their mental
   sway, till Rome again interfered. In 1743, the Bishop of Avrancis felt
   the philosophy of the schools, on which the false doctrines of Rome
   were built: in danger, and then he persuaded Louis 11th, the ruling
   monarch of France, to order their writings to be seized and their
   persons imprisoned. But as time passed on, the king relented, for about
   eight years afterwards he revoked his edict, and restored the party to
   their former philosophical position. The Reformers lived amidst this
   perversion of ideas on religious subjects, and their writings show them
   to be unconsciously tinged with the sentiments of the Realists. The
   schoolmen, for instance, still argued for a corporeal propagation of
   what was termed fomes or concupiscentia, calling it a qualitas
   corporis, derived either from contagione pomi, or afflatu serpentis
   [374] While the Lutherans took one step in the right direction, the
   Zuinglians added another: and the influence of the prevailing opinions
   of their day is very perceptible in the tone in which the Reformers
   comment on the prophets. Calvin, for instance, is remarkable for his
   sound common-sense view of difficulties: if an apparent inconsistency
   occurs, he is ready at once with his phrases, forma loquendi, per
   concessionem, ironice, katachrestikos, improprie, all implying his own
   riglit to use his private, judgment in solving a difficulty according
   to his pleasure. He often finds it necessary to exercise it. In Ezekiel
   20:28, he ventures to suppose a phrase used in a sense directly
   contrary to its obvious meaning; and in verses 5-8, (Ezekiel 20:5-8,)
   he treats the Prophet's words as "translatiae locutiones." His desire
   to identify the prophetic teaching with the law of Moses on the one
   side, and with the precepts of the gospel on the other, leads him to
   invent these varying schemes for avoiding the literal meaning. The
   inexperienced student will learn wisdom by allowing the Law, the
   Prophets, and the Apostles, to speak their own separate language, and
   gradually to develop the designs and the character of God without
   either confusion or distortion. Still, the use of the word improprie
   must not mislead us; it does not signify "improperly" in the ordinary
   sense, but is used as in and proprie in Latin. It implies that a phrase
   does not bear the meaning which it seems to have it denies the
   Realist's view of a question, and asserts that of the Nominalist. For
   instance, righteousness infused is the doctrine of one school;
   righteousneiss imputed that of the other the text of the fifty-fifth
   lecture speaks the language of the former; the comment of Calvin that
   of the latter. The Reformers have taught us to look for spiritual
   realities where only they can be found, and to deny their necessary
   connection with outward observances and tangible elements, whether
   under the temple rites, or the prophetic visions, or the apostolic
   ordinances.

   g ON THE PHRASE "PROSTITUERUNT DEUM."

   Ezekiel 13:19

   The remarks of the last article apply directly to Calvin's language
   respecting the Almighty he says about the wicked "defile his glory,"
   "corrupt his justice," and "prostitute even God himself," (Ezekiel
   13:19,) and then "drown in the lowest abyss of hell the whole world
   when disappointed of their gains." This is the language of Realists,
   who suppose it possible for men thus to treat either the Almighty or
   their fellow-creatures. The anathemas of the Council of Trent are
   founded on the same fallacious bases, and the strong language of the
   vulgar savors of the same innate belief. The modern reader at once
   supplies the word "name" after the offensive verb "to prostitute."
   Calvin probably understood it so, but, he did not write it so. His
   phraseology is largely tinctured with the errors of his times, though
   he has written enough to be correctly interpreted by himself. When we
   moderns think on the subject for a moment, we admit that no man can
   defile God's glory, or corrupt his justice, or devote his fellow-sinner
   to the lowest abyss: we take any such expressions as simply denoting
   the views of the speakers or writers about matters immeasurably beyond
   them. If we more thoroughly understood the teaching of Locke and the
   continental Nominalists respecting abstract ideas, we should live
   without any fears of the success of those who unchurch all sects but
   their own, and who assert the cleansing efficacy of suffering, and the
   possibility of discovering the whole body of Catholic tradition. With
   us, for instance, altars are not only prohibited, but impossible. They
   are now a mere name -- their reality is confined to the one altar, the
   Cross. It is equally as impossible to prostitute God as to erect an
   altar. The reader of these Commentaries must have observed that
   Calvin's idea of God is rather more familiar than infinite he
   introduces his name into the minutest concerns, and thinks of him not
   as acting by general and settled laws, but as personally and constantly
   intervening between the conduct and the destined of men. He naturally
   transfers the conceptions and instincts of morality and holiness which
   he finds within himself to the Almighty -- he clothes his idea of an
   awful Spirit with the attributes of a human conscience he imagines his
   Deity a divine man, purified, exalted, and unlimitedly endowed. Our
   acquaintance with the physical sciences leads us to see the Great
   Supreme acting through the visible universe by fixed and undeviating
   laws: so we expect that revelation will unfold to us laws of similar
   harmony, although apparently disturbed by the anomaly of rebellion and
   the mystery of sin. But Calvin without hesitation supposes ]the to
   interfere perpetually with the ordinary processes of our animal nature.
   For instance, in the 14th verse of this chapter, he supposes the
   Almighty to withdraw from the ordinary bread of this life its usual
   nourishment by way of punishing the wicked. He is said to break the
   staff of bread by puffing it up, and depriving it of its power of
   affording aliment to the body. He repeats this singular comment as the
   correct explanation of the language of Moses in Deuteronomy 8:3.
   (Ezekiel 14:14.) It may be perfectly true, that "unless God breathes
   into the bread the virtue of nourishment the bread is useless;" but
   where is the proof that he withdraws this nourishing power when the
   bread is tasted by the ungodly? The ignorance of the Reformers of those
   physical laws by which it pleases the Almighty that the natural
   universe should be governed, was very injurious to them as commentators
   on sacred writ' they were constantly in danger of being like men who
   write on glass with diamonds, and thus obscure light with scratches.
   And not. only so, when Calvin speaks of "a secret virtue infused into
   the bread," he adopts the language of the Realists: he assumes the
   existence of a quality which is philosophically incorrect. A disciple
   of Locke will be aware that this supposed virtue is only an abstract
   idea existing in the mind of man and not in the bread, and that it is
   only an admissible form of speech when it is understood as a general
   term for the aggregate of those chemical agents and properties which
   are realities. If God then withdraws this "infused virtue," it is only
   a form of saying that he withdraws or suspends certain chemical
   agencies' and who will now confidently assert this to be his method of
   interfering with the never-ceasing operations of his creation? So in
   Ezekiel 13:14, the action of Pinnehas, Numbers 25, is said to be
   infectum aliqto vitio. This again is the language of the Realists, and
   is erroneous. His work could not be infected morally either way it must
   have been his mind or his affections. The language erroneosly transfers
   moral attributes to the deed instead of to the man.

   And here it may appositely be stated, that a correct exposition of the
   Prophecies never requires any violation of either physical or moral
   truth. Faith in the unity and supremacy of truth is one form of faith
   in God. The prophecies are rather illustrated than obscured by our
   increasing knowledge of the material universe. No true success in
   prophetic interpretations can be attained without a hearty reliance on
   the unity and majesty of all truth, without a calm confidence that
   contradictions are only apparent, and if we cannot explain them now,
   they will become clear hereafter. Reason, in its calmest and clearest
   vision, can be superseded only by being surpassed; feeling, in its
   tenderest mood, must still be ennobled by trust; and conscience must
   witness audibly and reverently to our need of the Spitit's mysterious
   guidance "into all truth."

   Throughout the Prophet Ezekiel, Calvin is nobly consistent in pleading
   for God's justice. There is no instinct more deeply seated in the human
   soul than this, -- the Godlike must be just nothing can be permanently
   opposed to this essential principle. It must sooner or later be
   vindicated, and bring a certain measure of retribution, which must
   follow hard upon its transgression. Still many traditional modes of
   thought concerning the Almighty occur in these Commentaries, which
   modern information has very largely modified. God's handwriting is now
   legible in many ways, where of old it was a blank. If his interposition
   is not now recognized in cherubs, and wheels, and burning flame, we are
   more conscious of the natural wonders developed in the dewdrop and the
   flower. Our age believes so many things of which the Reformers were
   ignorant, and disbelieves so much on which they laid stress, that we
   are in danger of overlooking the existence of great primeval truths,
   which constitute the essential religious life in man in all ages
   unchangeably. Veneration for what we believe God to be must be at the
   foundation of all diety; and imitation of what we believe God to do
   must ever be the substance of all duty. The first qualification for
   persuing Ezekiel with advantage is the spiritual purification of self;
   and in this attainment Calvin materially assists us, by setting before
   us large conceptions of the Almighty's character, and mature judgments
   of his purposes.

   Dissertation Thirteenth.

   a ISRAEL AN ADULTERESS.

   Ezekiel 16:1

   The allegory which runs through this chapter is by no means an unusual
   one in the Prophets. The beginning of Ezekiel 16:3 has occasioned some
   variety of remark. OEcolampadius takes mkvrh, mekoreh, meaning "birth,"
   "origin," for mgvrh, megoreh, meaning "dwelling;" as Calvin translates
   it habitationes. Houbigant derives it from krh, kereh, "to dig," which
   Newcome prefers: it may come from mkr, meker, "to sell," and thus means
   "dealings;" but this is not so appropriate here. Rosenmuller reviews
   these derivations, adding as another, viz. formationes; but approves of
   the sense "origin," effossione, from kvr, cor, "to dig." This is
   clearly the best, the Jews having constantly before them the digging
   out of a rock -- as in Isaiah 51:1. Both Theodoret and Jerome explain
   Ezekiel 16:3 with precision' the former has -- arais gar ho Chanaan
   hupeblethe kai douleian hupo tou propatoros Noe katedikasthe; the
   latter writes -- Cham quippe, pater Chanaan, princeps fuit gentis
   Aegvptiae... radicem Ierusalem terram AEgypti esse dicemus. In Ezekiel
   16:4 the salting and swaddling the body is said to represent the
   Almighty's care of the people when under Egyptian bondage. The custom
   of throwing the skirt over the female is alluded to by Theocritus
   Idyll. 18:19; and a fragment of Euripides preserved by Stobaeus. This
   cleansing from pollution is explained by the Chaldee paraphrast to mean
   the deliverance from Egypt. Those who are curious in the various
   articles of clothing in Ezekiel 16:10 to 14 may consult Schroeder de
   Vestitu Mul., chapter 14 page 221; Bochart Hieroz., part 1 lib. 3.;
   Jablonskii Opuscula, t. 1 p 290, etc.; and J. D. Michaelis in Suppl.,
   page 1565. "The images of men," (Ezekiel 16:17,) Jerome interprets of
   the idols of Bel, Chemosh, and Ashtoreth, which were made out of the
   sacred gold and silver of the temple. The passing through the fire,
   (Ezekiel 16:21,) the Vulgate renders consecrans illos; but Aquila,
   Synmachus, and Theodotion take the same view as Calvin. Theodoret
   interprets the 26th verse of the grossness of the Egyptian idolatry in
   worshipping the ibis, the cow and the crocodile. The punishment of the
   Jews (Ezekiel 16:36-43) is figuratively predicted by similar language,
   which Theodoret clearly illustrates -- ou gunaikas tas gunaikas
   onomazei alla tropikos tas poleis outo kalei epaide kai auten polin
   ousan diken gunaikos eis to dikasterion eisagei The comment of
   OEcolampadius on Ezekiel 16:20 and Ezekiel 16: 23 is copious and
   instructive.

   b CAPTIVE ISRAEL AND PAPAL ROME.

   Ezekiel 16:20

   In commenting on this verse, Calvin draws a striking comparison between
   the Jews of Ezekiel's day and the Romanists of his own. And as the
   controversy with Rome is at present a subject of absorbing interest, it
   is very important to ascertain the exact views of the Reformers as to
   that giant apostacy. The parallel between them seems to our Reformer
   most complete. He allows both to be true Churches, while he condemns
   them as breakers of God's covenant. Both Israel and the Papacy are
   still said to be under covenant with God; so, had "our baptism requires
   no renewal" (Ezekiel 16:20,) yet still the devil reigns in the Papacy
   without quite extinguishing God's grace. The Church is there amidst all
   its corruptions; otherwise Antichrist could not sit in God's temple.
   The papal priests are said to imitate the Jewish in all things, even to
   the material of which the surplice is made. The priests of Rome are
   called "papales sacrifici" -- the language of the Realists; which is
   erroneous, bee,, use it admits too much. It asserts that they offer
   sacrifice: the Protestant denies the fact, and disallows the term. In
   the controversy with Rome, we should be more careful than even Calvin
   in the terms we employ. To allow the analogy here pointed out, is to
   allow too much. While we assert, that the pretense to sacrificial
   functions is a gross imposture, we must at the same time refuse their
   claim to be acknowledged as priests. We must instantly erect the
   standard of nominalism, showing that there is but one high Priest, but
   one sacrifice, and one altar in the religion of Christ. This is real --
   all the rest mere accommodation. On this ground, too, Calvin's view of
   the covenant actually remaining among them, and of their being such a
   temple that Antichrist can be seated therein, is very questionable. It
   is necessary that the reader should see the consequences of allowing
   too much to the advocates of the papacy: there are many reasons, on
   which we cannot enter here, for believing that St. Paul did not refer
   in any way to Papal Rome by the phrase, "the temple of God" and if this
   be conceded, then Calvin's argument concerning Antichrist falls to the
   ground. It is very important to be aware of the tinge which the
   theological language of the sixteenth century gave to all the writings
   of that stirring age.

   g ON THE WORD "NEPHESH," SOUL.

   Ezekiel 16:27

   Calvin expresses himself rather hastily when he says (Ezekiel 16:27,)
   this word nphs, nepesh, means "lust," or desire, "appetite." It occurs
   eighteen times in these twenty chapters of Ezekiel; and in every case
   except this, when our version reads "will," it is properly translated
   "soul," or "person." As the word is in itself exceedingly important,
   and occurs some hundred times throughout the Old Testament, it is
   desirable to ascertain how far it admits of so many various meanings.
   We thought to lay it down as a general rule, that the usual sense of a
   word is not to be departed from without extreme necessity; and there
   seems none here for deviating from the ordinary meaning. Both Castell
   and Shindler, in their Lexx., give all the various uses of the word at
   full length; and both Gesenius and Lee fall into the error of stating
   too great a variety of meanings without giving the reasons for such
   discordant senses. Its original meaning is "breath;" and as "life" was
   supposed to reside in the breath, hence it expresses anything that has
   life, any living energy or mental activity, so that "the soul" is said
   to hunger and thirst, to fast and become cold. (See Proverbs, Psalms,
   and Job.) Schroeder de Vestitu Mulierum, and Gesenius, both give the
   sense of "fragrance" on Isaiah 3:20. The Rabbis distinguish three kinds
   of nepish in man, the vegetative, the brutal, and the intellectual.
   This description is philosophically correct, since it is now
   ascertained that "the life" of man strictly partakes of the elements of
   vegetable and animal vitality, together with the intellectual power and
   the moral sentiments, usually termed, "soul" in modern divinity.
   Connecting this word with lv, leb, "heart," we observe that Gesenius
   agrees with Calvin on Ezekiel 16:30, that it signifies "the seat of
   intelligence." The Hebrews supposed that the human heart "was actually
   the seat of the affections;" these are now known to act through the
   brain, and hence the old phraseology of "giving the heart to God"
   should be allowed to become obsolete. There is no proof that the word
   nephesh implied this immortal principle in man; the hunting souls, and
   slaying them, as in the thirteenth chapter, refer to the destruction of
   life. In the time of the translators, and in the distant counties of
   England at this day, the word "soul" is used where more refined
   speakers use the word "person." For instance, in Ezekiel 18, "the soul
   that sinneth it shall die," may be reduced to modern English by saying,
   "the person who sins shall die himself." It is by no means necessary,
   in Ezekiel 16:27, to deviate, with Calvin and our translators, from the
   ordinary sense; it is readily rendered, "and delivered thee up to the
   persons who hate thee, viz., the daughters," etc. Thus two English
   words only are required as the correct equivalent for nephesh
   throughout Ezekiel -- a point on which we thought to insist, as giving
   certainty and definiteness to any version of the Prophet's language.

   d THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH AND THE NEW TESTAMENT.

   Ezekiel 16:61

   It is worthy of notice, that in Calvin's time, as in our own, appeals
   were frequently made to the teaching of "the primitive Church." The
   Reformers were especially anxious to ascertain what the primitive
   Church really taught, and to compare it with Holy Scripture they did
   not repose implicitly on its dicta, because they looked upon the phrase
   as an idea rather than a reality. Here again the necessary collision
   between realism and nominalism arises. There is no such thing as the
   primitive Church in the sense in which it was used in Calvin's day, and
   has been revived in our own. The words stand for an abstract idea,
   comprehending many single churches, and stating what is held to be
   common to all. For instance, the Church at Antioch was in reality the
   primitive Gentile Church; its doctrines, discipline, and worship, were
   realities, and, could they be ascertained accurately, would present to
   our minds a destined and definite object; but any representation of
   doctrines and ceremonies said to be common to many Churches, and thus
   spoken of as appertaining to the primitive Church, is a mental
   deduction after the process of selection and assortment has been
   carried on. We have to guard against the erroneous view of the Realist,
   lest we should look to the primitive Church "to reveal what is to be
   believed, rather than to teach what has been revealed." See an
   admirable letter of the Archbishop of Canterbury to Rev. W. Maskell.

   Although Calvin's language throughout this chapter is precise and
   correct, yet he inadvertently falls now and then into that of the
   earliest. On Ezekiel 16:29 he uses the phrase "guttam pietatis in
   animis" -- the erroneous language of his Romanist adversaries. Piety,
   he knew well enough, was not a thing infused into man -- righteousness
   infused is the doctrine of realism -- righteousness imputed is
   nominalism: the former has of late been revived and systematized by
   Newman and Ward; while the latter has the inspired sanction of the
   Pauline Epistles. In his comments on this verse, our Reformer uses the
   word "testament" and "covenant" for the same idea. It is better to
   avoid this partial confusion. The word "testamentum" should properly be
   applied to the record, which informs us of the "foedus." Grotius has
   expressed the difference accurately: with him "testamentum" is
   equivalent to "libri feoderis," and, as accuracy in theological
   expressions is most desirable, it is wiser to translate diatheke in
   every instance by "covenant," and to confine the word testament most
   strictly to the written record. This will aid us in keeping before our
   minds the covenant between the Almighty and his living Church; we shall
   appreciate our position as children of the New Covenant, and avoid the
   error of regarding the Old Testament, with it's laws, and ceremonies,
   and sacrifices, as binding upon us, who are no longer "children of the
   bond woman, but of the free."

   Dissertation Fourteenth.

   a THE GREAT EAGLE.

   Ezekiel 17:3

   The allegory of "The Great Eagle" is well sustained throughout this
   chapter. A golden eagle with extended wings was the standard of the
   king of Persia in the time of Cyrus, (Xenoph. Cyrop., lib. 7 chap. 1,)
   and it was probably adopted from the Assyrian empire. The length of its
   wing is supposed by Grotius to apply to the widely-extended empire of
   Nebuchadnezzar. Kimchi interprets "the variegated color like a peacock"
   of the majesty and dignity of his kingdom; but Michaelis agrees with
   Calvin. The interpretation of Lebanon, to which Calvin objects, is
   adopted by Jerome and Theodoret; but Rosenmuller agrees with our
   Author. He also takes the word knn, ken-men, (Ezekiel 17:4,) exactly in
   Calvin's sense, quoting Proverbs 31:24, "quod incolae ejus terrae,
   utpote maris accolae, mercaturae erant deditissimi." See also Dathe's
   edit. of Glass. Phil. Sac., p. 1184. The sense which Calvin disapproves
   is adopted by the Septuagint, the Roman Codex, the Arabian version,
   Theodoret, and the Chaldee paraphrast. The criticism in the note to
   verse 8 is correct; and the interpretation generally is in accordance
   with the explanations of Jarcin, Kimchi, Jerome, Michaelis, Grotius,
   and other critics ancient and modern. Newcome has noticed some various
   readings, and others are easily gathered from De Rossi, and the
   different versions and codexes; but they are not of sufficient
   interest, to need further detail.

   b THE LOFTY BRANCH OF THE TALL CEDAR.

   Ezekiel 17:22

   The interpretation of Ezekiel 17:22 is worthy of remark. Kimchi and
   Grotius think that Zerubbabel is intended here, but Rosenmuller agrees
   with Calvin in referring it to Christ. The Chaldee paraphrast and
   Jarchi apply it to "King Messiah." (See Talm. Schabba,, fol. 30, and
   Cholin, fol. 139, b., and R. Abendana ad Michal Jopin.) Calvin's
   supposition, however, that where the prophets speak of "this hope of
   freedom to the elect," it should be dated from the rebuilding of the
   temple, and continued to the end of Christ's kingdom, is incorrect. It
   causes him, to date this kingdom from the rebuilding of the temple, in
   forgetfulness of the many disasters which happened to the people
   between the times of Ezra and of our Lord. The building of the second
   temple was not an event of any immediate spiritual import to the Jews'
   it was followed by overwhelming temporal disasters; so that the reign
   of Messiah did not commence till the Mediator of the New Covenant was
   revealed, and "the new kingdom of the heavens" fully heralded into the
   world at large.

   Dissertation Fifteenth.

   THE EATING SOUR GRAPES.

   Ezekiel 18:1

   THE proverb of the fathers eating sour grapes and the children's teeth
   being set on edge, requires a few remarks, in consequence of the
   conjectures of some modern writers on sacred subjects. Andrew Norton,
   in his elaborate notes on "The Genuineness of the Gospels," [375] has
   attempted to show a discrepancy between Ezekiel and the Pentateuch. He
   compares this proverb with the language of Exodus, Exodus 20, where God
   is said to visit the iniquity of the fathers on the children; he then
   quotes the Talmud as objecting to Ezekiel's prophecies, as
   contradictory to the Pentateuch and thus he insinuates that the two
   passages cannot be reconciled. If this be so, it is further implied
   that the Divine authority of either Exodus or Ezekiel is doubtful. But
   there seems no reason to conclude these two passages to be
   contradictory. The circumstances under which they were spoken give the
   tone and meaning to each. Moses enunciates a general law of God's moral
   government, which we see carried out every day before our eyes. Let the
   parent of a family, by honest industry and religious conduct acquire
   for himself the esteem and respect of his fellow-men, then it follows
   by an established law of God's providence, that his family gain
   honorable advantages by their parent's reputation. But let a parent by
   intemperance and dishonesty bring disgrace and poverty on himself, and
   it is equally a law of providential government that his children will
   suffer by his misconduct. The wickedness of the father will often fall
   dreadfully on his unconscious offspring. This is an undeviating, an
   irreversible law applicable at all times, and daily operating before us
   in ten thousand instances. But the Jews attempted to excuse their own
   sins by throwing them on their fathers. The generation which Ezekiel
   addressed were personally blameworthy; the language of this passage was
   theirs it is the language of a false excuse -- an attempt to charge the
   Almighty with unfairness, that they might throw the blame from
   themselves. No argument, then, can be drawn from its occurrence
   contrary to the Divine authority of the Pentateuch. Ezekiel records the
   language and chastises it, thereby upholding the authority of the law,
   and vindicating rather than destroying the unity of the Divine records.
   The destruction to be received from the chapter has been well pointed
   out by the present Archbishop of Canterbury, in his "Apostolic
   Preaching." -- Sixth edit., page 69.

   A translation of a work: of the Professor of Biblical Criticism at
   Heidelberg having been published in London, it becomes desirable to
   notice the result of his critical labors on this chapter of our
   Prophet. G. L. Bauer, in his "Theologie des alten Testaments," has the
   following comment "The whole book of Ezekiel is an illustration of the
   Judaic belief, that Jehovah is the King and Governor of his people
   Israel. He rewards and punishes them: blesses them with prosperity, and
   afflicts them with adversity. Ezekiel teaches (in direct opposition to
   the Mosaic doctrine that God will visit the sins of the fathers. upon
   the children unto the third and fourth generation), that the son shall
   not bear the iniquity of the father that moral conduct will ensure to
   the individual length of days that the righteousness of the righteous
   shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him,
   and that the soul that shineth he shall die. The eighteenth chapter is
   the most beautiful and the most useful in the book, but it has
   reference exclusively to God's conduct towards his own people." Here we
   have the usual mixture of Neologian wisdom and folly. There is no real
   contrast between Moses and this Prophet. Moses states a general law of
   God's moral government of mankind, and Ezekiel protests against an
   abuse of that doctrine. The Jews of his day wished to throw all the
   blame on their fathers, and to charge the Almighty with unfairness in
   punishing' them for the faults of their ancestors. They forgot their
   own personal share in rebellion against the Most high. Nor is it the
   slightest objection that "it has reference exclusively to God's conduct
   towards his own people." Here the Jews are specially addressed, and the
   principle is readily applicable to all mankind as soon as it is shown
   that they are under similar relations to the Almighty as the Jews. The
   writer who cannot see how easily Moses and Ezekiel are reconciled has
   but very slight pretensions to occupy a divinity chair; he may make
   hasty assertions, and give shrewd guesses; but his opinion thought to
   be well weighed before it is reckoned either valuable or trustworthy.
   Bauer's criticisms on various passages of this Prophet are by no means
   so objectionable as those on the other Old Testament writers; though he
   is open to the charge of exercising that "fertile imagination" [376]
   which he brings so irreverently against Ezekiel.

   A question of still larger import arises naturally out of their own
   defense of this eighteenth chapter; namely, what degree of authority
   have the laws of the Old Covenant over us, the children of the New? If,
   on the one hand, the reasonings of Professor Norton, as contained in
   the notes to his second volume of his "Evidences of the Genuineness of
   the Gospels" are unsound, the following assertion of a writer, in reply
   to the Queen's Professor of Modern History at Cambridge is unwise --
   "One inspired declaration is all that is needed, and whether it be
   found in the Old Testament or in the New, is all one to us Christians;
   it is God's word, and God's word cannot deceive." [377] It is clear
   enough that the Old Testament is God's word -- but is it so to us? Is
   its authority the same "to us Christians" as that of the New? He who
   would avoid Judaizing must answer in the negative: he who best
   understands the nature of our New Covenant in Christ Jesus will
   destined carefully between the authority of the inspired records of the
   two covenants over the conscience of the disciples of the new kingdom
   of the heavens. When we speak of Holy Writ collectively, as contrasted
   with all uninspired compositions, it is emphatically the Word of God;
   but when we are attempting to define the relation in which each
   Testament separately stands to ourselves, we must not hastily adopt the
   mere popular language of the day. By doing so, we are unable to repel
   the assaults of the worldly wise, and are in danger of lowering the
   value of the Sacred Oracles in the eyes of the scientific inquirers of
   our times.

   To the scholar who is acquainted with the difficulties which are
   reviewed by Professor Norton, the following observations will appear
   elementary; but as there are some simple-minded believers who may be
   perplexed by the specious arguments of the skeptic, a few remarks may
   be instructive. First of all, we should not treat the Old Testament as
   one book all written at the same time. It should be divided into
   various portions corresponding to the periods in which each book was
   written. The Pentateuch, for instance, should be studied separately
   from the Prophets; while the interval of nearly 1000 years, between the
   death of Moses and the visions of Ezekiel, should be constantly borne
   in mind. The Pentateuch, but not exactly as we have it, was the Word of
   God for Jews -- its authority as a law to Christians was never
   admissible. St. Paul's whole life was a protest against this going back
   again to Moses, instead of going forward to Christ. The ministration of
   death was exchanged for a dispensation of life while God's moral law
   remains unchangeable, its authority rests on other grounds to us than
   the thunders of Sinai and the tables of stone. Thus, again, the
   prophetic announcements were direct and special for Israel and Judea;
   but they contain guidance and warning for us only when we are placed in
   a similar position morally before God. Ezekiel, for instance, is a
   watchman to us only so far as it can be shown that our sins, needs, and
   responsibilities are similar to those of the Hebrews. It must be
   uttered again and again that we are discipled into the New Covenant of
   which St. Paul was a chief herald unto us Gentiles; and our highest
   attainment is to stand fast in the liberty wherewith our Redeemer has
   made us free. Wherever there is a spiritual analogy between our state
   and that of the captives at Chebar, Ezekiel is for us; his stirring
   voice is for our reproof and destruction in righteousness; but wherever
   the difference of condition is so great that this analogy fails, then
   Ezekiel is only indirectly our monitor from heaven. The light from
   heaven is reflected directly upon us through Jesus and his Apostles,
   and only obliquely through Moses and the Prophets. [378]

   By the expression of this view of the value of the Old Testament to us,
   we do but give form and voice to the feelings which exist in the minds
   of many earnest and thoughtful Christians. They cannot receive all that
   is in the Old Testament as equally binding on them with what is
   revealed in the New. Their cannot sympathize with the antagonist of the
   Queen's Professor of History: they feel that many proposed solutions of
   acknowledged difficulties are superficial and evasive rather than
   self-evident and satisfactory. Such obstacles are not necessarily
   connected with the Christian verities, they are not essential portions
   of our religion: we may safely confess ourselves ignorant of the true
   solution, without endangering a single particle of "the faith once
   delivered to the saints." By upholding the Pentateuch as the Word of
   God to the Jews of former ages, we defend and enforce its inspiration
   and suitability for its original time and purpose; by treating the
   prophecies of the era of the Captivity as spoken originally to the
   people alive at the time, we vindicate the Divine inspiration of the
   Prophet, and we prepare our own minds to receive intelligently any
   indirect destruction which may be applicable to ourselves. The
   integrity of the Jewish canon is thus acknowledged and preserved, while
   we are free to inquire how far its sacred books are instructive for all
   times and all nations. The whole life and ministry of St. Paul taught
   one invariable truth on this important question, and its significant
   witness was clear and emphatic to our higher privileges and nobler aims
   under the New Covenant in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   b USURY AND INTEREST.

   Ezekiel 18:8

   The manner in which this subject is treated illustrates our remarks on
   the non-application of the Jewish law to Christian duties. Calvin is
   evidently at a loss how to distinguish between lawful and unlawful
   interest. He does not clearly say that one law was applicable to the
   Jew and another to us. Usury may be sinful, but not because it was
   forbidden to Israel of old. The comment on this verse is not based upon
   principles in accordance with the New Covenant. It may fairly be stated
   that this eighteenth chapter is not law to us; our duties depend upon
   another foundation. The law which is to decide what is "interest" and
   what "usury," must rest upon the golden rule of doing unto others as we
   would that they should do unto us. If we be formed after the image of
   Christ, we shall educate conscience, and cultivate justice and mercy,
   and decide these points by a different standard from that of the Jewish
   law; and when Calvin states "in lege ea est perfectio ad quam nihil
   possit accedere," he does not state the sense in which he uses qege,"
   and seems to confine it to the Mosaic precepts. This instance is
   sufficient to show the true use which we are to make of the Old
   Testament, and to guard us against a misapplication of its statements.

   A singular instance of the fallacy of applying the Old Testament
   directly to the events of the world in the present day occurs in the
   State Trials in the reign of James the Second. In the case of the East
   India Company 5 Sandys, a question arose respecting the right of the
   King's subjects to trade with nations eastward of the Cape of Good Hope
   without the King's license. Holt, afterwards the celebrated
   Chief-Justice, argued his point with more, zeal than discretion. He
   gravely cites the doctrine of Lord Coke, that "infidels are perpetual
   enemies;" and then, in the same breath, quotes the book of Judges, to
   show by analogy, that as the Jews were restrained from merchandise with
   the Canaanites, so Christians thought to be restricted in their
   dealings with Pagans. [379] One instance out of many may suffice to
   remind us, that the assumption that Christians are in all cases to act
   according to God's commands to the Jews, is the bashes of modern
   Judaism; and the frequency of such reasonings, though supported at
   times by the writings of some of our venerable Reformers, calls loudly
   for the voice of another Paul to proclaim, "Stand fast in the liberty
   wherewith Christ has made you free."

   The imprudent manner in which some commentators have connected the
   incidents of the Old Testament with the doctrine of the New is readily
   illustrated by a passage in the first epistle to the Corinthians by
   Clement of Rome. In quoting the narrative of Rahab receiving the spies
   before the destruction of Jericho, he adverts to their suggesting the
   hanging out a scarlet thread from her house, and then adds directly,
   "making: it manifest that by the blood of the Lord redemption shall be
   to all those who believe and trust upon God. You see then, beloved,
   that there was not only faith, but prophecy in the woman." [380] if
   this method of illustration be considered allegorical, and as only
   suggestive of a remote comparison, it is tolerable; but if it be
   intended to imply any typical connection between the accident of the
   scarlet color and the redemption through Messiah, it is irreverent and
   inappropriate in the extreme. The learned Wotton defends Clement by the
   example of his master, Paul, and quotes Justin Martyr, who treats the
   same event "as a symbol of the blood of Christ." [381] Guided by such
   illustrious names, the Reformers often adopted the same
   "spiritualizing" system. The sounder and soberer criticism of later
   days has instructed us not to adopt the imaginations of men as if they
   were inseparably bound up with the supreme word of God. The following
   extract is worthy of notice, as illustrating the principles for which
   we contend: --

   "The same freedom of thought [as that of Luther] on topics not strictly
   theological formed a prominent feature in the character of Calvin. A
   curious instance of it occurs in one of his letters, [382] where he
   discussed an ethical question of no small moment in the science of
   political economy, How far it is consistent with morality to accept of
   interest for a pecuniary loan?' On this question, which, even in
   Protestant countries, continued till a very recent period to divide the
   opinions both of divines and Lawyers, Calvin treats the authority of
   Aristotle and that of the Church with equal disregard. To the former he
   opposes a close and logical argument not unworthy of Mr. Bentham: to
   the latter he replies, by showing that the Mosaic law on this point,
   was not a moral, but a municipal prohibition -- a prohibition not to be
   judged of from any particular text of Scripture, but upon the
   principles of natural equity." [383]

   g PERPLEXING AND THORNY QUESTIONS.

   Ezekiel 18:20

   In this and the following verses Calvin pronounces rather too
   dogmatically upon matters which are beyond human comprehension. He
   strives to reconcile statements apparently contradictory, and in doing
   so enunciates principles which cannot be positively determined. For
   instance, the will of an infant, before its birth, is said to be
   "perverse and rebellious against God," Ezekiel 18:20. Although we are
   reminded (Ezekiel 18:23) that God's secret counsels are inscrutable to
   us, yet the assertion is hazarded that he "has devoted the reprobate to
   eternal destruction, and wishes them to perish." Some effort is made to
   reconcile the freeness of this will with the certainty of the
   destruction the knot is said to be "easily untied;" but the experience
   of nearly three centuries has proved that these exciting disputes have
   not been satisfactorily settled: they are still what they are called in
   Ezekiel 18:25, "perplexing and thorny questions," and must remain so
   till the promise is accomplished, that faith shall be exchanged for
   sight. It does not seem desirable to enter upon these abstruse points
   when commenting upon a Hebrew Prophet: the revelation to Ezekiel was
   far different in its subject-matter from that to St. Paul: there is no
   necessity for supposing either that the evangelical doctrines were
   fully made known to the Prophets, or that their language is verbally
   binding upon us -- the offspring of the far-off Gentiles.

   In these "Dissertations" we only venture to suggest some general
   principles of correct interpretation, and to point out some errors into
   which our Reformer has fallen, partly through the infirmity natural to
   man, and partly through the philosophical systems and the false
   divinity current in his times. While he so evidently surpassed his own
   age in stern and devoted piety, and avoided the fanciful conjectures in
   which many of the Reformers indulged; Calvin is at times open to the
   charge of teaching dogmatically questions which have never been decided
   by Revelation. Let us bear with him on this point, while we profit by
   his judicious and instructive lectures; remembering that within the
   fringes of his shadow his modern revilers are not worthy to tread.

   Another instance of perplexity occurs in Ezekiel 20:39. The
   "Indecision" refers to the decree of the Emperor Charles V. called "The
   Interim." Calvin's hatred of it was sincere but injudicious. It was a
   first step to better things. See Mosheim, cent. 16 sect. 1, and the
   authorities quoted in Maclaine's note.

   Dissertation Sixteenth

   THE SABBATH A SACRAMENT AND A MYSTERY.

   Ezekiel 20:13, 14

   We have already cautioned the modern reader of Calvin not to be
   startled at his assertion, that "the Sabbath is Sacrament." We have in
   these days become so thoroughly imbued with the notion that; there can
   be but two Sacraments, that we reject at once the possibility of,
   third. This causes us again to call the reader's attention in detail to
   the principles expressed in the note to the 20th verse of this chapter.

   A number of words occur in theological discussions which are not met
   with in Holy Scripture. Among these are the words Sacramentum, Persona,
   Trinitas, Unitas. If these were merely translations of equivalent Greek
   words found in the New Testament, all difficulty would cease; but they
   are not although they express the ideas of the Apostles correctly, if
   taken in the sense in which they were originally used. The Protestant
   of these later times, if he would understand them aright, should study
   their use in the Schoolmen, and by the leading writers of the Church of
   Rome, and then, approach the writings of the Reformers. Lawrence's
   Bampton Lectures have already been mentioned: besides these, Bishop
   Davenant's Determinationes of theological questions, when Margaret
   Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, are a valuable specimen of the
   subject-matter of theological dispute in the days immediately preceding
   his own. (See edit. 1634, and also 1639, in Lib. of Queen's Coll.,
   Cam.) The greatest mistakes have been committed by English writers on
   Theology in consequence of their unconscious subjection to a
   traditional phraseology. It may fairly be called a slavery to words.
   They have lost sight of realities, through anxiety for a verbal
   orthodoxy. This has led them to look for spiritual realities where
   riley are not to be found. In tracing the cause of this, we find it to
   arise from our receiving so many of our theological expressions through
   the Latin Vulgate. And not only are the words, but the ideas, of the
   Reformers tinctured by their education under the religious philosophy
   which they rejected. Calvin, for instance, in Ezekiel 20:16, uses the
   phrase "guttam pietarts;" in Ezekiel 20:20, "guttam fidei;" and in
   Ezekiel 20:19, "suis commentis inficiunt legem ipsius," the two former
   expressions implying that piety and faith are qualities within the
   soul, measurable by quantity' and the latter, that the fictions of man
   can in any way affect the purity of the law of God. Instances of this
   kind are here pointed out, that we may be aware of the principle on
   which Calvin's expressions on many interesting points frequently rest.
   Other words as well as sacramentum are used by Calvin in a sense rather
   different from their modern meaning. For example, virtus and virtutes,
   doctrina and religio, occur throughout these Lectures, and sometimes
   need a circumlocution for their English equivalents. In Ezekiel 20:29
   religio occurs for respect paid to idols, and "mysterium" must be taken
   rather in its classical than its familiar meaning. The Greek musterion
   was translated "sacramentum" in the copies used by Tertullian, Cyprian,
   and Ambrose. Tertullian accordingly calls the doctrines of the Trinity
   and of our Lord's Incarnation "sacramenta." Prudentius uses it for "the
   whole Christian doctrine," as St. Paul does the word musterion 1
   Corinthians 4:1. It is sufficient to point out this difference in the
   use of terms, that no reader may judge Calvin hastily, but rather be
   led to discover the error or the unsoundness in himself. Those
   Reformers who were more strenuous Nominalists than Calvin, did not deny
   the realities of the faith but they thought for them where they are
   only to be found: not in rites, and words, and creeds, and ceremonies,
   but in the inner soul of man; in our moral and spiritual nature; in the
   character and revelation of God; in the teachings and guidings of the
   Holy Spirit; and in the renewed lives and peaceful deaths of all who
   are new-created in Christ Jesus their Lord.
