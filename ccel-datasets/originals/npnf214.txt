   Preface.

   ------------------------

   The work intrusted to me of preparing this volume evidently can be
   divided into two separate parts.  The first, the collecting of the
   material needed and the setting of it before the reader in the English
   tongue; the other, the preparation of suitable introductions and notes
   to the matter thus provided.  Now in each of these departments two
   courses were open to the editor:  the one, to be original; the other,
   to be a copyist.  I need hardly say that of these the former offered
   many temptations.  But I could not fail to recognize the fact that such
   a course would greatly take from the real value of the work, and
   therefore without any hesitation I have adopted the other alternative,
   and have endeavoured, so far as was at all possible, to keep myself out
   of the question altogether; and as a general rule even the translation
   of the text (as distinguished from the notes) is not mine but that of
   some scholar of well-established reputation.

   In the carrying out of this method of procedure I have availed myself
   of all the translations which I could find, and where, after comparing
   them with the original, I have thought them substantially accurate, I
   have adopted them and reproduced them.  Where I have thought that the
   translation was misleading, I have amended it from some other
   translation, and, I think, in no case have I ventured a change of
   translation which rests upon my own judgment alone.  A very
   considerable portion, however, of the matter found in this volume is
   now translated into English for the first time.  For some of this I am
   indebted to my friends, who have most kindly given me every assistance
   in their power, but even here no translation has been made from the
   Greek without careful reference being had to the traditional
   understanding, as handed down in the Latin versions, and wherever the
   Latin and Greek texts differ on material points the difference has been
   noted.  I have not thought it necessary nor desirable to specify the
   source of each particular translation, but I have provided for the use
   of the reader a list of all the translations which I have used.  I
   should also add that I have not considered any one text sufficiently
   well established as to command any deference being paid to it, and that
   I have usually followed (for my own convenience rather than for any
   other reason) the text contained in Labbe and Cossart's Concilia.  No
   doubt Hardouin and Mansi are in some respects superior, but old
   prejudices are very strong, and the reader will remember that these
   differing Concilia gave rise to a hard-fought battle in the history of
   the Gallican Church.  I should add, however, that where more recent
   students of the subject have detected errors of importance in Labbe's
   text, I have corrected them, usually noting the variety of reading.
   With regard then to the text I entirely disclaim any responsibility,
   and the more so as on such a matter my opinion would be entirely
   valueless.  And with regard to the translation my responsibility goes
   no further than the certifying the reader that, to all intents and
   purposes, the meaning of the original is presented to him in the
   English language and without interpretation being introduced under the
   specious guise of translation.  Some portions are mere literal
   translations, and some are done into more idiomatic English, but
   all--so far as I am able to judge--are fair renderings of the original,
   its ambiguities being duly preserved.  I have used as the foundation of
   the translation of the canons of the first four synods and of the five
   Provincial Synods that most convenient book, Index Canonum, by the Rev.
   John Fulton, D.D., D.C.L., in which united to a good translation is a
   Greek text, very well edited and clearly printed.

   In preparing the other division of the book, that is to say, the
   Introduction and Notes, I have been guided by the same considerations.
   Here will be found no new and brilliant guesses of my own, but a
   collection of the most reliable conclusions of the most weighty critics
   and commentators.  Where the notes are of any length I have traced the
   source and given the exact reference, but for the brief notes, where I
   have not thought this necessary, the reader may feel the greatest
   confidence that he is not reading any surmises of mine, but that in
   every particular what he reads rests upon the authority of the greatest
   names who have written on the subject.  In the bibliographical table
   already referred to I have placed the authorities most frequently
   cited.

   I think it necessary to make a few remarks upon the rule which I have
   laid down for myself with regard to my attitude on controverted
   questions bearing upon doctrine or ecclesiastical discipline.  It seems
   to me that in such a work as the present any expression of the editor's
   views would be eminently out of place.  I have therefore confined
   myself to a bare statement of what I conceive to be the facts of the
   case, and have left the reader to draw from them what conclusions he
   pleases.  I hope that this volume may be equally acceptable to the
   Catholic and to the Protestant, to the Eastern and to the Western, and
   while I naturally think that the facts presented are clearly in
   accordance with my own views, I hope that those who draw from the same
   premises different conclusions will find these premises stated to their
   satisfaction in the following pages.  And should such be the case this
   volume may well be a step toward "the union of all" and toward "the
   peace of all the holy churches of God," for which the unchanging East
   has so constantly prayed in her liturgy.

   I wish to explain to the reader one other principle on which I have
   proceeded in preparing this volume.  It professes to be a translation
   of the decrees and canons of certain ecclesiastical synods.  It is not
   a history of those synods, nor is it a theological treatise upon the
   truth or otherwise of the doctrines set forth by those synods in their
   legislation.  I have therefore carefully restricted my own historical
   introductions to a bare statement of such facts as seemed needed to
   render the meaning of the matter subsequently presented intelligible to
   the reader.  And with regard to doctrine I have pursued the same
   course, merely explaining what the doctrine taught or condemned was,
   without entering into any consideration of its truth or falsity.  For
   the history of the Church and its Councils the reader must consult the
   great historians; for a defence of the Church's faith he must read the
   works of her theologians.

   I need hardly say that the overwhelming majority of the references
   found in this volume I have had no opportunity of verifying, no copy of
   many of the books being (so far as I know) to be found in America.  I
   have, however, taken great pains to insure accuracy in reproducing the
   references as given in the books from which I have cited them; this,
   however, does not give me any feeling of confidence that they may be
   relied on, especially as in some cases where I have been able to look
   them up, I have found errors of the most serious kind.

   It now only remains that I thank all those who have assisted me in this
   work, and especially I must mention his Excellency the High Procurator
   of the Holy Governing Synod of Russia, who directed the bibliographical
   table of Russian editions of the Canons, etc., which is found in this
   volume, to be prepared for me by Professor Glubokoffski of the
   Ecclesiastical Academy at St. Petersburgh.  My special thanks are due
   to the learned professor just named for the very admirable manner in
   which he has performed the work, and to Mr. W. J. Birkbeck, who has
   added one more to his numerous labours for making the West better
   acquainted with the East by translating the Russian ms. into English.
   I cannot but pause here to remark how deep my regret is that my
   ignorance of the Russian and Slavic tongues has prevented me from
   laying before my readers the treasures of learning and the stores of
   tradition and local illustration which these volumes must contain.  I
   am, however, extremely well pleased in being able to put those, who are
   more fortunate than myself in this respect, in the way of investigating
   the matter for themselves, by supplying them with the titles of the
   books on the subject.  I desire also to offer my thanks to Professor
   Bolotoff for the valuable information he sent me as well as for a copy
   of his learned (and often most just) strictures upon Professor
   Lauchert's book, "Die Kanones der wichtigsten altkirchlichen Concilien
   nebst den Apostolischen Kanones."  (Freiburg in B. und Leipzig, 1896.)

   The Rev. Wm. McGarvey has helped me most kindly by translating parts of
   the Second Council of Nice, and one or more of the African Canons; and
   by looking over the translation of the entire African Code.

   The Rev. F. A. Sanborn translated two of St. Cyril's letters, and the
   Rev. Leighton Hoskins the Sardican Canons.  To these and many other of
   my friends, who in one way or another helped me, I wish to return my
   deep thanks; also to the Nashotah Theological Seminary and to the
   Lutheran Theological Seminary at Mt. Airy, Philadelphia, for having
   placed their libraries entirely at my disposal; nor can I end this list
   without mention of my sister, who has assisted me most materially
   through the entire progress of the work, and without whom I never could
   have undertaken it.

   When I think of the great number of authors cited, of the rapidity with
   which most of the translation has had to be done, of the difficulty of
   getting access to the necessary books, and of the vast range of
   subjects touched upon (including almost every branch of ecclesiastical
   and theological learning), I feel I must throw myself and my work upon
   the reader's indulgence and beg him to take all this in consideration
   in making his estimate of the value of the work done.  As for me, now
   that it is all finished, I feel like crying out with the reader, in
   deep shame at the recollection of the many blunders he has made in
   reading the lesson,--"Tu autem, Domine, miserere nobis!"

   In conclusion I would add that nothing I have written must be
   interpreted as meaning that the editor personally has any doubt of the
   truth of the doctrines set forth by the Ecumenical Councils of the
   Christian Church, and I wish to declare in the most distinct manner
   that I accept all the doctrinal decrees of the Seven Ecumenical Synods
   as infallible and irreformable.

   General Introduction.

   ------------------------

   I.  Method of Treatment.

   It is absolutely necessary that a few words should be said on the
   general arrangement of the work.  The reader will find given him in the
   English tongue, so far as they have come down to us, all the doctrinal
   definitions of the Seven Ecumenical Councils (councils which have
   always, and still do, receive the unqualified acceptance of both East
   and West), and all the canons, disciplinary and doctrinal, which were
   enacted by them.  To these has been added a translation in full of all
   the canons of the local synods which received the approval and sanction
   of the aforesaid Ecumenical Councils.  Besides this, as throwing light
   upon the subject, large extracts from the Acta have been given, in fact
   all that seemed to illustrate the decrees; and, that nothing might be
   lacking, in an appendix has been placed a collection of all the
   non-synodal canons which have received the sanction of the Ecumenical
   Synods, the "Canons of the Apostles" (so called) being given in full,
   and the others in a shortened form, for the most part in the words of
   the admirable and learned John Johnson.

   This then is the text of the volume; but it is manifest that it stood
   in need of much comment to make its meaning clear to the reader, even
   if well informed on ordinary matters.  To provide for this, to each
   synodal canon there has been added the Ancient Epitome.

   Of this Epitome Bishop Beveridge treats with great learning in section
   xxvi. of his "Prolegomena" to his Synodicon, and shows that while some
   attributed this epitome to the Greek mediæval scholiast Aristenus, it
   cannot be his, as he has taken it for the text of his commentaries, and
   has in more than one instance pointed out that whoever he was who made
   it had, in his judgment, missed the sense. [1]

   The Epitome must indeed be much older, for Nicholas Hydruntinus, who
   lived in the times of Alexis Angelus, when intending to quote one of
   the canons of Ephesus, actually quotes words which are not in that
   canon, but which are in the Epitome.  "Wherefore," says Beveridge, "it
   is manifest that the Epitome is here cited, and that under the name of
   the whole canon."  This being established we may justly look upon the
   Ancient Epitome as supplying us with a very ancient gloss upon the
   canons.

   To this Epitome have been added Notes, taken from most of the great
   commentators, and Excursuses, largely made up from the writings of the
   greatest theologians, canonists, archæologists, etc., with regard to
   whom and their writings, all the information that seems necessary the
   reader will find in the Bibliographical Introduction.

   II.  Concerning Ecumenical Councils in General.

   An Ecumenical Synod may be defined as a synod the decrees of which have
   found acceptance by the Church in the whole world. [2]   It is not
   necessary to make a council ecumenical that the number of bishops
   present should be large, there were but 325 at Nice, and 150 at I.
   Constantinople; it is not necessary that it should be assembled with
   the intention of its being ecumenical, such was not the case with I.
   Constantinople; it is not necessary that all parts of the world should
   have been represented or even that the bishops of such parts should
   have been invited.  All that is necessary is that its decrees find
   ecumenical acceptance afterwards, and its ecumenical character be
   universally recognized.

   The reader will notice that in the foregoing I have not proceeded from
   the theological foundation of what an Ecumenical Synod should be (with
   this question the present volume has nothing to do), but from a
   consideration of the historical question as to what the Seven Councils
   have in common, which distinguishes them from the other councils of the
   Christian Church.

   And here it is well to note that there have been many "General
   Councils" which have not been "Ecumenical."  It is true that in
   ordinary parlance we often use the expressions as interchangeable, but
   such really is not the case.  There are but seven universally
   recognized and undisputed "Ecumenical Councils"; on the other hand, the
   number of "General Councils" is very considerable, and as a matter of
   fact of these last several very large ones fell into heresy.  It is
   only necessary to mention as examples the Latrocinium and the spurious
   "Seventh Council," held by the iconoclastic heretics.  It is therefore
   the mere statement of an historical fact to say that General Councils
   have erred.

   The Ecumenical Councils claimed for themselves an immunity from error
   in their doctrinal and moral teaching, resting such claim upon the
   promise of the presence and guidance of the Holy Ghost.  The Council
   looked upon itself, not as revealing any new truth, but as setting
   forth the faith once for all delivered to the Saints, its decisions
   therefore were in themselves ecumenical, as being an expression of the
   mind of the whole body of the faithful both clerical and lay, the
   sensus communis of the Church.  And by the then teaching of the Church
   that ecumenical consensus was considered free from the suspicion of
   error, guarded, (as was believed,) by the Lord's promise that the gates
   of hell should not prevail against his Church.  This then is what
   Catholics mean when they affirm the infallibility of Ecumenical
   Councils.  Whether this opinion is true or false is a question outside
   the scope of the present discussion.  It was necessary, however, to
   state that these Councils looked upon themselves as divinely protected
   in their decisions from error in faith and morals, lest the reader
   should otherwise be at a loss to understand the anathematisms which
   follow the decrees, and which indeed would be singularly out of place,
   if the decrees which they thus emphatically affirm were supposed to
   rest only upon human wisdom and speculation, instead of upon divine
   authority.

   Theologians consider that the decisions of Ecumenical Councils, like
   all juridical decrees, must be construed strictly, and that only the
   point at issue must be looked upon as decided.  The obiter dicta of so
   august a body are no doubt of the greatest weight, but yet they have no
   claim to be possessed of that supreme authority which belongs to the
   definition of the particular point under consideration. [3]

   The Seven Ecumenical Councils were all called together at the
   commandment and will of Princes; without any knowledge of the matter on
   the part of the Pope in one case at least (1st Constantinople) [4] ;
   without any consultation with him in the case of I. Nice, so far as we
   know [5] ; and contrary to his expressed desire in at least the case of
   Chalcedon, when he only gave a reluctant consent after the Emperor
   Marcian had already convoked the synod.  From this it is historically
   evident that Ecumenical Councils can be summoned without either the
   knowledge or consent of the See of Rome.

   In the history of the Christian Church, especially at a later period in
   connection with the Great Schism, much discussion has taken place among
   the learned as to the relative powers of a General Council and of the
   Pope.  It will be remembered by everyone that the superior authority of
   the council was not only taught, but on one occasion acted on, by a
   council, but this is outside of the period covered by the Seven
   Ecumenical Synods, and I shall therefore only discuss the relations of
   these seven synods to the Roman See.  And in the first place it is
   evident that no council has ever been received as ecumenical which has
   not been received and confirmed by the Roman Pontiff.  But, after all,
   this is only saying that no council has been accepted as ecumenical
   which has not been ecumenically received, for it must be remembered
   that there was but one Patriarchate for the whole West, that of Rome;
   and this is true to all intents and purposes, whether or no certain
   sections had extrapatriarchal privileges, and were "auto-cephalous."

   But it would be giving an entirely unfair impression of the matter to
   the reader were he left to suppose that this necessity for Rome's
   confirmation sprang necessarily from any idea of Rome's infallibility.
   So far as appears from any extant document, such an idea was as unknown
   in the whole world then as it is in four of the five patriarchates
   to-day.  And it should be borne in mind that the confirmation by the
   Emperor was sought for and spoken of in quite as strong, if not
   stronger, terms.  Before passing to a particular examination of what
   relation each of the Councils bore to the Roman See, it may be well to
   note that while as an historical fact each of the Seven Ecumenical
   Councils did eventually find acceptance at Rome, this fact does not
   prove that such acceptance is necessary in the nature of things.  If we
   can imagine a time when Rome is not in communion with the greater part
   of the West, then it is quite possible to imagine that an Ecumenical
   Council could be held whose decrees would (for the time being) be
   rejected by the unworthy occupant of the Apostolic See.  I am not
   asserting that such a state of affairs is possible from a theological
   standpoint, but merely stating an historical contingency which is
   perfectly within the range of imagination, even if cut off from any
   practical possibility by the faith of some.

   We now come to a consideration of how, by its acts, each of the Seven
   Synods intimated its relation to the Roman See:

   1.  The First Council of Nice passed a canon in which some at least of
   the Roman rights are evidently looked upon as being exactly on the same
   plane as those of other metropolitans, declaring that they rest upon
   "custom."

   It was the Emperor who originated this council and called it together,
   if we may believe his own words and those of the council; and while
   indeed it is possible that when the Emperor did not preside in person,
   Hosius of Cordova may have done so (even uniting the two Roman
   Presbyters who were the legates of the Roman See with him), yet there
   is no evidence that anything of the kind ever took place, and a pope,
   Felix III. (a.d. 483-492), in his Fifth Epistle (ad Imp. Zen.) declares
   that Eustathius, bishop of Antioch, presided at this council. [6]

   The matter, however, is of little moment as no one would deny the right
   of the See of Rome to preside in a council of the whole Church.

   2.  The Second Ecumenical Council was called together by the Emperor
   without the knowledge of the Roman Pontiff.  Nor was he invited to be
   present.  Its first president was not in communion at the time of its
   session with the Roman Church.  And, without any recourse to the first
   of all the patriarchs, it passed a canon changing the order of the
   patriarchates, and setting the new see of Constantinople in a higher
   place than the other ancient patriarchates, in fact immediately after
   Rome.  Of course Protestants will consider this a matter of very minor
   importance, looking upon all patriarchal divisions and rank and
   priority (the Papacy included) as of a disciplinary character and as
   being jure ecclesiastico, and in no way affecting doctrine, but any
   fair reading of the third canon of this synod would seem plainly to
   assert that as the first rank of Rome rested upon the fact of its being
   the capital city, so the new capital city should have the second rank.
   If this interpretation is correct it affects very materially the Roman
   claim of jure divino primacy.

   3.  Before the third of the Ecumenical Synods was called to meet, Pope
   Celestine had already convicted Nestorius of heresy and deposed and
   excommunicated him.  When subsequently the synod was assembled, and
   before the papal legates had arrived, the Council met, treated
   Nestorius as in good standing, entirely ignoring the sentence already
   given by Rome, and having examined the case (after summoning him three
   times to appear that he might be heard in his own defence), proceeded
   to sentence Nestorius, and immediately published the sentence.  On the
   10th of July (more than a fortnight later), the papal legates having
   arrived, a second session was held, at which they were told what had
   been done, all of which they were good enough to approve of. [7]

   4.  The Council of Chalcedon refused to consider the Eutychian matter
   as settled by Rome's decision or to accept Leo's Tome without
   examination as to whether it was orthodox.  Moreover it passed a canon
   at a session which the Papal legates refused to attend, ratifying the
   order of the Patriarchates fixed at I. Constantinople, and declaring
   that "the Fathers had very properly given privileges to Old Rome as the
   imperial city, and that now they gave the same (ta isa presbeia)
   privileges" to Constantinople as the seat of the imperial government at
   that time.

   5.  The fifth of the Ecumenical Synods refused to receive any written
   doctrinal communication from the then pope (Vigilius), took his name
   from the diptychs, and refused him communion.

   6.  The Third Council of Constantinople, the sixth of the Ecumenical
   Synods, excommunicated Pope Honorius, who had been dead for years, for
   holding and teaching the Monothelite heresy.

   7.  It is certain that the Pope had nothing to do with the calling of
   the Seventh Synod, [8] and quite possible that it was presided over by
   Tarasius and not by the Papal legates.

   Such is, in brief, the evidence which the Ecumenical Councils give on
   the subject of what, for lack of a better designation, may be called
   the Papal claims.  Under these circumstances it may not be deemed
   strange that some extreme ultramontanists have arrived at the
   conclusion that much of the acts and decisions as we have them is
   spurious, or at least corrupted in an anti-papal direction.  Vincenzi,
   who is the most learned of these writers, argues somewhat thus "if the
   members of the Ecumenical Synods believed as we do to-day with regard
   to the Papacy it is impossible that they should have acted and spoken
   as they did, but we know they must have believed as we do, ergo they
   did not so act or speak."  The logic is admirable, but the truth of the
   conclusion depends upon the truth of the minor premise.  The forgeries
   would have been very extensive, and who were they done by?  Forgeries,
   as the false decretals, to advance papal claims we are unfortunately
   familiar with, but it is hard to imagine who could have forged in Greek
   and Latin the acts of the Ecumenical Synods.  It is not necessary to
   pursue the matter any further, perhaps its very mention was uncalled
   for, but I wish to be absolutely fair, that no one may say that any
   evidence has been suppressed. [9]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] This was until the division of the East and West the definition
   accepted by all the whole Christian world.  But since the Church has
   been divided, while the East has kept to the old definition and has not
   pretended to have held any Ecumenical Councils, the Roman Church has
   made a new definition of the old term and has then proceeded to hold a
   very considerable number of synods which she recognizes as Ecumenical.
   I say "a very considerable number," for even among Roman Catholic
   theologians there is much dispute as to the number of these "Ecumenical
   Synods," the decrees of which, like those of Trent and the Vatican,
   have never been received by about half of the Christian world,
   including four of the five patriarchates and of the fifth patriarchate
   all the Anglican communion.  According to modern Roman writers the
   definition of these non-ecumenically received Ecumenical Synods is
   "Ecumenical councils are those to which the bishops and others entitled
   to vote are convoked from the whole world under the Presidency of the
   Pope or his legates, and the decrees of which, having received Papal
   confirmation, bind all Christians."  Addis and Arnold, A Catholic
   Dictionary, s. v. Councils.  The reader will notice that by this
   definition one at least (I. Constantinople), probably three, of the
   seven undisputed Ecumenical Synods cease to be such.

   [3] Vide Vasquez, P. III., Disp. 181, c. 9; Bellarmin., De Concil.,
   Lib. II., cap. xvij.; Veron, Rule of the Cath. Faith, Chap. I., §§ 4,

   [5] It should be stated that at the Sixth Synod it was said that I.
   Nice was "summoned by the Emperor and Pope Sylvester," on what
   authority I know not.

   [6] Cf. Theod. H. E., Lib. I., e. 6.

   [7] Protestant Controversialists, as well as others, have curious ways
   of stating historical events without any regard to the facts of the
   case.  A notable instance of this is found in Dr. Salmon's
   Infallibility of the Church (p. 426 of the 2d Edition) where we are
   told that "the only one of the great controversies in which the Pope
   really did his part in teaching Christians what to believe was the
   Eutychian controversy.  Leo the Great, instead of waiting, as Popes
   usually do, till the question was settled, published his sentiments at
   the beginning, and his letter to Flavian was adopted by the Council of
   Chalcedon.  This is what would have always happened if God had really
   made the Pope the guide to the Church.  But this case is quite
   exceptional, resulting from the accident that Leo was a good
   theologian, besides being a man of great vigour of character.  No
   similar influence was exercised either by his predecessors or
   successors."  This sentence is not pleasant reading, for it is an
   awe-inspiring display of one of two things, neither of which should be
   in the author of such a book.  We need only remind the reader that
   Celestine had condemned Nestorius and his teaching before the Council
   of Ephesus; that Honorius had written letters defining the question
   with regard to the will or wills of the Incarnate Son before the III.
   Council of Constantinople (which excommunicated him as a heretic for
   these very letters); that Pope Vigilius condemned the "Three Chapters"
   before the II. Council of Constantinople; and that Gregory II.
   condemned the iconoclastic heresy before the Seventh Synod, if the
   letters attributed to him be genuine (which is not quite certain, as
   will be shewn in its proper place).  Thus the only two great questions
   not decided, one way or another, by the See of Rome before the meeting
   of a General Council were Arianism and Macedonianism, and some have
   held (though mistakenly as is generally thought) that Arius was
   condemned by a synod held at Rome before that of Nice.

   [8] See Michaud's brilliant answer to Hefele, Discussion sur les Sept
   Conciles OEcuméniques, p. 327.

   [9] The reader may easily satisfy himself on this matter by reading the
   somewhat extensive works of Aloysius Vincenzi, published in Rome in
   1875 and thereabouts.

   III.  The Number of the Ecumenical Synods.

   It may not be unjustly expected that some reasons should be assigned
   for limiting the number of the Ecumenical Synods to seven.  There is no
   need here to enter into any proof that Nice, I. Constantinople, Ephesus
   and Chalcedon are Ecumenical, since so long ago as the time of St.
   Gregory the Great, that Saint and Doctor said of them:  "I venerate the
   first four Ecumenical Councils equally with the Four Gospels (sicut
   quatuor Evangelia)," [10] and no one has been found to question that in
   so saying he gave expression to the mind of the Church of his day.  Of
   the fifth and sixth synods there never was any real doubt, although
   there was trouble at first about the reception of the fifth in some
   places.  The ecumenical character of the seventh is not disputed by
   East or West and has not been for near a thousand years, and full proof
   of its ecumenicity will be found in connection with that council.
   There is therefore no possible doubt that these seven must be included,
   but it may be asked why certain others are not here also.

   The following is a list of those that might seem to have a claim:
   Sardica (343 circa), Quinisext (692), Constantinople (869), Lyons
   (1274), and Florence (1439).

   The reasons for rejecting the claims of Sardica will be found in
   connection with the canons set forth by that council.  The same is the
   case with regard to the claims of the Synod in Trullo.  It is true that
   IV. Constantinople, holden in a.d. 869, was for a short while held as
   Ecumenical by both East and West, and continues to be held as such by
   the Latin Church down to this day, but it was soon rejected by the East
   and another synod of Constantinople (879), which undid much of its
   work, has for the Greeks taken its place.  However the Easterns do not
   claim for this synod an ecumenical character, but confine the number to
   seven.

   The Councils of Lyons and Florence both fail of ecumenicity for the
   same reason.  At both the East was represented, and at each an
   agreement was arrived at, but neither agreement was subsequently
   accepted in the East, and the decrees therefore have failed, as yet, of
   receiving ecumenical acceptance.

   We are left therefore with Seven Ecumenical Councils, neither more nor
   less, and these are fully treated of in the pages that follow.

   Bibliographical Introduction.

   ------------------------

   To the student of the ancient synods of the Church of Christ, the name
   of William Beveridge must ever stand most illustrious; and his work on
   the canons of the undivided Church as received by the Greeks, published
   at Oxford in 1672, will remain a lasting glory to the Anglican Church,
   as the "Concilia" of Labbe and Cossart, which appeared in Paris about
   the same time, must ever redound to the glory of her sister, the
   Gallican Church.

   Of the permanent value of Beveridge's work there can be no greater
   evidence than that to-day it is quoted all the world over, and not only
   are Anglicans proud of the bishop of St. Asaph, but Catholics and
   Protestants, Westerns and Easterns alike quote him as an authority.  In
   illustration of this it will be sufficient to mention two examples, the
   most extensive and learned work on the councils of our own day, that by
   the Roman Catholic bishop Hefele, and the "Compendium of Canon Law," by
   the Metropolitan of the Orthodox Greek Hungarian Church, [11] in both
   of which the reader will find constant reference to Beveridge's
   "Synodicon."

   This great work appeared in two volumes full folio, with the Greek
   text, beautifully printed, but of course with the ligatures so
   perplexing to the ordinary Greek reader of to-day.  It should however
   be noted that the most learned and interesting Prolegomena in Sunodikon
   sive Pandectæ Canonum, as well as the Præfationem ad annotationes in
   Canones Apostolicos, is reprinted as an Appendix to Vol. XII. of "The
   Theological Works of William Beveridge, sometime lord bishop of St.
   Asaph," in the "Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology," (published at
   Oxford, 1848), which also contains a reprint of the "Codex Canonum
   Ecclesiæ Primitivæ vindicatus ac illustratus," of which last work I
   shall have something to say in connection with the Apostolical Canons
   in the Appendix to this volume.

   Nothing could exceed the value of the Prolegomena and it is greatly to
   be wished that this most unique preface were more read by students.  It
   contains a fund of out-of-the-way information which can be found
   nowhere else collected together, and while indeed later research has
   thrown some further light upon the subject, yet the main conclusions of
   Bishop Beveridge are still accepted by the learned with but few
   exceptions.  I have endeavoured, as far as possible to incorporate into
   this volume the most important part of the learned bishop's notes and
   observations, but the real student must consult the work itself.  The
   reader will be interested to know that the greatest English scholars of
   his day assisted Bishop Beveridge in his work, among whom was John
   Pearson, the defender of the Ignatian Epistles.

   I think I cannot do better than set out in full the contents of the
   Synodicon so that the student may know just what he will find in its
   pages:

   "Sunodikon sive Padectæ Canonum SS. Apostolorum, et Conciliorum ab
   Ecclesia Græca receptorum; necnon Canonicorum SS. Patrum Epistolarum:
   Unà cum Scholiis Antiquorum singulis eorum annexis, et scriptis aliis
   huc spectantibus; quorum plurima e Biblothecæ Bodleianæ aliarumque mss.
   codicibus nunc primum edita:  reliqua cum iisdem mss. summâ fide et
   diligentiâ collata.  Totum Opus in duos Tomos divisum, Guilielmus
   Beverigius, Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ Presbyter, Recensuit, Prolegomenis
   munivit, et Annotationibus auxit.  Oxonii, E Theatro Sheldoniano.
   M.DC.LXXII."

   Such is the title in full.  I proceed to note the contents, premising
   that for all the Greek a Latin translation is given in a parallel
   column:

   Volume I.

   The Canons of the Holy Apostles, with the Ancient Epitome, and the
   scholia of Balsamon, Zonaras and Aristenus.

   The Canons of the Seventh OEcumenical Council.

   The Canons of the Council of Constantinople called the First-and-Second
   [in the time of Photius].

   The Canons of the Council held in the Temple of Wisdom [which confirmed
   the Seventh OEcumenical Synod].  All these with notes as before.

   The Canons of the Council of Carthage [over which St. Cyprian, the
   Martyr, presided] with the notes of Balsamon and Zonaras.

   The Canons of the Council of Ancyra.

   Then, ending Volume I. is a version of Josephus Æyptius's Arabic
   Introduction and Paraphrase on the Canons of the first four General
   Councils, bearing the following title:

   Josephi Ægyptii Proæmia et Paraphrasis Arabica in Quatuor Preorum
   Generalium Conciliorum Canones, interprete Guilielmo Beverigio, the
   Arabic being given in the left hand column.

   most holy Patriarch to the See of Constantinople, and dissolved the
   scandal of the two Churches of Old and New Rome; [Styled by some the
   "Eighth OEcumenical Synod."] to which is added the Letter of the
   Blessed John Pope of Rome to the most holy Photius, Archbishop of
   Constantinople.

   An Index Rerum et Verborum of both volumes.

   Beveridge's own Notes on the Canons of the Councils.

   An Index Rerum et Verborum of the Notes.

   Such are the contents of Bishop Beveridge's great work, and it is
   impossible to exaggerate its value.  But it will be noticed that it
   only covers the disciplinary action of the Councils, and does not give
   the dogmatic decrees, these being excluded from the author's plan.

   Before leaving the collections of the canons we must mention the great
   work of Justellus (the Preface and notes of which are found reprinted
   in Migne's Pat. Lat., Tom. LXVII.); Canonum Ecclesiæ Universæ Gr. et
   Lat. cum Præfatione Notisque Christoph. Justelli.

   The author was counsellor and secretary to the King of France, was born
   in Paris 1580, and died in 1649.  After his death there appeared at
   Paris in 1661 a work in 2 volumes folio, with the following title:
   Bibliotheca juris canonici vetus...ex antiquis codicibus mss.
   Bibliothecæ Christopheri Justelli....Opera et studio Gul. Voelli et
   Henrici Justelli.

   The Church in Paris had the honour of having among its Cathedral clergy
   the first scholar who published a collection of the Acts of the
   councils.  James Merlin was Canon and Grand Penitentiary of the
   Metropolitan Church, and the first edition of his work he put out in
   1523 in one volume folio.  This work passed through several editions
   within a few years, but soon gave place to fuller collections. [14]

   In 1538, the Belgian Franciscan Peter Crabbe (Pierre Grable) issued at
   Cologne an enlarged collection in two volumes, and the second edition
   in 1551 was enlarged to three folio volumes.  Besides these, there was
   Lawrence Surius's still more complete collection, published in 1557 (4
   vols. folio), and the Venice collection compiled by Domenick Bollanus,
   O. P., and printed by Dominic Nicolini, 1585 (5 vols. folio).

   But the renowned collection of Professor Severin Binius surpassed all
   its predecessors, and its historical and critical notes are quoted with
   respect even to-day.  The first edition, in four volumes folio, was
   issued at Cologne in 1606, and later editions, better than the first,
   in 1618 and 1636.  This last edition was published at Paris in nine
   volumes, and made use of the Roman collection.

   To the learned Jesuit Sirmond belongs the chief glory of having
   compiled this Roman collection, and the "Introduction" is from his
   pen.  The work was undertaken by the authority of Pope Paul V., and
   much of the Greek text, copied from mss. in the Vatican Library, was
   now for the first time given to the reading public.  This collection
   contains only the Ecumenical Councils according to the Roman method of
   reckoning, and its compilation took from 1608 to 1612.

   No collection appeared from this date until the "Collectio Regia," a
   magnificent series of thirty-seven volumes folio, at the royal press at
   Paris in 1644.  But while it was superb in get up, it left much to be
   desired when looked at critically, for many faults of the Roman edition
   already pointed out by Sirmond were not corrected.

   And now we have reached the time when the first really great Concilia
   appeared, which while only filling seventeen volumes in folio was yet
   far more complete --Hefele says twenty-five per cent. more
   complete--than the great Collectio Regia just described.  This edition
   was the work of Philip Labbe (Labbeus in Latin), S. J., and was
   completed after his death in 1667, by Father Gabriel Cossart of the
   same Society--"Almost all the French savants quote from this edition of
   Labbe's with Baluze's supplement," [15] and I have followed their lead,
   availing myself of the corrections made by later editors.  The title of
   the edition used in this work is:  "Sacrasancta Concilia ad Regiam
   Editionem exacta.  Studio Philip. Labbei et Gabr. Cossartii, Soc. Jesu
   Presbyterorum.  Lutetiæ Parisiorum.  MDCLXXI.  Cum Privilegio Regis
   Christianissimi."

   Anything more perfect than these precious volumes it would be hard to
   conceive of, and while of course they contain the errors of chronology
   et cetera of their age, yet their general accuracy and marvellous
   completeness leave them even to-day as the greatest of the great,
   although the later edition of Hardouin is more often used by English
   and American scholars, and is the one quoted by Pope Benedict XIV. in
   his famous work De Synodo Diæcesana.  Hardouin's edition did certainly
   correct many of the faults of Labbe and Cossart, yet had itself many
   faults and defects which are pointed out by Salmon [16] in a long list,
   although he fully acknowledges the value of Hardouin's improvements and
   additions.  Perhaps, not unnaturally, as a Professor at the Sorbonne,
   he preferred Labbe and Cossart.  It may not be amiss to add that
   Hardouin was very anti-Gallican and ultramontane.

   The Dominican Archbishop of Lucca, Mansi, in 1759, put out his
   "Concilia" in thirty-one volumes folio at Florence, styled on the
   title-page "the most ample" edition ever printed, and claiming to
   contain all the old and much new matter.  It was never finished, only
   reaching to the XV^th century, has no indices, and (says Hefele) "is
   very inferior to Hardouin in accuracy.  The order of the subjects in
   the later volumes is sometimes not sufficiently methodical, and is at
   variance with the chronology." [17]

   I shall now present the reader with some bibliographical notes which I
   extract verbatim from Hefele (Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. I.,
   p. 74).

   Among the numerous works on the history of the councils, the most
   useful to consult are:

   1.  John Cabassutius, Notitia ecclesiastica historiarum conciliorum et
   canonum.  Lyons 1680, folio.  Very often reprinted.

   2.  Hermant, Histoire des Conciles, Rouen 1730, four volumes, 8vo.

   3.  Labbe, Synopsis historica Conciliorum, in vol. i. of his Collection
   of Councils.

   4.  Edm. Richer, Historia conciliorum generalium (Paris, 1680), three
   volumes, 4to.  Reprinted in 8vo. at Cologne.

   5.  Charles Ludovic Richard, Analysis conciliorum generalium et
   particularium.  Translated from French into Latin by Dalmasus.  Four
   volumes, 8vo, Augsburg, 1778.

   6.  Christ. Wilh. Franz Walch, Entwurf einer vollständigen Historie der
   Kirchenversammlungen, Leipzig, 1759.

   7.  Fabricius, Bibliotheca Græca, edit. Harless. t. xii., p. 422 sqq.,
   in which is contained an alphabetical table of all the councils, and an
   estimate of the value of the principal collections.

   8.  Alletz, Concilien-Lexikon, translated from French into German by
   Father Maurus Disch, a Benedictine and professor at Augsburg, 1843.

   9.  Dictionnaire universel et complet des Conciles, tant généraux que
   particuliers, etc., rédigé par M. l'abbé P----, prêtre du Diocese de
   Paris, published by the Abbé Migne (Paris, 1846), two volumes, 4to.

   In the great works on ecclesiastical history--for example, in the
   Nouvelle Bibliothèque des Auteurs Ecclesiastiques, by El. Dupin, and
   the Historia Literaria of Cave, and particularly in the excellent
   Histoire des Auteurs Sacrés, by Remi Ceillier--we find matter relating
   to the history of the councils.  Salmon, l. c., p. 387, and Walch in
   his Historie der Kirchenversammlungen, pp. 48-67, have pointed out a
   large number of works on the history of the councils.  There are also
   very valuable dissertations on the same subject in--

   1.  Christian Lupus, Synodorum generalium ac provincialium decreta et
   canones, scholiis, notis ac historica actorum dissertatione illustrata,
   Louv., 1665; Brussels, 1673; five volumes, 4to.

   2.  Lud. Thomassin, Dissertationum in Concilia generalia et
   particularia, t. i., Paris, 1667; reprinted in Rocaberti, Bibl.
   pontificia, tr. XV.

   3.  Van Espen, Tractatus Historicus exhibens scholia in omnes canones
   conciliorum, etc., in his complete works.

   4.  Barth. Caranza has written a very complete and useful abstract of
   the acts of the councils in his Summa Conciliorum, which has often been
   re-edited.

   5.  George Daniel Fuchs, deacon of Stuttgart, has, in his Bibliothek
   der Kirchenversammlungen, four volumes, Leipsic, 1780-1784, given
   German translations and abstracts of the acts of the councils in the
   fourth and fifth centuries.

   6.  Francis Salmon, Doctor and Librarian of the Sorbonne, has published
   an Introduction to the Study of the Councils, in his Traité de l'Étude
   des Conciles et de leurs collections, Paris, 1724, in 4to, which has
   often been reprinted.

   To these I would add the following:

   1.  Fleury, Histoire Ecclesiastique.  This work in many volumes, part
   of which has been translated into English, is most useful and accurate,
   and contains a resumé of the separate canons and definitions as well as
   the history of the proceedings.

   2.  Denziger, Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum quæ de rebus fidei
   et morum a Conciliis OEcumenicis et Summis Pontificibus emanarunt.  A
   most useful handbook in the original.

   3.  Hefele, Conciliengeschicte.  This, the most recent work upon the
   subject, is also in some respects the most satisfactory, and it is a
   matter of real regret that only the first part of the work, down to the
   end of the Seventh OEcumenical Council, has been translated into
   English.  The last volume of the author's revised edition appeared in
   1890.  The first volume of the first edition was published in 1855, and
   the seventh and last in 1874.  The entire book was translated into
   French some years ago (with full indices) by M. l'abbé Goschlerand and
   M. l'abbé Delarc (Paris, Adrien le Clere et Cie).  It should in
   fairness, however, be remarked that Bishop Hefele was one of the
   minority who opposed the opportuneness of the definition of Papal
   infallibility at the Vatican Council, and while indeed afterwards he
   submitted to the final decree, yet he has been a somewhat suspected
   person since to those who held extreme views on this doctrine.

   So far as I am aware no serious work has been done upon the councils by
   any writer using the English tongue in recent times, with the exception
   of the useful Notes on the Canons of the First Four General Councils,
   by Canon Wm. Bright.

   The following is a list of the English translations which I have
   consulted or followed:

   John Johnson, The Clergyman's Vade-mecum (London, 2d Ed., 1714).

   Wm. A. Hammond, The Definitions of Faith and Canons of Discipline of
   the Six OEcumenical Councils, etc.

   William Lambert, The Canons of the First Four General Councils of the
   Church and those of the Early Greek Synods (London, s.d. Preface dated
   1868).

   John Fulton, Index Canonum.  [This work ends with the Council of
   Chalcedon.]  (New York, 1872.  3d Ed., 1892.)

   John Mendham, The Seventh General Council, the Second of Nice (London,
   s. d.).

   H. R. Percival, The Decrees of the Seven Ecumenical Synods.  Appendix
   I. to A Digest of Theology (London, Masters, 1893).

   It only remains that I mention two other works.

   Dr. Pusey's book, The Councils of the Church from the Council of
   Jerusalem a.d. 51 to the Council of Constantinople, 381 (1857) should
   not be omitted, and certainly the reader's attention should be called
   to that most accurate and valuable volume by Herm. Theod. Bruns,
   Canones Apostolorum et Conciliorum Veterum Selecti (Berolini, 1839),
   which has been constantly referred to in preparing this work.

   Appended Note on the Eastern Editions of Synodical Literature.

   ------------------------

   From the presses of the East, especially those at Athens, a number of
   editions more or less complete of the Greek text of the Canons of the
   Ecumenical and of the Local Councils have been issued, and the notes of
   Balsamon, Zonaras, and Aristenus have been added in some cases.
   Professor Bolotoff writes however that so far as Greek literature on
   the subject is concerned, with the exception of purely topographical
   researches in the environs of Constantinople, it is simply putting into
   Greek what was originally in German.

   The Russian Church has done somewhat more and as will be seen from the
   following table, some attempts have been made at providing scholia, but
   when the scheme of this present work was shewn him, Professor Bolotoff
   said:  "We have nothing analogous to this undertaking in Russia."  The
   learned professor remarks that all the best Russian literature upon the
   subject is contained in magazine articles, especially those of
   Professor Zaozersky of the Moscow Theological Academy, and of Professor
   A. S. Pavloff, of the University of Moscow; he mentions also the
   latter's article in the Orthodox Review, and adds that "An Essay on a
   Course of Church Legislation," by Joann Smolensk (St. Petersburg, 1851)
   should be referred to.

   A Bibliographical Index of the Printed Editions of the Canons of the
   Apostles and of the Councils in the Slavonic and Russian Languages.

   (Prepared by Nicolas Glubokoffski, Professor of the Chair of the Holy
   Scriptures of the New Testament in the Ecclesiastical Academy of St.
   Petersburgh.) [21]

   In the orthodox Russian Church, editions of the Conciliar Canons and
   Decrees have only been issued under the immediate disposition and
   sanction of the supreme ecclesiastical authority, and, in fact, are
   amongst those things which it is not within the competence of private
   scholars to undertake.  Such editions therefore have been published in
   Russia only in accordance with practical requirements.

   1.  The earliest printed edition of the afore-mentioned canons appeared
   in the Slavonic "Kormchaja Kniga" [22] (=Gk. pedalion), the printing of
   which was commenced at Moscow, on October 7th, 1649, under the
   Patriarch Joseph of Moscow, and was finished on July 1, 1650; but the
   Patriarch Nicon caused it to be submitted to a Council for revision, in
   consequence of which certain pages were reprinted and inserted afresh
   into it. [23]   Thereupon copies of this "Kormchaja" were distributed
   for use amongst the churches, and came into general circulation not
   earlier than the year 1653.  The second edition of the "Kormchaja"
   appeared in 1787, after a revision under the Metropolitan Gabriel of
   Novgorod and St. Petersburgh, [24] and was followed by others (e.g.,
   those of 1804, 1816, and 1823) without any alterations of importance.
   The latest editions differ from that of Nicon in certain particulars,
   but these particulars do not concern the ecclesiastical Canons, which
   are placed in the first part of the "Kormchaja" and include the 85
   Apostolic Canons, the decrees of the sixteen councils (of Nicæa,
   Ancyra, Neocæsarea, Gangra, Antioch, Laodicea, the 2d, 3d, and 4th
   Ecumenical, Sardica, Carthage, Constantinople under Nectarius, in
   Trullo, a.d. 692, the 7th Ecumenical, the First-and-Second [council of
   Constantinople] and that in the church of St. Sophia) and the Canons of
   the 13 Holy Fathers.

   2.  In the printed "Kormchaja" the canons are set forth, not in their
   full text, but in a shortened form which sometimes gives but a very
   insufficient representation of the contents of the original.  On this
   account attempts at full translations were made many years back, but
   these never appeared in print.  It was not until 1839 that such an
   edition as this was put forth by the Holy Synod at St. Petersburgh,
   under the title:  "The Book of the Canons of the Holy Apostles, of the
   Holy Ecumenical and local Councils, and of the Holy Fathers," printed
   in large folio in "the Imperial city of St. Peter, the first impression
   in the 7347th year from the creation of the world, and the 1839th from
   the Birth in the flesh of God the Word, indict. 12."  In this edition
   there are 4 unnumbered leaves and 455 numbered pages.  On each page
   there are two columns, for the original text and the new translation of
   the whole text into the Slavonic respectively, but without the
   commentaries of the Byzantine Canonists; occasionally, but rarely,
   notes based upon Zonaras or Balsamon are given, which are not always
   historically accurate (for instance, that to the 10th Canon of Ancyra,
   the 3d of Sardica, the 4th of Carthage, and the one which deals with
   the First-and-Second Council of a.d. 861) while in some places the text
   itself is not correct (for instance, in the 13th Canon of the 1st
   Ecumenical Council).  This "Book of the Canons" subsequently went
   through the following editions:  the 2d, printed in Moscow at the
   Synodal Press in 1862, in folio 8 leaves + 672 + 74 numbered pages,
   with Greek and Slavonic texts; the 3d ibid. in 1866, in quarto, 3
   leaves + 373 pages + 1 leaf + 59 pages, with the Slavonic text only;
   the 4th, ibid. in 1874, in octavo, 4 leaves 4 + 455 pages + 2 leaves +
   104 + 4 pages, also with the Slavonic text only; the 5th, ibid. in
   1886, in folio, 3 leaves + 395 + 42 pages + 1 leaf, again with Slavonic
   text only.

   3.  The "Book of Canons" by no means represents an authorized textus
   receptus, and after its publication, the Holy Synod itself not
   unfrequently introduced the Canons as given in the Slavonic edition of
   the "Kormchaja Kniga" into its edicts, and moreover recommended the
   Athenian Edition of the "Syntagma" for all the
   ecclesiastico-educational establishments.  This opened the way for a
   new work, which, with the permission of the supreme ecclesiastical
   authority, was undertaken by the Moscow "Society of Amateurs of
   Spiritual Enlightenment."  The announcement of this was made in No. 3
   of the "Moscow Diocesan Church Gazette" of the year 1875, whilst in the
   same year in the January number of the Moscow Journal, "Lectures
   delivered in the Society of Amateurs of Spiritual Enlightenment," the
   "programe" of the edition itself was printed (pages 79-90 in the
   section devoted to bibliography).  In criticism of it the Professor of
   Canonical Law in the University of Novorossiisk, Alexis Stepanovich
   Pavloff (who died on August 16, 1898, as Professor of the University of
   Moscow) wrote "Notes on the programme of an edition, in a Russian
   translation of the Canons of the Church with Commentaries" in the
   sixteenth volume of "Memoirs of the Imperial University of
   Novorossiisk" (Odessa, 1875), pages 1-17 of the Appendix (and in a
   separate pamphlet), which was afterwards reprinted with certain
   additions in the Moscow Journal, "Orthodox Review," of April, 1876
   (pages 730-746), under the title:  "A new translation of the
   Commentaries upon the canons of the church."  To these criticisms the
   Professor of Ecclesiastical Law in the Moscow Ecclesiastical Academy,
   Alexander Theodorovich Lavroff, wrote a reply in "Lectures delivered in
   the Society of Amateurs of Spiritual Enlightenment" (for the year 1877,
   part 2, pages 158-194), entitled "A printed letter to Alexis
   Stepanovich Pavloff."  Thus the plan of the edition gradually took
   shape.  It was first printed in the Appendices to the Journal "Lectures
   in the Society, etc.," and subsequently was published separately in
   octavo in the following parts (A) I. "The Canons of the Holy Apostles
   with Commentaries" in two editions--Moscow, 1876, (from "Lectures,"
   1875, pages 1-163) 4 + 12 + 175 pages, and ibid., 1887, 5-12 + 163
   pages; II. "Canons of the Holy Ecumenical Councils with Commentaries"
   (from "Lectures" 1875, pages 165-325; 1876, pages 329-680; 1877, pages
   891-900), in two parts:  1st "The Canons of the Councils I.-IV.,"
   Moscow, 1877, 260 pages; 2d. "The Canons of Councils V.-VII.," ibid.,
   736 pages; (B) "The Canons of the Holy Local Councils with
   Commentaries," also in two parts (from "Lectures" 1877, pages 900-1066;
   1878, pages 1067-1306; 1879, pages 1307-1410):  the 1st (The Canons of
   the Councils of Ancyra, Neocæsarea, Gangra, Antioch, Laodicea, and
   Sardica) Moscow, 1880, 359 pages; the 2d (The Canons of the Councils of
   Carthage [with the letters to Pope Boniface and to Pope Celestine],
   Constantinople, the First-and-Second, and that in the Temple of the
   Wisdom of the Word of God) ibid., 1881, 876 pages; (C) "The Canons of
   the Holy Fathers with Commentaries," ibid., 1884, 626 pages.  Together
   with these is a separate "Index of subjects contained in the edition of
   the Canons of the Apostles, Councils and Holy Fathers with
   Commentaries," Moscow, 1888, 58 pages in octavo.  The Greek text of the
   canons follows the edition Suntagma ton theion kai ieron kanonon...hupo
   G. A. Ralle kai M. Potle, Athenesin 1852-1854, and alongside of it is
   placed a literal Slavonic translation, after which follows a Russian
   translation of the Commentaries of the Byzantine Canonists (Zonaras,
   Aristenus, Balsamon), and the text and commentaries of the Slavonic
   "Kormchaja;" all this is accompanied by introductions and explanations
   of all sorts (historical, philological, etc.).  This edition is rightly
   considered by specialists to be of very great value from a scientific
   point of view.  Professor A. Th. Lavroff (who became a monk under the
   name Alexis, and died Archbishop of Lithuania and Vilna) was its chief
   editor and had most to do with it, but many others took part in the
   work, and amongst these Professor A. S. Pavloff.

   4.  The only Russian translation of the canons which exists is
   contained in the publications of the Ecclesiastical Academy of Kazan:
   (a) "The Acts of the Ecumenical Councils translated into Russian," 7
   volumes.  Kazan, 1859-1878 (some of these volumes have run into a
   second edition) and (b) "Acts of the nine local councils translated
   into Russian," 1 volume, Kazan, 1878.  This translation was made under
   the direction of the Holy Synod, and the Canons are reproduced in it
   according to the text of the Acts of the Councils.

   From the outline here presented of the printed editions of the Canons
   of the Councils, it will be seen that, within the limits of their
   practical applicability, they are reverenced as the source of the
   operative law in the Russian orthodox church, and therefore for her it
   is only the authoritative Byzantine commentaries which have any
   particular importance.  There are works upon these by V. Demidoff, "The
   character and significance of the commentaries upon the Canonical Codex
   of the Greek Church--of Aristenus, Zonaras, and Balsamon," in the
   "Orthodox Review," vol. ii. of 1888, and of Professor V. A. Narbekoff,
   of Kazan, "The commentaries of Balsamon upon the Nomocanon of Photius,"
   Kazan, 1889, and of Professor M. E. Krasnozhen, of Jurieff (Dorpat)
   "The Commentators of the Canonical Codex of the Eastern Church:
   Aristenus, Zonaras, and Balsamon."  Moscow, 1892.

   No separate scientific commentaries upon all the canons of the councils
   exist in Russian literature, but they are described, and explained in
   courses of Ecclesiastical law (of the Archimandrite John [who, when he
   died, was Bishop of Smolensk] of Professors N. S. Suvoroff, T. S.
   Berdnikoff, N. A. Lashkareff, M. A. Ostroümoff) in our works upon the
   history of the Ecumenical Councils (by Bishop John, and Professor
   Alexis Petrovich Lebedeff), and in monographs dealing with Canon Law
   and Church History.  As far as a critical edition of the original text
   of the canons is concerned, there is a learned and useful article (upon
   a book by Fr. Lauchert, Die Kanones usw., Freiberg i. Br. und Leipsig,
   1896), by Vasili Vasilievich Bolotoff, Professor of Ecclesiastical
   History in the St. Petersburgh Ecclesiastical Academy in the "Christian
   Reading," vol. iv. for 1896, pp. 178-195.

   Excursus on the History of the Roman Law and Its Relation to the Canon
   Law.

   ------------------------

   The foregoing bibliographical outline would be entirely incomplete did
   I not give the reader at least a sketch of how those canons adopted by
   the various councils gradually won admission to the law-code of the
   Empire, and how that code itself came into being.  For those wishing to
   study the matter in detail I would name as the most recent authorities
   upon the Roman Law, Mr. Muirhead, who has published with additions and
   notes his article on the subject in the "Encyclopædia Britannica," and
   Mr. Bury's new edition of Gibbon's Rome just being issued with most
   learned notes.

   But neither of these writers has put the matter exactly as I desire for
   this purpose, and I have therefore been forced to seek elsewhere the
   information I now lay before the reader.

   The study of Jurisprudence did not form a separate department among the
   ancient Greeks, but among the Romans it was quite otherwise, and a very
   elaborate system was developed, so elaborate as to demand the care of a
   special class of men, who devoted themselves to this business alone and
   handed down to their successors a constantly increasing mass of legal
   matter.

   When Greece fell under the Roman yoke the laws of the victor were
   imposed upon the vanquished, but even then the Greeks did not take to
   legal studies.  In fact not until the seat of the Empire was removed to
   Constantinople did the East become a centre of jurisprudence or the
   residence of the chief legal experts.  In the whole period before the
   fourth century of our era we know of but one barrister who wrote in
   Greek, and he came from the West, Herennius Modestinus.  He was a
   disciple of Ulpian and preceptor to the Emperor Maximian the Younger.

   From the time of Hadrian to that of Alexander Severus the influence of
   the legal schools of Rome had been paramount.  The Emperors consulted
   them and asked them to decide difficult points.  But after the death of
   Alexander this custom fell into entire disuse, and the Emperors
   themselves decided the matters formerly entrusted to the lawyers.
   After this time the Imperial Constitutions became the chief sources of
   Roman law.  It is only in the time of Constantine the Great that we
   find once again the lawyers rising into prominence and a flourishing
   school at Beyroot in Syria.  It was at this time that the Imperial
   Constitutions or Edicts were first collected, for until then they
   existed only in detached documents.  This collection was made by two
   lawyers, Gregory or Gregorian, and Hermogenes.  Gregory's collection
   contains the laws set forth from the time of Hadrian to Constantine,
   and Hermogenes wrote a supplement.  Although this was but a private
   enterprise, yet it was cited in the courts of law, just as Lord
   Lyndwood's Provinciale is with us to-day.

   It is interesting to note that it was about this same time that the
   first attempt was made to collect the ecclesiastical canons, and so the
   Civil Law and the Canon Law (as we know them in after times) had their
   rise about the same period.

   The law of the Empire was not, however, to be left to private and
   unofficial action, but by the care of Theodosius the Younger its first
   official collection was made.  This prince directed eight men learned
   in the law to gather into one body of laws all the Imperial
   Constitutions published since the last included in the collections of
   Gregory and Hermogenes.  This is the "Theodosian Code," and contains
   the laws set forth by Constantine and his successors.  It was
   promulgated in 438 in the East, and received by the then Emperor of the
   West, Valentinian III.  To this were subsequently added such laws as
   each set forth, under the title of "New Constitutions."

   The Emperor Justinian determined still further to simplify the
   attaining of judicial decisions.  It is true that the making of the
   legal collections referred to had added greatly to the ease of
   determining the law in any given case, but there was a source of great
   confusion in the endless number of legal decisions which by custom had
   acquired the force of law, and which were by no means always consistent
   between themselves; these were the famous responsa jurisperitorum.  To
   clear up this difficulty was no small task, but the Emperor went about
   it in the most determined fashion and appointed a commission,
   consisting of Tribonian and ten other experts, to make a new collection
   of all the imperial constitutions from Hadrian to his own day.  This is
   the famous Justinian Code, which was promulgated in 529, and abrogated
   all previous collections. [25]

   This, however, was not sufficient to remove the difficulty, and
   Tribonian next, together with sixteen lawyers, spent three years in
   making extracts from the great mass of decisions of the ancient
   jurists, filling as they did nearly two thousand volumes.  These they
   digested and did their best to clear away the contradictions.  When the
   work was finished it appeared to the world as the "Pandects," because
   it was intended to contain all there was to be said upon the subject.
   It is also known as the "Digest."  This work was set forth in 533 and
   from that time such of the former decisions as were not incorporated
   ceased to have any force.

   It must however be remembered that, while this was the case, all the
   decisions contained in the Pandects did not obtain the force of law.
   The Pandects are not a code of laws, but a system of public
   jurisprudence composed by public authority.  To the Pandects were added
   by the Emperor two ordinances, the first to forbid any copyist to write
   them in an abbreviated form; and the second forbidding commentators to
   treat them in anything but their literal sense.

   While this work was in progress some points were so complicated and
   obscure that the Emperor had to be appealed to, and his writings in
   these particulars are the origin of the "Fifty Decisions."

   At the same time was prepared the "Institutes," containing the elements
   of the whole Roman law. [26]

   Later, new laws having been made, the Code had to be revised; the
   former edition was abrogated in 534, and a new one set forth with the
   title "Codex repetitæ prælectionis."

   The last of Justinian's labours in the field of jurisprudence (if
   indeed they were not collected after his death) are his "Novels," a
   series of imperial constitutions issued between 535 and 559 (Nearai
   Diataxeis).  There are one hundred and sixty-eight of these Novels, but
   the ancient glosses only know ninety-seven, and the rest have been
   added since, as they have been found.

   Such is the origin of the Corpus Juris Civilis, and its history needed
   to be set forth in this place on account of its close connection with
   the Corpus Juris Canonici.  In the foregoing I have followed M. Schoell
   in his admirable Histoire de la Littérature Grecque Profane, to which I
   am also chiefly indebted for the following notes upon the jurists of
   the sixth and ensuing centuries.

   A work which is often looked upon as the origin of the Canon Law was
   composed by a lawyer of Antioch, somewhere near the middle of the sixth
   century.  This jurist was John of Antioch, surnamed Scholasticus.  He
   was representative or apocrisiarius of the Church of Antioch at
   Constantinople, and afterward was made Patriarch of that see, over
   which he ruled from 564 until his death in 578.  While still a simple
   priest at Antioch he made his Collection of the Canons of the Councils.

   "He was not the first who conceived the idea of such a work.  Some
   writers, resting upon a passage in Socrates, have been of opinion that
   this honour belonged to Sabinus, bishop of Heraclea, in Thrace, at the
   beginning of the fifth century; but Socrates is not speaking of a
   collection of canons at all, but of the synodal acts, of the letters
   written by or addressed to the synods.  If, however, Sabinus did not
   make a collection of canons, it is certain nevertheless that before
   John of Antioch there existed one, for he himself cites it many times,
   although he does not name the authors." [27]

   "In gathering together thus the canons of the councils John of Antioch
   did not form a complete body of ecclesiastical law.  By his Novel
   CXLI., Justinian had indeed given to the canons of the Church the force
   of law, but he himself published a great number of constitutions upon
   Church matters.  Now it was necessary to harmonize these constitutions
   and canons, and to accomplish this feat was the object of a second work
   undertaken by John of Antioch, to which he gave the title of Nomocanon
   (Nomokanon ), [28] a word which from that time has served to designate
   any collection of this sort." [29]

   Bury says, "In the troubles of the VII^th century the study of law,
   like many other things, declined, and in the practical administration
   of justice the prescriptions of the Code and Digest were often ignored
   or modified by the alien precepts of Christianity.  The religion of the
   Empire had exerted but very slight influence--no fundamental influence,
   we may say--on the Justinian law.  Leo III., the founder of the Syrian
   (vulgarly called Isaurian) dynasty, when he restored the Empire after a
   generation of anarchy, saw the necessity of legislation to meet the
   changed circumstances of the time.  The settlements of
   foreigners--Slavs and Mardaites--in the provinces of the Empire created
   an agrarian question, which he dealt with in his Agrarian Code.  The
   increase of Slavonic and Saracenic piracy demanded increased securities
   for maritime trade, and this was dealt with in a Navigation Code.  But
   it was not only for special relations that Leo made laws; he legislated
   also, and in an entirely new way, for the general relations of life.
   He issued a law book (in a.d. 740 in the name of himself and his son
   Constantine), which changed and modified the Roman law, as it had been
   fixed by Justinian.  The Ecloga, [30] as it is called, may be described
   as a Christian law book.  It is a deliberate attempt to change the
   legal system of the Empire by an application of Christian principles.
   Examples, to illustrate its tendency, will be given below.  The horror
   in which the iconoclasts were held on account of their heresy by the
   image-worshippers, cast discredit upon all their works.  This feeling
   had something to do with the great reaction, which was inaugurated by
   Basil I., against their legal reforms.  The Christian Code of Leo
   prevailed in the empire for less than a century and a half; and then,
   under the auspices of Basil, the Roman law of Justinian was (partially)
   restored.  In legal activity the Basilian epoch faintly reflected the
   epoch of Justinian itself.  A handbook of extracts from the Institutes,
   Digest, Code, and Novels, was published in a.d. 879, entitled the
   Prochiron, to diffuse a knowledge of the forgotten system.  But the
   great achievement of the Basilian epoch is the Basilica'--begun under
   Basil, completed under Leo VI.--a huge collection of all the laws of
   the Empire, not only those still valid, but those which had become
   obsolete.  It seems that two commissions of experts were appointed to
   prepare the material for this work.  One of these commissions compiled
   the Prochiron by the way, and planned out the Basilica in sixty Books.
   The other commission also prepared a handbook called the Epanagoge,
   which was never actually published (though a sketch of the work is
   extant), and planned out the Basilica in forty Books.  The Basilica, as
   actually published, are arranged in sixty Books, compiled from the
   materials prepared by both commissions.

   "The Basilian revival of Justinianean law was permanent; and it is
   outside our purpose to follow the history further, except to note the
   importance of the foundation of a school of law at Constantinople in
   the 11th century by the Emperor Constantine IX.  The law enacting the
   institution of this school, under the direction of a salaried
   Nomophylax, is extant.  John Xiphilin (see above) was the first
   director.  This foundation may have possibly had some influence on the
   institution of the school at Bologna half a century later." [31]

   I take from Schoell the following description of the "Basilica":

   "The Basilica' are a body of Roman law in the Greek language, extracted
   from the Institutes, the Pandects, the Codes and the Novels of
   Justinian as well as from the Imperial Constitutions posterior to that
   prince; also extracts from the interpretations of such jurists as had
   won a fixed authority in the courts, and the canons of the councils.
   Here is found together the civil and the ecclesiastical law of the
   Greeks, these two laws having been in an intimate union by reason of
   the authority which the Emperors exercised over the Church; on the
   other hand, in the West there was formed step by step a canon law
   separate from the civil law, and having a different source." [32]

   Such, then, were the "Basilica," but what is most singular is that this
   collection was not given the force of law, neither by Leo VI. nor by
   Constantine VI., although it was prepared at their order, under their
   authority, and was written in the language which was spoken by their
   subjects.  The Justinian code of law, although in Latin, still
   continued to be the only authority in the entire East.  An anonymous
   writer prepared an Epitome of the Basilica, digested into Alphabetical
   order, and beginning with "Of the Orthodox faith of Christians."

   In 883 Photius published a "Syntagma canonum" and a "Nomocanon" with
   the title Prokanon, because it was placed before the canons.  This last
   work at the command of Constantine VI. was revised and soon took the
   place of the Nomocanon of John of Antioch, over which work it had the
   advantage of being more recent and of being digested in better order.
   In citing the canons, only the titles are given; but the text of the
   civil laws appears in full.  "As in the Eastern Church the influence of
   the imperial authority increased at the expense of that of the
   councils, and as these princes made ecclesiastical affairs a principal
   part of their government, it came to pass that the Nomocanon of Photius
   became of more frequent and more necessary use than his Syntagma,
   [which contained the actual text of the canons of the councils down to
   880].  Many commentators busied themselves with it, while the
   collection of the councils was neglected.  Thus it has happened that
   the Nomocanon has become the true foundation of the ecclesiastical law
   of the East." [33]

   But while this is true, yet there were not lacking commentators upon
   the Canon law, and of the three chiefest of these some notice must be
   taken in this place.  As I have already pointed out it is to Bishop
   Beveridge that we owe the publication not only of Photius's Collection
   of Canons which are found in his "Sunodikon sive Pandectæ," but also of
   the scholia of all three of these great commentators, Zonaras,
   Aristenus, and Balsamon, and from his most learned Prolegomena to the
   same work I have chiefly drawn the following facts, referring the
   curious reader to the introduction [34] itself for further particulars.

   John Zonaras was probably the same person who wrote the Byzantine
   History which bears his name.  He flourished under Alexis Comnenus, and
   enjoyed the high office of Grand Drungarius Viglæ (Droungarios tes
   Bigles) and Chief of the Clerks.  After some years of secular life he
   retired to a monastery and devoted himself to literary pursuits.  While
   here, at the command of his superiors, and moved by the persuasion of
   his friends, he wrote that great book which has made his fame, which he
   entitled "An Exposition of the Sacred and Divine Canons, as well those
   of the holy and venerable Apostles, as also those of the sacred
   OEcumenical Synods, and those of the local or particular councils, and
   those of the rest of the Holy Fathers; by the labour of John Zonaras
   the monk, who was formerly Grand Drungarius Viglæ and Chief of the
   Clerks." [35]

   One of the greatest peculiarities of this work, and one which
   distinguishes it very markedly from the later work of Balsamon upon the
   same subject, is that Zonaras confines himself strictly to the canon
   law and rarely makes any references to the civil law whatever; and in
   such canons as bear no relation to the civil law Balsamon often adopts
   Zonaras's notes without change or addition.

   These commentaries were first brought to light by John Quintin, a
   professor of canon law at Paris, who published a Latin translation of
   the scholia upon the Apostolic Canons.  This was in 1558.  In 1618
   Antonius Salmatia edited his commentaries on the canons of the Councils
   done into Latin.  To this Latin version the Paris press added the Greek
   text from the ms. codex in the Royal Library and printed it in 1618.
   In 1622 the same press issued his commentaries upon the Epistles of the
   Holy Fathers, together with those of St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, Macarius
   of Egypt, and Basil.  But Beveridge collected them in his Oxford
   Edition for the first time into one work; preparing a somewhat critical
   text by collation with some manuscripts he found at home.

   The second of these great Greek scholiasts is Alexis Aristenus.  As
   Beveridge points out, he must have flourished before or at the same
   time as Balsamon, for this latter speaks of him in high terms of
   commendation in his scholion on the Sixth of the Apostolic Canons,
   describing him as ton hupertimon.  Aristenus was Nomophylax,
   Orphanotrophe and Protecdekas, or chief of the Syndics of the Communes,
   called Ecdics (Ekdikoi).  He wrote the excellent series of notes upon
   the Epitomes of the Canons which are given the reader in Beveridge's
   Pradects.  Schoell says that it is an error to attribute to him the
   "Extract of the Ancient Ecclesiastical Laws," "which is none of his."
   [36]   Aristenus was Grand Economus of the Church of Constantinople and
   a man of great distinction; and his opinion was sought after and his
   decision followed even when in opposition to one of the Patriarchs,
   viz.:  Nicephorus of Jerusalem.

   Beveridge was the first to print Aristenus's Scholia, and he did so
   from four mss., in England, for a description of which I refer the
   reader to the bishop's prolegomena. [37]

   Theodore Balsamon is the last of the three great Greek scholiasts.  He
   flourished in the time of the Emperor Isaac Angelus and bore the title
   of Patriarch of Antioch, although at that time the city was in the
   hands of the Latins and had been so since 1100.  He was looked upon as
   the greatest jurist of his times both in ecclesiastical and civil
   matters.  Somewhere about the year 1150, he wrote by the order of
   Manuel Comnenus a series of "Scholia upon the Nomocanon of Photius,"
   and another set styled "Scholia upon the Canons of the Apostles, of the
   Councils and of the Fathers of the Church;" he also prepared a
   "Collection of [imperial] Constitutions upon ecclesiastical matters,"
   [38] in three books, which has been published (by Loewenklaw) at
   Frankfort, 1595, under the title "Paratitles."  There remains also a
   great number of his opinions on cases presented to him, notably his
   "answers to sixty-four canonical questions by Mark, Patriarch of
   Alexandria."

   These most learned writings were unknown and forgotten, at least in the
   West, until they were set forth in a Latin translation during the time
   the Council of Trent was sitting, in 1561, and not till 1620 did the
   Greek text appear in the Paris edition of that date.  But this text was
   imperfect and corrupt, and Beveridge produced a pure text from an
   Oxford ms., with which he compared several others.  Moreover in his
   Pandects he amended the Latin text as well in numberless particulars.
   For further, particulars of the bibliography of the matter see
   Beveridge. [39]

   It may not be amiss to add that abundant proof of the high esteem in
   which Balsamon was held is found in contemporary authors, and no words
   can give an exaggerated idea of the weight of his opinion on all legal
   matters, religious and profane; his works were undertaken at the
   command of the Emperor and of the Patriarch, and were received with an
   unmixed admiration. [40]

   In the thirteenth century a certain Chumnus who had been Nomophylax and
   was afterwards elevated to the Archiepiscopal chair of Thessalonica
   wrote a little book on the "Degrees of Relationship." [41]

   In the fourteenth century we find Matthew Blastares writing "An
   Alphabetical Table" [42] of the contents of the canons of the councils,
   and of the laws of the Emperors.

   And in the same century we find Constantine Harmenopulus, who was born
   in 1320.  He was, when thirty years of age, a member of the first court
   of civil justice (Judex Dromi).  Subsequently he was appointed
   Counsellor of the Emperor, John Cantacuzene, and finally Sebastos and
   Curopalatos under John Paleologus.  In the year 1345 he published a
   "Manual of Jurisprudence." [43]   This work is of great value to the
   student of Roman law as he completes the work of the Emperor Basil by
   adding the imperial constitutions since that time.  But our chief
   concern with him is as the author of an "Epitome of the Divine and
   Sacred Canons." [44]

   Constantine Harmenopulus was the last Greek jurist, and then
   Constantinople fell, to the everlasting disgrace of a divided
   Christendom, into the hands of the Infidel, and the law of the false
   Prophet supplanted the Roman Law, the Code of Civilization and
   Christianity.

   I pass now to the history of the growth of the canon law in the West.
   No one reading even cursorily the canons contained in the present
   volume can fail to notice that, with the exception of those of the
   African code, they are primarily intended for the government of the
   East and of persons more immediately under the shadow of the imperial
   city.  In fact in the canons of the Council in Trullo and in those of
   the Seventh Synod there are places which not even covertly are attacks,
   or at least reflections, upon the Western customs of the time.  And it
   does not seem to be an unjust view of the matter to detect in the
   Council of Chalcedon and its canon on the position of the See of Rome,
   a beginning of that unhappy spirit which found its full expression in
   that most lamentable breaking off of communion between East and West.

   While, then, as I have pointed out, in the East the Canon Law was
   developed and digested side by side and in consonance with the civil
   law, in the West the state of things was wholly different, and while in
   secular matters the secular power was supposed to be supreme, there
   grew up a great body of Ecclesiastical Law, often at variance with the
   secular decrees upon the subject.  To trace this, step by step, is no
   part of my duty in this excursus, and I shall only give so brief an
   outline that the reader may be able to understand the references in the
   notes which accompany the Canons in the text.

   Somewhere about the year 500 Dionysius Exiguus, who was Abbot of a
   Monastery in Rome, translated a collection of Greek Canons into Latin
   for Bishop Stephen of Salona.  At the head of these he placed fifty of
   what we now know as the "Canons of the Apostles," but it must not be
   supposed that he was convinced of their Apostolic origin, for in the
   Preface to his translation he expressly styles them "Canons which are
   said to be by the Apostles," and adds "quibus plurimi consensum non
   proebuere facilem." [45]   To these he added the canons of Chalcedon
   with those that council had accepted, viz., those of Sardica, and a
   large number passed by African Synods, and lastly the Papal Decretals
   from Siricius to Anastasius II.

   The next collection is that of St. Isidore of Seville, or which is
   supposed to have been made by him, early in the seventh century.

   About the middle of the ninth century there appeared a collection
   bearing the name of Isidore Mercator, and containing the "false
   decretals" which have been so fruitful a theme of controversial
   writing.  This collection was made somewhere about the year 850, and
   possibly at Mayence.  Many writers in treating of these decretals,
   which are undoubtedly spurious, seem to forget that they must have
   expressed the prevailing opinions of the day in which they were forged,
   of what those early Popes would have been likely to have said, and that
   therefore even forgeries as they certainly are, they have a great
   historical value which no sound scholar can properly neglect.

   After the collection of St. Isidore we have no great collection till
   that of Gratian in 1151.  Gratian was a Benedictine monk, and he styled
   his work "A Reconciling of contradictory canons" (Concordantia
   discordantium Canonum), which well sets forth what his chief object in
   view was, but his work had a great future before it, and all the world
   knows it as "Gratian's Decretum," and with it begins the "collections"
   of Canon law, if we consider it as a system in present force.

   "This great work is divided into three parts.  The first part, in 101
   Distinctions,' treats of ecclesiastical law, its origin, principles,
   and authority, and then of the different ranks and duties of the
   clergy.  The second part, in thirty-six Causes,' treats of
   ecclesiastical courts and their forms of procedure.  The third part,
   usually called De Consecratione,' treats of things and rites employed
   in the service of religion.  From its first appearance the Decretum
   obtained a wide popularity, but it was soon discovered that it
   contained numerous errors, which were corrected under the directions of
   successive Popes down to Gregory XIII.  Nor, although every subsequent
   generation has resorted to its pages, is the Decretum an authority to
   this day--that is, whatever canons or maxims of law are found in it
   possess only that degree of legality which they would possess if they
   existed separately; their being in the Decretum gives them no binding
   force.  In the century after Gratian, several supplementary collections
   of Decretals appeared.  These, with many of his own, were collected by
   the orders of Gregory IX., who employed in the work the extraordinary
   learning and acumen of St. Raymond of Pennafort, into five books, known
   as the Decretals of Gregory IX.  These are in the fullest sense
   authoritative, having been deliberately ratified and published by that
   Pope (1234).  The Sext, or sixth book of the Decretals, was added by
   Boniface VIII. (1298).  The Clementines are named after Clement V., who
   compiled them out of the canons of the Council of Vienne (1316) and
   some of his own constitutions.  The Extravagantes of John XXII., who
   succeeded Clement V., and the Extravagantes Communes, containing the
   decretals of twenty-five Popes, ending with Sixtus IV. (1484), complete
   the list.  Of these five collections--namely the Decretals, the Sext,
   the Clementines, the Extravagants of John XXII. and the Extravagants
   Common--the Corpus Juris Ecclesiastici' of the West is made up." [46]

   Into this body of canon law of course many of the canons we shall have
   to treat of in the following pages have been incorporated and so far as
   possible I shall give the reader a reference which will help his
   research in this particular.

   Historical Introduction.

   The history of the Council of Nice has been so often written by so many
   brilliant historians, from the time of its sitting down to to-day, that
   any historical notice of the causes leading to its assembling, or
   account of its proceedings, seems quite unnecessary.  The editor,
   however, ventures to call the attention of the reader to the fact that
   in this, as in every other of the Seven Ecumenical Councils, the
   question the Fathers considered was not what they supposed Holy
   Scripture might mean, nor what they, from à priori arguments, thought
   would be consistent with the mind of God, but something entirely
   different, to wit, what they had received.  They understood their
   position to be that of witnesses, not that of exegetes.  They
   recognized but one duty resting upon them in this respect--to hand down
   to other faithful men that good thing the Church had received according
   to the command of God.  The first requirement was not learning, but
   honesty.  The question they were called upon to answer was not, What do
   I think probable, or even certain, from Holy Scripture? but, What have
   I been taught, what has been intrusted to me to hand down to others?
   When the time came, in the Fourth Council, to examine the Tome of Pope
   St. Leo, the question was not whether it could be proved to the
   satisfaction of the assembled fathers from Holy Scripture, but whether
   it was the traditional faith of the Church.  It was not the doctrine of
   Leo in the fifth century, but the doctrine of Peter in the first, and
   of the Church since then, that they desired to believe and to teach,
   and so, when they had studied the Tome, they cried out: [47]

   "This is the faith of the Fathers!  This is the faith of the
   Apostles!...Peter hath thus spoken by Leo!  The Apostles thus taught!
   Cyril thus taught!" etc.

   No Acts of either of the first two Ecumenical Councils have been handed
   down. [48]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [47] This is clearly set forth by Pope Vigilius as follows:  "No one
   can doubt that our fathers believed that they should receive with
   veneration the letter of blessed Leo if they declared it to agree with
   the doctrines of the Nicene and Constantinopolitan Councils, as also
   with those of blessed Cyril, set forth in the first of Ephesus.  And if
   that letter of so great a Pontiff, shining with so bright a light of
   the orthodox Faith, needed to be approved by these comparisons, how can
   that letter to Maris the Persian, which specially rejects the First
   Council of Ephesus and declares to be heretics the expressed doctrines
   of the blessed Cyril, be believed to have been called orthodox by these
   same Fathers, condemning as it does those writings, by comparison with
   which, as we have said, the doctrine of so great a Pontiff deserved to
   be commended?"--Vigil., Constitutum pro dammatione Trium Capitulorum.
   Migne, Pat. Lat., tom. lxix., col. 162.

   [48] About twenty-five years ago Mr. Eugène Révillout discovered, in
   the Museum of Turin, two fragments in Coptic which he supposed to be
   portions of the Acts of this Council (of which the rest are still
   missing) incorporated into the Acts of a Council held at Alexandria in
   362.  But there is too little known about these fragments to attribute
   to them any fixed value.  I therefore only refer the reader to the
   literature on the subject--Journal Asiatique, Fevrier-Mars, 1873;
   Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne, Juin, 1873; Revue de Questions
   Historiques, Avril, 1874; M. W. Guettée, Histoire de l'Église, t. III.,
   p. 21; Eugène Révillout, Le Concile de Nicée et le Concile
   d'Alexandrie...d'après les textes Coptes.

   The Nicene Creed.

   (Found in the Acts of the Ecumenical Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon,
   in the Epistle of Eusebius of Cæsarea to his own Church, in the Epistle
   of St. Athanasius Ad Jovianum Imp., in the Ecclesiastical Histories of
   Theodoret and Socrates, and elsewhere, The variations in the text are
   absolutely without importance.)

   The Synod at Nice set forth this Creed. [49]

   The Ecthesis of the Synod at Nice. [50]

   We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible
   and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the
   only-begotten of his Father, of the substance of the Father, God of
   God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten (gennethenta), not
   made, being of one substance (homoousion, consubstantialem) with the
   Father.  By whom all things were made, both which be in heaven and in
   earth.  Who for us men and for our salvation came down [from heaven]
   and was incarnate and was made man.  He suffered and the third day he
   rose again, and ascended into heaven.  And he shall come again to judge
   both the quick and the dead.  And [we believe] in the Holy Ghost.  And
   whosoever shall say that there was a time when the Son of God was not
   (en pote hote ouk en), or that before he was begotten he was not, or
   that he was made of things that were not, or that he is of a different
   substance or essence [from the Father] or that he is a creature, or
   subject to change or conversion [51] --all that so say, the Catholic
   and Apostolic Church anathematizes them.

   Notes.

   The Creed of Eusebius of Cæsarea, which he presented to the council,
   and which some suppose to have suggested the creed finally adopted.

   (Found in his Epistle to his diocese; vide:  St. Athanasius and
   Theodoret.)

   We believe in one only God, Father Almighty, Creator of things visible
   and invisible; and in the Lord Jesus Christ, for he is the Word of God,
   God of God, Light of Light, life of life, his only Son, the first-born
   of all creatures, begotten of the Father before all time, by whom also
   everything was created, who became flesh for our redemption, who lived
   and suffered amongst men, rose again the third day, returned to the
   Father, and will come again one day in his glory to judge the quick and
   the dead.  We believe also in the Holy Ghost.  We believe that each of
   these three is and subsists; the Father truly as Father, the Son truly
   as Son, the Holy Ghost truly as Holy Ghost; as our Lord also said, when
   he sent his disciples to preach:  Go and teach all nations, and baptize
   them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

   Excursus on the Word Homousios. [52]

   The Fathers of the Council at Nice were at one time ready to accede to
   the request of some of the bishops and use only scriptural expressions
   in their definitions.  But, after several attempts, they found that all
   these were capable of being explained away.  Athanasius describes with
   much wit and penetration how he saw them nodding and winking to each
   other when the orthodox proposed expressions which they had thought of
   a way of escaping from the force of.  After a series of attempts of
   this sort it was found that something clearer and more unequivocal must
   be adopted if real unity of faith was to be attained; and accordingly
   the word homousios was adopted.  Just what the Council intended this
   expression to mean is set forth by St. Athanasius as follows:  "That
   the Son is not only like to the Father, but that, as his image, he is
   the same as the Father; that he is of the Father; and that the
   resemblance of the Son to the Father, and his immutability, are
   different from ours:  for in us they are something acquired, and arise
   from our fulfilling the divine commands.  Moreover, they wished to
   indicate by this that his generation is different from that of human
   nature; that the Son is not only like to the Father, but inseparable
   from the substance of the Father, that he and the Father are one and
   the same, as the Son himself said:  The Logos is always in the Father,
   and, the Father always in the Logos,' as the sun and its splendour are
   inseparable." [53]

   The word homousios had not had, although frequently used before the
   Council of Nice, a very happy history.  It was probably rejected by the
   Council of Antioch, [54] and was suspected of being open to a Sabellian
   meaning.  It was accepted by the heretic Paul of Samosata and this
   rendered it very offensive to many in the Asiatic Churches.

   On the other hand the word is used four times by St. Irenæus, and
   Pamphilus the Martyr is quoted as asserting that Origen used the very
   word in the Nicene sense.  Tertullian also uses the expression "of one
   substance" (unius substantiæ) in two places, and it would seem that
   more than half a century before the meeting of the Council of Nice, it
   was a common one among the Orthodox.

   Vasquez treats this matter at some length in his Disputations, [55] and
   points out how well the distinction is drawn by Epiphanius between
   Synousios and Homousios, "for synousios signifies such an unity of
   substance as allows of no distinction:  wherefore the Sabellians would
   admit this word:  but on the contrary homousios signifies the same
   nature and substance but with a distinction between persons one from
   the other.  Rightly, therefore, has the Church adopted this word as the
   one best calculated to confute the Arian heresy." [56]

   It may perhaps be well to note that these words are formed like
   homobios and homoiobios, homognomon and homoiognomon, etc., etc.

   The reader will find this whole doctrine treated at great length in all
   the bodies of divinity; and in Alexander Natalis (H. E. t. iv., Diss.
   xiv.); he is also referred to Pearson, On the Creed; Bull, Defence of
   the Nicene Creed; Forbes, An Explanation of the Nicene Creed; and
   especially to the little book, written in answer to the recent
   criticisms of Professor Harnack, by H. B. Swete, D.D., The Apostles'
   Creed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [52] Our older English writers usually wrote this word "homoousion,"
   and thus spoke of the doctrine as "the doctrine of the homoousion."
   For the Arian word they wrote "homoiousion."  Later writers have used
   the nominative masculine, "homoousios" and "homoiousios."  The great
   Latin writers did not thus transliterate the word, but, wrote
   "homousios," and for the heretical word "homooesios" or "homoesios."  I
   have kept for the noun signifying the doctrine, our old English
   "Homoousion," but for the adjective, I have used the ordinary latinized
   form "homousios," in this copying Smith and Wace, Dict. Christian
   Antiquities

   [54] Vide Swainson, in Smith and Wace, Dict. Christ. Biog., sub voce
   Homousios, p. 134.

   [55] Vasquez, Disput. cix., cap. v.  "Rightly doth the Church use the
   expression Homousios (that is Consubstantial) to express that the
   Father and the Son are of the same nature."

   [56] Vasquez may also well be consulted on the expressions ousia,
   substantia, hupostasis, etc.

   Excursus on the Words gennethenta ou poiethenta .

   (J. B. Lightfoot.  The Apostolic Fathers--Part II. Vol. ii. Sec. I. pp.
   90, et seqq.)

   The Son is here [Ignat. Ad. Eph. vii.] declared to be gennetos as man
   and agennetos as God, for this is clearly shown to be the meaning from
   the parallel clauses.  Such language is not in accordance with later
   theological definitions, which carefully distinguished between genetos
   and gennetos between agenetos and agennetos; so that genetos, agenetos
   respectively denied and affirmed the eternal existence, being
   equivalent to ktistos, aktistos, while gennetos, agennetos described
   certain ontological relations, whether in time or in eternity.  In the
   later theological language, therefore, the Son was gennetos even in his
   Godhead.  See esp. Joann. Damasc. de Fid. Orth. i. 8 [where he draws
   the conclusion that only the Father is agennetos, and only the Son
   gennetos].

   There can be little doubt however, that Ignatius wrote gennetos kai
   agennetos, though his editors frequently alter it into genetos kai
   agenetos.  For (1) the Greek ms. still retains the double [Greek nun]
   n, though the claims of orthodoxy would be a temptation to scribes to
   substitute the single n.  And to this reading also the Latin genitus et
   ingenitus points.  On the other hand it cannot be concluded that
   translators who give factus et non factus had the words with one n, for
   this was after all what Ignatius meant by the double n, and they would
   naturally render his words so as to make his orthodoxy apparent.  (2)
   When Theodoret writes gennetos ex agennetou, it is clear that he, or
   the person before him who first substituted this reading, must have
   read gennetos kai agennetos, for there would be no temptation to alter
   the perfectly orthodox genetos kai agenetos, nor (if altered) would it
   have taken this form.  (3) When the interpolator substitutes ho monos
   alethinos Theos ho agennetos...tou de monogonous pater kai gennetor,
   the natural inference is that he too, had the forms in double n, which
   he retained, at the same time altering the whole run of the sentence so
   as not to do violence to his own doctrinal views; see Bull Def. Fid.
   Nic. ii. 2 § 6.  (4) The quotation in Athanasius is more difficult.
   The mss. vary, and his editors write genetos kai agenetos.  Zahn too,
   who has paid more attention to this point than any previous editor of
   Ignatius, in his former work (Ign. v. Ant. p. 564), supposed Athanasius
   to have read and written the words with a single n, though in his
   subsequent edition of Ignatius (p. 338) he declares himself unable to
   determine between the single and double n.  I believe, however, that
   the argument of Athanasius decides in favour of the nn.  Elsewhere he
   insists repeatedly on the distinction between ktizein and gennan,
   justifying the use of the latter term as applied to the divinity of the
   Son, and defending the statement in the Nicene Creed genneton ek tes
   ousias tou patros ton huion homoousion (De Synod. 54, 1, p. 612).
   Although he is not responsible for the language of the Macrostich (De
   Synod. 3, 1, p. 590), and would have regarded it as inadequate without
   the homoousion, yet this use of terms entirely harmonizes with his
   own.  In the passage before us, ib. §§ 46, 47 (p. 607), he is defending
   the use of homousios at Nicæa, notwithstanding that it had been
   previously rejected by the council which condemned Paul of Samosata,
   and he contends that both councils were orthodox, since they used
   homousios in a different sense.  As a parallel instance he takes the
   word agennetos which like homousios is not a scriptural word, and like
   it also is used in two ways, signifying either (1) To on men, mete de
   gennethen mete holos echon ton aition, or (2) To aktiston.  In the
   former sense the Son cannot be called agennetos, in the latter he may
   be so called.  Both uses, he says, are found in the fathers.  Of the
   latter he quotes the passage in Ignatius as an example; of the former
   he says, that some writers subsequent to Ignatius declare hen to
   agenneton ho pater, kai eis ho ex autou huios gnesios, gennema
   alethinon k.t.l.  [He may have been thinking of Clem. Alex. Strom. vi.
   7, which I shall quote below.]  He maintains that both are orthodox, as
   having in view two different senses of the word agenneton , and the
   same, he argues, is the case with the councils which seem to take
   opposite sides with regard to homousios.  It is clear from this
   passage, as Zahn truly says, that Athanasius is dealing with one and
   the same word throughout; and, if so, it follows that this word must be
   agenneton, since ageneton would be intolerable in some places.  I may
   add by way of caution that in two other passages, de Decret. Syn. Nic.
   28 (1, p. 184), Orat. c. Arian. i. 30 (1, p. 343), St. Athanasius gives
   the various senses of ageneton (for this is plain from the context),
   and that these passages ought not to be treated as parallels to the
   present passage which is concerned with the senses of agenneton .  Much
   confusion is thus created, e.g. in Newman's notes on the several
   passages in the Oxford translation of Athanasius (pp. 51 sq., 224 sq.),
   where the three passages are treated as parallel, and no attempt is
   made to discriminate the readings in the several places, but
   "ingenerate" is given as the rendering of both alike.  If then
   Athanasius who read gennetos kai agennetos in Ignatius, there is
   absolutely no authority for the spelling with one n.  The earlier
   editors (Voss, Ussher, Cotelier, etc.), printed it as they found it in
   the ms.; but Smith substituted the forms with the single n, and he has
   been followed more recently by Hefele, Dressel, and some other.  In the
   Casanatensian copy of the ms., a marginal note is added, anagnosteon
   agenetos tout' esti me poietheis.  Waterland (Works, III., p. 240 sq.,
   Oxf. 1823) tries ineffectually to show that the form with the double n
   was invented by the fathers at a later date to express their
   theological conception.  He even "doubts whether there was any such
   word as agennetos so early as the time of Ignatius."  In this he is
   certainly wrong.

   The mss. of early Christian writers exhibit much confusion between
   these words spelled with the double and the single n.  See e.g. Justin
   Dial. 2, with Otto's note; Athenag. Suppl. 4 with Otto's note;
   Theophil, ad Autol. ii. 3, 4; Iren. iv. 38, 1, 3; Orig. c. Cels. vi.
   66; Method. de Lib. Arbitr., p. 57; Jahn (see Jahn's note 11, p. 122);
   Maximus in Euseb. Præp. Ev. vii. 22; Hippol. Hær. v. 16 (from Sibylline
   Oracles); Clem. Alex. Strom. v. 14; and very frequently in later
   writers.  Yet notwithstanding the confusion into which later
   transcribers have thus thrown the subject, it is still possible to
   ascertain the main facts respecting the usage of the two forms.  The
   distinction between the two terms, as indicated by their origin, is
   that agenetos denies the creation, and agennetos the generation or
   parentage.  Both are used at a very early date; e.g. agenetos by
   Parmenides in Clem. Alex. Strom. v. 14, and by Agothon in Arist. Eth.
   Nic. vii. 2 (comp. also Orac. Sibyll. prooem. 7, 17); and agennetos in
   Soph. Trach. 61 (where it is equivalent to dusgenon.  Here the
   distinction of meaning is strictly preserved, and so probably it always
   is in Classical writers; for in Soph. Trach. 743 we should after Porson
   and Hermann read ageneton with Suidas.  In Christian writers also there
   is no reason to suppose that the distinction was ever lost, though in
   certain connexions the words might be used convertibly.  Whenever, as
   here in Ignatius, we have the double n where we should expect the
   single, we must ascribe the fact to the indistinctness or incorrectness
   of the writer's theological conceptions, not to any obliteration of the
   meaning of the terms themselves.  To this early father for instance the
   eternal gennesis of the Son was not a distinct theological idea, though
   substantially he held the same views as the Nicene fathers respecting
   the Person of Christ.  The following passages from early Christian
   writers will serve at once to show how far the distinction was
   appreciated, and to what extent the Nicene conception prevailed in
   ante-Nicene Christianity; Justin Apol. ii. 6, comp. ib. § 13; Athenag.
   Suppl. 10 (comp. ib. 4); Theoph. ad. Aut. ii. 3; Tatian Orat. 5; Rhodon
   in Euseb. H. E. v. 13; Clem. Alex. Strom. vi. 7; Orig. c. Cels. vi. 17,
   ib. vi. 52; Concil. Antioch (a.d. 269) in Routh Rel. Sacr. III., p.
   290; Method. de Creat. 5.  In no early Christian writing, however, is
   the distinction more obvious than in the Clementine Homilies, x. 10
   (where the distinction is employed to support the writer's heretical
   theology):  see also viii. 16, and comp. xix. 3, 4, 9, 12.  The
   following are instructive passages as regards the use of these words
   where the opinions of other heretical writers are given; Saturninus,
   Iren. i. 24, 1; Hippol. Hær. vii. 28; Simon Magus, Hippol. Hær. vi. 17,
   18; the Valentinians, Hippol. Hær. vi. 29, 30; the Ptolemæus in
   particular, Ptol. Ep. ad. Flor. 4 (in Stieren's Irenæus, p. 935);
   Basilides, Hippol. Hær. vii. 22; Carpocrates, Hippol. Hær. vii. 32.

   From the above passages it will appear that Ante-Nicene writers were
   not indifferent to the distinction of meaning between the two words;
   and when once the orthodox Christology was formulated in the Nicene
   Creed in the words gennethenta ou poiethenta, it became henceforth
   impossible to overlook the difference.  The Son was thus declared to be
   gennetos but not genetos.  I am therefore unable to agree with Zahn
   (Marcellus, pp. 40, 104, 223, Ign. von Ant. p. 565), that at the time
   of the Arian controversy the disputants were not alive to the
   difference of meaning.  See for example Epiphanius, Hær. lxiv. 8.  But
   it had no especial interest for them.  While the orthodox party clung
   to the homousios as enshrining the doctrine for which they fought, they
   had no liking for the terms agennetos and gennetos as applied to the
   Father and the Son respectively, though unable to deny their propriety,
   because they were affected by the Arians and applied in their own way.
   To the orthodox mind the Arian formula ouk en prin gennethenai or some
   Semiarian formula hardly less dangerous, seemed always to be lurking
   under the expression Theos gennetos as applied to the Son.  Hence the
   language of Epiphanius Hær. lxxiii. 19:  "As you refuse to accept our
   homousios because though used by the fathers, it does not occur in the
   Scriptures, so will we decline on the same grounds to accept your
   agennetos ."  Similarly Basil c. Eunom. i., iv., and especially ib.
   further on, in which last passage he argues at great length against the
   position of the heretics, ei agennetos, phasin, ho pater, gennetos de
   ho huios, ou tes autes ousias.  See also the arguments against the
   Anomoeans in [Athan.] Dial. de Trin. ii. passim.  This fully explains
   the reluctance of the orthodox party to handle terms which their
   adversaries used to endanger the homousios.  But, when the stress of
   the Arian controversy was removed, it became convenient to express the
   Catholic doctrine by saying that the Son in his divine nature was
   gennetos but not genetos.  And this distinction is staunchly maintained
   in later orthodox writers, e.g. John of Damascus, already quoted in the
   beginning of this Excursus.

   The Canons of the 318 Holy Fathers Assembled in the City of Nice, in
   Bithynia.

   Canon I.

   If any one in sickness has been subjected by physicians to a surgical
   operation, or if he has been castrated by barbarians, let him remain
   among the clergy; but, if any one in sound health has castrated
   himself, it behoves that such an one, if [already] enrolled among the
   clergy, should cease [from his ministry], and that from henceforth no
   such person should be promoted.  But, as it is evident that this is
   said of those who wilfully do the thing and presume to castrate
   themselves, so if any have been made eunuchs by barbarians, or by their
   masters, and should otherwise be found worthy, such men the Canon
   admits to the clergy.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome [57] of Canon I.

   Eunuchs may be received into the number of the clergy, but those who
   castrate themselves shall not be received.

   Balsamon.

   The divine Apostolic Canons xxi., xxii., xxiii., and xxiv., have taught
   us sufficiently what ought to be done with those who castrate
   themselves, this canon provides as to what is to be done to these as
   well as to those who deliver themselves over to others to be
   emasculated by them, viz., that they are not to be admitted among the
   clergy nor advanced to the priesthood.

   Daniel Butler.

   (Smith & Cheetham, Dict. Christ. Ant.)

   The feeling that one devoted to the sacred ministry should be
   unmutilated was strong in the Ancient Church....This canon of Nice, and
   those in the Apostolic Canons and a later one in the Second Council of
   Arles (canon vii.) were aimed against that perverted notion of piety,
   originating in the misinterpretation of our Lord's saying (Matt. xix.
   12) by which Origen, among others, was misled, and their observance was
   so carefully enforced in later times that not more than one or two
   instances of the practice which they condemn are noticed by the
   historian.  The case was different if a man was born an eunuch or had
   suffered mutilation at the hands of persecutors; an instance of the
   former, Dorotheus, presbyter of Antioch, is mentioned by Eusebius (H.
   E. vii., c. 32); of the latter, Tigris, presbyter of Constantinople, is
   referred to both by Socrates (H. E. vi. 15) and Sozomen (H. E. vi. 24)
   as the victim of a barbarian master.

   Hefele.

   We know, by the first apology of St. Justin (Apol. c. 29) that a
   century before Origen, a young man had desired to be mutilated by
   physicians, for the purpose of completely refuting the charge of vice
   which the heathen brought against the worship of Christians.  St.
   Justin neither praises nor blames this young man:  he only relates that
   he could not obtain the permission of the civil authorities for his
   project, that he renounced his intention, but nevertheless remained
   virgo all his life.  It is very probable that the Council of Nice was
   induced by some fresh similar cases to renew the old injunctions; it
   was perhaps the Arian bishop, Leontius, who was the principal cause of
   it. [58]

   Lambert.

   Constantine forbade by a law the practice condemned in this canon.  "If
   anyone shall anywhere in the Roman Empire after this decree make
   eunuchs, he shall be punished with death.  If the owner of the place
   where the deed was perpetrated was aware of it and hid the fact, his
   goods shall be confiscated."  (Const. M. Opera. Migne Patrol. vol.
   viii., 396.)

   Beveridge.

   The Nicene fathers in this canon make no new enactment but only confirm
   by the authority of an Ecumenical synod the Apostolic Canons, and this
   is evident from the wording of this canon.  For there can be no doubt
   that they had in mind some earlier canon when they said, "such men the
   canon admits to the clergy."  Not, houtos ho kanon, but ho kanon, as if
   they had said "the formerly set forth and well-known canon" admits such
   to the clergy.  But no other canon then existed in which this provision
   occurred except apostolical canon xxi. which therefore we are of
   opinion is here cited.

   [In this conclusion Hefele also agrees.]

   This law was frequently enacted by subsequent synods and is inserted in
   the Corpus Juris Canonici, Decretum Gratiani. Pars. I.  Distinctio LV.,

   Excursus on the Use of the Word "Canon."

   (Bright:  Notes on the Canons, pp. 2 and 3.)

   Kanon, as an ecclesiastical term, has a very interesting history.  See
   Westcott's account of it, On the New Testament Canon, p. 498 ff.  The
   original sense, "a straight rod" or "line," determines all its
   religious applications, which begin with St. Paul's use of it for a
   prescribed sphere of apostolic work (2 Cor. x. 13, 15), or a regulative
   principle of Christian life (Gal. vi. 16).  It represents the element
   of definiteness in Christianity and in the order of the Christian
   Church.  Clement of Rome uses it for the measure of Christian
   attainment (Ep. Cor. 7).  Irenæus calls the baptismal creed "the canon
   of truth" (i. 9, 4):  Polycrates (Euseb. v. 24) and probably Hippolytus
   (ib. v. 28) calls it "the canon of faith;" the Council of Antioch in
   a.d. 269, referring to the same standard of orthodox belief, speaks
   with significant absoluteness of "the canon" (ib. vii. 30).  Eusebius
   himself mentions "the canon of truth" in iv. 23, and "the canon of the
   preaching" in iii. 32; and so Basil speaks of "the transmitted canon of
   true religion" (Epist. 204-6).  Such language, like Tertullian's
   "regula fidei," amounted to saying, "We Christians know what we
   believe:  it is not a vague idea' without substance or outline:  it can
   be put into form, and by it we test the spirits whether they be of
   God.'"  Thus it was natural for Socrates to call the Nicene Creed
   itself a "canon," ii. 27.  Clement of Alexandria uses the phrase "canon
   of truth" for a standard of mystic interpretation, but proceeds to call
   the harmony between the two Testaments "a canon for the Church," Strom.
   vi. 15, 124, 125.  Eusebius speaks of "the ecclesiastical canon" which
   recognized no other Gospels than the four (vi. 25).  The use of the
   term and its cognates in reference to the Scriptures is explained by
   Westcott in a passive sense so that "canonized" books, as Athanasius
   calls them (Fest. Ep. 39), are books expressly recognized by the Church
   as portions of Holy Scripture.  Again, as to matters of observance,
   Clement of Alexandria wrote a book against Judaizers, called "The
   Churches Canon" (Euseb. vi. 13); and Cornelius of Rome, in his letter
   to Fabius, speaks of the "canon" as to what we call confirmation
   (Euseb. vi. 43), and Dionysius of the "canon" as to reception of
   converts from heresy (ib. vii. 7).  The Nicene Council in this canon
   refers to a standing "canon" of discipline (comp. Nic. 2, 5, 6, 9, 10,
   15, 16, 18), but it does not apply the term to its own enactments,
   which are so described in the second canon of Constantinople (see
   below), and of which Socrates says "that it passed what are usually
   called canons'" (i. 13); as Julius of Rome calls a decree of this
   Council a "canon" (Athan. Apol. c. Ari. 25); so Athanasius applies the
   term generally to Church laws (Encycl. 2; cp. Apol. c. Ari. 69).  The
   use of kanon for the clerical body (Nic. 16, 17, 19; Chalc. 2) is
   explained by Westcott with reference to the rule of clerical life, but
   Bingham traces it to the roll or official list on which the names of
   clerics were enrolled (i. 5, 10); and this appears to be the more
   natural derivation, see "the holy canon" in the first canon of the
   Council of Antioch, and compare Socrates (i. 17), "the Virgins
   enumerated en to ton ekklesion kanoni," and (ib. v. 19) on the addition
   of a penitentiary "to the canon of the church;" see also George of
   Laodicea in Sozomon, iv. 13.  Hence any cleric might be called
   kanonikos , see Cyril of Jerusalem, Procatech. 4; so we read of
   "canonical singers."  Laodicea, canon xv.  The same notion of
   definiteness appears in the ritual use of the word for a series of nine
   "odes" in the Eastern Church service (Neale, Introd. East. Ch. ii.
   832), for the central and unvarying element in the Liturgy, beginning
   after the Tersanctus (Hammond, Liturgies East and West, p. 377); or for
   any Church office (Ducange in v.); also in its application to a table
   for the calculation of Easter (Euseb. vi. 29; vii. 32); to a scheme for
   exhibiting the common and peculiar parts of the several Gospels (as the
   "Eusebian canons") and to a prescribed or ordinary payment to a church,
   a use which grew out of one found in Athanasius' Apol. c. Ari. 60.

   In more recent times a tendency has appeared to restrict the term Canon
   to matters of discipline, but the Council of Treat continued the
   ancient use of the word, calling its doctrinal and disciplinary
   determinations alike "Canons."

   Canon II.

   Forasmuch as, either from necessity, or through the urgency of
   individuals, many things have been done contrary to the Ecclesiastical
   canon, so that men just converted from heathenism to the faith, and who
   have been instructed but a little while, are straightway brought to the
   spiritual laver, and as soon as they have been baptized, are advanced
   to the episcopate or the presbyterate, it has seemed right to us that
   for the time to come no such thing shall be done.  For to the
   catechumen himself there is need of time and of a longer trial after
   baptism.  For the apostolical saying is clear, "Not a novice; lest,
   being lifted up with pride, he fall into condemnation and the snare of
   the devil."  But if, as time goes on, any sensual sin should be found
   out about the person, and he should be convicted by two or three
   witnesses, let him cease from the clerical office.  And whoso shall
   transgress these [enactments] will imperil his own clerical position,
   as a person who presumes to disobey the great Synod.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   Those who have come from the heathen shall not be immediately advanced
   to the presbyterate.  For without a probation of some time a neophyte
   is of no advantage (kakos).  But if after ordination it be found out
   that he had sinned previously, let him then be expelled from the
   clergy.

   Hefele.

   It may be seen by the very text of this canon, that it was already
   forbidden to baptize, and to raise to the episcopate or to the
   priesthood anyone who had only been a catechumen for a short time:
   this injunction is in fact contained in the eightieth (seventy-ninth)
   apostolical canon; and according to that, it would be older than the
   Council of Nicæa.  There have been, nevertheless, certain cases in
   which, for urgent reasons, an exception has been made to the rule of
   the Council of Nicæa--for instance, that of S. Ambrose.  The canon of
   Nicæa does not seem to allow such an exception, but it might be
   justified by the apostolical canon, which says, at the close:  "It is
   not right that any one who has not yet been proved should be a teacher
   of others, unless by a peculiar divine grace."  The expression of the
   canon of Nicæa, psuchikon ti hamartema, is not easy to explain:  some
   render it by the Latin words animale peccatam, believing that the
   Council has here especially in view sins of the flesh; but as Zonaras
   has said, all sins are psuchika hamartemata.  We must then understand
   the passage in question to refer to a capital and very serious offence,
   as the penalty of deposition annexed to it points out.

   These words have also given offence, ei de proiontos tou chronon; that
   is to say, "It is necessary henceforward," etc., understanding that it
   is only those who have been too quickly ordained who are threatened
   with deposition in case they are guilty of crime; but the canon is
   framed, and ought to be understood, in a general manner:  it applies to
   all other clergymen, but it appears also to point out that greater
   severity should be shown toward those who have been too quickly
   ordained.

   Others have explained the passage in this manner:  "If it shall become
   known that any one who has been too quickly ordained was guilty before
   his baptism of any serious offence, he ought to be deposed."  This is
   the interpretation given by Gratian, but it must be confessed that such
   a translation does violence to the text.  This is, I believe, the
   general sense of the canon, and of this passage in particular:
   "Henceforward no one shall be baptized or ordained quickly.  As to
   those already in orders (without any distinction between those who have
   been ordained in due course and those who have been ordained too
   quickly), the rule is that they shall be deposed if they commit a
   serious offence.  Those who are guilty of disobedience to this great
   Synod, either by allowing themselves to be ordained or even by
   ordaining others prematurely, are threatened with deposition ipso
   facto, and for this fault alone."  We consider, in short, that the last
   words of the canon may be understood as well of the ordained as of the
   ordainer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon III.

   The great Synod has stringently forbidden any bishop, presbyter,
   deacon, or any one of the clergy whatever, to have a subintroducta
   dwelling with him, except only a mother, or sister, or aunt, or such
   persons only as are beyond all suspicion.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   No one shall have a woman in his house except his mother, and sister,
   and persons altogether beyond suspicion.

   Justellus.

   Who these mulieres subintroductæ were does not sufficiently
   appear...but they were neither wives nor concubines, but women of some
   third kind, which the clergy kept with them, not for the sake of
   offspring or lust, but from the desire, or certainly under the
   pretence, of piety.

   Johnson.

   For want of a proper English word to render it by, I translate "to
   retain any woman in their houses under pretence of her being a disciple
   to them."

   Van Espen.

   Translates:  And his sisters and aunts cannot remain unless they be
   free from all suspicion.

   Fuchs in his Bibliothek der kirchenver sammlungen confesses that this
   canon shews that the practice of clerical celibacy had already spread
   widely.  In connexion with this whole subject of the subintroductæ the
   text of St. Paul should be carefully considered.  1 Cor. ix. 5.

   Hefele.

   It is very certain that the canon of Nice forbids such spiritual
   unions, but the context shows moreover that the Fathers had not these
   particular cases in view alone; and the expression suneisaktos should
   be understood of every woman who is introduced (suneisaktos) into the
   house of a clergyman for the purpose of living there.  If by the word
   suneisaktos was only intended the wife in this spiritual marriage, the
   Council would not have said, any suneisaktos, except his mother, etc.;
   for neither his mother nor his sister could have formed this spiritual
   union with the cleric.  The injunction, then, does net merely forbid
   the suneisaktos in the specific sense, but orders that "no woman must
   live in the house of a cleric, unless she be his mother," etc.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Distinc. XXXII., C. xvj.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IV.

   It is by all means proper that a bishop should be appointed by all the
   bishops in the province; but should this be difficult, either on
   account of urgent necessity or because of distance, three at least
   should meet together, and the suffrages of the absent [bishops] also
   being given and communicated in writing, then the ordination should
   take place.  But in every province the ratification of what is done
   should be left to the Metropolitan.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   A bishop is to be chosen by all the bishops of the province, or at
   least by three, the rest giving by letter their assent; but this choice
   must be confirmed by the Metropolitan.

   Zonaras.

   The present Canon might seem to be opposed to the first canon of the
   Holy Apostles, for the latter enjoins that a bishop ordained by two or
   three bishops, but this by three, the absent also agreeing and
   testifying their assent by writing.  But they are not contradictory;
   for the Apostolical canon by ordination (cheirotonian) means
   consecration and imposition of hands, but the present canon by
   constitution (katastasin) and ordination means the election, and
   enjoins that the election of a bishop do not take place unless three
   assemble, having the consent also of the absent by letter, or a
   declaration that they also will acquiesce in the election (or vote,
   psepho) made by the three who have assembled.  But after the election
   it gives the ratification or completion of the matter--the imposition
   of hands and consecration--to the metropolitan of the province, so that
   the election is to be ratified by him.  He does so when with two or
   three bishops, according to the apostolical canon, he consecrates with
   imposition of hands the one of the elected persons whom he himself
   selects.

   Balsamon.

   Also understands kathistasthai to mean election by vote.

   Bright.

   The Greek canonists are certainly in error when they interpret
   cheirotonia of election.  The canon is akin to the 1st Apostolic canon
   which, as the canonists admit, must refer to the consecration of a new
   bishop, and it was cited in that sense at the Council of
   Chalcedon--Session xiii. (Mansi., vii. 307).  We must follow Rufinus
   and the old Latin translators, who speak of "ordinari," "ordinatio" and
   "manus impositionem."

   Hefele.

   The Council of Nice thought it necessary to define by precise rules the
   duties of the bishops who took part in these episcopal elections.  It
   decided (a) that a single bishop of the province was not sufficient for
   the appointment of another; (b) three at least should meet, and (c)
   they were not to proceed to election without the written permission of
   the absent bishops; it was necessary (d) to obtain afterward the
   approval of the metropolitan.  The Council thus confirms the ordinary
   metropolitan division in its two most important points, namely, the
   nomination and ordination of bishops, and the superior position of the
   metropolitan.  The third point connected with this division--namely,
   the provincial synod--will be considered under the next canon.

   Meletius was probably the occasion of this canon.  It may be remembered
   that he had nominated bishops without the concurrence of the other
   bishops of the province, and without the approval of the metropolitan
   of Alexandria, and had thus occasioned a schism.  This canon was
   intended to prevent the recurrence of such abuses.  The question has
   been raised as to whether the fourth canon speaks only of the choice of
   the bishop, or whether it also treats of the consecration of the newly
   elected.  We think, with Van Espen, that it treats equally of both,--as
   well of the part which the bishops of the province should take in an
   episcopal election, as of the consecration which completes it.

   This canon has been interpreted in two ways.  The Greeks had learnt by
   bitter experience to distrust the interference of princes and earthly
   potentates in episcopal elections.  Accordingly, they tried to prove
   that this canon of Nice took away from the people the right of voting
   at the nomination of a bishop, and confined the nomination exclusively
   to the bishops of the province.

   The Greek Commentators, Balsamon and others, therefore, only followed
   the example of the Seventh and [so-called] Eighth OEcumenical Councils
   in affirming that this fourth canon of Nice takes away from the people
   the right previously possessed of voting in the choice of bishops and
   makes the election depend entirely on the decision of the bishops of
   the province.

   The Latin Church acted otherwise.  It is true that with it also the
   people have been removed from episcopal elections, but this did not
   happen till later, about the eleventh century; and it was not the
   people only who were removed, but the bishops of the province as well,
   and the election was conducted entirely by the clergy of the Cathedral
   Church.  The Latins then interpreted the canon of Nice as though it
   said nothing of the rights of the bishops of the province in the
   election of their future colleague (and it does not speak of it in a
   very explicit manner), and as though it determined these two points
   only; (a) that for the ordination of a bishop three bishops at least
   are necessary; (b) that the right of confirmation rests with the
   metropolitan.

   The whole subject of episcopal elections is treated fully by Van Espen
   and by Thomassin, in Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l' Église, P.
   II. l. 2.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I. Dist. LXIV. c. j.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   Concerning those, whether of the clergy or of the laity, who have been
   excommunicated in the several provinces, let the provision of the canon
   be observed by the bishops which provides that persons cast out by some
   be not readmitted by others.  Nevertheless, inquiry should be made
   whether they have been excommunicated through captiousness, or
   contentiousness, or any such like ungracious disposition in the
   bishop.  And, that this matter may have due investigation, it is
   decreed that in every province synods shall be held twice a year, in
   order that when all the bishops of the province are assembled together,
   such questions may by them be thoroughly examined, that so those who
   have confessedly offended against their bishop, may be seen by all to
   be for just cause excommunicated, until it shall seem fit to a general
   meeting of the bishops to pronounce a milder sentence upon them.  And
   let these synods be held, the one before Lent, (that the pure Gift may
   be offered to God after all bitterness has been put away), and let the
   second be held about autumn.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   Such as have been excommunicated by certain bishops shall not be
   restored by others, unless the excommunication was the result of
   pusillanimity, or strife, or some other similar cause.  And that this
   may be duly attended to, there shall be in each year two synods in
   every province--the one before Lent, the other toward autumn.

   There has always been found the greatest difficulty in securing the
   regular meetings of provincial and diocesan synods, and despite the
   very explicit canonical legislation upon the subject, and the severe
   penalties attached to those not answering the summons, in large parts
   of the Church for centuries these councils have been of the rarest
   occurrence.  Zonaras complains that in his time "these synods were
   everywhere treated with great contempt," and that they had actually
   ceased to be held.

   Possibly the opinion of St. Gregory Nazianzen had grown common, for it
   will be remembered that in refusing to go to the latter sessions of the
   Second Ecumenical he wrote, "I am resolved to avoid every meeting of
   bishops, for I have never seen any synod end well, nor assuage rather
   than aggravate disorders." [59]

   Hefele.

   Gelasius has given in his history of the Council of Nice, the text of
   the canons passed by the Council; and it must be noticed that there is
   here a slight difference between his text and ours.  Our reading is as
   follows:  "The excommunication continues to be in force until it seem
   good to the assembly of bishops (to koino) to soften it."  Gelasius, on
   the other hand, writes:  mechris an to koino e to episkopo, k.t.l.,
   that is to say, "until it seem good to the assembly of bishops, or to
   the bishop (who has passed the sentence)," etc....Dionysius the Less
   has also followed this variation, as his translation of the canon
   shows.  It does not change the essential meaning of the passage; for it
   may be well understood that the bishop who has passed the sentence of
   excommunication has also the right to mitigate it.  But the variation
   adopted by the Prisca alters, on the contrary, the whole sense of the
   canon:  the Prisca has not to koino, but only episkopo :  it is in this
   erroneous form that the canon has passed into the Corpus jurisc an.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa XI, Quæst. III., Canon lxxiij., and the latter part in
   Pars I., Distinc. XVIII., c. iij.

   Excursus on the Word Prospherein .

   (Dr. Adolph Harnack:  Hist. of Dogma [Eng. Tr.] Vol. I. p. 209.)

   The idea of the whole transaction of the Supper as a sacrifice, is
   plainly found in the Didache, (c. 14), in Ignatius, and above all, in
   Justin (I. 65f.)  But even Clement of Rome presupposes it, when (in cc.
   40-44) he draws a parallel between bishops and deacons and the Priests
   and Levites of the Old Testament, describing as the chief function of
   the former (44.4) prospherein ta dora.  This is not the place to
   enquire whether the first celebration had, in the mind of its founder,
   the character of a sacrificial meal; but, certainly, the idea, as it
   was already developed at the time of Justin, had been created by the
   churches.  Various reasons tended towards seeing in the Supper a
   sacrifice.  In the first place, Malachi i. 11, demanded a solemn
   Christian sacrifice:  see my notes on Didache, 14.3.  In the second
   place, all prayers were regarded as a sacrifice, and therefore the
   solemn prayers at the Supper must be specially considered as such.  In
   the third place, the words of institution touto poieite, contained a
   command with regard to a definite religious action.  Such an action,
   however, could only be represented as a sacrifice, and this the more,
   that the Gentile Christians might suppose that they had to understand
   poiein in the sense of thuein.  In the fourth place, payments in kind
   were necessary for the "agapæ" connected with the Supper, out of which
   were taken the bread and wine for the Holy celebration; in what other
   aspect could these offerings in the worship be regarded than as
   prosphorai for the purpose of a sacrifice?  Yet the spiritual idea so
   prevailed that only the prayers were regarded as the thusia proper,
   even in the case of Justin (Dial. 117).  The elements are only dora,
   prosphorai, which obtain their value from the prayers, in which thanks
   are given for the gifts of creation and redemption, as well as for the
   holy meal, and entreaty is made for the introduction of the community
   into the Kingdom of God (see Didache, 9. 10).  Therefore, even the
   sacred meal itself is called eucharistia (Justin, Apol. I. 66:  he
   trophe haute kaleitai par' hemin eucharistia .  Didache, 9. 1:
   Ignat.), because it is traphe eucharistetheisa.  It is a mistake to
   suppose that Justin already understood the body of Christ to be the
   object of poiein, [60] and therefore thought of a sacrifice of this
   body (I. 66).  The real sacrificial act in the Supper consists rather,
   according to Justin, only in the eucharistian poiein whereby the koinos
   artos becomes the artos tes eucharistias . [61]   The sacrifice of the
   Supper in its essence, apart from the offering of alms, which in the
   practice of the Church was closely united with it, is nothing but a
   sacrifice of prayer:  the sacrificial act of the Christian here also is
   nothing else than an act of prayer (See Apol. I. 14, 65-67; Dial. 28,
   29, 41, 70, 116-118).

   Harnack (lib. cit. Vol. II. chapter III. p. 136) says that "Cyprian was
   the first to associate the specific offering, i.e. the Lord's Supper
   with the specific priesthood.  Secondly, he was the first to designate
   the passio Domini, nay, the sanguis Christi and the dominica hostia as
   the object of the eucharistic offering."  In a foot-note (on the same
   page) he explains that "Sacrificare, Sacrificium celebrare in all
   passages where they are unaccompanied by any qualifying words, mean to
   celebrate the Lord's Supper."  But Harnack is confronted by the very
   evident objection that if this was an invention of St. Cyprian's, it is
   most extraordinary that it raised no protest, and he very frankly
   confesses (note 2, on same page) that "the transference of the
   sacrificial idea to the consecrated elements which in all probability
   Cyprian already found in existence, etc."  Harnack further on (in the
   same note on p. 137) notes that he has pointed out in his notes on the
   Didache that in the "Apostolic Church Order" occurs the expression he
   prosphora tou somatos kai tou haimatos.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60] Harnack seems to know only the printed (and almost certainly
   incorrect) reading of the modern texts of the I. Apology (Chapter LXVI)
   where touto esti has taken the place of toutesti.  The passage did
   read, touto poieite, eis ten anamnesin mou, toutesti to soma mou; in
   which it is evident that the words "my body" are in apposition with
   touto and the object of poieite, which has its sacrificial sense "to
   offer," as in the Dialogue with Trypho, ho kurios hemon paredoke poiein
   (chapter xlj).

   [61] Harnack evidently does not fully appreciate the Catholic doctrine
   of the Sacrifice in the Holy Eucharist.  No catholic theologian teaches
   that the essence of that sacrifice is to offer up the already present
   Body of Christ, but that the essence of the Sacrifice is the act of
   consecration; the "making the Eucharistic Sacrifice," as he accurately
   says, "whereby the common bread becomes the Bread of the Eucharist."
   Harnack says truly that "the sacrificial act of the Christian here also
   is nothing else than an act of prayer," but he does not seem to know
   that this is the Catholic doctrine to-day, nor to appreciate at its
   Catholic value the "Prayer of Consecration."  The act of consecration
   is the essence of the Christian Sacrifice according to the teaching of
   all Catholics.

   Canon VI.

   Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis prevail, that
   the Bishop of Alexandria have jurisdiction in all these, since the like
   is customary for the Bishop of Rome also.  Likewise in Antioch and the
   other provinces, let the Churches retain their privileges.  And this is
   to be universally understood, that if any one be made bishop without
   the consent of the Metropolitan, the great Synod has declared that such
   a man ought not to be a bishop.  If, however, two or three bishops
   shall from natural love of contradiction, oppose the common suffrage of
   the rest, it being reasonable and in accordance with the ecclesiastical
   law, then let the choice of the majority prevail.

   The Bishop of Alexandria shall have jurisdiction over Egypt, Libya, and
   Pentapolis.  As also the Roman bishop over those subject to Rome.  So,
   too, the Bishop of Antioch and the rest over those who are under them.
   If any be a bishop contrary to the judgment of the Metropolitan, let
   him be no bishop.  Provided it be in accordance with the canons by the
   suffrage of the majority, if three object, their objection shall be of
   no force.

   Many, probably most, commentators have considered this the most
   important and most interesting of all the Nicene canons, and a whole
   library of works has been written upon it, some of the works asserting
   and some denying what are commonly called the Papal claims.  If any one
   wishes to see a list of the most famous of these works he will find it
   in Phillips's Kirchenrecht (Bd. ii. S. 35).  I shall reserve what I
   have to say upon this subject to the notes on a canon which seems
   really to deal with it, confining myself here to an elucidation of the
   words found in the canon before us.

   Hammond, W. A.

   The object and intention of this canon seems clearly to have been, not
   to introduce any new powers or regulations into the Church, but to
   confirm and establish ancient customs already existing.  This, indeed,
   is evident from the very first words of it:  "Let the ancient customs
   be maintained."  It appears to have been made with particular reference
   to the case of the Church of Alexandria, which had been troubled by the
   irregular proceedings of Miletius, and to confirm the ancient
   privileges of that see which he had invaded.  The latter part of it,
   however, applies to all Metropolitans, and confirms all their ancient
   privileges.

   Ffoulkes.

   (Dict. Christ. Antiq. voce Council of Nicæa).

   The first half of the canon enacts merely that what had long been
   customary with respect to such persons in every province should become
   law, beginning with the province where this principle had been
   infringed; while the second half declares what was in future to be
   received as law on two points which custom had not as yet expressly
   ruled....Nobody disputes the meaning of this last half; nor, in fact,
   would the meaning of the first half have been questioned, had it not
   included Rome....Nobody can maintain that the bishops of Antioch and
   Alexandria were called patriarchs then, or that the jurisdiction they
   had then was co-extensive with what they had afterward, when they were
   so called....It is on this clause ["since the like is customary for the
   Bishops of Rome also"] standing parenthetically between what is decreed
   for the particular cases of Egypt and Antioch, and in consequence of
   the interpretation given to it by Rufinus, more particularly, that so
   much strife has been raised.  Rufinus may rank low as a translator,
   yet, being a native of Aquileia, he cannot have been ignorant of Roman
   ways, nor, on the other hand, had he greatly misrepresented them, would
   his version have waited till the seventeenth century to be impeached.

   Hefele.

   The sense of the first words of the canon is as follows:  "This ancient
   right is assigned to the Bishop of Alexandria which places under his
   jurisdiction the whole diocese of Egypt."  It is without any reason,
   then, that the French Protestant Salmasius (Saumaise), the Anglican
   Beveridge, and the Gallican Launoy, try to show that the Council of
   Nice granted to the Bishop of Alexandria only the rights of ordinary
   metropolitans.

   Bishop Stillingfleet.

   I do confess there was something peculiar in the case of the Bishop of
   Alexandria, for all the provinces of Egypt were under his immediate
   care, which was Patriarchal as to extent, but Metropolical in the
   administration.

   Justellus.

   This authority (exousia) is that of a Metropolitan which the Nicene
   Fathers decreed to be his due over the three provinces named in this
   canon, Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, which made up the whole diocese of
   Egypt, as well in matters civil as ecclesiastical.

   On this important question Hefele refers to the dissertation of Dupin,
   in his work De Antiqua Ecclesiæ Disciplina.  Hefele says:  "It seems to
   me beyond a doubt that in this canon there is a question about that
   which was afterward called the patriarchate of the Bishop of
   Alexandria; that is to say that he had a certain recognized
   ecclesiastical authority, not only over several civil provinces, but
   also over several ecclesiastical provinces (which had their own
   metropolitans);" and further on (p. 392) he adds:  "It is incontestable
   that the civil provinces of Egypt, Libya, Pentapolis and Thebaïs, which
   were all in subjection to the Bishop of Alexandria, were also
   ecclesiastical provinces with their own metropolitans; and consequently
   it is not the ordinary rights of metropolitans that the Sixth Canon of
   Nice confers on the Bishop of Alexandria, but the rights of a superior
   Metropolitan, that is, of a Patriarch."

   There only remains to see what were the bounds of the jurisdiction of
   the Bishop of Antioch.  The civil diocese of Oriens is shown by the
   Second Canon of Constantinople to be conterminous with what was
   afterward called the Patriarchate of Antioch.  The see of Antioch had,
   as we know, several metropolitans subject to it, among them Cæsarea,
   under whose jurisdiction was Palestine.  Justellus, however, is of
   opinion that Pope Innocent I. was in error when he asserted that all
   the Metropolitans of Oriens were to be ordained by him by any peculiar
   authority, and goes so far as to stigmatize his words as "contrary to
   the mind of the Nicene Synod." [62]

   Excursus on the Extent of the Jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome Over
   the Suburbican Churches.

   Although, as Hefele well says, "It is evident that the Council has not
   in view here the primacy of the Bishop of Rome over the whole Church,
   but simply his power as a patriarch," yet it may not be unimportant to
   consider what his patriarchal limits may have been.

   (Hefele, Hist. Councils, Vol. I., p. 397.)

   The translation of this [VI.] canon by Rufinus has been especially an
   apple of discord.  Et ut apud Alexandriam et in urbe Roma vetusta
   consuetudo servetur, ut vel ille Egypti vel hic suburbicariarum
   ecclesiarum sollicitudinem gerat.  In the seventeenth century this
   sentence of Rufinus gave rise to a very lively discussion between the
   celebrated jurist, Jacob Gothfried (Gothofredus), and his friend,
   Salmasius, on one side, and the Jesuit, Sirmond, on the other.  The
   great prefecture of Italy, which contained about a third of the whole
   Roman Empire, was divided into four vicariates, among which the
   vicariate of Rome was the first.  At its head were two officers, the
   proefectus urbi and the vicarius urbis.  The proefectus urbi exercised
   authority over the city of Rome, and further in a suburban circle as
   far as the hundredth milestone.  The boundary of the vicarius urbis
   comprised ten provinces--Campania, Tuscia with Ombria, Picenum,
   Valeria, Samnium, Apulia with Calabria, Lucania and that of the Brutii,
   Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica.  Gothfried and Salmasius maintained,
   that by the regiones suburbicariæ the little territory of the
   proefectus urbi must be understood; while, according to Sirmond, these
   words designate the whole territory of the vicarius urbis.  In our time
   Dr. Maasen has proved in his book, [63] already quoted several times,
   that Gothfried and Salmasius were right in maintaining that, by the
   regiones suburbicariæ, the little territory of the proefectus urbi must
   be alone understood.

   Hefele thinks that Phillips "has proved" that the Bishop of Rome had
   patriarchal rights over places outside the limits of the ten provinces
   of the vicarius urbis; but does not agree with Phillips in thinking
   Rufinus in error.  As a matter of fact the point is a difficult one,
   and has little to do with the gist of the meaning of the canon.  One
   thing is certain:  the early Latin version of the canons, called the
   Prisca, was not satisfied with the Greek wording and made the Canon
   read thus:  "It is of ancient custom that the bishop of the city of
   Rome should have a primacy (principatum), so that he should govern with
   care the suburban places, and all his own province." [64]   Another
   interesting reading is that found in several mss. which begins, "The
   Church of Rome hath always had a primacy (primatum)," and as a matter
   of fact the early date of this addition is evinced by the fact that the
   canon was actually quoted in this shape by Paschasinus at the Council
   of Chalcedon.

   Hefele further on says, "The Greek commentators Zonaras and Balsamon
   (of the twelfth century) say very explicitly, in their explanation of
   the Canons of Nice, that this sixth canon confirms the rights of the
   Bishop of Rome as patriarch over the whole West," and refers to
   Beveridge's Synodicon, Tom. I., pp. 66 and 67.  After diligent search I
   can find nothing to warrant the great amplitude of this statement.
   Balsamon's interpretation is very vague, being simply that the Bishop
   of Rome is over the Western Eparchies (ton hesperion eparchion) and
   Zonaras still more vaguely says that ton hesperion archein ethos
   ekratese.  That the whole West was in a general way understood to be in
   the Roman Patriarchate I have no doubt, that the Greek scholiasts just
   quoted deemed it to be so I think most probably the case, but it does
   not seem to me that they have said so in the particular place cited.
   It seems to me that all they meant to say was that the custom observed
   at Alexandria and Antioch was no purely Eastern and local thing, for a
   similar state of affairs was found in the West.

   Canon VII.

   Since custom and ancient tradition have prevailed that the Bishop of
   Ælia [i.e., Jerusalem] should be honoured, let him, saving its due
   dignity to the Metropolis, have the next place of honour.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   Let the Bishop of Ælia be honoured, the rights of the Metropolis being
   preserved intact.

   There would seem to be a singular fitness in the Holy City Jerusalem
   holding a very exalted position among the sees of Christendom, and it
   may appear astonishing that in the earliest times it was only a
   suffragan see to the great Church of Cæsarea.  It must be remembered,
   however, that only about seventy years after our Lord's death the city
   of Jerusalem was entirely destroyed and ploughed as a field according
   to the prophet.  As a holy city Jerusalem was a thing of the past for
   long years, and it is only in the beginning of the second century that
   we find a strong Christian Church growing up in the rapidly increasing
   city, called no longer Jerusalem, but Ælia Capitolina.  Possibly by the
   end of the second century the idea of the holiness of the site began to
   lend dignity to the occupant of the see; at all events Eusebius [65]
   tells us that "at a synod held on the subject of the Easter controversy
   in the time of Pope Victor, Theophilus of Cæsarea and Narcissus of
   Jerusalem were presidents."

   It was this feeling of reverence which induced the passing of this
   seventh canon.  It is very hard to determine just what was the
   "precedence" granted to the Bishop of Ælia, nor is it clear which is
   the metropolis referred to in the last clause.  Most writers, including
   Hefele, Balsamon, Aristenus and Beveridge consider it to be Cæsarea;
   while Zonaras thinks Jerusalem to be intended, a view recently adopted
   and defended by Fuchs; [66] others again suppose it is Antioch that is
   referred to.

   Excursus on the Rise of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem.

   The narrative of the successive steps by which the See of Jerusalem
   rose from being nothing but Ælia, a Gentile city, into one of the five
   patriarchal sees is sad reading for a Christian.  It is but the record
   of ambition and, worse still, of knavery.  No Christian can for a
   moment grudge to the Holy City of the old dispensation the honour shewn
   it by the Church, but he may well wish that the honour had been
   otherwise obtained.  A careful study of such records as we possess
   shews that until the fifth century the Metropolitan of Cæsarea as often
   took precedence of the Bishop of Jerusalem as vice versa, and Beveridge
   has taken great pains to shew that the learned De Marca is in error in
   supposing that the Council of Nice assigned to Jerusalem a dignity
   superior to Cæsarea, and only inferior to Rome, Alexandria, and
   Antioch.  It is true that in the signatures the Bishop of Jerusalem
   does sign before his metropolitan, but to this Beveridge justly replies
   that the same is the case with the occupants of two other of his
   suffragan sees.  Bishop Beveridge's opinion is that the Council
   assigned Jerusalem the second place in the province, such as London
   enjoys in the Province of Canterbury.  This, however, would seem to be
   as much too little as De Marca's contention grants too much.  It is
   certain that almost immediately after the Council had adjourned, the
   Bishop of Jerusalem, Maximus, convoked a synod of Palestine, without
   any reference to Cæsarea, which consecrated bishops and acquitted St.
   Athanasius.  It is true that he was reprimanded for doing so, [67] but
   yet it clearly shews how he intended to understand the action of Nice.
   The matter was not decided for a century more, and then through the
   chicanery of Juvenal the bishop of Jerusalem.

   (Canon Venables, Dict. Christ. Biography.)

   Juvenalis succeeded Praylius as bishop of Jerusalem somewhere about 420
   a.d.  The exact year cannot be determined.  The episcopate of Praylius,
   which commenced in 417 a.d., was but short, and we can hardly give it
   at most more than three years.  The statement of Cyril of Scythopolis,
   in his Life of St. Euthymius (c. 96), that Juvenal died "in the
   forty-fourth year of his episcopate," 458 a.d., is certainly incorrect,
   as it would make his episcopate begin in 414 a.d., three years before
   that of his predecessor.  Juvenal occupies a prominent position during
   the Nestorian and Eutychian troubles towards the middle of the fifth
   century.  But the part played by him at the councils of Ephesus and
   Chalcedon, as well as at the disgraceful lestrike sunodos of 449, was
   more conspicuous than creditable, and there are few of the actors in
   these turbulent and saddening scenes who leave a more unpleasing
   impression.  The ruling object of Juvenal's episcopate, to which
   everything else was secondary, and which guided all his conduct, was
   the elevation of the see of Jerusalem from the subordinate position it
   held in accordance with the seventh of the canons of the council of
   Nicæa, as suffragan to the metropolitan see of Cæsarea, to a primary
   place in the episcopate.  Not content with aspiring to metropolitan
   rank, Juvenal coveted patriarchal dignity, and, in defiance of all
   canonical authority, he claimed jurisdiction over the great see of
   Antioch, from which he sought to remove Arabia and the two Phoenicias
   to his own province.  At the council of Ephesus, in 431, he asserted
   for "the apostolic see of Jerusalem the same rank and authority with
   the apostolic see of Rome" (Labbe, Concil. iii. 642).  These falsehoods
   he did not scruple to support with forged documents ("insolenter ausus
   per commentitia scripta firmare," Leo. Mag. Ep. 119 [92]), and other
   disgraceful artifices.  Scarcely had Juvenal been consecrated bishop of
   Jerusalem when he proceeded to assert his claims to the metropolitan
   rank by his acts.  In the letter of remonstrance against the
   proceedings of the council of Ephesus, sent to Theodosius by the
   Oriental party, they complain that Juvenal, whose "ambitious designs
   and juggling tricks" they are only too well acquainted with, had
   ordained in provinces over which he had no jurisdiction (Labbe, Concil.
   iii. 728).  This audacious attempt to set at nought the Nicene decrees,
   and to falsify both history and tradition was regarded with the utmost
   indignation by the leaders of the Christian church.  Cyril of
   Alexandria shuddered at the impious design ("merito perhorrescens,"
   Leo. u. s.), and wrote to Leo, then archdeacon of Rome, informing him
   of what Juvenal was undertaking, and begging that his unlawful attempts
   might have no sanction from the apostolic See ("ut nulla illicitis
   conatibus præberetur assensio," u. s.).  Juvenal, however, was far too
   useful an ally in his campaign against Nestorius for Cyril lightly to
   discard.  When the council met at Ephesus Juvenal was allowed, without
   the slightest remonstrance, to take precedence of his metropolitan of
   Cæsarea, and to occupy the position of vice-president of the council,
   coming next after Cyril himself (Labbe, Concil. iii. 445), and was
   regarded in all respects as the second prelate in the assembly.  The
   arrogant assertion of his supremacy over the bishop of Antioch, and his
   claim to take rank next after Rome as an apostolical see, provoked no
   open remonstrance, and his pretensions were at least tacitly allowed.
   At the next council, the disgraceful Latrocinium, Juvenal occupied the
   third place, after Dioscorus and the papal legate, having been
   specially named by Theodosius, together with Thalassius of Cæsarea (who
   appears to have taken no umbrage at his suffragan being preferred
   before him), as next in authority to Dioscorus (Labbe, Concil. iv.
   109), and he took a leading part in the violent proceedings of that
   assembly.  When the council of Chalcedon met, one of the matters which
   came before it for settlement was the dispute as to priority between
   Juvenal and Maximus Bishop of Antioch.  The contention was long and
   severe.  It ended in a compromise agreed on in the Seventh Action, meta
   pollen philoneikian .  Juvenal surrendered his claim to the two
   Phoenicias and to Arabia, on condition of his being allowed
   metropolitical jurisdiction over the three Palestines (Labbe, Concil.
   iv. 613).  The claim to patriarchal authority over the Bishop of
   Antioch put forward at Ephesus was discreetly dropped.  The difficulty
   presented by the Nicene canon does not appear to have presented itself
   to the council, nor was any one found to urge the undoubted claims of
   the see of Cæsarea.  The terms arranged between Maximus and Juvenal
   were regarded as satisfactory, and received the consent of the
   assembled bishops (ibid. 618).  Maximus, however, was not long in
   repenting of his too ready acquiescence in Juvenal's demands, and wrote
   a letter of complaint to pope Leo, who replied by the letter which has
   been already quoted, dated June 11, 453 a.d., in which he upheld the
   binding authority of the Nicene canons, and commenting in the strongest
   terms on the greediness and ambition of Juvenal, who allowed no
   opportunity of forwarding his ends to be lost, declared that as far as
   he was concerned he would do all he could to maintain the ancient
   dignity of the see of Antioch (Leo Magn. Ep. ad Maximum, 119 [92]).  No
   further action, however, seems to have been taken either by Leo or by
   Maximus.  Juvenal was left master of the situation, and the church of
   Jerusalem has from that epoch peaceably enjoyed the patriarchal dignity
   obtained for it by such base means.

   Canon VIII.

   Concerning those who call themselves Cathari, if they come over to the
   Catholic and Apostolic Church, the great and holy Synod decrees that
   they who are ordained shall continue as they are in the clergy.  But it
   is before all things necessary that they should profess in writing that
   they will observe and follow the dogmas of the Catholic and Apostolic
   Church; in particular that they will communicate with persons who have
   been twice married, and with those who having lapsed in persecution
   have had a period [of penance] laid upon them, and a time [of
   restoration] fixed so that in all things they will follow the dogmas of
   the Catholic Church.  Wheresoever, then, whether in villages or in
   cities, all of the ordained are found to be of these only, let them
   remain in the clergy, and in the same rank in which they are found.
   But if they come over where there is a bishop or presbyter of the
   Catholic Church, it is manifest that the Bishop of the Church must have
   the bishop's dignity; and he who was named bishop by those who are
   called Cathari shall have the rank of presbyter, unless it shall seem
   fit to the Bishop to admit him to partake in the honour of the title.
   Or, if this should not be satisfactory, then shall the bishop provide
   for him a place as Chorepiscopus, or presbyter, in order that he may be
   evidently seen to be of the clergy, and that there may not be two
   bishops in the city.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   If those called Cathari come over, let them first make profession that
   they are willing to communicate with the twice married, and to grant
   pardon to the lapsed.  And on this condition he who happens to be in
   orders, shall continue in the same order, so that a bishop shall still
   be bishop.  Whoever was a bishop among the Cathari let him, however,
   become a Chorepiscopus, or let him enjoy the honour of a presbyter or
   of a bishop.  For in one church there shall not be two bishops.

   The Cathari or Novatians were the followers of Novatian, a presbyter of
   Rome, who had been a Stoic philosopher and was delivered, according to
   his own story, from diabolical possession at his exorcising by the
   Church before his baptism, when becoming a Catechumen.  Being in peril
   of death by illness he received clinical baptism, and was ordained
   priest without any further sacred rites being administered to him.
   During the persecution he constantly refused to assist his brethren,
   and afterwards raised his voice against what he considered their
   culpable laxity in admitting to penance the lapsed.  Many agreed with
   him in this, especially of the clergy, and eventually, in a.d. 251, he
   induced three bishops to consecrate him, thus becoming, as Fleury
   remarks, [68] "the first Anti-Pope."  His indignation was principally
   spent upon Pope Cornelius, and to overthrow the prevailing discipline
   of the Church he ordained bishops and sent them to different parts of
   the empire as the disseminators of his error.  It is well to remember
   that while beginning only as a schismatic, he soon fell into heresy,
   denying that the Church had the power to absolve the lapsed.  Although
   condemned by several councils his sect continued on, and like the
   Montanists they rebaptized Catholics who apostatized to them, and
   absolutely rejected all second marriages.  At the time of the Council
   of Nice the Novatian bishop at Constantinople, Acesius, was greatly
   esteemed, and although a schismatic, was invited to attend the
   council.  After having in answer to the emperor's enquiry whether he
   was willing to sign the Creed, assured him that he was, he went on to
   explain that his separation was because the Church no longer observed
   the ancient discipline which forbade that those who had committed
   mortal sin should ever be readmitted to communion.  According to the
   Novatians he might be exhorted to repentance, but the Church had no
   power to assure him of forgiveness but must leave him to the judgment
   of God.  It was then that Constantine said, "Acesius, take a ladder,
   and climb up to heaven alone." [69]

   Aristenus.

   If any of them be bishops or chorepiscopi they shall remain in the same
   rank, unless perchance in the same city there be found a bishop of the
   Catholic Church, ordained before their coming.  For in this case he
   that was properly bishop from the first shall have the preference, and
   he alone shall retain the Episcopal throne.  For it is not right that
   in the same city there should be two bishops.  But he who by the
   Cathari was called bishop, shall be honoured as a presbyter, or (if it
   so please the bishop), he shall be sharer of the title bishop; but he
   shall exercise no episcopal jurisdiction.

   Zonaras, Balsamon, Beveridge and Van Espen, are of opinion that
   cheirothetoumenous does not mean that they are to receive a new laying
   on of hands at their reception into the Church, but that it refers to
   their already condition of being ordained, the meaning being that as
   they have had Novatian ordination they must be reckoned among the
   clergy.  Dionysius Exiguus takes a different view, as does also the
   Prisca version, according to which the clergy of the Novatians were to
   receive a laying on of hands, cheirothetoumenous, but that it was not
   to be a reordination.  With this interpretation Hefele seems to agree,
   founding his opinion upon the fact that the article is wanting before
   cheirothetoumenous, and that autous is added.  Gratian [70] supposes
   that this eighth canon orders a re-ordination.

   Excursus on the Chorepiscopi.

   There has been much difference of opinion among the learned touching
   the status of the Chorepiscopus in the early Church.  The main question
   in dispute is as to whether they were always, sometimes, or never, in
   episcopal orders.  Most Anglican writers, including Beveridge, Hammond,
   Cave, and Routh, have affirmed the first proposition, that they were
   true bishops, but that, out of respect to the bishop of the City they
   were forbidden the exercise of certain of their episcopal functions,
   except upon extraordinary occasions.  With this view Binterim [71] also
   agrees, and Augusti is of the same opinion. [72]   But Thomassinus is
   of a different mind, thinking, so says Hefele, [73] that there were
   "two classes of chorepiscopi, of whom the one were real bishops, while
   the other had only the title without consecration."

   The third opinion, that they were merely presbyters, is espoused by
   Morinus and Du Cange, and others who are named by Bingham. [74]   This
   last opinion is now all but universally rejected, to the other two we
   shall now devote our attention.

   For the first opinion no one can speak more learnedly nor more
   authoritatively than Arthur West Haddon, who writes as follows;

   (Haddon, Dict. Christ. Antiq. s.v. Chorepiscopus.)

   The chorepiscopus was called into existence in the latter part of the
   third century, and first in Asia Minor, in order to meet the want of
   episcopal supervision in the country parts of the now enlarged dioceses
   without subdivision.  [They are] first mentioned in the Councils of
   Ancyra and Neo-Cæsarea a.d. 314, and again in the Council of Nice
   (which is subscribed by fifteen, all from Asia Minor or Syria).  [They
   became] sufficiently important to require restriction by the time of
   the Council of Antioch, a.d. 341; and continued to exist in the East
   until at least the ninth century, when they were supplanted by
   exarchoi.  [Chorepiscopi are] first mentioned in the West in the
   Council of Riez, a.d. 439 (the Epistles of Pope Damasus I. and of Leo.
   M. respecting them being forgeries), and continued there (but not in
   Africa, principally in France) until about the tenth century, after
   which the name occurs (in a decree of Pope Damasus II. ap. Sigeb. in
   an. 1048) as equivalent to archdeacon, an office from which the Arabic
   Nicene canons expressly distinguish it.  The functions of chorepiscopi,
   as well as their name, were of an episcopal, not of a presbyterial
   kind, although limited to minor offices.  They overlooked the country
   district committed to them, "loco episcopi," ordaining readers,
   exorcists, subdeacons, but, as a rule, not deacons or presbyters (and
   of course not bishops), unless by express permission of their diocesan
   bishop.  They confirmed in their own districts, and (in Gaul) are
   mentioned as consecrating churches (vide Du Cange).  They granted
   eirenikai, or letters dimissory, which country presbyters were
   forbidden to do.  They had also the honorary privilege (timomenoi ) of
   assisting at the celebration of the Holy Eucharist in the mother city
   church, which country presbyters had not (Conc. Ancyr. can. xiii.;
   Neo-Cæsar. can. xiv.; Antioch, can. x.; St. Basil M. Epist. 181; Rab.
   Maur. De Instit. Cler. i. 5, etc. etc.).  They were held therefore to
   have power of ordination, but to lack jurisdiction, save
   subordinately.  And the actual ordination of a presbyter by Timotheus,
   a chorepiscopus, is recorded (Pallad., Hist. Lausiac. 106).

   In the West, i.e. chiefly in Gaul, the order appears to have prevailed
   more widely, to have usurped episcopal functions without due
   subordination to the diocesans, and to have been also taken advantage
   of by idle or worldly diocesans.  In consequence it seems to have
   aroused a strong feeling of hostility, which showed itself, first in a
   series of papal bulls, condemning them; headed, it is true, by two
   forged letters respectively of Damasus I. and Leo. M. (of which the
   latter is merely an interpolated version of Conc. Hispal. II. a.d. 619,
   can. 7, adding chorepiscopi to presbyteri, of which latter the council
   really treats), but continuing in a more genuine form, from Leo III.
   down to Pope Nicholas I. (to Rodolph, Archbishop of Bourges, a.d. 864);
   the last of whom, however, takes the more moderate line of affirming
   chorepiscopi to be really bishops, and consequently refusing to annul
   their ordinations of presbyters and deacons (as previous popes had
   done), but orders them to keep within canonical limits; and secondly,
   in a series of conciliar decrees, Conc. Ratispon. a.d. 800, in Capit.
   lib. iv. c. 1, Paris. a.d. 829, lib. i.c. 27; Meld. a.d. 845, can. 44;
   Metens. a.d. 888, can. 8, and Capitul. v. 168, vi. 119, vii. 187, 310,
   323, 324, annulling all episcopal acts of chorepiscopi, and ordering
   them to be repeated by "true" bishops; and finally forbidding all
   further appointments of chorepiscopi at all.

   That chorepiscopi as such--i.e. omitting the cases of reconciled or
   vacant bishops above mentioned, of whose episcopate of course no
   question is made--were at first truly bishops both in East and West,
   appears almost certain, both from their name and functions, and even
   from the arguments of their strong opponents just spoken of.  If
   nothing more could be urged against them, than that the Council of
   Neo-Cæsarea compared them to the Seventy disciples, that the Council of
   Antioch authorises their consecration by a single bishop, and that they
   actually were so consecrated (the Antiochene decree might mean merely
   nomination by the word ginesthai, but the actual history seems to rule
   the term to intend consecration, and the [one] exceptional case of a
   chorepiscopus recorded [Actt. Episc. Cenoman. ap. Du Cange] in late
   times to have been ordained by three bishops [in order that he might be
   a full bishop] merely proves the general rule to the contrary)--and
   that they were consecrated for "villages," contrary to canon,--then
   they certainly were bishops.  And Pope Nicholas expressly says that
   they were so.  Undoubtedly they ceased to be so in the East, and were
   practically merged in archdeacons in the West.

   For the second opinion, its great champion, Thomassinus shall speak.

   (Thomassin, Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l'Église, Tom. I. Livre
   II. chap 1. § iii.)

   The chorepiscopi were not duly consecrated bishops, unless some bishop
   had consecrated a bishop for a town and the bishop thus ordained
   contrary to the canons was tolerated on condition of his submitting
   himself to the diocesan as though he were only a chorepiscopus.  This
   may be gathered from the fifty-seventh canon of Laodicea.

   From this canon two conclusions may be drawn, 1st. That bishops ought
   not to be ordained for villages, and that as Chorepiscopi could only be
   placed in villages they could not be bishops.  2d. That sometimes by
   accident a chorepiscopus might be a bishop, but only through having
   been canonically lowered to that rank.

   The Council of Nice furnishes another example of a bishop lowered to
   the rank of a chorepiscopus in Canon viii.  This canon shows that they
   should not have been bishops, for two bishops could never be in a
   diocese, although this might accidentally be the case when a
   chorepiscopus happened to be a bishop.

   This is the meaning which must be given to the tenth canon of Antioch,
   which directs that chorepiscopi, even if they have received episcopal
   orders, and have been consecrated bishops, shall keep within the limits
   prescribed by the canon; that in cases of necessity, they ordain the
   lower clergy; but that they be careful not to ordain priests or
   deacons, because this power is absolutely reserved to the Diocesan.  It
   must be added that as the council of Antioch commands that the Diocesan
   without any other bishop can ordain the chorepiscopus, the position can
   no longer be sustained that the chorepiscopi were bishops, such a
   method of consecrating a bishop being contrary to canon xix. of the
   same council, moreover the canon does not say the chorepiscopus is to
   be ordained, but uses the word genesthai by the bishop of the city
   (canon x.).  The Council of Neocæsarea by referring them to the seventy
   disciples (in Canon XIV.) has shown the chorepiscopi to be only
   priests.

   But the Council of Ancyra does furnish a difficulty, for the text seems
   to permit chorepiscopi to ordain priests.  But the Greek text must be
   corrected by the ancient Latin versions.  The letter attributed to pope
   Nicholas, a.d. 864, must be considered a forgery since he recognises
   the chorepiscopi as real bishops.

   If Harmenopulus, Aristenus, Balsamon, and Zonaras seem to accord to the
   chorepiscopi the power to ordain priests and deacons with the
   permission of the Diocesan, it is because they are explaining the
   meaning and setting forth the practice of the ancient councils and not
   the practice of their own times.  But at all events it is past all
   doubt that before the seventh century there were, by different
   accidents, chorepiscopi who were really bishops and that these could,
   with the consent of the diocesan, ordain priests.  But at the time
   these authors wrote, there was not a single chorepiscopus in the entire
   East, as Balsamon frankly admits in commenting on Canon xiii. of
   Ancyra.

   Whether in the foregoing the reader will think Thomassinus has proved
   his point, I do not know, but so far as the position of the
   chorepiscopi in synods is concerned there can be no doubt whatever, and
   I shall allow Hefele to speak on this point.

   (Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. I. pp. 17, 18.)

   The Chorepiscopi (chorepiskopoi), or bishops of country places, seem to
   have been considered in ancient times as quite on a par with the other
   bishops, as far as their position in synod was concerned.  We meet with
   them at the Councils of Neocæsarea in the year 314, of Nicæa in 325, of
   Ephesus in 431.  On the other hand, among the 600 bishops of the fourth
   Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451, there is no chorepiscopus
   present, for by this time the office had been abolished; but in the
   Middle Ages we again meet with chorepiscopi of a new kind at Western
   councils, particularly at those of the French Church, at Langres in
   830, at Mayence in 847, at Pontion in 876, at Lyons in 886, at Douzy in
   871.

   Canon IX.

   If any presbyters have been advanced without examination, or if upon
   examination they have made confession of crime, and men acting in
   violation of the canon have laid hands upon them, notwithstanding their
   confession, such the canon does not admit; for the Catholic Church
   requires that [only] which is blameless.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   Whoever are ordained without examination, shall be deposed if it be
   found out afterwards that they had been guilty.

   Hefele.

   The crimes in question are those which were a bar to the
   priesthood--such as blasphemy, bigamy, heresy, idolatry, magic,
   etc.--as the Arabic paraphrase of Joseph explains.  It is clear that
   these faults are punishable in the bishop no less than in the priest,
   and that consequently our canon refers to the bishops as well as to the
   presbuteroi in the more restricted sense.  These words of the Greek
   text, "In the case in which any one might be induced, in opposition to
   the canon, to ordain such persons," allude to the ninth canon of the
   Synod of Neocæsarea.  It was necessary to pass such ordinances; for
   even in the fifth century, as the twenty-second letter to Pope Innocent
   the First testifies, some held that as baptism effaces all former sins,
   so it takes away all the impedimenta ordinationis which are the results
   of those sins.

   Balsamon.

   Some say that as baptism makes the baptized person a new man, so
   ordination takes away the sins committed before ordination, which
   opinion does not seem to agree with the canons.

   This canon occurs twice in the Corpus Juris Canonici.  Decretum Pars I.
   Dist. xxiv. c. vij., and Dist. lxxxj., c. iv.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon X.

   If any who have lapsed have been ordained through the ignorance, or
   even with the previous knowledge of the ordainers, this shall not
   prejudice the canon of the Church; for when they are discovered they
   shall be deposed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   Whoso had lapsed are to be deposed whether those who ordained and
   promoted them did so conscious of their guilt or unknowing of it.

   Hefele.

   The tenth canon differs from the ninth, inasmuch as it concerns only
   the lapsi and their elevation, not only to the priesthood, but to any
   other ecclesiastical preferment as well, and requires their
   deposition.  The punishment of a bishop who should consciously perform
   such an ordination is not mentioned; but it is incontestable that the
   lapsi could not be ordained, even after having performed penance; for,
   as the preceding canon states, the Church requires those who were
   faultless.  It is to be observed that the word procheirizein is
   evidently employed here in the sense of "ordain," and is used without
   any distinction from cheirizein, whilst in the synodal letter of the
   Council of Nicæa on the subject of the Meletians, there is a
   distinction between these two words, and procheirizein is used to
   signify eligere.

   This canon is found in Corpus Juris Canonici.  Decretum.  Pars I.

   Canon XI.

   Concerning those who have fallen without compulsion, without the
   spoiling of their property, without danger or the like, as happened
   during the tyranny of Licinius, the Synod declares that, though they
   have deserved no clemency, they shall be dealt with mercifully.  As
   many as were communicants, if they heartily repent, shall pass three
   years among the hearers; for seven years they shall be prostrators; and
   for two years they shall communicate with the people in prayers, but
   without oblation.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   As many as fell without necessity, even if therefore undeserving of
   indulgence, yet some indulgence shall be shown them and they shall be
   prostrators for twelve years.

   On the expression "without oblation" (choris prosphoras) see the notes
   to Ancyra, Canon V. where the matter is treated at some length.

   Lambert.

   The usual position of the hearers was just inside the church door.  But
   Zonaras (and Balsamon agrees with him), in his comment on this canon,
   says, "they are ordered for three years to be hearers, or to stand
   without the church in the narthex."

   I have read "as many as were communicants" (hoi pistoi) thus following
   Dr. Routh.  Vide his Opuscula.  Caranza translates in his Summary of
   the Councils "if they were faithful" and seems to have read ei pistoi,
   which is much simpler and makes better sense.

   Zonaras.

   The prostrators stood within the body of the church behind the ambo
   [i.e. the reading desk] and went out with the catechumens.

   Excursus on the Public Discipline or Exomologesis of the Early Church.

   (Taken chiefly from Morinus, De Disciplina in Administratione
   Sacramenti Poenitentiæ; Bingham, Antiquities; and Hammond, The
   Definitions of Faith, etc.  Note to Canon XI. of Nice.)

   "In the Primitive Church there was a godly discipline, that at the
   beginning of Lent, such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin
   were put to open penance, and punished in this world that their souls
   might be saved in the day of the Lord; and that others, admonished by
   their example, might be the more afraid to offend."

   The foregoing words from the Commination Service of the Church of
   England may serve well to introduce this subject.  In the history of
   the public administration of discipline in the Church, there are three
   periods sufficiently distinctly marked.  The first of these ends at the
   rise of Novatianism in the middle of the second century; the second
   stretches down to about the eighth century; and the third period shews
   its gradual decline to its practical abandonment in the eleventh
   century.  The period with which we are concerned is the second, when it
   was in full force.

   In the first period it would seem that public penance was required only
   of those convicted of what then were called by pre-eminence "mortal
   sins" (crimena mortalia [75] ), viz:  idolatry, murder, and adultery.
   But in the second period the list of mortal sins was greatly enlarged,
   and Morinus says that "Many Fathers who wrote after Augustine's time,
   extended the necessity of public penance to all crimes which the civil
   law punished with death, exile, or other grave corporal penalty." [76]
     In the penitential canons ascribed to St. Basil and those which pass
   by the name of St. Gregory Nyssen, this increase of offences requiring
   public penance will be found intimated.

   From the fourth century the penitents of the Church were divided into
   four classes.  Three of these are mentioned in the eleventh canon, the
   fourth, which is not here referred to, was composed of those styled
   sunklaiontes, flentes or weepers.  These were not allowed to enter into
   the body of the church at all, but stood or lay outside the gates,
   sometimes covered with sackcloth and ashes.  This is the class which is
   sometimes styled cheimozomenoi, hybernantes, on account of their being
   obliged to endure the inclemency of the weather.

   It may help to the better understanding of this and other canons which
   notice the different orders of penitents, to give a brief account of
   the usual form and arrangement of the ancient churches as well as of
   the different orders of the penitents.

   Before the church there was commonly either an open area surrounded
   with porticoes, called mesaulion or atrium, with a font of water in the
   centre, styled a cantharus or phiala, or sometimes only an open
   portico, or propulaion.  The first variety may still be seen at S.
   Ambrogio's in Milan, and the latter in Rome at S. Lorenzo's, and in
   Ravenna at the two S. Apollinares.  This was the place at which the
   first and lowest order of penitents, the weepers, already referred to,
   stood exposed to the weather.  Of these, St. Gregory Thaumaturgus
   says:  "Weeping takes place outside the door of the church, where the
   sinner must stand and beg the prayers of the faithful as they go in."

   The church itself usually consisted of three divisions within, besides
   these exterior courts and porch.  The first part after passing through
   "the great gates," or doors of the building, was called the Narthex in
   Greek, and Færula in Latin, and was a narrow vestibule extending the
   whole width of the church.  In this part, to which Jews and Gentiles,
   and in most places even heretics and schismatics were admitted, stood
   the Catechumens, and the Energumens or those afflicted with evil
   spirits, and the second class of penitents (the first mentioned in the
   Canon), who were called the akoomenoi, audientes, or hearers.  These
   were allowed to hear the Scriptures read, and the Sermon preached, but
   were obliged to depart before the celebration of the Divine Mysteries,
   with the Catechumens, and the others who went by the general name of
   hearers only.

   The second division, or main body of the church, was called the Naos or
   Nave.  This was separated from the Narthex by rails of wood, with gates
   in the centre, which were called "the beautiful or royal gates."  In
   the middle of the Nave, but rather toward the lower or entrance part of
   it, stood the Ambo, or reading-desk, the place for the readers and
   singers, to which they went up by steps, whence the name, Ambo.  Before
   coming to the Ambo, in the lowest part of the Nave, and just after
   passing the royal gates, was the place for the third order of
   penitents, called in Greek gonuklinontes, or hupopiptontes, and in
   Latin Genuflectentes or Prostrati, i.e., kneelers or prostrators,
   because they were allowed to remain and join in certain prayers
   particularly made for them.  Before going out they prostrated
   themselves to receive the imposition of the bishop's hands with
   prayer.  This class of penitents left with the Catechumens.

   In the other parts of the Nave stood the believers or faithful, i.e.,
   those persons who were in full communion with the Church, the men and
   women generally on opposite sides, though in some places the men were
   below, and the women in galleries above.  Amongst these were the fourth
   class of penitents, who were called sunestotes, consistentes, i.e.,
   co-standers, because they were allowed to stand with the faithful, and
   to remain and hear the prayers of the Church, after the Catechumens and
   the other penitents were dismissed, and to be present while the
   faithful offered and communicated, though they might not themselves
   make their offerings, nor partake of the Holy Communion.  This class of
   penitents are frequently mentioned in the canons, as "communicating in
   prayers," or "without the oblation;" and it was the last grade to be
   passed through previous to the being admitted again to full communion.
   The practice of "hearing mass" or "non-communicating attendance"
   clearly had its origin in this stage of discipline.  At the upper end
   of the body of the church, and divided from it by rails which were
   called Cancelli, was that part which we now call the Chancel.  This was
   anciently called by several names, as Bema or tribunal, from its being
   raised above the body of the church, and Sacrarium or Sanctuary.  It
   was also called Apsis and Concha Bematis, from its semicircular end.
   In this part stood the Altar, or Holy Table (which names were
   indifferently used in the primitive Church), behind which, and against
   the wall of the chancel, was the Bishop's throne, with the seats of the
   Presbyters on each side of it, called synthronus.  On one side of the
   chancel was the repository for the sacred utensils and vestments,
   called the Diaconicum, and answering to our Vestry; and on the other
   the Prothesis, a side-table, or place, where the bread and wine were
   deposited before they were offered on the Altar.  The gates in the
   chancel rail were called the holy gates, and none but the higher orders
   of the clergy, i.e., Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, were allowed to
   enter within them.  The Emperor indeed was permitted to do so for the
   purpose of making his offering at the Altar, but then he was obliged to
   retire immediately, and to receive the communion without.

   (Thomassin.  Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l'Eglise.  Tom. I.
   Livre II. chap. xvj. somewhat abridged.)

   In the West there existed always many cases of public penance, but in
   the East it is more difficult to find any traces of it, after it was
   abolished by the Patriarch Nectarius in the person of the Grand
   Penitentiary.

   However, the Emperor Alexis Comnenus, who took the empire in the year
   1080, did a penance like that of older days, and one which may well
   pass for miraculous.  He called together a large number of bishops with
   the patriarch, and some holy religious; he presented himself before
   them in the garb of a criminal; he confessed to them his crime of
   usurpation with all its circumstances.  They condemned the Emperor and
   all his accomplices to fasting, to lying prostrate upon the earth, to
   wearing haircloth, and to all the other ordinary austerities of
   penance.  Their wives desired to share their griefs and their
   sufferings, although they had had no share in their crime.  The whole
   palace became a theatre of sorrow and public penance.  The emperor wore
   the hairshirt under the purple, and lay upon the earth for forty days,
   having only a stone for a pillow.

   To all practical purposes Public Penance was a general institution but
   for a short while in the Church.  But the reader must be careful to
   distinguish between this Public Penance and the private confession
   which in the Catholic Church both East and West is universally
   practised.  What Nectarius did was to abolish the office of
   Penitentiary, whose duty it had been to assign public penance for
   secret sin; [77] a thing wholly different from what Catholics
   understand by the "Sacrament of Penance."  It would be out of place to
   do more in this place than to call the reader's attention to the bare
   fact, and to supply him, from a Roman Catholic point of view, with an
   explanation of why Public Penance died out.  "It came to an end because
   it was of human institution.  But sacramental confession, being of
   divine origin, lasted when the penitential discipline had been changed,
   and continues to this day among the Greeks and Oriental sects." [78]
   That the reader may judge of the absolute candour of the writer just
   quoted, I give a few sentences from the same article:  "An opinion,
   however, did prevail to some extent in the middle ages, even among
   Catholics, that confession to God alone sufficed.  The Council of
   Châlons in 813 (canon xxxiij.), says:  Some assert that we should
   confess our sins to God alone, but some think that they should be
   confessed to the priest, each of which practices is followed not
   without great fruit in Holy Church....Confession made to God purges
   sins, but that made to the priest teaches how they are to be purged.'
   This former opinion is also mentioned without reprobation by Peter
   Lombard (In Sentent. Lib. iv. dist. xvij.)."

   Canon XII.

   As many as were called by grace, and displayed the first zeal, having
   cast aside their military girdles, but afterwards returned, like dogs,
   to their own vomit, (so that some spent money and by means of gifts
   regained their military stations); let these, after they have passed
   the space of three years as hearers, be for ten years prostrators.  But
   in all these cases it is necessary to examine well into their purpose
   and what their repentance appears to be like.  For as many as give
   evidence of their conversions by deeds, and not pretence, with fear,
   and tears, and perseverance, and good works, when they have fulfilled
   their appointed time as hearers, may properly communicate in prayers;
   and after that the bishop may determine yet more favourably concerning
   them.  But those who take [the matter] with indifference, and who think
   the form of [not] entering the Church is sufficient for their
   conversion, must fulfil the whole time.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   Those who endured violence and were seen to have resisted, but who
   afterwards yielded to wickedness, and returned to the army, shall be
   excommunicated for ten years.  But in every case the way in which they
   do their penance must be scrutinized.  And if anyone who is doing
   penance shews himself zealous in its performance, the bishop shall
   treat him more leniently than had he been cold and indifferent.

   Lambert.

   The abuse of this power, namely, of granting under certain
   circumstances a relaxation in the penitential exercises enjoined by the
   canons--led, in later times, to the practice of commuting such
   exercises for money payments, etc.

   Hefele.

   In his last contests with Constantine, Licinius had made himself the
   representative of heathenism; so that the final issue of the war would
   not be the mere triumph of one of the two competitors, but the triumph
   or fall of Christianity or heathenism.  Accordingly, a Christian who
   had in this war supported the cause of Licinius and of heathenism might
   be considered as a lapsus, even if he did not formally fall away.  With
   much more reason might those Christians be treated as lapsi who, having
   conscientiously given up military service (this is meant by the
   soldier's belt), afterwards retracted their resolution, and went so far
   as to give money and presents for the sake of readmission, on account
   of the numerous advantages which military service then afforded.  It
   must not be forgotten that Licinius, as Zonaras and Eusebius relate,
   required from his soldiers a formal apostasy; compelled them, for
   example, to take part in the heathen sacrifices which were held in the
   camps, and dismissed from his service those who would not apostatize.

   Bright.

   This canon (which in the Prisca and the Isidorian version stands as
   part of canon 11) deals, like it, with cases which had arisen under the
   Eastern reign of Licinius, who having resolved to "purge his army of
   all ardent Christians" (Mason, Persec. of Diocl. p. 308), ordered his
   Christian officers to sacrifice to the gods on pain of being cashiered
   (compare Euseb. H. E. x. 8; Vit. Con. i. 54).  It is to be observed
   here that military life as such was not deemed unchristian.  The case
   of Cornelius was borne in mind.  "We serve in your armies," says
   Tertullian, Apol. 42 (although later, as a Montanist, he took a
   rigorist and fanatical view, De Cor. 11), and compare the fact which
   underlies the tale of the "Thundering Legion,"--the presence of
   Christians in the army of Marcus Aurelius.  It was the heathenish
   adjuncts to their calling which often brought Christian soldiers to a
   stand (see Routh. Scr. Opusc. i. 410), as when Marinus' succession to a
   centurionship was challenged on the ground that he could not sacrifice
   to the gods (Euseb. H. E. vii. 15).  Sometimes, indeed, individual
   Christians thought like Maximilian in the Martyrology, who absolutely
   refused to enlist, and on being told by the proconsul that there were
   Christian soldiers in the imperial service, answered, "Ipsi sciunt quod
   ipsis expediat" (Ruinart, Act. Sanc. p. 341).  But, says Bingham
   (Antiq. xi. 5, 10), "the ancient canons did not condemn the military
   life as a vocation simply unlawful....I believe there is no instance of
   any man being refused baptism merely because he was a soldier, unless
   some unlawful circumstance, such as idolatry, or the like, made the
   vocation sinful."  After the victory of Constantine in the West, the
   Council of Arles excommunicated those who in time of peace "threw away
   their arms" (can. 2).  In the case before us, some Christian officers
   had at first stood firm under the trial imposed on them by Licinius.
   They had been "called by grace" to an act of self-sacrifice (the phrase
   is one which St. Augustine might have used); and had shown "their
   eagerness at the outset" ("primum suum ardorem," Dionysius; Philo and
   Evarestus more laxly, "primordia bona;" compare ten agapen sou ten
   proten, Rev. ii. 4).  Observe here how beautifully the ideas of grace
   and free will are harmonized.  These men had responded to a Divine
   impulse:  it might seem that they had committed themselves to a noble
   course:  they had cast aside the "belts" which were their badge of
   office (compare the cases of Valentinian and Valens, Soc. iii. 13, and
   of Benevolus throwing down his belt at the feet of Justina, Soz. vii.
   13).  They had done, in fact, just what Auxentius, one of Licinius'
   notaries, had done when, according to the graphic anecdote of
   Philostorgius (Fragm. 5), his master bade him place a bunch of grapes
   before a statue of Bacchus in the palace-court; but their zeal, unlike
   his, proved to be too impulsive--they reconsidered their position, and
   illustrated the maxim that in morals second thoughts are not best
   (Butler, Serm. 7), by making unworthy attempts--in some cases by
   bribery--to recover what they had worthily resigned.  (Observe the
   Grecised Latinism benephikiois and compare the Latinisms of St. Mark,
   and others in Euseb. iii. 20, vi. 40, x. 5.)  This the Council
   describes in proverbial language, probably borrowed from 2 Pet. ii. 22,
   but, it is needless to say, without intending to censure enlistment as
   such.  They now desired to be received to penance:  accordingly they
   were ordered to spend three years as Hearers, during which time "their
   purpose, and the nature (eidos) of their repentance" were to be
   carefully "examined."  Again we see the earnest resolution of the
   Council to make discipline a moral reality, and to prevent it from
   being turned into a formal routine; to secure, as Rufinus' abridgment
   expresses it, a repentance "fructuosam et attentam."  If the penitents
   were found to have "manifested their conversion by deeds, and not in
   outward show (schemati), by awe, and tears, and patience, and good
   works" (such, for instance, Zonaras comments, as almsgiving according
   to ability), "it would be then reasonable to admit them to a
   participation in the prayers," to the position of Consistentes, "with
   permission also to the bishop to come to a yet more indulgent
   resolution concerning them," by admitting them to full communion.  This
   discretionary power of the bishop to dispense with part of a
   penance-time is recognized in the fifth canon of Ancyra and the
   sixteenth of Chalcedon, and mentioned by Basil, Epist. 217, c. 74.  It
   was the basis of "indulgences" in their original form (Bingham, xviii.
   4, 9).  But it was too possible that some at least of these lapsi might
   take the whole affair lightly, "with indifference" adiaphoros --not
   seriously enough, as Hervetas renders--just as if, in common parlance,
   it did not signify:  the fourth Ancyrene canon speaks of lapsi who
   partook of the idol-feast adiaphoros as if it involved them in no sin
   (see below on Eph. 5, Chalc. 4).  It was possible that they might
   "deem" the outward form of "entering the church" to stand in the
   narthex among the Hearers (here, as in c. 8, 19, schema denotes an
   external visible fact) sufficient to entitle them to the character of
   converted penitents, while their conduct out of church was utterly
   lacking in seriousness and self-humiliation.  In that case there could
   be no question of shortening their penance time, for they were not in a
   state to benefit by indulgence:  it would be, as the Roman Presbyters
   wrote to Cyprian, and as he himself wrote to his own church, a "mere
   covering over of the wound" (Epist. 30, 3), an "injury" rather than "a
   kindness" (De Lapsis, 16); they must therefore "by all means" go
   through ten years as Kneelers, before they can become Consistentes.

   There is great difficulty about the last phrase and Gelasius of
   Cyzicus, the Prisca, Dionysius Exiguus, the pseudo-Isidore, Zonaras and
   most others have considered the "not" an interpolation.  I do not see
   how dropping the "not" makes the meaning materially clearer.

   Canon XIII.

   Concerning the departing, the ancient canonical law is still to be
   maintained, to wit, that, if any man be at the point of death, he must
   not be deprived of the last and most indispensable Viaticum.  But, if
   any one should be restored to health again who has received the
   communion when his life was despaired of, let him remain among those
   who communicate in prayers only.  But in general, and in the case of
   any dying person whatsoever asking to receive the Eucharist, let the
   Bishop, after examination made, give it him.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   The dying are to be communicated.  But if any such get well, he must be
   placed in the number of those who share in the prayers, and with these
   only.

   Van Espen.

   It cannot be denied that antiquity used the name "Viaticum" not only to
   denote the Eucharist which was given to the dying, but also to denote
   the reconciliation, and imposition of penance, and in general,
   everything that could be conducive to the happy death of the person
   concerned, and this has been shown by Aubespine (lib. 1, Obs. cap.
   ii.).  But while this is so, the more usual sense of the word is the
   Eucharist.  For this cannot be denied that the faithful of the first
   ages of the Church looked upon the Eucharist as the complement of
   Christian perfection, and as the last seal of hope and salvation.  It
   was for this reason that at the beginning of life, after baptism and
   confirmation, the Eucharist was given even to infants, and at the close
   of life the Eucharist followed reconciliation and extreme unction, so
   that properly and literally it could be styled "the last Viaticum."
   Moreover for penitents it was considered especially necessary that
   through it they might return to the peace of the Church; for perfect
   peace is given by that very communion of the Eucharist.  [A number of
   instances are then cited, and various ancient versions of the canon.]
   Balsamon and Zonaras also understand the canon as I have done, as is
   evident from their commentaries, and so did Josephus Ægyptius, who in
   his Arabic Paraphrase gives the canon this title:  "Concerning him who
   is excommunicated and has committed some deadly sin, and desires the
   Eucharist to be granted to him."

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian, Decretum
   Pars. II. causa xxvi, Quæs. VI., c. ix.

   Excursus on the Communion of the Sick.

   There is nothing upon which the ancient church more strenuously
   insisted than the oral reception of the Holy Communion.  What in later
   times was known as "Spiritual Communion" was outside of the view of
   those early days; and to them the issues of eternity were considered
   often to rest upon the sick man's receiving with his mouth "his food
   for the journey," the Viaticum, before he died.  No greater proof of
   how important this matter was deemed could be found than the present
   canon, which provides that even the stern and invariable canons of the
   public penance are to give way before the awful necessity of fortifying
   the soul in the last hour of its earthly sojourn.

   Possibly at first the holy Sacrament may have been consecrated in the
   presence of the sick person, but of this in early times the instances
   are rare and by no means clear.  In fact it was considered a marked
   favour that such a thing should be allowed, and the saying of mass in
   private houses was prohibited (as it is in the Eastern and Latin
   churches still to-day) with the greatest rigour.

   The necessity of having the consecrated bread and wine for the sick led
   to their reservation, a practice which has existed in the Church from
   the very beginning, so far as any records of which we are in possession
   shew.

   St. Justin Martyr, writing less than a half century after St. John's
   death, mentions that "the deacons communicate each of those present,
   and carry away to the absent the blest bread, and wine and water." [79]
     It was evidently a long established custom in his day.

   Tertullian tells us of a woman whose husband was a heathen and who was
   allowed to keep the Holy Sacrament in her house that she might receive
   every morning before other food.  St. Cyprian also gives a most
   interesting example of reservation.  In his treatise "On the Lapsed"
   written in a.d. 251, (chapter xxvi), he says:  "Another woman, when she
   tried with unworthy hands to open her box, in which was the Holy of the
   Lord, was deterred from daring to touch it by fire rising from it."

   It is impossible with any accuracy to fix the date, but certainly
   before the year four hundred, a perpetual reservation for the sick was
   made in the churches.  A most interesting incidental proof of this is
   found in the thrilling description given by St. Chrysostom of the great
   riot in Constantinople in the year 403, when the soldiers "burst into
   the place where the Holy Things were stored, and saw all things
   therein," and "the most holy blood of Christ was spilled upon their
   clothes." [80]   From this incident it is evident that in that church
   the Holy Sacrament was reserved in both kinds, and separately.

   Whether this at the time was usual it is hard to say, but there can be
   no doubt that even in the earliest times the Sacrament was given, on
   rare occasions at least, in one kind, sometimes under the form of bread
   alone, and when the sick persons could not swallow under the form of
   wine alone.  The practice called "intinction," that is the dipping of
   the bread into the wine and administering the two species together, was
   of very early introduction and still is universal in the East, not only
   when Communion is given with the reserved Sacrament, but also when the
   people are communicated in the Liturgy from the newly consecrated
   species.  The first mention of intinction in the West, is at Carthage
   in the fifth century. [81]   We know it was practised in the seventh
   century and by the twelfth it had become general, to give place to the
   withdrawal of the chalice altogether in the West. [82]   "Regino (De
   Eccles. Discip. Lib. I. c. lxx.) in 906, Burchard (Decr. Lib. V. cap.
   ix. fol. 95. colon. 1560.) in 996, and Ivo (Decr. Pars. II. cap. xix.
   p. 56, Paris 1647) in 1092 all cite a Canon, which they ascribe to a
   council of Tours ordering every presbyter to have a pyx or vessel meet
   for so great a sacrament, in which the Body of the Lord may be
   carefully laid up for the Viaticum to those departing from this world,
   which sacred oblation ought to be steeped in the Blood of Christ that
   the presbyter may be able to say truthfully to the sick man, The Body
   and Blood of the Lord avail thee, etc.'" [83]

   The reservation of the Holy Sacrament was usually made in the church
   itself, and the learned W. E. Scudamore is of opinion that this was the
   case in Africa as early as the fourth century. [84]

   It will not be uninteresting to quote in this connection the "Apostolic
   Constitutions," for while indeed there is much doubt of the date of the
   Eighth Book, yet it is certainly of great antiquity.  Here we read,
   "and after the communion of both men and women, the deacons take what
   remains and place it in the tabernacle." [85]

   Perhaps it may not be amiss before closing the remark that so far as we
   are aware the reservation of the Holy Sacrament in the early church was
   only for the purposes of communion, and that the churches of the East
   reserve it to the present day only for this purpose.

   Those who wish to read the matter treated of more at length, can do so
   in Muratorius's learned "Dissertations" which are prefixed to his
   edition of the Roman Sacramentaries (chapter XXIV) and in Scudamore's
   Notitia Eucharistica, a work which can be absolutely relied upon for
   the accuracy of its facts, however little one may feel constrained to
   accept the logical justness of its conclusions.

   Canon XIV.

   Concerning catechumens who have lapsed, the holy and great Synod has
   decreed that, after they have passed three years only as hearers, they
   shall pray with the catechumens.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   If any of the catechumens shall have fallen for three years he shall be
   a hearer only, and then let him pray with the catechumens.

   Justellus.

   The people formerly were divided into three classes in the church, for
   there were catechumens, faithful, and penitents; but it is clear from
   the present canon there were two kinds of catechumens:  one consisting
   of those who heard the Word of God, and wished to become Christians,
   but had not yet desired baptism; these were called "hearers."  Others
   who were of long standing, and were properly trained in the faith, and
   desired baptism--these were called "competentes."

   There is difference of opinion among the learned as to whether there
   was not a third or even a fourth class of catechumens.  Bingham and
   Card. Bona, while not agreeing in particular points, agree in affirming
   that there were more than two classes.  Bingham's first class are those
   not allowed to enter the church, the exothoumenoi , but the affirmation
   of the existence of such a class rests only on a very forced
   explanation of canon five of Neocæsarea.  The second class, the
   hearers, audientes, rests on better evidence.  These were not allowed
   to stay while the Holy Mysteries were celebrated, and their expulsion
   gave rise to the distinction between the "Mass of the Catechumens"
   (Missa Catechumenorum) and the "Mass of the Faithful" (Missa
   Fidelium).  Nor were they suffered to hear the Creed or the Our
   Father.  Writers who multiply the classes insert here some who knelt
   and prayed, called Prostrati or Genuflectentes (the same name as was
   given to one of the grades of penitence).

   (Edw. H. Plumptre in Dict. Christ. Antiq. s.v. Catechumens.)

   After these stages had been traversed each with its appropriate
   instruction, the catechumens gave in their names as applicants for
   baptism, and were known accordingly as Competentes (sunaitountes ).
   This was done commonly at the beginning of the Quadragesimal fast, and
   the instruction, carried on through the whole of that period, was
   fuller and more public in its nature (Cyril Hieros. Catech. i. 5;
   Hieron. Ep. 61, ad Pammach. c. 4).  To catechumens in this stage the
   great articles of the Creed, the nature of the Sacraments, the
   penitential discipline of the Church, were explained, as in the
   Catechetical Lectures of Cyril of Jerusalem, with dogmatic precision.
   Special examinations and inquiries into character were made at
   intervals during the forty days.  It was a time for fasting and
   watching and prayer (Const. Apost. viii. 5; 4 C. Carth. c. 85; Tertull.
   De Bapt. c. 20; Cyril. l. c.) and, in the case of those who were
   married, of the strictest continence (August. De fide et oper. v. 8).
   Those who passed through the ordeal were known as the perfectiores
   (teleioteroi ), the electi, or in the nomenclature of the Eastern
   Church as baptizomenoi or photizomenoi , the present participle being
   used of course with a future or gerundial sense.  Their names were
   inscribed as such in the album or register of the church.  They were
   taught, but not till a few days before their baptism, the Creed and the
   Lord's Prayer which they were to use after it.  The periods for this
   registration varied, naturally enough, in different churches.  At
   Jerusalem it was done on the second (Cyril. Catech. iii.), in Africa on
   the fourth Sunday in Lent (August. Serm. 213), and this was the time at
   which the candidate, if so disposed, might lay aside his old heathen or
   Jewish name and take one more specifically Christian (Socrat. H. E.
   vii. 21)....It is only necessary to notice here that the Sacramentum
   Catechumenorum of which Augustine speaks (De Peccat. Merit. ii. 26) as
   given apparently at or about the time of their first admission by
   imposition of hands, was probably the eulogiai or panis benedictus, and
   not, as Bingham and Augusti maintain, the salt which was given with
   milk and honey after baptism.

   Canon XV.

   On account of the great disturbance and discords that occur, it is
   decreed that the custom prevailing in certain places contrary to the
   Canon, must wholly be done away; so that neither bishop, presbyter, nor
   deacon shall pass from city to city.  And if any one, after this decree
   of the holy and great Synod, shall attempt any such thing, or continue
   in any such course, his proceedings shall be utterly void, and he shall
   be restored to the Church for which he was ordained bishop or
   presbyter.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   Neither bishop, presbyter, nor deacon shall pass from city to city.
   But they shall be sent back, should they attempt to do so, to the
   Churches in which they were ordained.

   Hefele.

   The translation of a bishop, priest, or deacon from one church to
   another, had already been forbidden in the primitive Church.
   Nevertheless, several translations had taken place, and even at the
   Council of Nice several eminent men were present who had left their
   first bishoprics to take others:  thus Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia,
   had been before Bishop of Berytus; Eustathius, Bishop of Antioch, had
   been before Bishop of Berrhoea in Syria.  The Council of Nice thought
   it necessary to forbid in future these translations, and to declare
   them invalid.  The chief reason of this prohibition was found in the
   irregularities and disputes occasioned by such change of sees; but even
   if such practical difficulties had not arisen, the whole doctrinal
   idea, so to speak, of the relationship between a cleric and the church
   to which he had been ordained, namely, the contracting of a mystical
   marriage between them, would be opposed to any translation or change.
   In 341 the Synod of Antioch renewed, in its twenty-first canon, the
   prohibition passed by the Council of Nice; but the interest of the
   Church often rendered it necessary to make exceptions, as happened in
   the case of St. Chrysostom.  These exceptional cases increased almost
   immediately after the holding of the Council of Nice, so that in 382,
   St. Gregory of Nazianzum considered this law among those which had long
   been abrogated by custom.  It was more strictly observed in the Latin
   Church; and even Gregory's contemporary, Pope Damasus, declared himself
   decidedly in favour of the rule of Nice.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici. Decretum, Pars II.
   Causa VII, Q. 1, c. xix.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Excursus on the Translation of Bishops.

   There are few points upon which the discipline of the Church has so
   completely changed as that which regulated, or rather which forbade,
   the translation of a bishop from the see for which he was consecrated
   to some other diocese.  The grounds on which such prohibition rested
   were usually that such changes were the outcome of ambition, and that
   if tolerated the result would be that smaller and less important sees
   would be despised, and that there would be a constant temptation to the
   bishops of such sees to make themselves popular with the important
   persons in other dioceses with the hope of promotion.  Besides this
   objection to translation, St. Athanasius mentions a spiritual one, that
   the diocese was the bishop's bride, and that to desert it and take
   another was an act of unjustifiable divorce, and subsequent adultery.
   [86]   Canon XIV. of the Apostolic Canons does not forbid the practice
   absolutely, but allows it for just cause, and although the Council of
   Nice is more stringent so far as its words are concerned, apparently
   forbidding translation under any circumstances, yet, as a matter of
   fact, that very council did allow and approve a translation. [87]   The
   general feeling, however, of the early Church was certainly very strong
   against all such changes of Episcopal cure, and there can be no doubt
   that the chief reason why St. Gregory Nazianzen resigned the Presidency
   of the First Council of Constantinople, was because he had been
   translated from his obscure see Sasima (not Nazianzum as Socrates and
   Jerome say) to the Imperial City. [88]

   From the canons of some provincial councils, and especially from those
   of the Third and of the Fourth Council of Carthage, it is evident that
   despite the conciliar and papal prohibitions, translations did take
   place, being made by the authority of the provincial Synods, and
   without the consent of the pope, [89] but it is also evident that this
   authority was too weak, and that the aid of the secular power had often
   to be invoked.

   This course, of having the matter decided by the synod, was exactly in
   accordance with the Apostolic Canon (no. xiv.).  In this manner, for
   example, Alexander was translated from Cappadocia to Jerusalem, a
   translation made, so it is narrated, in obedience to heavenly
   revelation.

   It will be noticed that the Nicene Canon does not forbid Provincial
   Councils to translate bishops, but forbids bishops to translate
   themselves, and the author of the tract De Translationibus in the Jus
   Orient. (i. 293, Cit. Haddon. Art. "Bishop," Smith and Cheetham, Dict.
   Chr. Antiq.) sums up the matter tersely in the statement that he
   metabasis kekolutai, ou men he metathesis:  i.e., the thing prohibited
   is "transmigration" (which arises from the bishop himself, from selfish
   motives) not "translation" (wherein the will of God and the good of the
   Church is the ruling cause); the "going," not the "being taken" to
   another see.  And this was the practice both of East and West, for many
   centuries.  Roman Catholic writers have tried to prove that
   translations, at least to the chief sees, required the papal consent,
   but Thomassinus, considering the case of St. Meletius having translated
   St. Gregory of Nazianzum to Constantinople, admits that in so doing he
   "would only have followed the example of many great bishops of the
   first ages, when usage had not yet reserved translations to the first
   see of the Church." [90]

   But the same learned author frankly confesses that in France, Spain,
   and England, translations were made until the ninth century without
   consulting the pope at all, by bishops and kings.  When, however, from
   grounds of simple ambition, Anthimus was translated from Trebizonde to
   Constantinople, the religious of the city wrote to the pope, as also
   did the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem, and as a result the
   Emperor Justinian allowed Anthimus to be deposed. [91]

   Balsamon distinguishes three kinds of translations.  The first, when a
   bishop of marked learning and of equal piety is forced by a council to
   pass from a small diocese to one far greater where he will be able to
   do the Church the most important services, as was the case when St.
   Gregory of Nazianzum was transferred from Sasima to Constantinople,
   metathesis; the second when a bishop, whose see has been laid low by
   the barbarians, is transferred to another see which is vacant,
   metabasis; and the third when a bishop, either having or lacking a see,
   seizes on a bishopric which is vacant, on his own proper authority
   anabasis.  It is this last which the Council of Sardica punishes so
   severely.  In all these remarks of Balsamon there is no mention of the
   imperial power.

   Demetrius Chomatenus, however, who was Archbishop of Thessalonica, and
   wrote a series of answers to Cabasilas, Archbishop of Durazzo, says
   that by the command of the Emperor a bishop, elected and confirmed, and
   even ready to be ordained for a diocese, may be forced to take the
   charge of another one which is more important, and where his services
   will be incomparably more useful to the public.  Thus we read in the
   Book of Eastern Law that "If a Metropolitan with his synod, moved by a
   praiseworthy cause and probable pretext, shall give his approbation to
   the translation of a bishop, this can, without doubt, be done, for the
   good of souls and for the better administration of the church's
   affairs, etc." [92]   This was adopted at a synod held by the patriarch
   Manuel at Constantinople, in the presence of the imperial
   commissioners.

   The same thing appears also in the synodal response of the patriarch
   Michael, which only demands for translation the authority of the
   Metropolitan and "the greatest authority of the Church." [93]   But,
   soon after this, translation became the rule, and not the exception
   both in East and West.

   It was in vain that Simeon, Archbishop of Thessalonica, in the East
   raised his voice against the constant translations made by the secular
   power, and the Emperors of Constantinople were often absolute masters
   of the choice and translations of bishops; and Thomassinus sums up the
   matter, "At the least we are forced to the conclusion that no
   translations could be made without the consent of the Emperor,
   especially when it was the See of Constantinople that was to be
   filled."

   The same learned writer continues:  "It was usually the bishop or
   archbishop of another church that was chosen to ascend the patriarchal
   throne of the imperial city.  The Kings of England often used this same
   power to appoint to the Primatial See of Canterbury a bishop already
   approved in the government of another diocese." [94]

   In the West, Cardinal Bellarmine disapproved the prevailing custom of
   translations and protested against it to his master, Pope Clement
   VIII., reminding him that they were contrary to the canons and contrary
   to the usage of the Ancient Church, except in cases of necessity and of
   great gain to the Church.  The pope entirely agreed with these wise
   observations, and promised that he would himself make, and would urge
   princes to make, translations only "with difficulty."  But translations
   are made universally, all the world over, today, and no attention
   whatever is paid to the ancient canons and discipline of the Church.

   [95] I believe this is true of all churches, Catholic and Protestant,
   having an episcopal form of government (including the Protestant Church
   of Sweden, and the Methodist Episcopal Church), with the exception of
   the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, in which the
   ancient prohibition of the translation of diocesan bishops is observed
   in all its Nicene strictness.

   Canon XVI.

   Neither presbyters, nor deacons, nor any others enrolled among the
   clergy, who, not having the fear of God before their eyes, nor
   regarding the ecclesiastical Canon, shall recklessly remove from their
   own church, ought by any means to be received by another church; but
   every constraint should be applied to restore them to their own
   parishes; and, if they will not go, they must be excommunicated.  And
   if anyone shall dare surreptitiously to carry off and in his own Church
   ordain a man belonging to another, without the consent of his own
   proper bishop, from whom although he was enrolled in the clergy list he
   has seceded, let the ordination be void.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.

   Such presbyters or deacons as desert their own Church are not to be
   admitted into another, but are to be sent back to their own diocese.
   But if any bishop should ordain one who belongs to another Church
   without the consent of his own bishop, the ordination shall be
   cancelled.

   "Parish" in this canon, as so often elsewhere, means "diocese."

   Balsamon.

   It seemed right that the clergy should have no power to move from city
   to city and to change their canonical residence without letters
   dimissory from the bishop who ordained them.  But such clerics as are
   called by the bishops who ordained them and cannot be persuaded to
   return, are to be separated from communion, that is to say, not to be
   allowed to concelebrate (sunierourgein) with them, for this is the
   meaning of "excommunicated" in this place, and not that they should not
   enter the church nor receive the sacraments.  This decree agrees with
   canon xv. of the Apostolical canons, which provides that such shall not
   celebrate the liturgy.  Canon xvj. of the same Apostolical canons
   further provides that if a bishop receive a cleric coming to him from
   another diocese without his bishop's letters dimissory, and shall
   ordain him, such a bishop shall be separated.  From all this it is
   evident that the Chartophylax of the Great Church for the time does
   rightly in refusing to allow priests ordained in other dioceses to
   offer the sacrifice unless they bring with them letters commendatory
   and dimissory from those who ordained them.

   Zonaras had also in his Scholion given the same explanation of the
   canon.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, divided into two.

   Canon XVII.

   Forasmuch as many enrolled among the Clergy, following covetousness and
   lust of gain, have forgotten the divine Scripture, which says, "He hath
   not given his money upon usury," and in lending money ask the hundredth
   of the sum [as monthly interest], the holy and great Synod thinks it
   just that if after this decree any one be found to receive usury,
   whether he accomplish it by secret transaction or otherwise, as by
   demanding the whole and one half, or by using any other contrivance
   whatever for filthy lucre's sake, he shall be deposed from the clergy
   and his name stricken from the list.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.

   If anyone shall receive usury or 150 per cent, he shall be cast forth
   and deposed, according to this decree of the Church.

   Van Espen.

   Although the canon expresses only these two species of usury, if we
   bear in mind the grounds on which the prohibition was made, it will be
   manifest that every kind of usury is forbidden to clerics and under any
   circumstances, and therefore the translation of this canon sent by the
   Orientals to the Sixth Council of Carthage is in no respect alien to
   the true intent of the canon; for in this version no mention is made of
   any particular kind of usury, but generally the penalty is assigned to
   any clerics who "shall be found after this decree taking usury" or
   thinking out any other scheme for the sake of filthy lucre.

   This Canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, in the first part of
   the Decretum, in Dionysius's version.  Dist. xlvii, c. ii, and again in
   Isidore's version in Pars II, Causa xiv. Quæs. iv., c. viii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Excursus on Usury.

   The famous canonist Van Espen defines usury thus:  "Usura definitur
   lucrum ex mutuo exactum aut speratum;" [96] and then goes on to defend
   the proposition that, "Usury is forbidden by natural, by divine, and by
   human law.  The first is proved thus.  Natural law, as far as its first
   principles are concerned, is contained in the decalogue; but usury is
   prohibited in the decalogue, inasmuch as theft is prohibited; and this
   is the opinion of the Master of the Sentences, of St. Bonaventura, of
   St. Thomas and of a host of others:  for by the name of theft in the
   Law all unlawful taking of another's goods is prohibited; but usury is
   an unlawful, etc."  For a proof of usury's being contrary to divine law
   he cites Ex. xxii. 25, and Deut. xxiii. 29; and from the New Testament
   Luke vi. 34.  "The third assertion is proved thus.  Usury is forbidden
   by human law:  The First Council of Nice in Canon VII. deposed from the
   clergy and from all ecclesiastical rank, clerics who took usury; and
   the same thing is the case with an infinite number of councils, in fact
   with nearly all e.g. Elvira, ij, Arles j, Carthage iij, Tours iij,
   etc.  Nay, even the pagans themselves formerly forbid it by their
   laws."  He then quotes Tacitus (Annal. lib. v.), and adds, "with what
   severe laws the French Kings coerced usurers is evident from the edicts
   of St. Louis, Philip IV., Charles IX., Henry III., etc."

   There can be no doubt that Van Espen in the foregoing has accurately
   represented and without any exaggeration the universal opinion of all
   teachers of morals, theologians, doctors, Popes, and Councils of the
   Christian Church for the first fifteen hundred years.  All interest
   exacted upon loans of money was looked upon as usury, and its reception
   was esteemed a form of theft and dishonesty.  Those who wish to read
   the history of the matter in all its details are referred to Bossuet's
   work on the subject, Traité de l'Usure, [97] where they will find the
   old, traditional view of the Christian religion defended by one
   thoroughly acquainted with all that could be said on the other side.

   The glory of inventing the new moral code on the subject, by which that
   which before was looked upon as mortal sin has been transfigured into
   innocence, if not virtue, belongs to John Calvin!  He made the modern
   distinction between "interest" and "usury," and was the first to write
   in defence of this then new-fangled refinement of casuistry. [98]
   Luther violently opposed him, and Melancthon also kept to the old
   doctrine, though less violently (as was to be expected); today the
   whole Christian West, Protestant and Catholic alike, stake their
   salvation upon the truth of Calvin's distinction!  Among Roman
   Catholics the new doctrine began to be defended about the beginning of
   the eighteenth century, the work of Scipio Maffei, Dell' impiego dell
   danaro, written on the laxer side, having attracted a widespread
   attention.  The Ballerini affirm that the learned pope Benedict XIV.
   allowed books defending the new morals to be dedicated to him, and in
   1830 the Congregation of the Holy Office with the approval of the
   reigning Pontiff, Pius VIII., decided that those who considered the
   taking of interest allowed by the state law justifiable, were "not to
   be disturbed."  It is entirely disingenuous to attempt to reconcile the
   modern with the ancient doctrine; the Fathers expressly deny that the
   State has any power to make the receiving of interest just or to fix
   its rate, there is but one ground for those to take who accept the new
   teaching, viz. that all the ancients, while true on the moral principle
   that one must not defraud his neighbour nor take unjust advantage of
   his necessity, were in error concerning the facts, in that they
   supposed that money was barren, an opinion which the Schoolmen also
   held, following Aristotle.  This we have found in modern times, and
   amid modern circumstances, to be an entire error, as Gury, the famous
   modern casuist, well says, "fructum producit et multiplicatur per se."
   [99]

   That the student may have it in his power to read the Patristic view of
   the matter, I give a list of the passages most commonly cited, together
   with a review of the conciliar action, for all which I am indebted to a
   masterly article by Wharton B. Marriott in Smith and Cheetham's
   Dictionary of Christian Antiquities (s.v. Usury).

   Although the conditions of the mercantile community in the East and the
   West differed materially in some respects, the fathers of the two
   churches are equally explicit and systematic in their condemnation of
   the practice of usury.  Among those belonging to the Greek church we
   find Athanasius (Expos. in Ps. xiv); Basil the Great (Hom. in Ps. xiv).
   Gregory of Nazianzum (Orat. xiv. in Patrem tacentem). Gregory of Nyssa
   (Orat. cont. Usurarios); Cyril of Jerusalem (Catech. iv. c. 37),
   Epiphanius (adv. Hæres. Epilog. c. 24), Chrysostom (Hom. xli. in
   Genes), and Theodoret (Interpr. in Ps. xiv. 5, and liv. 11).  Among
   those belonging to the Latin church, Hilary of Poitiers (in Ps. xiv);
   Ambrose (de Tobia liber unus). Jerome (in Ezech. vi. 18); Augustine de
   Baptismo contr. Donatistas, iv. 19); Leo the Great (Epist. iii. 4), and
   Cassiodorus (in Ps. xiv. 10).

   The canons of later councils differ materially in relation to this
   subject, and indicate a distinct tendency to mitigate the rigour of the
   Nicæan interdict.  That of the council of Carthage of the year 348
   enforces the original prohibition, but without the penalty, and grounds
   the veto on both Old and New Testament authority, "nemo contra
   prophetas, nemo contra evangelia facit sine periculo" (Mansi, iii.
   158).  The language, however, when compared with that of the council of
   Carthage of the year 419, serves to suggest that, in the interval, the
   lower clergy had occasionally been found having recourse to the
   forbidden practice, for the general terms of the earlier canon, "ut non
   liceat clericis fenerari," are enforced with greater particularity in
   the latter, "Nec omnino cuiquam clericorum liceat de qualibet re foenus
   accipere" (Mansi, iv. 423).  This supposition is supported by the
   language of the council of Orleans (a.d. 538), which appears to imply
   that deacons were not prohibited from lending money at interest, "Et
   clericus a diaconatu, et supra, pecuniam non commodet ad usuras" (ib.
   ix. 18).  Similarly, at the second council of Trullanum (a.d. 692) a
   like liberty would appear to have been recognised among the lower
   clergy (Hardouin, iii. 1663).  While, again, the Nicæan canon requires
   the immediate deposition of the ecclesiastic found guilty of the
   practice, the Apostolical canon enjoins that such deposition is to take
   place only after he has been admonished and has disregarded the
   admonition.

   Generally speaking, the evidence points to the conclusion that the
   Church imposed no penalty on the layman.  St. Basil (Epist. clxxxviii.
   can. 12), says that a usurer may even be admitted to orders, provided
   he gives his acquired wealth to the poor and abstains for the future
   from the pursuit of gain (Migne, Patrol. Græc. xxxii. 275).  Gregory of
   Nyssa says that usury, unlike theft, the desecration of tombs, and
   sacrilege (hierosulia ), is allowed to pass unpunished, although among
   the things forbidden by Scripture, nor is a candidate at ordination
   ever asked whether or no he has been guilty of the practice (Migne, ib.
   xlv. 233).  A letter of Sidonius Apollinaris (Epist. vi. 24) relating
   an experience of his friend Maximus, appears to imply that no blame
   attached to lending money at the legal rate of interest, and that even
   a bishop might be a creditor on those terms.  We find also Desideratus,
   bishop of Verdun, when applying for a loan to king Theodebert, for the
   relief of his impoverished diocese, promising repayment, "cum usuris
   legitimis," an expression which would seem to imply that in the
   Gallican church usury was recognised as lawful under certain conditions
   (Greg. Tur. Hist. Franc. iii. 34).  So again a letter (Epist. ix. 38)
   of Gregory the Great seems to shew that he did not regard the payment
   of interest for money advanced by one layman to another as unlawful.
   But on the other hand, we find in what is known as archbishop
   Theodore's "Penitential" (circ. a.d. 690) what appears to be a general
   law on the subject, enjoining "Sie quis usuras undecunque
   exegerit...tres annos in pane et aqua" (c. xxv. 3); a penance again
   enjoined in the Penitential of Egbert of York (c. ii. 30).  In like
   manner, the legates, George and Theophylact, in reporting their
   proceedings in England to pope Adrian I. (a.d. 787), state that they
   have prohibited "usurers," and cite the authority of the Psalmist and
   St. Augustine (Haddan and Stubbs, Conc. iii. 457).  The councils of
   Mayence, Rheims, and Châlons, in the year 813, and that of Aix in the
   year 816, seem to have laid down the same prohibition as binding both
   on the clergy and the laity (Hardouin, Conc. iv. 1011, 1020, 1033,
   1100).

   Muratori, in his dissertation on the subject (Antichità, vol. i.),
   observes that "we do not know exactly how commerce was transacted in
   the five preceding centuries," and consequently are ignorant as to the
   terms on which loans of money were effected.

   Canon XVIII.

   It has come to the knowledge of the holy and great Synod that, in some
   districts and cities, the deacons administer the Eucharist to the
   presbyters, whereas neither canon nor custom permits that they who have
   no right to offer should give the Body of Christ to them that do
   offer.  And this also has been made known, that certain deacons now
   touch the Eucharist even before the bishops.  Let all such practices be
   utterly done away, and let the deacons remain within their own bounds,
   knowing that they are the ministers of the bishop and the inferiors of
   the presbyters.  Let them receive the Eucharist according to their
   order, after the presbyters, and let either the bishop or the presbyter
   administer to them.  Furthermore, let not the deacons sit among the
   presbyters, for that is contrary to canon and order.  And if, after
   this decree, any one shall refuse to obey, let him be deposed from the
   diaconate.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.

   Deacons must abide within their own bounds.  They shall not administer
   the Eucharist to presbyters, nor touch it before them, nor sit among
   the presbyters.  For all this is contrary to canon, and to decent
   order.

   Van Espen.

   Four excesses of deacons this canon condemns, at least indirectly.  The
   first was that they gave the holy Communion to presbyters.  To
   understand more easily the meaning of the canon it must be remembered
   that the reference here is not to the presbyters who were sacrificing
   at the altar but to those who were offering together with the bishop
   who was sacrificing; by a rite not unlike that which to-day takes
   place, when the newly ordained presbyters or bishops celebrate mass
   with the ordaining bishop; and this rite in old times was of daily
   occurrence, for a full account of which see Morinus De SS. Ordinat. P.
   III. Exercit. viij....The present canon does not take away from deacons
   the authority to distribute the Eucharist to laymen, or to the minor
   clergy, but only reproves their insolence and audacity in presuming to
   administer to presbyters who were concelebrating with the bishop or
   another presbyter....

   The second abuse was that certain deacons touched the sacred gifts
   before the bishop.  The vulgar version of Isidore reads for "touched"
   "received," a meaning which Balsamon and Zonaras also adopt, and unless
   the Greek word, which signifies "to touch," is contrary to this
   translation, it seems by no means to be alien to the context of the
   canon.

   "Let them receive the Eucharist according to their order, after the
   presbyters, and let the bishop or the presbyter administer to them."
   In these words it is implied that some deacons had presumed to receive
   Holy Communion before the presbyters, and this is the third excess of
   the deacon which is condemned by the Synod.

   And lastly, the fourth excess was that they took a place among the
   presbyters at the very time of the sacrifice, or "at the holy altar,"
   as Balsamon observes.

   From this canon we see that the Nicene fathers entertained no doubt
   that the faithful in the holy Communion truly received "the body of
   Christ."  Secondly, that that was "offered" in the church, which is the
   word by which sacrifice is designated in the New Testament, and
   therefore it was at that time a fixed tradition that there was a
   sacrifice in which the body of Christ was offered.  Thirdly that not to
   all, nor even to deacons, but only to bishops and presbyters was given
   the power of offering.  And lastly, that there was recognized a fixed
   hierarchy in the Church, made up of bishops and presbyters and deacons
   in subordination to these.

   Of course even at that early date there was nothing new in this
   doctrine of the Eucharist.  St. Ignatius more than a century and a half
   before, wrote as follows:  "But mark ye those who hold strange doctrine
   touching the grace of Jesus Christ which came to us, how that they are
   contrary to the mind of God.  They have no care for love, none for the
   widow, none for the orphan, none for the afflicted, none for the
   prisoner, none for the hungry or thirsty.  They abstain from eucharist
   (thanksgiving) and prayer, because they allow not that the Eucharist is
   the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our
   sins, and which the Father of his goodness raised up." [100]

   In one point the learned scholiast just quoted has most seriously
   understated his case.  He says that the wording of the canon shews
   "that the Nicene fathers entertained no doubt that the faithful in the
   holy Communion truly received the body of Christ.'"  Now this statement
   is of course true because it is included in what the canon says, but
   the doctrinal statement which is necessarily contained in the canon is
   that "the body of Christ is given" by the minister to the faithful.
   This doctrine is believed by all Catholics and by Lutherans, but is
   denied by all other Protestants; those Calvinists who kept most nearly
   to the ordinary Catholic phraseology only admitting that "the sacrament
   of the Body of Christ" was given in the supper by the minister, while
   "the body of Christ," they taught, was present only in the soul of the
   worthy communicant (and in no way connected with the form of bread,
   which was but the divinely appointed sign and assurance of the heavenly
   gift), and therefore could not be "given" by the priest. [101]

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Decretum. Pars I.
   Dist. XCIII., c. xiv.

   Canon XIX.

   Concerning the Paulianists who have flown for refuge to the Catholic
   Church, it has been decreed that they must by all means be rebaptized;
   and if any of them who in past time have been numbered among their
   clergy should be found blameless and without reproach, let them be
   rebaptized and ordained by the Bishop of the Catholic Church; but if
   the examination should discover them to be unfit, they ought to be
   deposed.  Likewise in the case of their deaconesses, and generally in
   the case of those who have been enrolled among their clergy, let the
   same form be observed.  And we mean by deaconesses such as have assumed
   the habit, but who, since they have no imposition of hands, are to be
   numbered only among the laity.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.

   Paulianists must be rebaptised, and if such as are clergymen seem to be
   blameless let them be ordained.  If they do not seem to be blameless,
   let them be deposed.  Deaconesses who have been led astray, since they
   are not sharers of ordination, are to be reckoned among the laity.

   Ffoulkes.

   (Dict. Chr. Ant. s.v. Nicæa, Councils of.)

   That this is the true meaning of the phrase horos ektetheitai, viz. "a
   decree has now been made," is clear from the application of the words
   horos in Canon xvii., and horisen, in Canon vi.  It has been a pure
   mistake, therefore, which Bp. Hefele blindly follows, to understand it
   of some canon previously passed, whether at Arles or elsewhere.

   Justellus.

   Here cheirothesia is taken for ordination or consecration, not for
   benediction,...for neither were deaconesses, sub-deacons, readers, and
   other ministers ordained, but a blessing was merely pronounced over
   them by prayer and imposition of hands.

   Aristenus.

   Their (the Paulicians') deaconesses also, since they have no imposition
   of hands, if they come over to the Catholic Church and are baptized,
   are ranked among the laity.

   With this Zonaras and Balsamon also agree.

   Hefele.

   By Paulianists must be understood the followers of Paul of Samosata the
   anti-Trinitarian who, about the year 260, had been made bishop of
   Antioch, but had been deposed by a great Synod in 269.  As Paul of
   Samosata was heretical in his teaching on the Holy Trinity the Synod of
   Nice applied to him the decree passed by the council of Arles in its
   eighth canon.  "If anyone shall come from heresy to the Church, they
   shall ask him to say the creed; and if they shall perceive that he was
   baptized into the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, [102] he
   shall have a hand laid on him only that he may receive the Holy Ghost.
   But if in answer to their questioning he shall not answer this Trinity,
   let him be baptized."

   The Samosatans, according to St. Athanasius, named the Father, Son and
   Holy Spirit in administering baptism (Orat. ii, Contra Arian. No.
   xliii.), but as they gave a false meaning to the baptismal formula and
   did not use the words Son and Holy Spirit in the usual sense, the
   Council of Nice, like St. Athanasius himself, considered their baptism
   as invalid.

   There is great difficulty about the text of the clause beginning
   "Likewise in the case, etc.," and Gelasius, the Prisca, Theilo and
   Thearistus, (who in 419 translated the canons of Nice for the African
   bishops), the Pseudo-Isidore, and Gratian have all followed a reading
   diakonon, instead of diakonisson.  This change makes all clear, but
   many canonists keep the ordinary text, including Van Espen, with whose
   interpretation Hefele does not agree.

   The clause I have rendered "And we mean by deaconesses" is most
   difficult of translation.  I give the original, 'Emnesthemen de
   diakonisson ton en to schemati exetastheison, epei k.t.l.  Hefele's
   translation seems to me impossible, by schemati he understands the list
   of the clergy just mentioned.

   Excursus on the Deaconess of the Early Church.

   It has been supposed by many that the deaconess of the Early Church had
   an Apostolic institution and that its existence may be referred to by
   St. Paul in his Epistle to the Romans (xvi. 1) where he speaks of
   Phoebe as being a diakonos of the Church of Cenchrea.  It moreover has
   been suggested that the "widows" of 1 Tim. v. 9 may have been
   deaconesses, and this seems not unlikely from the fact that the age for
   the admission of women to this ministry was fixed by Tertullian at
   sixty years (De Vel. Virg. Cap. ix.), and only changed to forty, two
   centuries later by the Council of Chalcedon, and from the further fact
   that these "widows" spoken of by St. Paul seem to have had a vow of
   chastity, for it is expressly said that if they marry they have
   "damnation, because they have cast off their first faith" (1 Tim. v.
   12).

   These women were called diakonissai, presbutides (which must be
   distinguished from the presbuterai , a poor class referred to in the
   Apostolic Constitutions (ii. 28) who are to be only invited frequently
   to the love-feasts, while the presbutides had a definite allotment of
   the offerings assigned to their support), cherai, diaconissæ,
   presbyteræ, and viduæ.

   The one great characteristic of the deaconess was that she was vowed to
   perpetual chastity. [103]   The Apostolical Constitutions (vi. 17) say
   that she must be a chaste virgin (parthenos hagne) or else a widow.
   The writer of the article "Deaconess" in the Dictionary of Christian
   Antiquities says:  "It is evident that the ordination of deaconesses
   included a vow of celibacy."  We have already seen the language used by
   St. Paul and of this the wording of the canon of Chalcedon is but an
   echo (Canon xv).  "A woman shall not receive the laying on of hands as
   a deaconess under forty years of age, and then only after searching
   examination.  And if, after she has had hands laid on her, and has
   continued for a time to minister, she shall despise the Grace of God
   and give herself in marriage, she shall be anathematized and the man
   who is united to her."  The civil law went still further, and by
   Justinian's Sixth Novel (6) those who attempted to marry are subjected
   to forfeiture of property and capital punishment.  In the collect in
   the ancient office there is a special petition that the newly admitted
   deaconess may have the gift of continence.

   The principal work of the deaconess was to assist the female candidates
   for holy baptism.  At that time the sacrament of baptism was always
   administered by immersion (except to those in extreme illness) and
   hence there was much that such an order of women could be useful in.
   Moreover they sometimes gave to the female catechumens preliminary
   instruction, but their work was wholly limited to women, and for a
   deaconess of the Early Church to teach a man or to nurse him in
   sickness would have been an impossibility.  The duties of the deaconess
   are set forth in many ancient writings, I cite here what is commonly
   known as the XII Canon of the Fourth Council of Carthage, which met in
   the year 398:

   "Widows and dedicated women (sanctimoniales) who are chosen to assist
   at the baptism of women, should be so well instructed in their office
   as to be able to teach aptly and properly unskilled and rustic women
   how to answer at the time of their baptism to the questions put to
   them, and also how to live godly after they have been baptized."  This
   whole matter is treated clearly by St. Epiphanius who, while indeed
   speaking of deaconesses as an order (tagma), asserts that "they were
   only women-elders, not priestesses in any sense, that their mission was
   not to interfere in any way with Sacerdotal functions, but simply to
   perform certain offices in the care of women" (Hær. lxxix., cap. iij).
   From all this it is evident that they are entirely in error who suppose
   that "the laying on of hands" which the deaconesses received
   corresponded to that by which persons were ordained to the diaconate,
   presbyterate, and episcopate at that period of the church's history.
   It was merely a solemn dedication and blessing and was not looked upon
   as "an outward sign of an inward grace given."  For further proof of
   this I must refer to Morinus, who has treated the matter most
   admirably.  (De Ordinationibus, Exercitatio X.)

   The deaconesses existed but a short while.  The council of Laodicea as
   early as a.d. 343-381, forbade the appointment of any who were called
   presbutides (Vide Canon xi); and the first council of Orange, a.d. 441,
   in its twenty-sixth canon forbids the appointment of deaconesses
   altogether, and the Second council of the same city in canons xvij and
   xviij, decrees that deaconesses who married were to be excommunicated
   unless they renounced the men they were living with, and that, on
   account of the weakness of the sex, none for the future were to be
   ordained.

   Thomassinus, to whom I refer the reader for a very full treatment of
   the whole subject, is of opinion that the order was extinct in the West
   by the tenth or twelfth century, but that it lingered on a little later
   at Constantinople but only in conventual institutions.  (Thomassin,
   Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l' Eglise, I Partie, Livre III.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [103] In 1836, the Lutheran Pastor Fliedner, of a little town on the
   Rhine, opened a parish hospital the nurses of which he called
   "Deaconesses."  This "Deaconess House" at Kaiserswerth, was the
   mother-house from which all the deaconess establishments of the present
   day have taken their origin.  The Methodists have adopted the system
   successfully.  Some efforts have been made to domesticate it, in a
   somewhat modified form, also in the Anglican Churches but thus far with
   but little success.  Of course these "Deaconesses" resemble the
   Deaconesses of the Early Church only in name.  The reader who may be
   interested in seeing an effort to connect the modern deaconess with the
   deaconess of antiquity is referred to The Ministry of Deaconesses by
   Deaconess Cecilia Robinson.  This book, it should be said, contains
   much valuable and accurate information upon the subject, but accepts as
   proven facts the suppositions of the late Bishop Lightfoot upon the
   subject; who somewhat rashly asserted that "the female diaconate is as
   definite an institution as the male diaconate.  Phoebe is as much a
   deacon as Stephen or Philip is a deacon!"

   Canon XX.

   Forasmuch as there are certain persons who kneel on the Lord's Day and
   in the days of Pentecost, therefore, to the intent that all things may
   be uniformly observed everywhere (in every parish), it seems good to
   the holy Synod that prayer be made to God standing.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.

   On Lord's days and at Pentecost all must pray standing and not
   kneeling.

   Hammond.

   Although kneeling was the common posture for prayer in the primitive
   Church, yet the custom had prevailed, even from the earliest times, of
   standing at prayer on the Lord's day, and during the fifty days between
   Easter and Pentecost.  Tertullian, in a passage in his treatise De
   Corona Militis, which is often quoted, mentions it amongst other
   observances which, though not expressly commanded in Scripture, yet
   were universally practised upon the authority of tradition.  "We
   consider it unlawful," he says, "to fast, or to pray kneeling, upon the
   Lord's day; we enjoy the same liberty from Easter-day to that of
   Pentecost."  De Cor. Mil. s. 3, 4.  Many other of the Fathers notice
   the same practice, the reason of which, as given by Augustine and
   others, was to commemorate the resurrection of our Lord, and to signify
   the rest and joy of our own resurrection, which that of our Lord
   assured.  This canon, as Beveridge observes, is a proof of the
   importance formerly attached to an uniformity of sacred rites
   throughout the Church, which made the Nicene Fathers thus sanction and
   enforce by their authority a practice which in itself is indifferent,
   and not commanded directly or indirectly in Scripture, and assign this
   as their reason for doing so:  "In order that all things may be
   observed in like manner in every parish" or diocese.

   Hefele.

   All the churches did not, however, adopt this practice; for we see in
   the Acts of the Apostles (xx. 36 and xxi. 5) that St. Paul prayed
   kneeling during the time between Pentecost and Easter.

   Excursus on the Number of the Nicene Canons.

   There has come down to us a Latin letter purporting to have been
   written by St. Athanasius to Pope Marcus.  This letter is found in the
   Benedictine edition of St. Athanasius's works (ed. Patav. ii. 599) but
   rejected as spurious by Montfaucon the learned editor.  In this letter
   is contained the marvellous assertion that the Council of Nice at first
   adopted forty canons, which were in Greek, that it subsequently added
   twenty Latin canons, and that afterwards the council reassembled and
   set forth seventy altogether.  A tradition that something of the kind
   had taken place was prevalent in parts of the East, and some
   collections did contain seventy canons.

   In the Vatican Library is a ms. which was bought for it by the famous
   Asseman, from the Coptic Patriarch, John, and which contains not only
   seventy, but eighty canons attributed to the council of Nice.  The ms.
   is in Arabic, and was discovered by J. B. Romanus, S. J., who first
   made its contents known, and translated into Latin a copy he had made
   of it.  Another Jesuit, Pisanus, was writing a history of the Nicene
   Council at the time and he received the eighty newly found canons into
   his book; but, out of respect to the pseudo-Athanasian letter, he at
   first cut down the number to seventy; but in later editions he followed
   the ms.  All this was in the latter half of the sixteenth century; and
   in 1578 Turrianus, who had had Father Romanus's translation revised
   before it was first published, now issued an entirely new translation
   with a Proëmium [104] containing a vast amount of information upon the
   whole subject, and setting up an attempted proof that the number of the
   Nicene Canons exceeded twenty.  His argument for the time being carried
   the day.

   Hefele says, "it is certain that the Orientals [105] believed the
   Council of Nice to have promulgated more than twenty canons:  the
   learned Anglican, Beveridge, [106] has proved this, reproducing an
   ancient Arabic paraphrase of the canons of the first four Ecumenical
   Councils.  According to this Arabic paraphrase, found in a ms. in the
   Bodleian Library, the Council of Nice must have put forth three books
   of canons....The Arabic paraphrase of which we are speaking gives a
   paraphrase of all these canons, but Beveridge took only the part
   referring to the second book--that is to say, the paraphrase of the
   twenty genuine canons; for, according to his view, which was perfectly
   correct, it was only these twenty canons which were really the work of
   the Council of Nice, and all the others were falsely attributed to it."
   [107]

   Hefele goes on to prove that the canons he rejects must be of much
   later origin, some being laws of the times of Theodosius and Justinian
   according to the opinion of Renaudot. [108]

   Before leaving this point I should notice the profound research on
   these Arabic canons of the Maronite, Abraham Echellensis.  He gives
   eighty-four canons in his Latin translation of 1645, and was of opinion
   that they had been collected from different Oriental sources, and
   sects; but that originally they had all been translated from the Greek,
   and were collected by James, the celebrated bishop of Nisibis, who was
   present at Nice.  But this last supposition is utterly untenable.

   Among the learned there have not been wanting some who have held that
   the Council of Nice passed more canons than the twenty we possess, and
   have arrived at the conclusion independently of the Arabic discovery,
   such are Baronius and Card. d'Aguirre, but their arguments have been
   sufficiently answered, and they cannot present anything able to weaken
   the conclusion that flows from the consideration of the following
   facts.

   (Hefele:  History of the Councils, Vol. I. pp. 355 et seqq. [2d ed.])

   Let us see first what is the testimony of those Greek and Latin authors
   who lived about the time of the Council, concerning the number.

   a.  The first to be consulted among the Greek authors is the learned
   Theodoret, who lived about a century after the Council of Nicæa.  He
   says, in his History of the Church:  "After the condemnation of the
   Arians, the bishops assembled once more, and decreed twenty canons on
   ecclesiastical discipline."

   b.  Twenty years later, Gelasius, Bishop of Cyzicus, after much
   research into the most ancient documents, wrote a history of the Nicene
   Council.  Gelasius also says expressly that the Council decreed twenty
   canons; and, what is more important, he gives the original text of
   these canons exactly in the same order, and according to the tenor
   which we find elsewhere.

   c.  Rufinus is more ancient than these two historians.  He was born
   near the period when the Council of Nicæa was held, and about half a
   century after he wrote his celebrated history of the Church, in which
   he inserted a Latin translation of the Nicene canons.  Rufinus also
   knew only of these twenty canons; but as he has divided the sixth and
   the eighth into two parts, he has given twenty-two canons, which are
   exactly the same as the twenty furnished by the other historians.

   d.  The famous discussion between the African bishops and the Bishop of
   Rome, on the subject of appeals to Rome, gives us a very important
   testimony on the true number of the Nicene canons.  The presbyter
   Apiarius of Sicca in Africa, having been deposed for many crimes,
   appealed to Rome.  Pope Zosimus (417-418) took the appeal into
   consideration, sent legates to Africa; and to prove that he had the
   right to act thus, he quoted a canon of the Council of Nicæa,
   containing these words:  "When a bishop thinks he has been unjustly
   deposed by his colleagues he may appeal to Rome, and the Roman bishop
   shall have the business decided by judices in partibus."  The canon
   quoted by the Pope does not belong to the Council of Nicæa, as he
   affirmed; it was the fifth canon of the Council of Sardica (the seventh
   in the Latin version).  What explains the error of Zosimus is that in
   the ancient copies the canons of Nicæa and Sardica are written
   consecutively, with the same figures, and under the common title of
   canons of the Council of Nicæa; and Zosimus might optima fide fall into
   an error--which he shared with Greek authors, his contemporaries, who
   also mixed the canons of Nicæa with those of Sardica.  The African
   bishops, not finding the canon quoted by the Pope either in their Greek
   or in their Latin copies, in vain consulted also the copy which Bishop
   Cecilian, who had himself been present at the Council of Nicæa, had
   brought to Carthage.  The legates of the Pope then declared that they
   did not rely upon these copies, and they agreed to send to Alexandria
   and to Constantinople to ask the patriarchs of these two cities for
   authentic copies of the canons of the Council of Nicæa.  The African
   bishops desired in their turn that Pope Boniface should take the same
   step (Pope Zosimus had died meanwhile in 418)--that he should ask for
   copies from the Archbishops of Constantinople, Alexandria, and
   Antioch.  Cyril of Alexandria and Atticus of Constantinople, indeed,
   sent exact and faithful copies of the Creed and canons of Nicæa; and
   two learned men of Constantinople, Theilo and Thearistus, even
   translated these canons into Latin.  Their translation has been
   preserved to us in the acts of the sixth Council of Carthage, and it
   contains only the twenty ordinary canons.  It might be thought at first
   sight that it contained twenty-one canons; but on closer consideration
   we see, as Hardouin has proved, that this twenty-first article is
   nothing but an historical notice appended to the Nicene canons by the
   Fathers of Carthage.  It is conceived in these terms:  "After the
   bishops had decreed these rules at Nicæa, and after the holy Council
   had decided what was the ancient rule for the celebration of Easter,
   peace and unity of faith were re-established between the East and the
   West.  This is what we (the African bishops) have thought it right to
   add according to the history of the Church."

   The bishops of Africa despatched to Pope Boniface the copies which had
   been sent to them from Alexandria and Constantinople, in the month of
   November 419; and subsequently in their letters to Celestine I.
   (423-432), successor to Boniface, they appealed to the text of these
   documents.

   e.  All the ancient collections of canons, either in Latin or Greek,
   composed in the fourth, or quite certainly at least in the fifth
   century, agree in giving only these twenty canons to Nicæa.  The most
   ancient of these collections were made in the Greek Church, and in the
   course of time a very great number of copies of them were written.
   Many of these copies have descended to us; many libraries possess
   copies; thus Montfaucon enumerates several in his Bibliotheca
   Coisliniana.  Fabricius makes a similar catalogue of the copies in his
   Bibliotheca Græca to those found in the libraries of Turin, Florence,
   Venice, Oxford, Moscow, etc.; and he adds that these copies also
   contain the so-called apostolic canons, and those of the most ancient
   councils.  The French bishop John Tilius presented to Paris, in 1540, a
   ms. of one of these Greek collections as it existed in the ninth
   century.  It contains exactly our twenty canons of Nicæa, besides the
   so-called apostolic canons, those of Ancyra, etc.  Elias Ehmger
   published a new edition at Wittemberg in 1614, using a second ms. which
   was found at Augsburg; but the Roman collection of the Councils had
   before given in 1608, the Greek text of the twenty canons of Nicæa.
   This text of the Roman editors, with the exception of some
   insignificant variations, was exactly the same as that of the edition
   of Tilius.  Neither the learned Jesuit Sirmond nor his coadjutors have
   mentioned what manuscripts were consulted in preparing this edition;
   probably they were manuscripts drawn from several libraries, and
   particularly from that of the Vatican.  The text of this Roman edition
   passed into all the following collections, even into those of Hardouin
   and Mansi; while Justell in his Bibliotheca juris Canonici and
   Beveridge in his Synodicon (both of the eighteenth century), give a
   somewhat different text, also collated from mss., and very similar to
   the text given by Tilius.  Bruns, in his recent Bibliotheca
   Ecclesiastica, compares the two texts.  Now all these Greek mss.,
   consulted at such different times, and by all these editors,
   acknowledge only twenty canons of Nicæa, and always the same twenty
   which we possess.

   The Latin collections of the canons of the Councils also give the same
   result--for example, the most ancient and the most remarkable of all,
   the Prisca, and that of Dionysius the Less, which was collected about
   the year 500.  The testimony of this latter collection is the more
   important for the number twenty, as Dionysius refers to the Græca
   auctoritas.

   f.  Among the later Eastern witnesses we may further mention Photius,
   Zonaras and Balsamon.  Photius, in his Collection of the Canons, and in
   his Nomocanon, as well as the two other writers in their commentaries
   upon the canons of the ancient Councils, quote only and know only
   twenty canons of Nicæa, and always those which we possess.

   g.  The Latin canonists of the Middle Ages also acknowledge only these
   twenty canons of Nicæa.  We have proof of this in the celebrated
   Spanish collection, which is generally but erroneously attributed to
   St. Isidore (it was composed at the commencement of the seventh
   century), and in that of Adrian (so called because it was offered to
   Charles the Great by Pope Adrian I).  The celebrated Hincmar,
   Archbishop of Rheims, the first canonist of the ninth century, in his
   turn attributes only twenty canons to the Council of Nicæa, and even
   the pseudo-Isidore assigns it no more.

   I add for the convenience of the reader the captions of the Eighty
   Canons as given by Turrianus, translating them from the reprint in
   Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. II. col. 291.  The Eighty-four Canons
   as given by Echellensis together with numerous Constitutions and
   Decrees attributed to the Nicene Council are likewise to be found in
   Labbe (ut supra, col. 318).

   Canon I. [109]

   Insane persons and energumens should not be ordained.

   Canon II.

   Bond servants are not to be ordained.

   Canon III.

   Neophytes in the faith are not to be ordained to Holy Orders before
   they have a knowledge of Holy Scripture.  And such, if convicted after
   their ordination of grave sin, are to be deposed with those who
   ordained them.

   Canon IV.

   The cohabitation of women with bishops, presbyters, and deacons
   prohibited on account of their celibacy.

   We decree that bishops shall not live with women; nor shall a presbyter
   who is a widower; neither shall they escort them; nor be familiar with
   them, nor gaze upon them persistently.  And the same decree is made
   with regard to every celibate priest, and the same concerning such
   deacons as have no wives.  And this is to be the case whether the woman
   be beautiful or ugly, whether a young girl or beyond the age of
   puberty, whether great in birth, or an orphan taken out of charity
   under pretext of bringing her up.  For the devil with such arms slays
   religious, bishops, presbyters, and deacons, and incites them to the
   fires of desire.  But if she be an old woman, and of advanced age, or a
   sister, or mother, or aunt, or grandmother, it is permitted to live
   with these because such persons are free from all suspicion of scandal.

   by it, and does not wish afterwards to stay there.

   [The time of penance fixed is twenty years, only godfather and
   godmother are mentioned, and nothing is said of separation.]

   Canon XXII.

   Of sponsors in baptism.

   Men shall not hold females at the font, neither women males; but women
   females, and men males.

   Canon XXIII.

   Of the prohibited marriages of spiritual brothers and sisters from
   receiving them in baptism.

   Canon XXIV.

   Of the system and manner of receiving converts to the Orthodox faith
   from the heresy of Arius and of other like.

   Canon XXXII.

   Of the system of receiving those who have kept the dogmas of the faith
   and the Church's laws, and yet have separated from us and afterwards
   come back.

   Canon XXXIII.

   Of the place of residence of the Patriarch, and of the honour which
   should be given to the bishop of Jerusalem and to the bishop of
   Seleucia.

   Canon XXXIV.

   Of the honour to be given to the Archbishop of Seleucia in the Synod of
   Greece.

   Canon XXXV.

   Of not holding a provincial synod in the province of Persia without the
   authority of the patriarch of Antioch, and how the bishops of Persia

   Canon XXXVI.

   Of the creation of a patriarch for Ethiopia, and of his power, and of

   Canon XXXIX.

   Of the care and power which a Patriarch has over the bishops and
   archbishops of his patriarchate; and of the primacy of the Bishop of
   Rome over all.

   Let the patriarch consider what things are done by the archbishops and
   bishops in their provinces; and if he shall find anything done by them
   otherwise than it should be, let him change it, and order it, as
   seemeth him fit:  for he is the father of all, and they are his sons.
   And although the archbishop be among the bishops as an elder brother,
   who hath the care of his brethren, and to whom they owe obedience
   because he is over them; yet the patriarch is to all those who are
   under his power, just as he who holds the seat of Rome, is the head and
   prince of all patriarchs; inasmuch as he is first, as was Peter, to
   whom power is given over all Christian princes, and over all their
   peoples, as he who is the Vicar of Christ our Lord over all peoples and
   over the whole Christian Church, and whoever shall contradict this, is
   excommunicated by the Synod. [111]

   [I add Canon XXXVII. of Echellensis's Nova Versio LXXXIV. Arabic.
   Canonum Conc. Nicæni, that the reader may compare it with the
   foregoing.]

   Let there be only four patriarchs in the whole world as there are four
   writers of the Gospel, and four rivers, etc.  And let there be a prince
   and chief over them, the lord of the see of the Divine Peter at Rome,
   according as the Apostles commanded.  And after him the lord of the
   great Alexandria, which is the see of Mark.  And the third is the lord
   of Ephesus, which is the see of John the Divine who speaks divine
   things.  And the fourth and last is my lord of Antioch, which is
   another see of Peter.  And let all the bishops be divided under the
   hands of these four patriarchs; and the bishops of the little towns
   which are under the dominion of the great cities let them be under the
   authority of these metropolitans.  But let every metropolitan of these
   great cities appoint the bishops of his province, but let none of the
   bishops appoint him, for he is greater than they.  Therefore let every
   man know his own rank, and let him not usurp the rank of another.  And
   whosoever shall contradict this law which we have established the
   Fathers of the Synod subject him to anathema. [112]

   Canon XL.

   its utility; together with the excommunication of such as oppose the
   decree.

   unpunished by the decision of the bishop, presbyter, or even of a
   deacon, as the case may be.

   How an archbishop ought to give trial to one of his suffragan bishops.

   Canon XLV.

   Of the receiving of complaints and condemnation of an archbishop
   against his patriarch.

   How a patriarch should admit a complaint; or judgment of an Archbishop
   against an Archbishop.

   Canon XLVII.

   Of those excommunicated by a certain one, when they can be and when
   they cannot be absolved by another.

   Canon XLVIII.

   No bishop shall choose his own successor.

   Canon XLIX.

   No simoniacal ordinations shall be made.

   Canon L.

   There shall be but one bishop of one city, and one parochus of one

   Canon LVI.

   Of how the presbyters of the towns and villages should go twice a year

   monastery should go thrice.

   Canon LVII.

   Of the rank in sitting during the celebration of service in church by
   the bishop, the archdeacon and the chorepiscopus; and of the office of
   archdeacon, and of the honour due the archpresbyter.

   described and set forth.

   Canon LX.

   Of how men are to be chosen from the diocese for holy orders, and of
   how they should be examined.

   Canon LXI.

   Of the honour due to the deacons, and how the clerics must not put
   themselves in their way.

   Canon LXII.

   The number of presbyters and deacons is to be adapted to the work of
   the church and to its means.

   Canon LXIII.

   Of the Ecclesiastical Economist and of the others who with him care for

   Canon LXVI.

   Of taking a second wife, after the former one has been disowned for any
   cause, or even not put away, and of him who falsely accuses his wife of
   adultery.  If any priest or deacon shall put away his wife on account
   of her fornication, or for other cause, as aforesaid, or cast her out
   of doors for external good, or that he may change her for another more
   beautiful, or better, or richer, or does so out of his lust which is
   displeasing to God; and after she has been put away for any of these
   causes he shall contract matrimony with another, or without having put
   her away shall take another, whether free or bond; and shall have both
   equally, they living separately and he sleeping every night with one or
   other of them, or else keeping both in the same house and bed, let him
   be deposed.  If he were a layman let him be deprived of communion.  But
   if anyone falsely defames his wife charging her with adultery, so that
   he turns her out of doors, the matter must be diligently examined; and
   if the accusation was false, he shall be deposed if a cleric, but if a
   layman shall be prohibited from entering the church and from the
   communion of the faithful; and shall be compelled to live with her whom
   he has defamed, even though she be deformed, and poor, and insane; and
   whoever shall not obey is excommunicated by the Synod.

   [Note.--The reader will notice that by this canon a husband is deposed
   or excommunicated, as the case may be, if he marry another woman, after
   putting away his wife on account of her adultery.  It is curious that
   in the parallel canon in the collection of Echellensis, which is
   numbered LXXI., the reading is quite different, although it is very
   awkward and inconsequent as given.  Moreover, it should be remembered
   that in some codices and editions this canon is lacking altogether, one
   on the right of the Pope to receive appeals taking its place.  As this
   canon is of considerable length, I only quote the interesting parts.]

   Whatever presbyter or deacon shall put away his wife without the
   offence of fornication, or for any other cause of which we have spoken
   above, and shall cast her out of doors...such a person shall be cast
   out of the clergy, if he were a clergyman; if a layman he shall be
   forbidden the communion of the faithful....But if that woman [untruly
   charged by her husband with adultery], that is to say his wife, spurns
   his society on account of the injury he has done her and the charge he
   has brought against her, of which she is innocent, let her freely be
   put away and let a bill of repudiation be written for her, noting the
   false accusation which had been brought against her.  And then if she
   should wish to marry some other faithful man, it is right for her to do
   so, nor does the Church forbid it; and the same permission extends as
   well to men as to women, since there is equal reason for it for each.
   But if he shall return to better fruit which is of the same kind, and
   shall conciliate to himself the love and benevolence of his consort,
   and shall be willing to return to his pristine friendship, his fault
   shall be condoned to him after he has done suitable and sufficient
   penance.  And whoever shall speak against this decree the fathers of
   the synod excommunicate him.

   Canon LXVII.

   Of having two wives at the same time, and of a woman who is one of the
   faithful marrying an infidel; and of the form of receiving her to
   penance.

   [Her reception back is conditioned upon her leaving the infidel man.]

   Canon LXVIII.

   Of giving in marriage to an infidel a daughter or sister without her
   knowledge and contrary to her wish.

   Canon LXIX.

   Of one of the faithful who departs from the faith through lust and love
   of an infidel; and of the form of receiving him back, or admitting him
   to penance.

   Canon LXX.

   Of the hospital to be established in every city, and of the choice of a
   superintendent and concerning his duties.

   [It is interesting to note that one of the duties of the superintendent
   is--"That if the goods of the hospital are not sufficient for its
   expenses, he ought to collect all the time and from all Christians
   provision according to the ability of each."]

   Canon LXXI.

   Of the placing a bishop or archbishop in his chair after ordination,
   which is enthronization.

   Canon LXXII.

   No one is allowed to transfer himself to another church [i.e., diocese]
   than that in which he was ordained; and what is to be done in the case
   of one cast out forcibly without any blame attaching to him.

   Canon LXXIII.

   The laity shall not choose for themselves priests in the towns and
   villages without the authority of the chorepiscopus; nor an abbot for a
   monastery; and that no one should give commands as to who should be
   elected his successor after his death, and when this is lawful for a
   superior.

   virtue; and how the election of a layman to the aforesaid grades is not
   prohibited, and that those chosen should not afterward be deprived
   before their deaths, except on account of crime.

   Canon LXXVI.

   Of the distinctive garb and distinctive names and conversation of monks
   and nuns.

   deposed without hope of restoration to the same grade; but shall not be
   excommunicated.

   Canon LXXVIII.

   Of presbyters and deacons who have fallen only once into adultery, if
   they have never been married; and of the same when fallen as widowers,
   and those who have fallen, all the while having their own wives.  Also
   of those who return to the same sin as well widowers as those having
   living wives; and which of these ought not to be received to penance,
   and which once only, and which twice.

   Canon LXXIX.

   Each one of the faithful while his sin is yet not public should be
   mended by private exhortation and admonition; if he will not profit by
   this, he must be excommunicated.

   Canon LXXX.

   Of the election of a procurator of the poor, and of his duties.

   Proposed Action on Clerical Celibacy.

   [The Acts are not extant.]

   Notes.

   Often the mind of a deliberative assembly is as clearly shown by the
   propositions it rejects as by those it adopts, and it would seem that
   this doctrine is of application in the case of the asserted attempt at
   this Council to pass a decree forbidding the priesthood to live in the
   use of marriage.  This attempt is said to have failed.  The particulars
   are as follows:

   Hefele.

   (Hist. Councils, Vol. I., pp. 435 et seqq.)

   Socrates, Sozomen, and Gelasius affirm that the Synod of Nicæa, as well
   as that of Elvira (can. 33), desired to pass a law respecting
   celibacy.  This law was to forbid all bishops, priests and deacons
   (Sozomen adds subdeacons), who were married at the time of their
   ordination, to continue to live with their wives.  But, say these
   historians, the law was opposed openly and decidedly by Paphnutius,
   bishop of a city of the Upper Thebaïs in Egypt, a man of a high
   reputation, who had lost an eye during the persecution under Maximian.
   He was also celebrated for his miracles, and was held in so great
   respect by the Emperor, that the latter often kissed the empty socket
   of the lost eye.  Paphnutius declared with a loud voice, "that too
   heavy a yoke ought not to be laid upon the clergy; that marriage and
   married intercourse are of themselves honourable and undefiled; that
   the Church ought not to be injured by an extreme severity, for all
   could not live in absolute continency:  in this way (by not prohibiting
   married intercourse) the virtue of the wife would be much more
   certainly preserved (viz. the wife of a clergyman, because she might
   find injury elsewhere, if her husband withdrew from her married
   intercourse).  The intercourse of a man with his lawful wife may also
   be a chaste intercourse.  It would therefore be sufficient, according
   to the ancient tradition of the Church, if those who had taken holy
   orders without being married were prohibited from marrying afterwards;
   but those clergymen who had been married only once as laymen, were not
   to be separated from their wives (Gelasius adds, or being only a reader
   or cantor)."  This discourse of Paphnutius made so much the more
   impression, because he had never lived in matrimony himself, and had
   had no conjugal intercourse.  Paphnutius, indeed, had been brought up
   in a monastery, and his great purity of manners had rendered him
   especially celebrated.  Therefore the Council took the serious words of
   the Egyptian bishop into consideration, stopped all discussion upon the
   law, and left to each cleric the responsibility of deciding the point
   as he would.

   If this account be true, we must conclude that a law was proposed to
   the Council of Nicæa the same as one which had been carried twenty
   years previously at Elvira, in Spain; this coincidence would lead us to
   believe that it was the Spaniard Hosius who proposed the law respecting
   celibacy at Nicæa.  The discourse ascribed to Paphnutius, and the
   consequent decision of the Synod, agree very well with the text of the
   Apostolic Constitutions, and with the whole practice of the Greek
   Church in respect to celibacy.  The Greek Church as well as the Latin
   accepted the principle, that whoever had taken holy orders before
   marriage, ought not to be married afterwards.  In the Latin Church,
   bishops, priests, deacons. and even subdeacons, were considered to be
   subject to this law, because the latter were at a very early period
   reckoned among the higher servants of the Church, which was not the
   case in the Greek Church.  The Greek Church went so far as to allow
   deacons to marry after their ordination, if previously to it they had
   expressly obtained from their bishop permission to do so.  The Council
   of Ancyra affirms this (c. 10).  We see that the Greek Church wishes to
   leave the bishop free to decide the matter; but in reference to
   priests, it also prohibited them from marrying after their ordination.
   Therefore, whilst the Latin Church exacted of those presenting
   themselves for ordination, even as subdeacons, that they should not
   continue to live with their wives if they were married, the Greek
   Church gave no such prohibition; but if the wife of an ordained
   clergyman died, the Greek Church allowed no second marriage.  The
   Apostolic Constitutions decided this point in the same way.  To leave
   their wives from a pretext of piety was also forbidden to Greek
   priests; and the Synod of Gangra (c. 4) took up the defence of married
   priests against the Eustathians.  Eustathius, however, was not alone
   among the Greeks in opposing the marriage of all clerics, and in
   desiring to introduce into the Greek Church the Latin discipline on
   this point.  St. Epiphanius also inclined towards this side.  The Greek
   Church did not, however, adopt this rigour in reference to priests,
   deacons, and subdeacons, but by degrees it came to be required of
   bishops and of the higher order of clergy in general, that they should
   live in celibacy.  Yet this was not until after the compilation of the
   Apostolic Canons (c. 5) and of the Constitutions; for in those
   documents mention is made of bishops living in wedlock, and Church
   history shows that there were married bishops, for instance Synesius,
   in the fifth century.  But it is fair to remark, even as to Synesius,
   that he made it an express condition of his acceptation, on his
   election to the episcopate, that he might continue to live the married
   life.  Thomassin believes that Synesius did not seriously require this
   condition, and only spoke thus for the sake of escaping the episcopal
   office; which would seem to imply that in his time Greek bishops had
   already begun to live in celibacy.  At the Trullan Synod (c. 13.) the
   Greek Church finally settled the question of the marriage of priests.
   Baronius, Valesius, and other historians, have considered the account
   of the part taken by Paphnutius to be apocryphal.  Baronius says, that
   as the Council of Nicæa in its third canon gave a law upon celibacy it
   is quite impossible to admit that it would alter such a law on account
   of Paphnutius.  But Baronius is mistaken in seeing a law upon celibacy
   in that third canon; he thought it to be so, because, when mentioning
   the women who might live in the clergyman's house--his mother, sister,
   etc.--the canon does not say a word about the wife.  It had no occasion
   to mention her, it was referring to the suneisaktoi whilst these
   suneisaktoi and married women have nothing in common.  Natalis
   Alexander gives this anecdote about Paphnutius in full:  he desired to
   refute Ballarmin, who considered it to be untrue and an invention of
   Socrates to please the Novatians.  Natalis Alexander often maintains
   erroneous opinions, and on the present question he deserves no
   confidence.  If, as St. Epiphanius relates, the Novatians maintained
   that the clergy might be married exactly like the laity, it cannot be
   said that Socrates shared that opinion, since he says, or rather makes
   Paphnutius say, that, according to ancient tradition, those not married
   at the time of ordination should not be so subsequently.  Moreover, if
   it may be said that Socrates had a partial sympathy with the Novatians,
   he certainly cannot be considered as belonging to them, still less can
   he be accused of falsifying history in their favour.  He may sometimes
   have propounded erroneous opinions, but there is a great difference
   between that and the invention of a whole story.  Valesius especially
   makes use of the argument ex silentio against Socrates.  (a) Rufinus,
   he says, gives many particulars about Paphnutius in his History of the
   Church; he mentions his martyrdom, his miracles, and the Emperor's
   reverence for him, but not a single word of the business about
   celibacy.  (b) The name of Paphnutius is wanting in the list of
   Egyptian bishops present at the Synod.  These two arguments of Valesius
   are weak; the second has the authority of Rufinus himself against it,
   who expressly says that Bishop Paphnutius was present at the Council of
   Nicæa.  If Valesius means by lists only the signatures at the end of
   the acts of the Council, this proves nothing; for these lists are very
   imperfect, and it is well known that many bishops whose names are not
   among these signatures were present at Nicæa.  This argument ex
   silentio is evidently insufficient to prove that the anecdote about
   Paphnutius must be rejected as false, seeing that it is in perfect
   harmony with the practice of the ancient Church, and especially of the
   Greek Church, on the subject of clerical marriages.  On the other hand,
   Thomassin pretends that there was no such practice, and endeavours to
   prove by quotations from St. Epiphanius, St. Jerome, Eusebius, and St.
   John Chrysostom, that even in the East priests who were married at the
   time of their ordination were prohibited from continuing to live with
   their wives.  The texts quoted by Thomassin prove only that the Greeks
   gave especial honour to priests living in perfect continency, but they
   do not prove that this continence was a duty incumbent upon all
   priests; and so much the less, as the fifth and twenty-fifth Apostolic
   canons, the fourth canon of Gangra, and the thirteenth of the Trullan
   Synod, demonstrate clearly enough what was the universal custom of the
   Greek Church on this point.  Lupus and Phillips explained the words of
   Paphnutius in another sense.  According to them, the Egyptian bishop
   was not speaking in a general way; he simply desired that the
   contemplated law should not include the subdeacons.  But this
   explanation does not agree with the extracts quoted from Socrates,
   Sozomen, and Gelasius, who believe Paphnutius intended deacons and
   priests as well.

   The Synodal Letter.

   (Found in Gelasius, Historia Concilii Nicæni, lib. II, cap. xxxiii.;
   Socr., H. E., lib. I., cap. 6; Theodor., H. E., Lib. I., cap. 9.)

   To the Church of Alexandria, by the grace of God, holy and great; and
   to our well-beloved brethren, the orthodox clergy and laity throughout
   Egypt, and Pentapolis, and Lybia, and every nation under heaven, the
   holy and great synod, the bishops assembled at Nicea, wish health in
   the Lord.

   Forasmuch as the great and holy Synod, which was assembled at Niece
   through the grace of Christ and our most religious Sovereign
   Constantine, who brought us together from our several provinces and
   cities, has considered matters which concern the faith of the Church,
   it seemed to us to be necessary that certain things should be
   communicated from us to you in writing, so that you might have the
   means of knowing what has been mooted and investigated, and also what
   has been decreed and confirmed.

   First of all, then, in the presence of our most religious Sovereign
   Constantine, investigation was made of matters concerning the impiety
   and transgression of Arius and his adherents; and it was unanimously
   decreed that he and his impious opinion should be anathematized,
   together with the blasphemous words and speculations in which he
   indulged, blaspheming the Son of God, and saying that he is from things
   that are not, and that before he was begotten he was not, and that
   there was a time when he was not, and that the Son of God is by his
   free will capable of vice and virtue; saying also that he is a
   creature.  All these things the holy Synod has anathematized, not even
   enduring to hear his impious doctrine and madness and blasphemous
   words.  And of the charges against him and of the results they had, ye
   have either already heard or will hear the particulars, lest we should
   seem to be oppressing a man who has in fact received a fitting
   recompense for his own sin.  So far indeed has his impiety prevailed,
   that he has even destroyed Theonas of Marmorica and Secundes of
   Ptolemais; for they also have received the same sentence as the rest.

   But when the grace of God had delivered Egypt from that heresy and
   blasphemy, and from the persons who have dared to make disturbance and
   division among a people heretofore at peace, there remained the matter
   of the insolence of Meletius and those who have been ordained by him;
   and concerning this part of our work we now, beloved brethren, proceed
   to inform you of the decrees of the Synod.  The Synod, then, being
   disposed to deal gently with Meletius (for in strict justice he
   deserved no leniency), decreed that he should remain in his own city,
   but have no authority either to ordain, or to administer affairs, or to
   make appointments; and that he should not appear in the country or in
   any other city for this purpose, but should enjoy the bare title of his
   rank; but that those who have been placed by him, after they have been
   confirmed by a more sacred laying on of hands, shall on these
   conditions be admitted to communion:  that they shall both have their
   rank and the right to officiate, but that they shall be altogether the
   inferiors of all those who are enrolled in any church or parish, and
   have been appointed by our most honourable colleague Alexander.  So
   that these men are to have no authority to make appointments of persons
   who may be pleasing to them, nor to suggest names, nor to do anything
   whatever, without the consent of the bishops of the Catholic and
   Apostolic Church, who are serving under our most holy colleague
   Alexander; while those who, by the grace of God and through your
   prayers, have been found in no schism, but on the contrary are without
   spot in the Catholic and Apostolic Church, are to have authority to
   make appointments and nominations of worthy persons among the clergy,
   and in short to do all things according to the law and ordinance of the
   Church.  But, if it happen that any of the clergy who are now in the
   Church should die, then those who have been lately received are to
   succeed to the office of the deceased; always provided that they shall
   appear to be worthy, and that the people elect them, and that the
   bishop of Alexandria shall concur in the election and ratify it.  This
   concession has been made to all the rest; but, on account of his
   disorderly conduct from the first, and the rashness and precipitation
   of his character, the same decree was not made concerning Meletius
   himself, but that, inasmuch as he is a man capable of committing again
   the same disorders, no authority nor privilege should be conceded to
   him.

   These are the particulars, which are of special interest to Egypt and
   to the most holy Church of Alexandria; but if in the presence of our
   most honoured lord, our colleague and brother Alexander, anything else
   has been enacted by canon or other decree, he will himself convey it to
   you in greater detail, he having been both a guide and fellow-worker in
   what has been done.

   We further proclaim to you the good news of the agreement concerning
   the holy Easter, that this particular also has through your prayers
   been rightly settled; so that all our brethren in the East who formerly
   followed the custom of the Jews are henceforth to celebrate the said
   most sacred feast of Easter at the same time with the Romans and
   yourselves and all those who have observed Easter from the beginning.

   Wherefore, rejoicing in these wholesome results, and in our common
   peace and harmony, and in the cutting off of every heresy, receive ye
   with the greater honour and with increased love, our colleague your
   Bishop Alexander, who has gladdened us by his presence, and who at so
   great an age has undergone so great fatigue that peace might be
   established among you and all of us.  Pray ye also for us all, that the
   things which have been deemed advisable may stand fast; for they have
   been done, as we believe, to the well-pleasing of Almighty God and of
   his only Begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost, to
   whom be glory for ever.  Amen.

   On the Keeping of Easter.

   From the Letter of the Emperor to all those not present at the Council.

   (Found in Eusebius, Vita Const., Lib. iii., 18-20.)

   When the question relative to the sacred festival of Easter arose, it
   was universally thought that it would be convenient that all should
   keep the feast on one day; for what could be more beautiful and more
   desirable, than to see this festival, through which we receive the hope
   of immortality, celebrated by all with one accord, and in the same
   manner?  It was declared to be particularly unworthy for this, the
   holiest of all festivals, to follow the custom [the calculation] of the
   Jews, who had soiled their hands with the most fearful of crimes, and
   whose minds were blinded.  In rejecting their custom, [113] we may
   transmit to our descendants the legitimate mode of celebrating Easter,
   which we have observed from the time of the Saviour's Passion to the
   present day [according to the day of the week].  We ought not,
   therefore, to have anything in common with the Jews, for the Saviour
   has shown us another way; our worship follows a more legitimate and
   more convenient course (the order of the days of the week); and
   consequently, in unanimously adopting this mode, we desire, dearest
   brethren, to separate ourselves from the detestable company of the
   Jews, for it is truly shameful for us to hear them boast that without
   their direction we could not keep this feast.  How can they be in the
   right, they who, after the death of the Saviour, have no longer been
   led by reason but by wild violence, as their delusion may urge them?
   They do not possess the truth in this Easter question; for, in their
   blindness and repugnance to all improvements, they frequently celebrate
   two passovers in the same year.  We could not imitate those who are
   openly in error.  How, then, could we follow these Jews, who are most
   certainly blinded by error? for to celebrate the passover twice in one
   year is totally inadmissible.  But even if this were not so, it would
   still be your duty not to tarnish your soul by communications with such
   wicked people [the Jews].  Besides, consider well, that in such an
   important matter, and on a subject of such great solemnity, there ought
   not to be any division.  Our Saviour has left us only one festal day of
   our redemption, that is to say, of his holy passion, and he desired [to
   establish] only one Catholic Church.  Think, then, how unseemly it is,
   that on the same day some should be fasting whilst others are seated at
   a banquet; and that after Easter, some should be rejoicing at feasts,
   whilst others are still observing a strict fast.  For this reason, a
   Divine Providence wills that this custom should be rectified and
   regulated in a uniform way; and everyone, I hope, will agree upon this
   point.  As, on the one hand, it is our duty not to have anything in
   common with the murderers of our Lord; and as, on the other, the custom
   now followed by the Churches of the West, of the South, and of the
   North, and by some of those of the East, is the most acceptable, it has
   appeared good to all; and I have been guarantee for your consent, that
   you would accept it with joy, as it is followed at Rome, in Africa, in
   all Italy, Egypt, Spain, Gaul, Britain, Libya, in all Achaia, and in
   the dioceses of Asia, of Pontus, and Cilicia.  You should consider not
   only that the number of churches in these provinces make a majority,
   but also that it is right to demand what our reason approves, and that
   we should have nothing in common with the Jews.  To sum up in few
   words:  By the unanimous judgment of all, it has been decided that the
   most holy festival of Easter should be everywhere celebrated on one and
   the same day, and it is not seemly that in so holy a thing there should
   be any division.  As this is the state of the case, accept joyfully the
   divine favour, and this truly divine command; for all which takes place
   in assemblies of the bishops ought to be regarded as proceeding from
   the will of God.  Make known to your brethren what has been decreed,
   keep this most holy day according to the prescribed mode; we can thus
   celebrate this holy Easter day at the same time, if it is granted me,
   as I desire, to unite myself with you; we can rejoice together, seeing
   that the divine power has made use of our instrumentality for
   destroying the evil designs of the devil, and thus causing faith,
   peace, and unity to flourish amongst us.  May God graciously protect
   you, my beloved brethren.

   Excursus on the Subsequent History of the Easter Question.

   (Hefele:  Hist. of the Councils, Vol. I., pp. 328 et seqq.)

   The differences in the way of fixing the period of Easter did not
   indeed disappear after the Council of Nicea.  Alexandria and Rome could
   not agree, either because one of the two Churches neglected to make the
   calculation for Easter, or because the other considered it inaccurate.
   It is a fact, proved by the ancient Easter table of the Roman Church,
   that the cycle of eighty-four years continued to be used at Rome as
   before.  Now this cycle differed in many ways from the Alexandrian, and
   did not always agree with it about the period for Easter--in fact (a),
   the Romans used quite another method from the Alexandrians; they
   calculated from the epact, and began from the feria prima of January.
   (b.) The Romans were mistaken in placing the full moon a little too
   soon; whilst the Alexandrians placed it a little too late.  (c.) At
   Rome the equinox was supposed to fall on March 18th; whilst the
   Alexandrians placed it on March 21st.  (d.) Finally, the Romans
   differed in this from the Greeks also; they did not celebrate Easter
   the next day when the full moon fell on the Saturday.

   Even the year following the Council of Nicea--that is, in 326--as well
   as in the years 330, 333, 340, 341, 343, the Latins celebrated Easter
   on a different day from the Alexandrians.  In order to put an end to
   this misunderstanding, the Synod of Sardica in 343, as we learn from
   the newly discovered festival letters of S. Athanasius, took up again
   the question of Easter, and brought the two parties (Alexandrians and
   Romans) to regulate, by means of mutual concessions, a common day for
   Easter for the next fifty years.  This compromise, after a few years,
   was not observed.  The troubles excited by the Arian heresy, and the
   division which it caused between the East and the West, prevented the
   decree of Sardica from being put into execution; therefore the Emperor
   Theodosius the Great, after the re-establishment of peace in the
   Church, found himself obliged to take fresh steps for obtaining a
   complete uniformity in the manner of celebrating Easter.  In 387, the
   Romans having kept Easter on March 21st, the Alexandrians did not do so
   for five weeks later--that is to say, till April 25th--because with the
   Alexandrians the equinox was not till March 21st.  The Emperor
   Theodosius the Great then asked Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria for an
   explanation of the difference.  The bishop responded to the Emperor's
   desire, and drew up a chronological table of the Easter festivals,
   based upon the principles acknowledged by the Church of Alexandria.
   Unfortunately, we now possess only the prologue of his work.

   Upon an invitation from Rome, S. Ambrose also mentioned the period of
   this same Easter in 387, in his letter to the bishops of Æmilia, and he
   sides with the Alexandrian computation.  Cyril of Alexandria abridged
   the paschal table of his uncle Theophilus, and fixed the time for the
   ninety-five following Easters--that is, from 436 to 531 after Christ.
   Besides this Cyril showed, in a letter to the Pope, what was defective
   in the Latin calculation; and this demonstration was taken up again,
   some time after, by order of the Emperor, by Paschasinus, Bishop of
   Lilybæum and Proterius of Alexandria, in a letter written by them to
   Pope Leo I.  In consequence of these communications, Pope Leo often
   gave the preference to the Alexandrian computation, instead of that of
   the Church of Rome.  At the same time also was generally established,
   the opinion so little entertained by the ancient authorities of the
   Church--one might even say, so strongly in contradiction to their
   teaching--that Christ partook of the passover on the 14th Nisan, that
   he died on the 15th (not on the 14th, as the ancients considered), that
   he lay in the grave on the 16th, and rose again on the 17th.  In the
   letter we have just mentioned, Proterius of Alexandria openly admitted
   all these different points.

   Some years afterwards, in 457, Victor of Aquitane, by order of the
   Roman Archdeacon Hilary, endeavoured to make the Roman and the
   Alexandrian calculations agree together.  It has been conjectured that
   subsequently Hilary, when Pope, brought Victor's calculation into use,
   in 456--that is, at the time when the cycle of eighty-four years came
   to an end.  In the latter cycle the new moons were marked more
   accurately, and the chief differences existing between the Latin and
   Greek calculations disappeared; so that the Easter of the Latins
   generally coincided with that of Alexandria, or was only a very little
   removed from it.  In cases when the id' fell on a Saturday, Victor did
   not wish to decide whether Easter should be celebrated the next day, as
   the Alexandrians did, or should be postponed for a week.  He indicates
   both dates in his table, and leaves the Pope to decide what was to be
   done in each separate case.  Even after Victor's calculations, there
   still remained great differences in the manner of fixing the
   celebration of Easter; and it was Dionysius the Less who first
   completely overcame them, by giving to the Latins a paschal table
   having as its basis the cycle of nineteen years.  This cycle perfectly
   corresponded to that of Alexandria, and thus established that harmony
   which had been so long sought in vain.  He showed the advantages of his
   calculation so strongly, that it was admitted by Rome and by the whole
   of Italy; whilst almost the whole of Gaul remained faithful to Victor's
   canon, and Great Britain still held the cycle of eighty-four years, a
   little improved by Sulpicius Severus.  When the Heptarchy was
   evangelized by the Roman missionaries, the new converts accepted the
   calculation of Dionysius, whilst the ancient Churches of Wales held
   fast their old tradition.  From this arose the well-known British
   dissensions about the celebration of Easter, which were transplanted by
   Columban into Gaul.  In 729, the majority of the ancient British
   Churches accepted the cycle of nineteen years.  It had before been
   introduced into Spain, immediately after the conversion of Reccared.
   Finally, under Charles the Great, the cycle of nineteen years triumphed
   over all opposition; and thus the whole of Christendom was united, for
   the Quartodecimans had gradually disappeared. [114]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [114] It is curious that after all the attempts that have been made to
   get this matter settled, the Church is still separated into East and
   West--the latter having accepted the Gregorian Calendar from which the
   Eastern Church, still using the Julian Calendar, differs in being
   twelve days behind.  And even in the West we have succeeded in breaking
   the spirit of the Nicene decree, for in 1825 the Christian Easter
   coincided with the Jewish Passover!

   The Canons of the Councils of Ancyra, Gangra, Neocæsarea, Antioch and
   Laodicea, which Canons were Accepted and Received by the Ecumenical
   Synods.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Introductory Note to the Canons of the Provincial Synods which in this
   Volume are Interjected Between the First and the Second Ecumenical
   Councils.

   The First Canon of the Fourth Ecumenical Council, Chalcedon, reads as
   follows:  "We have judged it right that the canons of the Holy Fathers
   made in every synod even until now, should remain in force."  And the
   Council in Trullo, in its second canon, has enumerated these synods in
   the following words.  "We set our seal to all the rest of the canons
   which have been established by our holy and blessed fathers, that is to
   say by the 318 God-inspired fathers who met at Nice, and by those who
   met at Ancyra, and by those who met at Neocæsarea, as well as by those
   who met at Gangra:  in addition to these the canons adopted by those
   who met at Antioch in Syria, and by those who met at Laodicea in
   Phrygia; moreover by the 150 fathers who assembled in this divinely
   kept and imperial city, and by the 200 who were gathered in the
   metropolis of Ephesus, and by the 630 holy and blessed fathers who met
   at Chalcedon," etc., etc.

   There can be no doubt that this collection of canons was made at a very
   early date, and from the fact that the canons of the First Council of
   Constantinople do not appear, as they naturally would, immediately
   after those of Nice, we may not improbably conclude that the collection
   was formed before that council assembled.  For it will be noticed that
   Nice, although not the earliest in date, takes the precedence as being
   of ecumenical rank.  And this is expressly stated in the caption to the
   canons of Ancyra according to the reading in the Paris Edition of
   Balsamon.  "The canons of the holy Fathers who assembled at Ancyra;
   which are indeed older than those made at Nice, but placed after them,
   on account of the authority (authentian) of the Ecumenical Synod."

   On the arrangement of this code much has been written and Archbishop
   Ussher has made some interesting suggestions, but all appear to be
   attended with more or less difficulties.  The reader will find in Bp.
   Beveridge, in the Prolegomena to his Synodicon a very full treatment of
   the point, [115] the gist of the matter is admirably given in the
   following brief note which I take from Hammond.  In speaking of this
   early codex of the Church he says:

   (Hammond, Definitions of Faith and Canons of Discipline, pp. 134 and
   135.)

   That this collection was made and received by the Church previous to
   the Council of Chalcedon is evident from the manner in which several of
   the Canons are quoted in that Council.  Thus in the 4th Action, in the
   matter of Carosus and Dorotheus, who had acknowledged Dioscorus as
   Bishop, though he had been deposed from his bishopric, "the holy Synod
   said, let the holy Canons of the Fathers be read, and inserted in the
   records; and Actius the Archdeacon taking the book read the 83d Canon,
   If any Bishops, etc.  And again the 84th Canon, concerning those who
   separate themselves, If any Presbyter," etc.  These Canons are the 4th
   and 5th of Antioch.  Again, in the 11th Action, in the matter of
   Bassianus and Stephanus who disputed about the Bishopric of Ephesus,
   both requested the Canons to be read, "And the Judges said, Let the
   Canons be read.  And Leontius Bishop of Magnesia read the 95th Canon,
   If any Bishop, etc., and again out of the same book the 96th Canon, If
   any Bishop," etc.  These Canons are the 16th and 17th of Antioch.  Now
   if we add together the different Canons in the Code of the Universal
   Church in the order in which they follow in the enumeration of them by
   the Council of Trullo and in other documents, we find that the 4th and
   5th of Antioch, are the 83d and 84th of the whole Code, and the 16th
   and 17th of Antioch, the 95th and 96th.  Nice 20, Ancyra 25, Neocæsarea
   14, Gangra 20; all which make 79.  Next come those of Antioch, the 4th
   and 5th of which therefore will be respectively the 83d and 84th, and
   the 16th and 17th the 95th and 96th.

   The fact of the existence of such a code does not prove by any means
   that it was the only collection extant at the time nor that it was
   universally known.  In fact we have good reason, as we shall see in
   connexion with the Council of Sardica, to believe that in many codices,
   probably especially in the West, the canons of that council followed
   immediately after those of Nice, and that without any break or note
   whatever.  But we know that the number of canons attributed to Nice
   must have been twenty or else the numbering of the codex read from at
   Chalcedon would be quite inexplicable.  It would naturally suggest
   itself to the mind that possibly the divergence in the canonical codes
   was the result of the local feelings of East and West with regard to
   the decrees of Sardica.  But this supposition, plausible as it appears,
   must be rejected, since at the Quinisext Council, where it is not
   disputed there was a strong anti-Western bias, the canons of Sardica
   are expressly enumerated among those which the fathers receive as of
   Ecumenical authority.  It will be noticed that the code set forth by
   the Council in Trullo differs from the code used at Chalcedon by having
   the so-called "Canons of the Apostles" prefixed to it, and by having a
   large number of other canons, including those of Sardica, appended, of
   which more will be said when treating of that Council.

   The order which I have followed my justly be considered as that of the
   earliest accepted codex canonum, at least of the East.

   Historical Note.

   Soon after the death of the Emperor Maximin, [116] a council was held
   at Ancyra, the capital of Galatia.  Only about a dozen bishops were
   present, and the lists of subscriptions which are found appended to the
   canons are not to be depended on, being evidently in their present form
   of later authorship; as has been shewn by the Ballerini.  If we may at
   all trust the lists, it would seem that nearly every part of Syria and
   Asia Minor was represented, and that therefore the council while small
   in numbers was of considerable weight.  It is not certain whether
   Vitalis, (bishop of Antioch,) presided or Marcellus, who was at the
   time bishop of Ancyra.  The honour is by the Libellus Synodicus
   assigned to the latter.

   The disciplinary decrees of this council possess a singular interest as
   being the first enacted after the ceasing of the persecution of the
   Christians and as providing for the proper treatment of the lapsed.
   Recently two papyri have been recovered, containing the official
   certificates granted by the Roman government to those who had lapsed
   and offered sacrifice.  These apostates were obliged to acknowledge in
   public their adhesion to the national religion of the empire, and then
   were provided with a document certifying to this fact to keep them from
   further trouble.  Dr. Harnack (Preussische Jahrbücher) writing of the
   yielding of the lapsed says:

   "The Church condemned this as lying and denial of the faith, and after
   the termination of the persecution, these unhappy people were partly
   excommunicated, partly obliged to submit to severe discipline.  Who
   would ever suppose that the records of their shame would come doom to
   our time?--and yet it has actually happened.  Two of these papers have
   been preserved, contrary to all likelihood, by the sands of Egypt which
   so carefully keep what has been entrusted to them.  The first was found
   by Krebs in a heap of papyrus, that had come to Berlin; the other was
   found by Wessely in the papyrus collection of Archduke Rainer.  I,
   Diogenes, have constantly sacrificed and made offerings, and have eaten
   in your presence the sacrificial meat, and I petition you to give me a
   certificate.'  Who to-day, without deep emotion, can read this paper
   and measure the trouble and terror of heart under which the Christians
   of that day collapsed?"

   Greek text together with several Latin versions of different dates.
   Also in Justellus and Beveridge.  There will also be found annotations
   by Routh, and a reprint of the notes of Christopher Justellus and of
   Bp. Beveridge in Vol. IV. of the Reliquiæ Sacræ, ed. altera, 1846.)

   Canon I.

   With regard to those presbyters who have offered sacrifices and
   afterwards returned to the conflict, not with hypocrisy, but in
   sincerity, it has seemed good that they may retain the honour of their
   chair; provided they had not used management, arrangement, or
   persuasion, so as to appear to be subjected to the torture, when it was
   applied only in seeming and pretence.  Nevertheless it is not lawful
   for them to make the oblation, nor to preach, nor in short to perform
   any act of sacerdotal function.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome to Canons I. and II.

   Presbyters and deacons who offered sacrifice and afterwards renewed the
   contest for the truth shall have only their seat and honour, but shall
   not perform any of the holy functions.

   Zonaras.

   Of those that yielded to the tyrants in the persecution, and offered
   sacrifice, some, after having been subjected to torture, being unable
   to withstand to the end its force and intensity, were conquered, and
   denied the faith; some, through effeminacy, before they experienced any
   suffering, gave way, and lest they should seem to sacrifice voluntarily
   they persuaded the executioners, either by bribes or entreaties, to
   manifest perhaps a greater degree of severity against them, and
   seemingly to apply the torture to them, in order that sacrificing under
   these circumstances they might seem to have denied Christ, conquered by
   force, and not through effeminacy.

   Hefele.

   It was quite justifiable, and in accordance with the ancient and severe
   discipline of the Church, when this Synod no longer allowed priests,
   even when sincerely penitent, to discharge priestly functions.  It was
   for this same reason that the two Spanish bishops, Martial and
   Basilides, were deposed, and that the judgment given against them was
   confirmed in 254 by an African synod held under St. Cyprian.

   The reader will notice how clearly the functions of a presbyter are set
   forth in this canon as they were understood at that time, they were "to
   offer" (prospherein), "to preach" (homilein), and "to perform any act
   of sacerdotal function" (leitourgein ti ton hieratikon leitourgion).

   This canon is in the Corpus Juris Canonici Decretum.  Pars I., Dist.
   l., c. xxxii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon II.

   It is likewise decreed that deacons who have sacrificed and afterwards
   resumed the conflict, shall enjoy their other honours, but shall
   abstain from every sacred ministry, neither bringing forth the bread
   and the cup, nor making proclamations.  Nevertheless, if any of the
   bishops shall observe in them distress of mind and meek humiliation, it
   shall be lawful to the bishops to grant more indulgence, or to take
   away [what has been granted].

   For Ancient Epitome see above under Canon I.

   In this canon the work and office of a deacon as then understood is set
   forth, viz.:  "to bring forth" (whatever that may mean) "bread or wine"
   (arton e poterion anapherein) and "to act the herald" (kerussein).
   There is considerable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the
   first of these expressions.  It was always the duty of the deacon to
   serve the priest, especially when he ministered the Holy Communion, but
   this phrase may refer to one of two such ministrations, either to
   bringing the bread and wine to the priest at the offertory, and this is
   the view of Van Espen, or to the distribution of the Holy Sacrament to
   the people.  It has been urged that the deacon had ceased to administer
   the species of bread before the time of this council, but Hefele shews
   that the custom had not entirely died out.

   If I may be allowed to offer a suggestion, the use of the disjunctive e
   seems rather to point to the administration of the sacrament than to
   the bringing of the oblations at the offertory.

   The other diaconal function "to act the herald" refers to the reading
   of the Holy Gospel, and to the numerous proclamations made by the
   deacons at mass both according to the Greek and Latin Rite.

   This canon is in the Corpus Juris Canonici united with the foregoing.
   Decretum., Pars I., Dist. l., c. xxxii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon III.

   Those who have fled and been apprehended, or have been betrayed by
   their servants; or those who have been otherwise despoiled of their
   goods, or have endured tortures, or have been imprisoned and abused,
   declaring themselves to be Christians; or who have been forced to
   receive something which their persecutors violently thrust into their
   hands, or meat [offered to idols], continually professing that they
   were Christians; and who, by their whole apparel, and demeanour, and
   humility of life, always give evidence of grief at what has happened;
   these persons, inasmuch as they are free from sin, are not to be
   repelled from the communion; and if, through an extreme strictness or
   ignorance of some things, they have been repelled, let them forthwith
   be re-admitted.  This shall hold good alike of clergy and laity.  It
   has also been considered whether laymen who have fallen under the same
   compulsion may be admitted to orders, and we have decreed that, since
   they have in no respect been guilty, they may be ordained; provided
   their past course of life be found to have been upright.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   Those who have been subjected to torments and have suffered violence,
   and have eaten food offered to idols after being tyrannized over, shall
   not be deprived of communion.  And laymen who have endured the same
   sufferings, since they have in no way transgressed, if they wish to be
   ordained, they may be, if otherwise they be blameless.

   In the translation the word "abused" is given as the equivalent of
   perischisthentas , which Zonaras translated, "if their clothes have
   been torn from their bodies," and this is quite accurate if the reading
   is correct, but Routh has found in the Bodleian several mss. which had
   perischethentas.  Hefele adopts this reading and translates "declaring
   themselves to be Christians but who have subsequently been vanquished,
   whether their oppressors have by force put incense into their hands or
   have compelled them, etc."  Hammond translates "and have been harassed
   by their persecutors forcibly putting something into their hands or who
   have been compelled, etc."  The phrase is obscure at best with either
   reading.

   This canon is in the Corpus Juris Canonici united to the two previous
   canons, Decretum, Pars I., Dist. l., c. xxxii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IV.

   Concerning those who have been forced to sacrifice, and who, in
   addition, have partaken of feasts in honour of the idols; as many as
   were haled away, but afterwards went up with a cheerful countenance,
   and wore their costliest apparel, and partook with indifference of the
   feast provided; it is decreed that all such be hearers for one year,
   and prostrators for three years, and that they communicate in prayers
   only for two years, and then return to full communion.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   Such as have been led away and have with joy gone up and eaten are to
   be in subjection for six years.

   In the Greek the word for "full communion" is to teleion ("the
   perfection"), an expression frequently used by early writers to denote
   the Holy Communion.  Vide Suicer, Thesaurus ad h. v.

   Bingham.

   [The Holy Communion was so called as being] that sacred mystery which
   unites us to Christ, and gives us the most consummate perfection that
   we are capable of in this world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   As many, however, as went up in mourning attire and sat down and ate,
   weeping throughout the whole entertainment, if they have fulfilled the
   three years as prostrators, let them be received without oblation; and
   if they did not eat, let them be prostrators two years, and in the
   third year let them communicate without oblation, so that in the fourth
   year they may be received into full communion.  But the bishops have
   the right, after considering the character of their conversion, either
   to deal with them more leniently, or to extend the time.  But, first of
   all, let their life before and since be thoroughly examined, and let
   the indulgence be determined accordingly.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   Those who have gone up in mourning weeds, and have eaten with tears,
   shall be prostrators for three years; but if they have not eaten, then
   for two years.  And according to their former and after life, whether
   good or evil, they shall find the bishop gentle or severe.

   Herbst and Routh have been followed by many in supposing that
   "oblation" (prosphora) in this canon refers to the sacrament of the
   altar.  But this seems to be a mistake, as the word while often used to
   denote the whole act of the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, is not
   used to mean the receiving alone of that sacrament.

   Suicer (Thesaurus s.v. prosphora) translates "They may take part in
   divine worship, but not actively," that is, "they may not mingle their
   offerings with those of the faithful."

   Hefele.

   But as those who cannot present their offerings during the sacrifice
   are excluded from the communion, the complete meaning of the canon is:
   "They may be present at divine service, but may neither offer nor
   communicate with the faithful."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   Concerning those who have yielded merely upon threat of penalties and
   of the confiscation of their goods, or of banishment, and have
   sacrificed, and who till this present time have not repented nor been
   converted, but who now, at the time of this synod, have approached with
   a purpose of conversion, it is decreed that they be received as hearers
   till the Great Day, and that after the Great Day they be prostrators
   for three years, and for two years more communicate without oblation,
   and then come to full communion, so as to complete the period of six
   full years.  And if any have been admitted to penance before this
   synod, let the beginning of the six years be reckoned to them from that
   time.  Nevertheless, if there should be any danger or prospect of death
   whether from disease or any other cause, let them be received, but
   under limitation.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   A man who yielded to threats alone, and has sacrificed, and then
   repented let him for five years be a prostrator.

   Zonaras.

   But should any of those debarred from communion as penitents be seized
   with illness or in any other way be brought nigh to death, they may be
   received to communion; but in accordance with this law or distinction,
   that if they escape death and recover their health, they shall be
   altogether deprived again of communion until they have finished their
   six years penance.

   Hammond.

   "The Great Day," that is, Easter Day.  The great reverence which the
   Primitive Church from the earliest ages felt for the holy festival of
   Easter is manifested by the application of the epithet Great, to
   everything connected with it.  The preceding Friday, i.e., Good Friday,
   was called the Great Preparation, the Saturday, the Great Sabbath, and
   the whole week, the Great Week.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VII.

   Concerning those who have partaken at a heathen feast in a place
   appointed for heathens, but who have brought and eaten their own meats,
   it is decreed that they be received after they have been prostrators
   two years; but whether with oblation, every bishop must determine after
   he has made examination into the rest of their life.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   If anyone having his own food, shall eat it with heathen at their
   feasts, let him be a prostrator for two years.

   Hefele.

   Several Christians tried with worldly prudence, to take a middle
   course.  On the one hand, hoping to escape persecution, they were
   present at the feasts of the heathen sacrifices, which were held in the
   buildings adjoining the temples; and on the other, in order to appease
   their consciences, they took their own food, and touched nothing that
   had been offered to the gods.  These Christians forgot that St. Paul
   had ordered that meats sacrificed to the gods should be avoided, not
   because they were tainted in themselves, as the idols were nothing, but
   from another, and in fact a twofold reason:  1st, Because, in partaking
   of them, some had still the idols in their hearts, that is to say, were
   still attached to the worship of idols, and thereby sinned; and 2dly,
   Because others scandalized their brethren, and sinned in that way.  To
   these two reasons a third may be added, namely, the hypocrisy and the
   duplicity of those Christians who wished to appear heathens, and
   nevertheless to remain Christians.  The Synod punished them with two
   years of penance in the third degree, and gave to each bishop the
   right, at the expiration of this time, either to admit them to
   communion, or to make them remain some time longer in the fourth
   degree.

   Canon VIII.

   Let those who have twice or thrice sacrificed under compulsion, be
   prostrators four years, and communicate without oblation two years, and
   the seventh year they shall be received to full communion.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   Whoever has sacrificed a second or third time, but has been led thereto
   by force, shall be a prostrator for seven years.

   Van Espen.

   This canon shews how in the Church it was a received principle that
   greater penances ought to be imposed for the frequent commission of the
   same crime, and consequently it was then believed that the number of
   times the sin had been committed should be expressed in confession,
   that the penance might correspond to the sin, greater or less as the
   case may be, and the time of probation be accordingly protracted or
   remitted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IX.

   As many as have not merely apostatized, but have risen against their
   brethren and forced them [to apostatize], and have been guilty of their
   being forced, let these for three years take the place of hearers, and
   for another term of six years that of prostrators, and for another year
   let them communicate without oblation, in order that, when they have
   fulfilled the space of ten years, they may partake of the communion;
   but during this time the rest of their life must also be enquired into.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   Whoever has not only sacrificed voluntarily but also has forced another
   to sacrifice, shall be a prostrator for ten years.

   [It will be noticed that this epitome does not agree with the canon,
   although Aristenus does not note the discrepancy.]

   Van Espen.

   From this canon we are taught that the circumstances of the sin that
   has been committed are to be taken into account in assigning the
   penance.

   Aristenus.

   When the ten years are past, he is worthy of perfection, and fit to
   receive the divine sacraments.  Unless perchance an examination of the
   rest of his life demands his exclusion from the divine communion.

   Canon X.

   They who have been made deacons, declaring when they were ordained that
   they must marry, because they were not able to abide so, and who
   afterwards have married, shall continue in their ministry, because it
   was conceded to them by the bishop.  But if any were silent on this
   matter, undertaking at their ordination to abide as they were, and
   afterwards proceeded to marriage, these shall cease from the diaconate.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   Whoso is to be ordained deacon, if he has before announced to the
   bishop that he cannot persevere unmarried, let him marry and let him be
   a deacon; but if he shall have kept silence, should he take a wife
   afterwards let him be cast out.

   Van Espen.

   The case proposed to the synod and decided in this canon was as
   follows:  When the bishop was willing to ordain two to the diaconate,
   one of them declared that he did not intend to bind himself to
   preserving perpetual continence, but intended to get married, because
   he had not the power to remain continent.  The other said nothing.  The
   bishop laid his hands on each and conferred the diaconate.

   After the ordination it fell out that both got married, the question
   propounded is, What must be done in each case?  The synod ruled that he
   who had made protestation at his ordination should remain in his
   ministry, "because of the license of the bishop," that is that he might
   contract matrimony after the reception of the diaconate.  With regard
   to him who kept silence the synod declares that he should cease from
   his ministry.

   The resolution of the synod to the first question shews that there was
   a general law which bound the deacons to continence; but this synod
   judged it meet that the bishops for just cause might dispense with this
   law, and this license or dispensation was deemed to have been given by
   the bishop if he ordained him after his protestation at the time of his
   ordination that he intended to be married, because he could not remain
   as he was; giving by the act of ordination his tacit approbation.
   Moreover from this decision it is also evident that not only was the
   ordained deacon allowed to enter but also to use matrimony after his
   ordination....Moreover the deacon who after this protestation entered
   and used matrimony, not only remained a deacon, but continued in the
   exercise of his ministry.

   On the whole subject of Clerical Celibacy in the Early Church see the
   Excursus devoted to that matter.

   Canon XI.

   It is decreed that virgins who have been betrothed, and who have
   afterwards been carried off by others, shall be restored to those to
   whom they had formerly been betrothed, even though they may have
   suffered violence from the ravisher.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   If a young girl who is engaged be stolen away by force by another man,
   let her be restored to the former.

   Hefele.

   This canon treats only of betrothed women (of the sponsalia de futuro)
   not of those who are married (of the sponsalia de præsenti).  In the
   case of the latter there could be no doubt as to the duty of
   restitution.  The man who was betrothed was, moreover, at liberty to
   receive his affianced bride who had been carried off or not.

   Johnson.

   Here Balsamon puts in a very proper cave, viz.:  If he to whom she was
   espoused demand her to be his wife.

   Compare St. Basil's twenty-second canon in his letter to Amphilochius,
   where it is so ruled.

   Canon XII.

   It is decreed that they who have offered sacrifice before their
   baptism, and were afterwards baptized, may be promoted to orders,
   inasmuch as they have been cleansed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   Whoso has sacrificed before his baptism, after it shall be guiltless.

   Hefele.

   This canon does not speak generally of all those who sacrificed before
   baptism; for if a heathen sacrificed before having embraced
   Christianity, he certainly could not be reproached for it after his
   admission.  It was quite a different case with a catechumen, who had
   already declared for Christianity, but who, during the persecution had
   lost courage, and sacrificed.  In this case it might be asked whether
   he could still be admitted to the priesthood.  The Council decided that
   a baptized catechumen could afterwards be promoted to holy orders.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIII.

   It is not lawful for Chorepiscopi to ordain presbyters or deacons, and
   most assuredly not presbyters of a city, without the commission of the
   bishop given in writing, in another parish.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   A chorepiscopus is not to ordain without the consent of the bishop.

   Hefele.

   If the first part of the thirteenth canon is easy to understand, the
   second, on the contrary, presents a great difficulty; for a priest of a
   town could not in any case have the power of consecrating priests and
   deacons, least of all in a strange diocese.  Many of the most learned
   men have, for this reason, supposed that the Greek text of the second
   half of the canon, as we have read it, is incorrect or defective.  It
   wants, say they, poiein ti, or aliquid agere, i.e., to complete a
   religious function.  To confirm this supposition, they have appealed to
   several ancient versions, especially to that of Isidore:  sed nec
   presbyteris civitatis sine episcopi præcepto amplius aliquid imperare,
   vel sine auctoritate literarum ejus in unaquaque (some read en ekaste
   instead of en hetera) parochia aliquid agere.  The ancient Roman ms. of
   the canons, Codex Canonum, has the same reading, only that it has
   provincia instead of parochia.  Fulgentius Ferrandus, deacon of
   Carthage, who long ago made a collection of canons, translates in the
   same way in his Breviatio Canonum:  Ut presbyteri civitatis sine jussu
   episcopi nihil jubeant, nec in unaquaque parochia aliquid agant.  Van
   Espen has explained this canon in the same way.

   Routh has given another interpretation.  He maintained that there was
   not a word missing in this canon, but that at the commencement one
   ought to read, according to several mss. chorepiskopois in the dative,
   and further down alla men mede instead of alla mede then presbuterous
   (in the accusative) poleos and finally ekaste instead of hetera, and
   that we must therefore translate, "Chorepiscopi are not permitted to
   consecrate priests and deacons (for the country) still less (alla men
   mede) can they consecrate priests for the town without the consent of
   the bishop of the place."  The Greek text, thus modified according to
   some mss., especially those in the Bodleian Library, certainly gives a
   good meaning.  Still alla men mede does not mean, but still less:  it
   means, but certainly not, which makes a considerable difference.

   Besides this, it can very seldom have happened that the chorepiscopi
   ordained presbyters or deacons for a town; and if so, they were already
   forbidden, at least implicitly, in the first part of the canon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIV.

   It is decreed that among the clergy, presbyters and deacons who abstain
   from flesh shall taste of it, and afterwards, if they shall so please,
   may abstain.  But if they disdain it, and will not even eat herbs
   served with flesh, but disobey the canon, let them be removed from
   their order.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   A priest who is an abstainer from flesh, let him merely taste it and so
   let him abstain.  But if he will not taste even the vegetables cooked
   with the meat let him be deposed (pepaustho).

   There is a serious dispute about the reading of the Greek text.  I have
   followed Routh, who, relying on three mss. the Collectio of John of
   Antioch and the Latin versions, reads ei de bdelussointo instead of the
   ei de boulointo of the ordinary text, which as Bp. Beveridge had
   pointed out before has no meaning unless a me be introduced.

   Zonaras points out that the canon chiefly refers to the Love feasts.

   I cannot agree with Hefele in his translation of the last clause.  He
   makes the reference to "this present canon," I think it is clearly to
   the 53 (52) of the so-called Canons of the Apostles, to kanoni "the
   well-known Canon."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XV.

   Concerning things belonging to the church, which presbyters may have
   sold when there was no bishop, it is decreed that the Church property
   shall be reclaimed; and it shall be in the discretion of the bishop
   whether it is better to receive the purchase price, or not; for
   oftentimes the revenue of the things sold might yield them the greater
   value.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   Sales of Church goods made by presbyters are null, and the matter shall
   rest with the bishop.

   Hefele.

   If the purchaser of ecclesiastical properties has realized more by the
   temporary revenue of such properties than the price of the purchase,
   the Synod thinks there is no occasion to restore him this price, as he
   has already received a sufficient indemnity from the revenue, and as,
   according to the rules then in force, interest drawn from the purchase
   money was not permitted.  Besides, the purchaser had done wrong in
   buying ecclesiastical property during the vacancy of a see (sede
   vacante).  Beveridge and Routh have shown that in the text
   anakaleisthai and prosodon must be read. [117]

   Canon XVI.

   Let those who have been or who are guilty of bestial lusts, if they
   have sinned while under twenty years of age, be prostrators fifteen
   years, and afterwards communicate in prayers; then, having passed five
   years in this communion, let them have a share in the oblation.  But
   let their life as prostrators be examined, and so let them receive
   indulgence; and if any have been insatiable in their crimes, then let
   their time of prostration be prolonged.  And if any who have passed
   this age and had wives, have fallen into this sin, let them be
   prostrators twenty-five years, and then communicate in prayers; and,
   after they have been five years in the communion of prayers, let them
   share the oblation.  And if any married men of more than fifty years of
   age have so sinned, let them be admitted to communion only at the point
   of death.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.

   Whoever shall have commerce with animals devoid of reason being younger
   than twenty, shall be a prostrator for fifteen years.  If he is over
   that age and has a wife when he falls into this wickedness he shall be
   a prostrator for twenty-five years.  But the married man who shall do
   so when over fifty years of age, shall be a prostrator to his life's
   end.

   It is interesting to compare with this, as Van Espen does, the canon of
   the Church of England set forth in the tenth century under King Edgar,
   where, Part II., canon xvi., we read--

   "If any one twenty years of age shall defile himself with a beast, or
   shall commit sodomy let him fast fifteen years; and if he have a wife
   and be forty years of age, and shall do such a deed let him abstain now
   and fast all the rest of his life, neither shall he presume until he is
   dying to receive the Lord's body.  Youths and fools who shall do any
   such thing shall be soundly trounced."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVII.

   Defilers of themselves with beasts, being also leprous, who have
   infected others [with the leprosy of this crime], the holy Synod
   commands to pray among the hiemantes.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.

   A leper who goes in to a beast or even to leprous women, shall pray
   with the hybernantes.

   Leprosantas is from leproo not from leprao and therefore cannot mean
   "have been lepers," but "have made others rough and scabby."  It is
   only in the passive and in Alexandrian Greek that it has the meaning to
   become leprous.  Vide Liddell and Scott.

   There seems but little doubt that the word is to be understood
   spiritually as suggested above.

   The last word of the canon is also a source of confusion.  Both
   Beveridge and Routh understand by the cheimazomenoi those possessed
   with devils.  Suicer however (Thesaurus) thinks that the penitents of
   the lowest degree are intended, who had no right to enter the church,
   but were exposed in the open porch to the inclemencies (cheimon) of the
   weather.  But, after all it matters little, as the possessed also were
   forced to remain in the same place, and shared the same name.

   Besides the grammatical reason for the meaning of leprosantas given
   above there is another argument of Hefele's, as follows:

   Hefele.

   It is clear that leprosantas cannot possibly mean "those who have been
   lepers"; for there is no reason to be seen why those who were cured of
   that malady should have to remain outside the church among the
   flentes.  Secondly, it is clear that the words leprous ontas, etc. are
   added to give force to the expression alogeusamenoi.  The preceding
   canon had decreed different penalties for different kinds of
   alogeusamenoi.  But that pronounced by canon xvii. being much severer
   than the preceding ones, the alogeusamenoi of this canon must be
   greater sinners than those of the former one.  This greater guilt
   cannot consist in the fact of a literal leprosy; for this malady was
   not a consequence of bestiality.  But their sin was evidently greater
   when they tempted others to commit it.  It is therefore lepra in the
   figurative sense that we are to understand, and our canon thus means;
   "Those who were spiritually leprous through this sin, and tempting
   others to commit it made them leprous."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVIII.

   If any who have been constituted bishops, but have not been received by
   the parish to which they were designated, shall invade other parishes
   and wrong the constituted [bishops] there, stirring up seditions
   against them, let such persons be suspended from office and communion.
   But if they are willing to accept a seat among the presbyterate, where
   they formerly were presbyters, let them not be deprived of that
   honour.  But if they shall act seditiously against the bishops
   established there, the honour of the presbyterate also shall be taken
   from them and themselves expelled.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.

   If a bishop who has been duly constituted, is not received by the
   Church to which he was elected, but gives trouble to other bishops, let
   him be excommunicated.

   If he wishes to be numbered among the presbyters, let him be so
   numbered.  But if he shall be at outs with the bishops duly constituted
   there, let him be deprived of the honour of being even a presbyter.

   The word I have translated "suspended from office and communion" is
   aphorizesthai .  Suicer in his Thesaurus shews that this word does not
   mean only, as some have supposed, a deprivation of office and dignity
   (e.g., Van Espen), but also an exclusion from the communion of the
   Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIX.

   If any persons who profess virginity shall disregard their profession,
   let them fulfil the term of digamists.  And, moreover, we prohibit
   women who are virgins from living with men as sisters.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.

   Whoever has professed virginity and afterwards annuls it, let him be
   cut off for four years.  And virgins shall not go [118] to any as to
   brothers.

   Hammond.

   According to some of the ancient canons digamists were to be suspended
   from communion for one or two years, though Beveridge and others doubt
   whether the rule was not meant to apply to such marriages only as were
   contracted before a former one was dissolved.  Bingham thinks that it
   was intended to discountenance marrying after an unlawful divorce.
   (Ant., Bk. xv, c. iv., § 18.) [119]

   Hefele.

   The first part of this canon regards all young persons--men as well as
   women--who have taken a vow of virginity, and who, having thus, so to
   speak, betrothed themselves to God are guilty of a quasi digamy in
   violating that promise.  They must therefore incur the punishment of
   digamy (successiva) which, according to St. Basil the Great, consisted
   of one year's seclusion.

   This canon is found in Gratian's Decretum (P. II., Causa xxvii., Q. i.,
   c. xxiv.) as follows:  "As many as have professed virginity and have
   broken their vow and contemned their profession shall be treated as
   digamists, that is as those who have contracted a second marriage."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [118] Aristenus understands this to mean to "live with," using the verb
   sunanastrephesthai.

   [119] This view of Bingham's would seem to be untenable, since the
   penance would have been for adultery not for digamy had the former
   marriage still been in force.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Excursus on Second Marriages, Called Digamy.

   To distinguish contemporaneous from successive bigamy I shall use
   throughout this volume the word "digamy" to denote the latter, and
   shall thus avoid much confusion which otherwise is unavoidable.

   The whole subject of second, and even of third and fourth marriages has
   a great interest for the student of early ecclesiastical legislation,
   and I shall therefore treat the matter here (as I shall hope)
   sufficiently and refer the reader for its fuller treatment to books
   more especially upon the subject.

   The general position of the Church seems to have been to discourage all
   second marriages, and to point to a single matrimonial connexion as the
   more excellent way.  But at the same time the principle that the
   marriage obligation is severed by death was universally recognised, and
   however much such fresh marriages may have been disapproved of, such
   disapproval did not rest upon any supposed adulterous character in the
   new connexion.  I cite a portion of an admirable article upon the
   subject by an English barrister of Lincoln's Inn.

   (J. M. Ludlow, in Smith and Cheetham, Dictionary of Christian
   Antiquities, sub voce Digamy.)

   Although among the earlier Romans [120] there was one form of marriage
   which was indissoluble, viz., that by confarreatio, still generally a
   second marriage either after death or divorce was by no means viewed
   with disfavour....Meanwhile an intensifying spirit of asceticism was
   leading many in the Church to a condemnation of second marriage in all
   cases.  Minucius Felix (Octavius, c. 31, § 5) only professes on behalf
   of the Christians a preference for monogamy.  Clement of Alexandria
   (a.d. 150-220) seems to confine the term marriage to the first lawful
   union (Stromata, Bk. ii.)....It would seem, however, that when these
   views were carried to the extent of absolute prohibition of second
   marriages generally by several heretical sects, the Montanists (see
   Augustine, De Hæresibus, c. xxvi.), the Cathari (ib., c. xxxviii.), and
   a portion at least of the Novatianists (see Cotel., Patr. Apol., vol.
   i., p. 91, n. 16) the Church saw the necessity of not fixing such a
   yoke on the necks of the laity.  The forbiddance of second marriage, or
   its assimilation to fornication, was treated as one of the marks of
   heresy (Augustin. u. s.; and see also his De Bono Vid., c. vi.).  The
   sentiment of Augustine (in the last referred to passage) may be taken
   to express the Church's judgment at the close of the fourth century:
   "Second marriages are not to be condemned, but had in less honour," and
   see also Epiphanius, in his Exposition of the Catholic Faith.

   To these remarks of Mr. Ludlow's, I may add that St. Ambrose had
   written (De Viduis, c. xi.), "We do not prohibit second marriages, but
   we do not approve marriages frequently reiterated."  St. Jerome had
   spoken still more strongly (Ep. lxvii., Apol. pro libris adv. Jovin.),
   "I do not condemn digamists, or even trigamists or, if such a thing can
   be said, octagamists."  It does not seem that the penance which was
   imposed in the East upon those entering into second nuptials was
   imposed in the West.  The Corpus Juris Canonici contains two decretals,
   one of Alexander III. and another of Urban III., forbidding priests to
   give the nuptial benediction in cases of reiterated marriage.  In the
   East at second marriages the benediction of the crown is omitted and
   "propitiatory prayers" are to be said.  Mr. Ludlow points out that in
   the "Sanctions and Decrees," falsely attributed to the Council of Nice
   and found in Mansi (vol. ii., col. 1029) it is expressly stated that
   widowers and widows may marry, but that "the blessing of the crowns is
   not to be imparted to them, for this is only once given, at first
   marriages, and is not to be repeated....But if one of them be not a
   widower or widow, let such one alone receive the benediction with the
   paranymphs, those whom he will."

   Canon XX.

   If the wife of anyone has committed adultery or if any man commit
   adultery it seems fit that he shall be restored to full communion after
   seven years passed in the prescribed degrees [of penance].

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.

   An adulteress and an adulterer are to be cut off for seven years.

   Hefele.

   The simplest explanation of this canon is "that the man or woman who
   has violated the marriage bond shall undergo a seven years' penance";
   but many reject this explanation, because the text says auton tuchein
   and consequently can refer only to the husband.  Fleury and Routh think
   the canon speaks, as does the seventieth of Elvira, of a woman who has
   broken the marriage tie with the knowledge and consent of her husband.
   The husband would therefore in this case be punished for this
   permission, just as if he had himself committed adultery.  Van Espen
   has given another explanation:  "That he who marries a woman already
   divorced for adultery is as criminal as if he had himself committed
   adultery."  But this explanation appears to us more forced than that
   already given; and we think that the Greek commentators Balsamon and
   Zonaras were right in giving the explanation we have offered first as
   the most natural.  They think that the Synod punished every adulterer,
   whether man or woman, by a seven years' penance.  There is no reason
   for making a mistake because only the word auton occurs in the passage
   in which the penalty is fixed; for auton here means the guilty party,
   and applies equally to the woman and the man:  besides, in the
   preceding canon the masculine hosoi epangellomenoi includes young men
   and young women also.  It is probable that the Trullan Synod of 692, in
   forming its eighty-seventh canon, had in view the twentieth of Ancyra.
    The sixty-ninth canon of Elvira condemned to a lighter
   punishment--only five years of penance--him who had been only once
   guilty of adultery.

   Canon XXI.

   Concerning women who commit fornication, and destroy that which they
   have conceived, or who are employed in making drugs for abortion, a
   former decree excluded them until the hour of death, and to this some
   have assented.  Nevertheless, being desirous to use somewhat greater
   lenity, we have ordained that they fulfil ten years [of penance],
   according to the prescribed degrees.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.

   Harlots taking injurious medicines are to be subjected to penance for
   ten years.

   The phrase "and to this some have assented" is the translation of
   Hervetus, Van Espen, and Hefele.  Dr. Routh suggests to understand hai
   and translate, "the same punishment will be inflicted on those who
   assist in causing miscarriages," but this seems rather an unnatural and
   strained rendering of the Greek.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXII.

   Concerning wilful murderers let them remain prostrators; but at the end

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.

   A voluntary homicide may at the last attain perfection. [121]

   Van Espen.

   It is noteworthy how singularly appositely [Constantine] Harmenopulus
   the Scholiast in the Epitom. Canonum., Sect. v., tit. 3, tells the
   following story:  "In the time of the Patriarch Luke, a certain bishop
   gave absolution in writing to a soldier who had committed voluntary
   homicide, after a very short time of penance; and afterwards when he
   was accused before the synod of having done so, he defended himself by
   citing the canon which gives bishops the power of remitting or
   increasing the length of their penance to penitents.  But he was told
   in answer that this was granted indeed to pontiffs but not that they
   should use it without examination, and with too great lenity.
   Wherefore the synod subjected the soldier to the canonical penance and
   the bishop it mulcted for a certain time, bidding him cease from the
   exercise of his ministry."

   Canon XXIII.

   Concerning involuntary homicides, a former decree directs that they be
   received to full communion after seven years [of penance], according to
   the prescribed degrees; but this second one, that they fulfil a term of
   five years.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIII.

   An involuntary homicide shall be subjected to penance for five years.

   Van Espen.

   Of voluntary and involuntary homicides St. Basil treats at length in
   his Canonical Epistle ad Amphilochium, can. viii., lvi. and lvii., and
   fixes the time of penance at twenty years for voluntary and ten years
   for involuntary homicides.  It is evident that the penance given for
   this crime varied in different churches, although it is clear from the
   great length of the penance, how enormous the crime was considered, no
   light or short penance being sufficient.

   Canon XXIV.

   They who practice divination, and follow the customs of the heathen, or
   who take men to their houses for the invention of sorceries, or for
   lustrations, fall under the canon of five years' [penance], according
   to the prescribed degrees; that is, three years as prostrators, and two
   of prayer without oblation.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIV.

   Whoso uses vaticination and whoso introduces anyone into his house for
   the sake of making a poison or a lustration let him be subject to
   penance for five years.

   I read ethnon for chronon and accordingly translate "of the heathen."

   Van Espen.

   It is greatly to be desired that bishops and pastors to-day would take
   example from the fathers of Ancyra and devote their attention
   strenuously to eliminate superstition from the people, and would
   expound with animation to the people the enormity of this crime.

   Canon XXV.

   One who had betrothed a maiden, corrupted her sister, so that she
   conceived.  After that he married his betrothed, but she who had been
   corrupted hanged herself.  The parties to this affair were ordered to
   be received among the co-standers after ten years [of penance]
   according to the prescribed degrees.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome to Canon XXV.

   A certain body after being engaged to marry a young girl, violates her
   sister and then takes her to wife.  The first is suffocated.  All who
   were cognizant of the affair are to be subject to penance for ten
   years.

   I have followed the usual translation "hanged herself," which is the
   ordinary dictionary-meaning of apancho, but Hefele says that it
   signifies any and every variety of suicides.

   Balsamon.

   In this case we have many nefarious crimes committed, fornication,
   unlawful marriage [i.e. with the sister of one's mistress] and murder.
   In that case [mentioned by St. Basil in Canon lxxviij. where only seven
   years penance is enjoined] there is only a nefarious marriage [i.e.
   with a wife's sister].

   Historical Note.

   (Zonaras and Balsamon prefix to the canons this note.)

   The Synod gathered together at Neocæsarea, which is a city of Pontus,
   is next in order after that of Ancyra, and earlier in date than the
   rest, even than the First Ecumenical Synod at Nice.  In this synod the
   Holy Fathers gathered together, among whom was the holy Martyr Basil,
   bishop of Amasea, adopted canons for the establishing of ecclesiastical
   order as follow--
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Canons of the Holy and Blessed Fathers Who Assembled at Neocæsarea,
   Which are Indeed Later in Date Than Those Made at Ancyra, But More
   Ancient Than the Nicene:  However, the Synod of Nice Has Been Placed
   Before Them on Account of Its Peculiar Dignity. [122]

   (Annotations by Routh, and reprint of the Notes of Christopher
   Justellus and of Bp. Beveridge will be found in Vol. iv. of the
   Reliquiæ Sacræ.)

   Canon I.

   If a presbyter marry, let him be removed from his order; but if he
   commit fornication or adultery, let him be altogether cast out [i.e. of
   communion] and put to penance.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   If a presbyter marries he shall be deposed from his order.  If he
   commits adultery or whoredom he shall be expelled, and shall be put to
   penance.

   Aristenus.

   A presbyter who marries is removed from the exercise of the priesthood
   but retains his honour and seat.  But he that commits fornication or
   adultery is cast forth altogether and put to penance.

   Van Espen.

   These fathers [i.e. of Neocæsarea] shew how much graver seemed to them
   the sin of the presbyter who after ordination committed fornication or
   adultery, than his who took a wife.  For the former they declare shall
   simply be deposed from his order or deprived of the dignity of the
   Priesthood, but the latter is to "be altogether cast out, and put to
   penance."...Therefore such a presbyter not only did they remove from
   the priestly functions, or the dignity of the priesthood, but perfectly
   or altogether cast him out of the Church.

   This canon Gratian has inserted in the Corpus Juris Canonici.
   Decretum.  Pars I., Dist. xxviii., c. ix.  Gratian has followed Isidore
   in adding after the word "penance" the words "among the laity" (inter
   laicos) which do not occur in the Greek, (as is noted by the Roman
   Correctors) nor in the version of Dionysius Exiguus; these same
   correctors fall however themselves into a still graver error in
   supposing that criminous clerks in the early days of the Church were
   sent out to wander over the country, as Van Espen well points out.

   On the whole subject of the marriage of the clergy in the Early Church
   see the Excursus devoted to that subject.

   Canon II.

   If a woman shall have married two brothers, let her be cast out [i.e.
   of communion] until her death.  Nevertheless, at the hour of death she
   may, as an act of mercy, be received to penance, provided she declare
   that she will break the marriage, should she recover.  But if the woman
   in such a marriage, or the man, die, penance for the survivor shall be
   very difficult.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   A woman married to two brothers shall be expelled all her life.  But if
   when near her death she promises that she will loose the marriage
   should she recover, she shall be admitted to penance.  But if one of
   those coupled together die, only with great difficulty shall penitence
   be allowed to the one still living.

   It will be carefully observed that this canon has no provision for the
   case of a man marrying two sisters.  It is the prohibited degree of
   brother's wife, not that of wife's sister which is in consideration.
   Of course those who hold that the affinity is the same in each case
   will argue from this canon by parity of reasoning, and those who do not
   accept that position will refuse to do so.

   In the Greek text of Balsamon (Vide Beveridge, Synod.) after the first
   clause is added, "if she will not be persuaded to loose the marriage."

   Van Espen.

   The meaning of this canon seems to be that which Balsamon sets forth,
   to wit, that if a woman at the point of death or in extremis promises
   that if she gets better she will dissolve the marriage, or make a
   divorce, or abstain from the sacrilegious use of matrimony, then "she
   may be received to penance as an act of mercy"; and surely she is
   immediately absolved from the excommunication inflicted upon her when
   she was cast out and extruded from the Church.  For it is certain that
   according to the discipline of the Fathers he was thought to be loosed
   from excommunication whoever was admitted to penance, and it is of this
   that the canon speaks; [123] but he did not obtain perfect
   reconciliation until his penance was done.

   To this performance of penance this woman was to be admitted if she got
   well and dissolved the marriage according to her promise made when she
   was in peril of death, as the Greek commentators note; and this too is
   the sense given by Isidore.

   Canon III.

   Concerning those who fall into many marriages, the appointed time of
   penance is well known; but their manner of living and faith shortens
   the time.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   The time of polygamists is well known.  A zeal for penance may shorten
   it.

   Hefele.

   As the Greek commentators have remarked, this canon speaks of those who
   have been married more than twice.  It is not known what were the
   ancient ordinances of penitence which the synod here refers to.  In
   later times digamists were condemned to one year's penance, and
   trigamists from two to five years.  St. Basil places the trigamists for
   three years among the "hearers," and then for some time among the
   consistentes.

   Van Espen.

   "The appointed time of penance is well known."  These words Zonaras
   notes must refer to a custom, for, says he, "before this synod no canon
   is found which prescribes the duration of the penance of bigamists
   [i.e. digamists]."  It is for this reason that St. Basil says (in
   Epist. ad Amphilogium, Can. 4) in speaking of the penance of trigamists
   "we have received this by custom and not by canon, but from the
   following of precedent," hence the Fathers received many things by
   tradition, and observed these as having the force of law.

   From the last clause of this canon we see the mind of the Fathers of
   this synod, which agrees with that of Ancyra and Nice, that; with
   regard to the granting of indulgences, for in shortening the time of
   penance, attention must be paid to the penitence, and conversation, or
   "conversation and faith" of each one separately.

   With this agrees Zonaras, whose remarks are worthy of consideration.
   On this whole subject of the commutation of the primitive penance and
   of the rise of the modern indulgences of the Roman Church Van Espen has
   written at length in his excursus De Indulgentiis (Jure Eccles., P. I.
   i., Tit. vij.) in which he assigns the change to the end of the XI^th
   century, and remarks that its introduction caused the "no small
   collapse of penitential discipline." [124]

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian, Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa xxxi., Quæst. i., c. viij. where for "conversio,"
   (anastrophe) is read "conversatio," and the Greek word is used in this
   sense in Polybius, and frequently so in the New Testament.

   Kirchen Lexicon of Wetzer and Welte.  Also for the English reader to T.
   L. Green, D.D., Indulgences, Absolutions, and Tax tables, etc.  Some of
   the difficulties which Roman theologians experience in explaining what
   are called "Plenary Indulgences" are set forth by Dr. Littledale in his
   Plain Reasons against joining the Church of Rome, in which the matter
   is discussed in the usual witty, and unscrupulous fashion of that
   brilliant writer.  But while this remark is just, it should also be
   remarked that after the exaggeration is removed there yet remains a
   difficulty of the most serious character.

   Canon IV.

   If any man lusting after a woman purposes to lie with her, and his
   design does not come to effect, it is evident that he has been saved by
   grace.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   Whoso lusteth but doth not accomplish his pleasure is preserved of God.

   Hefele.

   Instead of hepithumesai we must read, with Beveridge and Routh, who
   rely upon several mss., epithumesas.  They also replace met' autes by
   aute.

   The meaning of the canon appears to me to be very obscure.  Hefele
   refers to Van Espen and adopts his view, and Van Espen in turn has
   adopted Fleury's view and given him credit for it, referring to his
   Histoire Ecclesiastique, Lib. X., xvij.  Zonaras' and Balsamon's notes
   are almost identical, I translate that of the latter in full.

   Balsamon.

   In sins, the Fathers say, there are four stages, the first-motion, the
   struggle, the consent, and the act:  the first two of these are not
   subject to punishment, but in the two others the case is different.
   For neither is the first impression nor the struggle against it to be
   condemned, provided that when the reason receives the impression it
   struggles with it and rejects the thought.  But the consent thereto is
   subject to condemnation and accusation, and the action to punishment.
   If therefore anyone is assailed by the lust for a woman, and is
   overcome so that he would perform the act with her, he has given
   consent, indeed, but to the work he has not come, that is, he has not
   performed the act, and it is manifest that the grace of God has
   preserved him; but he shall not go off with impunity.  For the consent
   alone is worthy of punishment.  And this is plain from canon lxx. of
   St. Basil, which says; "A deacon polluted in lips (en cheilesi)" or who
   has approached to the kiss of a woman "and confesses that he has so
   sinned, is to be interdicted his ministry," that is to say is to be
   prohibited its exercise for a time.  "But he shall not be deemed
   unworthy to communicate in sacris with the deacons.  The same is also
   the case with a presbyter.  But if anyone shall go any further in sin
   than this, no matter what his grade, he shall be deposed."  Some,
   however, interpret the pollution of the lips in another way; of this I
   shall speak in commenting on Canon lxx. of St. Basil. [125]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [125] Balsamon's note is most curious reading, but beside being
   irrelevant to the present canon of Neocæsarea, would hardly bear
   translation into the vernacular.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   If a catechumen coming into the Church have taken his place in the
   order of catechumens, and fall into sin, let him, if a kneeler, become
   a hearer and sin no more.  But should he again sin while a hearer, let
   him be cast out.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   If a catechumen falls into a fault and if while a kneeler he sins no
   more, let him be among the hearers; but should he sin while among the
   hearers, let him be cast out altogether.

   Zonaras.

   There are two sorts of catechumens.  For some have only just come in
   and these, as still imperfect, go out immediately after the reading of
   the scriptures and of the Gospels.  But there are others who have been
   for some time in preparation and have attained some perfection; these
   wait after the Gospel for the prayers for the catechumens, and when
   they hear the words "Catechumens, bow down your heads to the Lord,"
   they kneel down.  These, as being more perfect, having tasted the good
   words of God, if they fall, are removed from their position; and are
   placed with the "hearers"; but if any happen to sin while "hearers"
   they are cast out of the Church altogether.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   Concerning a woman with child, it is determined that she ought to be
   baptized whensoever she will; for in this the woman communicates
   nothing to the child, since the bringing forward to profession is
   evidently the individual [privilege] of every single person.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   If a woman with child so desires, let her be baptized.  For the choice
   of each one is judged of.

   Van Espen.

   That the reason of the canon may be understood it must be noted that in
   the first ages of the Church catechumens were examined concerning their
   faith before they were baptized, and were made publicly to confess
   their faith and to renounce openly the pomps of the world, as
   Albaspinæus (Aubespine) observes on this canon, "A short while before
   they were immersed they declared with a loud voice that they desired
   baptism and wished to be baptized.  And since these confessions could
   not be made by those still shut up in their parent's womb, to them the
   thing (res) and grace of baptism could not come nor penetrate."  And
   altogether in accord with this is the translation of Isidore-- "because
   the free will of each one is declared in that confession," that is, in
   that confession he declares that he willingly desires to be baptized.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VII.

   A presbyter shall not be a guest at the nuptials of persons contracting
   a second marriage; for, since the digamist is worthy of penance, what
   kind of a presbyter shall he be, who, by being present at the feast,
   sanctioned the marriage?

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   A presbyter ought not to be present at the marriage of digamists.  For
   when that one [126] implores favour, who will deem him worthy of
   favour.

   Hefele.

   The meaning of the canon is as follows:  "If the digamist, after
   contracting his second marriage, comes to the priest to be told the
   punishment he has to undergo, how stands the priest himself who for the
   sake of the feast has become his accomplice in the offence?"

   Van Espen.

   The present canon again shews that although the Church never
   disapproved of, nor reputed second or still later marriages illicit,
   nevertheless the Fathers enjoined a penance upon digamists and those
   repeating marriage, because by this iteration they shewed their
   incontinence.  As he that contracted a second marriage did not sin
   properly speaking, and committed no fault worthy of punishment,
   therefore whatever was amiss was believed to be paid off by a lighter
   penance, and Zonaras supposes that the canons inflicted a mulct upon
   digamists, for saith he, "Digamists are not allowed for one year to
   receive the Holy Gifts."

   Zonaras seems to indicate that the discipline of the canon was not in
   force in his time, for he says, "Although this is found in our
   writings, yet we ourselves have seen the Patriarch and many
   Metropolitans present at the feast for the second nuptials of the
   Emperor."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [126] Bp. Beveridge for "that one" translates "the digamist."  The
   meaning is very obscure at best.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VIII.

   If the wife of a layman has committed adultery and been clearly
   convicted, such [a husband] cannot enter the ministry; and if she
   commit adultery after his ordination, he must put her away; but if he
   retain her, he can have no part in the ministry committed to him.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   A layman whose wife is an adulteress cannot be a clergyman, and a
   cleric who keeps an adulteress shall be expelled.

   Van Espen.

   Although the Eastern Church allows the clergy to have wives, even
   priests, and permits to them the use of marriage after ordination,
   nevertheless it requires of them the highest conjugal continency, as is
   seen by the present canon.  For here it is evident that the Fathers
   wished even the smallest possible kind of incontinence to be absent
   from men dedicated to holiness.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxxiv., c. xi.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IX.

   A presbyter who has been promoted after having committed carnal sin,
   and who shall confess that he had sinned before his ordination, shall
   not make the oblation, though he may remain in his other functions on
   account of his zeal in other respects; for the majority have affirmed
   that ordination blots out other kinds of sins.  But if he do not
   confess and cannot be openly convicted, the decision shall depend upon
   himself.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   If a presbyter confess that he has sinned, [127] let him abstain from
   the oblation, and from it only.  For certain sins orders remit.  If he
   neither confess nor is convicted, let him have power over himself.

   Van Espen.

   Therefore if he who before his ordination had committed a sin of the
   flesh with a woman, confess it after ordination, when he is already a
   priest, he cannot perform the priestly office, he can neither offer nor
   consecrate the oblations, even though after his ordination he has
   preserved uprightness of living and been careful to exercise virtue; as
   the words "zeal in other respects" ("studious of good") Zonaras rightly
   interprets.

   And since here the consideration is of a sin committed before
   ordination, and also concerning a presbyter who after his ordination
   was of spotless life, and careful to exercise virtue, the Fathers
   rightly wished that he should not, against his will, be deposed from
   the priestly office.

   It is certainly curious that this canon speaks of ordination as in the
   opinion of most persons taking away all sins except consummated carnal
   offences.  And it will be noted that the aphienai must mean more than
   that they are forgiven by ordination, for they had been forgiven long
   ago by God upon true contrition, but that they were made to be
   non-existent, as if they had never been, so that they were no
   hinderance to the exercise of the spiritual office.  I offer no
   explanation of the difficulty and only venture to doubt the
   satisfactory character of any of the explanations given by the
   commentators.  Moreover it is hard to grasp the logical connexion of
   the clauses, and what this "blotting out" of ta loipa has to do with
   the matter I entirely fail to see.  The kai after polloi may possibly
   suggest that something has dropped out.

   This canon and the following are together in the Corpus Juris Canonici,
   Gratian's Decretum, Pars II., Causa xv., Quæst. viii., c. i.

   Likewise, if a deacon have fallen into the same sin, let him have the
   rank of a minister.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   A deacon found in the same crime shall remain a minister (huperetes).

   Hefele.

   By ministers (huperetai) are meant inferior officers of the Church--the
   so-called minor orders, often including the subdeacons.

   This canon is in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum, Pars
   II., Causa xv., Quæst. viii., united with canon ix., and in the
   following curious form:  "Similiter et diaconus, si in eodem culpæ

   Canon XI.

   Let not a presbyter be ordained before he is thirty years of age, even
   though he be in all respects a worthy man, but let him be made to
   wait.  For our Lord Jesus Christ was baptized and began to teach in his
   thirtieth year.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   Unless he be xxx. years of age none shall be presbyter, even should he
   be worthy, following the example of the baptism of our Saviour.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. lxxviii., c. iv.

   Gratian.

   (Ut supra, Nota.)

   This is the law, and we do not read that Christ, or John the Baptist,
   or Ezechiel, or some other of the Prophets prophesied or preached
   before that age.  But Jeremiah and Daniel we read received the spirit
   of prophecy before they had arrived even at youth, and David and
   Solomon are found to have been anointed in their youth, also John the
   Evangelist, while still a youth, was chosen by the Lord for an Apostle,
   and we find that with the rest he was sent forth to preach:  Paul also,
   as we know, while still a young man was called by the Lord, and was
   sent out to preach.  The Church in like manner, when necessity compels,
   is wont to ordain some under thirty years of age.

   For this reason Pope Zacharias in his Letter to Boniface the Bishop,
   number vi., which begins "Benedictus Deus" says,

   C. v.  In case of necessity presbyters may be ordained at xxv. years of
   age.

   If men thirty years old cannot be found, and necessity so demand,
   Levites and priests may be ordained from twenty-five years of age
   upwards.

   Van Espen.

   The power of dispensing was committed to the bishop, and at length it
   was so frequently exercised that in the space of one century [i.e. by
   the end of the xii^th century] the law became abrogated, which was
   brought about by necessity, so that it passed into law that a presbyter
   could be ordained at twenty-five.  And from this it may appear how true
   it is that there is no surer way of destroying discipline and
   abrogating law than the allowing of dispensations and relaxations.
   Vide Thomassinus, De Disc. Eccles., Pars. IV., Lib. I., cap. 46.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XII.

   If any one be baptized when he is ill, forasmuch as his [profession of]
   faith was not voluntary, but of necessity [i.e. though fear of death]
   he cannot be promoted to the presbyterate, unless on account of his
   subsequent [display of] zeal and faith, and because of a lack of men.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   One baptized on account of sickness is not to be made presbyter, unless
   in reward for a contest which he afterwards sustains and on account of
   scarcity of men.

   The word used in the Greek for "baptized" is "illuminated" (photisthe),
   a very common expression among the ancients.

   Aristenus.

   He that is baptised by reason of illness, and, therefore come to his
   illumination not freely but of necessity, shall not be admitted to the
   priesthood unless both these conditions concur, that there are few
   suitable men to be found and that he has endured a hard conflict after
   his baptism.

   With this interpretation agree also Zonaras and Balsamon, the latter
   expressly saying, "If one of these conditions is lacking, the canon
   must be observed."  Not only has Isidore therefore missed the meaning
   by changing the copulative into the disjunctive conjunction (as Van
   Espen points out) but Beveridge has fallen into the same error, not
   indeed in the canon itself, but in translating the Ancient Epitome.

   Zonaras explains that the reason for this prohibition was the
   well-known fact that in those ages baptism was put off so as the longer
   to be free from the restraints which baptism was considered to impose.
   From this interpretation only Aubespine dissents, and Hefele points out
   how entirely without reason.

   Canon XIII.

   Country presbyters may not make the oblation in the church of the city
   when the bishop or presbyters of the city are present; nor may they
   give the Bread or the Cup with prayer.  If, however, they be absent,
   and he [i.e., a country presbyter] alone be called to prayer, he may
   give them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canons XIII. and XIV.

   A country presbyter shall not offer in the city temple, unless the
   bishop and the whole body of the presbyters are away.  But if wanted he
   can do so while they are away.  The chorepiscopi can offer as fellow
   ministers, as they hold the place of the Seventy.

   Routh reads the last clause in the plural, in this agreeing with
   Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore.  In many mss. this canon is united with
   the following and the whole number given as 14.

   "Nor to give the sacrificed bread and to hand the chalice;" otherwise
   it is read "sanctified" [sanctificatum for sacrificatum].  The Greek of
   the council is arton didonai en euche; but Balsamon has arton euches,
   that is, "the bread of the mystic prayer."

   Instead of "let them only who are called for giving the prayer, etc.,"
   read kai eis euchen klethe monos didosin, that is:  "and only he that
   shall have been called to the mystic prayer, shall distribute."

   Canon XIV.

   The chorepiscopi, however, are indeed after the pattern of the Seventy;
   and as fellow-servants, on account of their devotion to the poor, they
   have the honour of making the oblation.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   [Vide ante, as in many mss. the two canons are united in the Ancient
   Epitome.]

   Van Espen.

   The reference to the Seventy seems to intimate that the Synod did not
   hold the chorepiscopi to be true bishops, as such were always reputed
   and called successors, not of the Seventy disciples but successors of
   the Twelve Apostles.  It is also clear that their chief ministry was
   thought to be the care of the poor.

   Zonaras and Balsamon would seem to agree in this with Van Espen.  See
   on the whole subject the Excursus on the Chorepiscopi.

   Canon XV.

   The deacons ought to be seven in number, according to the canon, even
   if the city be great.  Of this you will be persuaded from the Book of
   the Acts.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   Seven Deacons according to the Acts of the Apostles should be appointed
   for each great city.

   This canon was observed in Rome and it was not until the xi^th century
   that the number of the Seven Cardinal Deacons was changed to fourteen.
   That Gratian received it into the Decretum (Pars. I., Dist. XCIII., c.
   xij.) is good evidence that he considered it part of the Roman
   discipline.  Eusebius [128] gives a letter of Pope Cornelius, written
   about the middle of the third century, which says that at that time
   there were at Rome forty-four priests, seven deacons, and seven
   subdeacons; and that the number of those in inferior orders was very
   great.  Thomassinus says that, "no doubt in this the Roman Church
   intended to imitate the Apostles who only ordained seven deacons.  But
   the other Churches did not keep themselves so scrupulously to that
   number." [129]

   In the acts of the Council of Chalcedon it is noted that the Church of
   Edessa had fifteen priests and thirty-eight deacons. [130]   And
   Justinian, we know, appointed one hundred deacons for the Church of
   Constantinople.  Van Espen well points out that while this canon refers
   to a previous law on the subject, neither the Council itself, nor the
   Greek commentators Balsamon or Zonaras give the least hint as to what
   that Canon was.

   The Fathers of Neocæsarea base their limiting of the number of deacons
   to seven in one city upon the authority of Holy Scripture, but the
   sixteenth canon of the Quinisext Council expressly says that in doing
   so they showed they referred to ministers of alms, not to ministers at
   the divine mysteries, and that St. Stephen and the rest were not
   deacons at all in this latter sense.  The reader is referred to this
   canon, where to defend the practice of Constantinople the meaning of
   the canon we are considering is entirely misrepresented.

   The Council of Gangra.

   a.d. 325-381.

   Historical Introduction.

   Synodal Letter.

   The Canons with the Ancient Epitome and Notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Historical Introduction.

   With regard to the Synod of Gangra we know little beside what we learn
   from its own synodal letter.  Three great questions naturally arise
   with regard to it.

   1.  What was its date?

   2.  Who was the Eustathius it condemned?

   3.  Who was its presiding officer?

   I shall briefly give the reader the salient points with regard to each
   of these matters.

   1.  With regard to the date, there can be no doubt that it was after
   Nice and before the First Council of Constantinople, that is between
   325 and 381.  Socrates [131] seems to place it about 365; but Sozomen
   [132] some twenty years earlier.  On the other hand, Remi Ceillier
   [133] inconsistently with his other statements, seems to argue from St.
   Basil's letters that the true date is later than 376.  Still another
   theory has been urged by the Ballerini, resting on the supposition that
   the Eusebius who presided was Eusebius of Cæsarea, and they therefore
   fix the date between 362 and 370.  With this Mr. Ffoulkes agrees, and
   fixes the date, [134] with Pagi, at 358, and is bold enough to add,
   "and this was unquestionably the year of the Council."  But in the old
   collections of canons almost without exception, the canons of Gangra
   precede those of Antioch, and Blondel and Tillemont [135] have
   sustained this, which perhaps I may call the traditional date.

   2.  There does not seem to be any reasonable ground to doubt that the
   person condemned, Eustathius by name, was the famous bishop of
   Sebaste.  This may be gathered from both Sozomen [136] and Socrates,
   [137] and is confirmed incidentally by one of St. Basil's epistles.
   [138]   Moreover, Eustathius's See of Sebaste is in Armenia, and it is
   to the bishops of Armenia that the Synod addresses its letter.  It
   would seem in view of all this that Bp. Hefele's words are not too
   severe when he writes, "Under such circumstances the statement of
   Baronius, Du Pin, and others (supported by no single ancient testimony)
   that another Eustathius, or possibly the monk Eutactus, is here meant,
   deserves no serious consideration, though Tillemont did not express
   himself as opposed to it." [139]

   The story that after his condemnation by the Synod of Gangra Eustathius
   gave up wearing his peculiar garb and other eccentricities, Sozomen
   only gives as a report. [140]

   3.  As to who was the president, it seems tolerably certain that his
   name was Eusebius--if Sozomen [141] indeed means it was "Eusebius of
   Constantinople," it is a blunder, yet he had the name right.  In the
   heading of the Synodal letter Eusebius is first named, and as Gangra
   and Armenia were within the jurisdiction of Cæsarea, it certainly would
   seem natural to suppose that the Eusebius named was the Metropolitan of
   that province, but it must be remembered that Eusebius of Cappadocia
   was not made bishop until 362, four years after Mr. Ffoulkes makes him
   preside at Gangra.  The names of thirteen bishops are given in the
   Greek text.

   The Latin translations add other names, such as that of Hosius of
   Cordova, and some Latin writers have asserted that he presided as
   legate à latere from the pope, e.g., Baronius [142] and Binius. [143]
   Hefele denies this and says:  "At the time of the Synod of Gangra
   Hosius was without doubt dead." [144]   But such has not been the
   opinion of the learned, and Cave [145] is of opinion that Hosius's
   episcopate covered seventy years ending with 361, and (resting on the
   same opinion) Pagi thinks Hosius may have attended the Synod in 358 on
   his way back to Spain, an opinion with which, as I have said, Mr.
   Ffoulkes agrees.  It seems also clear that by the beginning of the
   sixth century the Synod of Gangra was looked upon at Rome as having
   been held under papal authority; Pope Symmachus expressly saying so to
   the Roman Synod of 504.  (Vide Notes on Canons vij. and viij.)

   It remains only further to remark that the Libellus Synodicus mentions
   a certain Dius as president of the Synod.  The Ballarini [146] suggest
   that it should be Bios, an abbreviation of Eusebius.  Mr. Ffoulkes
   suggests that Dius is "probably Dianius, the predecessor of Eusebius."
   Lightfoot [147] fixes the episcopate of Eusebius Pamphili as between
   313 and 337; and states that that of Eusebius of Cæsarea in Cappadocia
   did not begin until 362, so that the enormous chronological
   difficulties will be evident to the reader.

   As all the proposed new dates involve more or less contradiction, I
   have given the canons their usual position between Neocæsarea and
   Antioch, and have left the date undetermined.

   Synodical Letter of the Council of Gangra.

   Eusebius, Ælian, Eugenius, Olympius, Bithynicus, Gregory, Philetus,
   Pappus, Eulalius, Hypatius, Proæresius, Basil and Bassus, [148]
   assembled in the holy Synod at Gangra, to our most honoured lords and
   fellow-ministers in Armenia wish health in the Lord.

   Forasmuch as the most Holy Synod of Bishops, assembled on account of
   certain necessary matters of ecclesiastical business in the Church at
   Gangra, on inquiring also into the matters which concern Eustathius,
   found that many things had been unlawfully done by these very men who
   are partisans of Eustathius, it was compelled to make definitions,
   which it has hastened to make known to all, for the removal of whatever
   has by him been done amiss.  For, from their utter abhorrence of
   marriage, and from their adoption of the proposition that no one living
   in a state of marriage has any hope towards God, many misguided married
   women have forsaken their husbands, and husbands their wives:  then,
   afterwards, not being able to contain, they have fallen into adultery;
   and so, through such a principle as this, have come to shame.  They
   were found, moreover, fomenting separations from the houses of God and
   of the Church; treating the Church and its members with disdain, and
   establishing separate meetings and assemblies, and different doctrines
   and other things in opposition to the Churches and those things which
   are done in the Church; wearing strange apparel, to the destruction of
   the common custom of dress; making distributions, among themselves and
   their adherents as saints, of the first-fruits of the Church, which
   have, from the first, been given to the Church; slaves also leaving
   their masters, and, on account of their own strange apparel, acting
   insolently towards their masters; women, too, disregarding decent
   custom, and, instead of womanly apparel, wearing men's clothes,
   thinking to be justified because of these; while many of them, under a
   pretext of piety, cut off the growth of hair, which is natural to
   woman; [and these persons were found] fasting on the Lord's Day,
   despising the sacredness of that free day, but disdaining and eating on
   the fasts appointed in the Church; and certain of them abhor the eating
   of flesh; neither do they tolerate prayers in the houses of married
   persons, but, on the contrary, despise such prayers when they are made,
   and often refuse to partake when Oblations are offered in the houses of
   married persons; contemning married presbyters, and refusing to touch
   their ministrations; condemning the services in honour of the Martyrs
   [149] and those who gather or minister therein, and the rich also who
   do not alienate all their wealth, as having nothing to hope from God;
   and many other things that no one could recount.  For every one of
   them, when he forsook the canon of the Church, adopted laws that tended
   as it were to isolation; for neither was there any common judgment
   among all of them; but whatever any one conceived, that he propounded,
   to the scandal of the Church, and to his own destruction.

   Wherefore, the Holy Synod present in Gangra was compelled, on these
   accounts, to condemn them, and to set forth definitions declaring them
   to be cast out of the Church; but that, if they should repent and
   anathematize every one of these false doctrines, then they should be
   capable of restoration.  And therefore the Holy Synod has particularly
   set forth everything which they ought to anathematize before they are
   received.  And if any one will not submit to the said decrees, he shall
   be anathematized as a heretic, and excommunicated, and cast out of the
   Church; and it will behove the bishops to observe a like rule in
   respect of all who may be found with them.

   The Canons of the Holy Fathers Assembled at Gangra, Which Were Set
   Forth After the Council of Nice [150] .

   Canon I.

   If any one shall condemn marriage, or abominate and condemn a woman who
   is a believer and devout, and sleeps with her own husband, as though
   she could not enter the Kingdom [of heaven] let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   Anathema to him who disregards legitimate marriage.

   When one considers how deeply the early church was impressed with those
   passages of Holy Scripture which she understood to set forth the
   superiority of the virgin over the married estate, it ceases to be any
   source of astonishment that some should have run into the error of
   condemning marriage as sinful.  The saying of our Blessed Lord with
   reference to those who had become "eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's
   sake," [151] and those words of St. Paul "He that giveth his virgin in
   marriage doeth well, but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth
   better," [152] together with the striking passage in the Revelation of
   those that were "not defiled with women for they are virgins," [153]
   were considered as settling the matter for the new dispensation.  The
   earliest writers are filled with the praises of virginity.  Its
   superiority underlies the allegories of the Hermes Pastor; [154] St.
   Justin Martyr speaks of "many men and women of sixty and seventy years
   of age who from their childhood have been the disciples of Christ, and
   have kept themselves uncorrupted," [155] and from that time on there is
   an ever-swelling tide of praise; the reader must be referred to SS.
   Cyprian, Athanasius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Jerome, Augustine, etc., etc.
   In fact the Council of Trent (it cannot be denied) only gave expression
   to the view of all Christian antiquity both East and West, when it
   condemned those who denied that "it is more blessed to remain virgin or
   celibate than to be joined in marriage." [156]

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Distinc. xxx., c. xii. (Isidore's version), and again Dist.
   xxxi., c. viii. (Dionysius's version).  Gratian, however, supposes that
   the canon is directed against the Manichæans and refers to the marriage
   of priests, but in both matters he is mistaken, as the Roman Correctors
   and Van Espen point out.

   note that while Eustathius and his followers held all marriage to be
   sinful, Luther (at least at one time) taught that it was a sin for
   anyone to remain unmarried who could "increase and multiply!"  The
   Synod of Gangra in this canon sets forth the unchanging position of the
   Catholic Church upon this point.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon II.

   If any one shall condemn him who eats flesh, which is without blood and
   has not been offered to idols nor strangled, and is faithful and
   devout, as though the man were without hope [of salvation] because of
   his eating, let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   Anathema also to him who condemns the eating of flesh, except that of a
   suffocated animal or that offered to idols.

   Hefele.

   This canon also, like the preceding one, is not directed against the
   Gnostics and Manicheans, but against an unenlightened hyper-asceticism,
   which certainly approaches the Gnostic-Manichean error as to matter
   being Satanic.  We further see that, at the time of the Synod of
   Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things
   strangled was still in force.  With the Greeks, indeed, it continued
   always in force as their Euchologies still show.  Balsamon also, the
   well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his
   commentary on the sixty-third Apostolic Canon, expressly blames the
   Latins because they had ceased to observe this command.  What the Latin
   Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown
   by St. Augustine in his work Contra Faustum, where he states that the
   Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews
   in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish
   and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things
   strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by
   few.  But still, as late as the eighth century, Pope Gregory the Third
   (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a
   penance of forty days.

   No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council,
   even though it be one of the undisputed Ecumenical Synods, can be of
   greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first
   council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its
   decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even
   Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed
   by disuser, like other laws.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XXX., c. xiii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon III.

   If any one shall teach a slave, under pretext of piety, to despise his
   master and to run away from his service, and not to serve his own
   master with good-will and all honour, let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   Anathema to him who persuades a slave to leave his master under
   pretence of religion.

   Van Espen.

   This canon is framed in accordance with the doctrine of the Apostle, in
   I. Timothy, chapter six, verse 1.  "Let as many servants as are under
   the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of
   God and his doctrine be not blasphemed."  And again the same Apostle
   teaches his disciple Titus that he should "exhort servants to be
   obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things;
   not answering again; not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity;
   that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."
   (Titus ii. 9 and 10.)

   These texts are likewise cited by Balsamon and Zonaras.

   This Canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars. II., Causa XVII., Q. IV., c. xxxvij. in the version of Isidore,
   and again in c. xxxviij. from the collections of Martin Bracarensis (so
   says Van Espen) and assigned to a council of Pope Martin, Canon xlvii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IV.

   If any one shall maintain, concerning a married presbyter, that is not
   lawful to partake of the oblation when he offers it, let him be
   anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   Anathema to him who hesitates to receive communion from presbyters
   joined in matrimony.

   Hefele.

   As is well known, the ancient Church, as now the Greek Church, allowed
   those clergy who married before their ordination to continue to live in
   matrimony.  Compare what was said above in the history of the Council
   of Nicæa, in connection with Paphnutius, concerning the celibacy and
   marriage of priests in the ancient Church.  Accordingly this canon
   speaks of those clergy who have wives and live in wedlock; and
   Baronius, Binius, and Mitter-Müller gave themselves useless trouble in
   trying to interpret it as only protecting those clergy who, though
   married, have since their ordination ceased to cohabit with their
   wives.

   The so-called Codex Ecclesiæ Romanæ published by Quesnel, which,
   however, as was shown by the Ballerini, [157] is of Gallican and not
   Roman origin, has not this canon, and consequently it only mentions
   nineteen canons of Gangra.

   Canon V.

   If any one shall teach that the house of God and the assemblies held
   therein are to be despised, let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   Whoso styles the house of God contemptible, let him be anathema.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. x.  The commentators find nothing to say upon
   the canon, and in fact the despising of the worship of God's true
   church is and always has been so common a sin, that it hardly calls for
   comment; no one will forget that the Prophet Malachi complains how in
   his days there were those who deemed "the table of the Lord
   contemptible" and said of his worship "what a weariness is it."  (Mal.
   i., 7 and 13.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   If any one shall hold private assemblies outside of the Church, and,
   despising the canons, shall presume to perform ecclesiastical acts, the
   presbyter with the consent of the bishop refusing his permission, let
   him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   Whoso privately gathers a religious meeting let him be anathema.

   Hefele.

   Both these canons, [V. and VI.] forbid the existence of conventicles,
   and conventicle services.  It already appears from the second article
   of the Synodal Letter of Gangra, that the Eustathians, through
   spiritual pride, separated themselves from the rest of the
   congregation, as being the pure and holy, avoided the public worship,
   and held private services of their own.  The ninth, tenth, and eleventh
   articles of the Synodal Letter give us to understand that the
   Eustathians especially avoided the public services, when married clergy
   officiated.  We might possibly conclude, from the words of the sixth
   canon:  me sunontos tou presbuterou kata gnomen tou episkopou, that no
   priest performed any part in their private services; but it is more
   probable that the Eustathians, who did not reject the priesthood as
   such, but only abhorred the married clergy, had their own unmarried
   clergy, and that these officiated at their separate services.  And the
   above-mentioned words of the canon do not the least contradict this
   supposition, for the very addition of the words kata gnomen tou
   episkopou indicate that the sectarian priests who performed the
   services of the Eustathians had received no permission to do so from
   the bishop of the place.  Thus did the Greek commentators, Balsamon,
   etc., and likewise Van Espen, interpret this canon.

   The meaning of this canon is very obscure.  The Latin reads non
   conveniente presbytero, de episcopi sententia; and Lambert translates
   "without the presence of a priest, with consent of the bishop."
   Hammond differs from this and renders thus, "without the concurrence of
   the presbyter and the consent of the bishop."  I have translated
   literally and left the obscurity of the original.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VII.

   If any one shall presume to take the fruits offered to the Church, or
   to give them out of the Church, without the consent of the bishop, or
   of the person charged with such things, and shall refuse to act
   according to his judgment, let him be anathema.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   Whoso performs church acts contrary to the will of a bishop or of a
   presbyter, let him be anathema.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VIII.

   If anyone, except the bishop or the person appointed for the
   stewardship of benefactions, shall either give or receive the revenue,
   let both the giver and the receiver be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   Whoso gives or receives offered fruits, except the bishop and the
   economist appointed to disburse charities, both he that gives, and he
   that receives shall be anathema.

   Pope Symmachus.

   (In his Address to the Synod of Rome a.d. 504.  Labbe and Cossart,
   Concilia, tom. iv., col. 1373.)

   In the canons framed by Apostolic authority [i.e., by the authority of
   the Apostolic See of Rome, cf. Ffoulkes, Smith and Cheetham, Dict.
   Christ. Antiq., art. Gangra] we find it written as follows concerning
   the offerings of fruits which are due to the clergy of the church, and
   concerning those things which are offered for the use of the poor; "If
   anyone shall presume, etc." [Canon VII.]  And again at the same
   council, "If anyone except the bishop, etc." [Canon VIII.]  And truly
   it is a crime and a great sacrilege for those whose duty it is chiefly
   to guard it, that is for Christians and God-fearing men and above all
   for princes and rulers of this world, to transfer and convert to other
   uses the wealth which has been bestowed or left by will to the
   venerable Church for the remedy of their sins, or for the health and
   repose of their souls.

   Moreover, whosoever shall have no care for these, and contrary to these
   canons, shall seek for, accept, or hold, or shall unjustly defend and
   retain the treasures given to the Church unless he quickly repent
   himself shall be stricken with that anathema with which an angry God
   smites souls; and to him that accepts, or gives, or possesses let there
   be anathema, and the constant accompaniment of the appointed penalty.
   For he can have no defence to offer before the tribunal of Christ, who
   nefariously without any regard to religion has scattered the substance
   left by pious souls for the poor.

   Canon IX.

   If any one shall remain virgin, or observe continence, abstaining from
   marriage because he abhors it, and not on account of the beauty and
   holiness of virginity itself, let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   Whoso preserves virginity not on account of its beauty but because he
   abhors marriage, let him be anathema.

   The lesson taught by this canon and that which follows is that the
   practice of even the highest Christian virtues, such as the
   preservation of virginity, if it does not spring from a worthy motive
   is only deserving of execration.

   Zonaras.

   Virginity is most beautiful of all, and continence is likewise
   beautiful, but only if we follow them for their own sake and because of
   the sanctification which comes from them.  But should anyone embrace
   virginity, because he detests marriage as impure, and keep himself
   chaste, and abstains from commerce with women and marriage, because he
   thinks that they are in themselves wicked, he is subjected by this
   canon to the penalty of anathema.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. v., and again Dist. xxxi., c. ix.

   Canon X.

   If any one of those who are living a virgin life for the Lord's sake
   shall treat arrogantly the married, let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   Whoso treats arrogantly those joined in matrimony, let him be anathema.

   On this point the fathers had spoken long before, I cite two as
   examples.

   St. Clement.

   (Epist. I., 38, Lightfoot's translation.)

   So in our case let the whole body be saved in Christ Jesus, and let
   each man be subject unto his neighbour, according as also he was
   appointed with his special grace.  Let not the strong neglect the weak;
   and let the weak respect the strong.  Let the rich minister aid to the
   poor and let the poor give thanks to God, because he hath given him one
   through whom his wants may be supplied.  Let the wise display his
   wisdom, not in words, but in good works.  He that is lowly in mind, let
   him not bear testimony to himself, but leave testimony to be borne to
   him by his neighbour.  He that is pure in the flesh, let him be so,
   [158] and not boast, knowing that it is Another who bestoweth his
   continence upon him.  Let us consider, brethren, of what matter we were
   made; who and what manner of beings we were, when we came into the
   world; from what a sepulchre and what darkness he that moulded and
   created us brought us into his world, having prepared his benefits
   aforehand ere ever we were born.  Seeing therefore that we have all
   these things from him, we ought in all things to give thanks to him, to
   whom be the glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

   St. Ignatius.

   (Epist. ad Polyc. 5, Lightfoot's translation.)

   Flee evil arts, or rather hold thou discourse about these, Tell my
   sisters to love the Lord and to be content with their husbands in flesh
   and in spirit.  In like manner also charge my brothers in the name of
   Jesus Christ to love their wives, as the Lord loved the Church.  If
   anyone is able to abide in chastity to the honour of the flesh of the
   Lord, let him so abide without boasting.  If he boast, he is lost; and
   if it be known beyond the bishop, he is polluted.  It becometh men and
   women, too, when they marry to unite themselves with the consent of the
   bishop, that the marriage may be after the Lord and not after
   concupiscence.  Let all things be done to the honour of God.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. iv.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [158] Lightfoot adopts Laurents' emendation and reads eto.  Sigato has
   also been suggested and Hort's thinks steto to be the genuine reading.
   It all comes to the same thing, however, the meaning being perfectly
   clear.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XI.

   If anyone shall despise those who out of faith make love-feasts and
   invite the brethren in honour of the Lord, and is not willing to accept
   these invitations because he despises what is done, let him be
   anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   Whoso spurns those who invite to the agape, and who when invited will
   not communicate with these, let him be anathema.

   There are few subjects upon which there has been more difference of
   opinion than upon the history and significance of the Agape or
   Love-feasts of the Early Church.  To cite here any writers would only
   mislead the reader; I shall therefore merely state the main outline of
   the discussion and leave every man to study the matter for himself.

   All agree that these feasts are referred to by St. Jude in his Epistle,
   and, although Dean Plumptre has denied it (Smith and Cheetham, Dict.
   Christ. Antiq., s.v. Agapæ), most writers add St. Paul in the First
   Epistle to the Corinthians xi.  Estius (in loc.) argues with great
   cogency that the expression "Lord's Supper" in Holy Scripture never
   means the Holy Eucharist, but the love-feast, and in this view he has
   been followed by many moderns, but the prevalent opinion has been the
   opposite.

   There is also much discussion as to the order in which the Agapæ and
   the celebrations of the Holy Sacrament were related, some holding that
   the love-feast preceded, others that it followed the Divine Mysteries.
   There seems no doubt that in early times the two became separated, the
   Holy Sacrament being celebrated in the morning and the Agapæ in the
   evening.

   All agree that these feasts were at first copies of the religious
   feasts common to the Jews and to the heathen world, and that soon
   abuses of one sort or another came in, so that they fell into ill
   repute and were finally prohibited at the Council in Trullo.  This
   canon of Gangra is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's
   Decretum, Pars I., Dist. xlii., c. i.

   Van Espen is of opinion that the Agapæ of our canon have no real
   connexion with the religious feasts of earlier days, but were merely
   meals provided by the rich for the poor, and with this view Hefele
   agrees.  But the matter is by no means plain.  In fact at every point
   we are met with difficulties and uncertainties.

   There would seem to be little doubt that the "pain beni" of the French
   Church, and the "Antidoron" of the Eastern Church are remains of the
   ancient Agapæ.

   The meaning, however, of this canon is plain enough, to wit, people
   must not despise, out of a false asceticism, feasts made for the poor
   by those of the faithful who are rich and liberal. [159]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [159] Most interesting literature on the whole subject will be found in
   connexion with the frescoes and cups, etc., found in the catacombs.

   Canon XII.

   If any one, under pretence of asceticism, should wear a peribolæum and,
   as if this gave him righteousness, shall despise those who with piety
   wear the berus and use other common and customary dress, let him be
   anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   Whoso despises those who wear beruses, let him be anathema.

   Hefele.

   The beroi (lacernæ) were the common upper garments worn by men over the
   tunic; but the peribolaia were rough mantles worn by philosophers to
   show their contempt for all luxury.  Socrates (H. E., ii. 43) and the
   Synodal Letter of Gangra in its third article say that Eustathius of
   Sebaste wore the philosopher's mantle.  But this canon in no way
   absolutely rejects a special dress for monks, for it is not the
   distinctive dress but the proud and superstitious over-estimation of
   its worth which the Synod here blames.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. xv.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIII.

   If any woman, under pretence of asceticism, shall change her apparel
   and, instead of a woman's accustomed clothing, shall put on that of a
   man, let her be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   Whatever women wear men's clothes, anathema to them.

   Hefele.

   The synodal letter in its sixth article also speaks of this.  Exchange
   of dress, or the adoption by one sex of the dress of the other, was
   forbidden in the Pentateuch (Deut. xxii. 5), and was therefore most
   strictly interdicted by the whole ancient Church.  Such change of
   attire was formerly adopted mainly for theatrical purposes, or from
   effeminacy, wantonness, the furtherance of unchastity, or the like.
   The Eustathians, from quite opposite and hyper-ascetical reasons, had
   recommended women to assume male, that is probably monk's attire, in
   order to show that for them, as the holy ones, there was no longer any
   distinction of sex; but the Church, also from ascetical reasons,
   forbade this change of attire, especially when joined to superstition
   and puritanical pride.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. vi.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIV.

   If any woman shall forsake her husband, and resolve to depart from him
   because she abhors marriage, let her be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   Women who keep away from their husbands because they abominate
   marriage, anathema to them.

   Hefele.

   This canon cannot in any way be employed in opposition to the practice
   of the Catholic Church.  For though the Church allows one of a married
   couple, with the consent of the other, to give up matrimonial
   intercourse, and to enter the clerical order or the cloister, still
   this is not, as is the case with the Eustathians, the result of a false
   dogmatic theory, but takes place with a full recognition of the
   sanctity of marriage.

   Van Espen.

   It would seem that the Eustathians chiefly disapproved of the use of
   marriage, and under pretext of preserving continence induced married
   women to abstain from its use as from something unlawful, and to leave
   their husbands, separating from them so far as the bed was concerned;
   and so the Greek interpreters understand this canon; for the
   Eustathians were never accused of persuading anyone to dissolve a
   marriage a vinculo.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist, xxx., c. iii., but in Isidore's version, which misses
   the sense by implying that a divorce a vinculo is intended.  The Roman
   Correctors do not note this error.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XV.

   If anyone shall forsake his own children and shall not nurture them,
   nor so far as in him lies, rear them in becoming piety, but shall
   neglect them, under pretence of asceticism, let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   Whosoever they be that desert their children and do not instruct them
   in the fear of God let them be anathema.

   Van Espen.

   The fathers of this Synod here teach that it is the office and duty of
   parents to provide for the bodily care of their children, and also, as
   far as in them lies, to mould them to the practice of piety.  And this
   care for their children is to be preferred by parents to any private
   exercises of religion.  In this connexion should be read the letter of
   St. Francis de Sales.  (Ep. xxxii, Lib. 4.)

   It may perhaps be noted that this canon has not infrequently been
   violated by those who are accepted as Saints in the Church.

   This canon is found, in Isidore's version, in the Corpus Juris
   Canonici, Gratian's Decretum, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. xiv.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVI.

   If, under any pretence of piety, any children shall forsake their
   parents, particularly [if the parents are] believers, and shall
   withhold becoming reverence from their parents, on the plea that they
   honour piety more than them, let them be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.

   If children leave their parents who are of the faithful let them be
   anathema.

   Zonaras notes that the use of the word "particularly" shews that the
   obligation is universal.  The commentators all refer here to St.
   Matthew xv., where our Lord speaks of the subterfuge by which the Jews
   under pretext of piety defrauded their parents and made the law of God
   of none effect.

   Van Espen.

   Of the last clause this is the meaning; that according to the
   Eustathians "piety towards God" or "divine worship," or rather its
   pretence, should be preferred to the honour and reverence due to
   parents.

   This canon, in Isidore's version, is found in the Corpus Juris
   Canonici, Gratian's Decretum, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. i.  The Roman
   correctors advertize the reader that the version of Dionysius Exiguus
   "is much nearer to the original Greek, although not altogether so."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVII.

   If any woman from pretended asceticism shall cut off her hair, which
   God gave her as the reminder of her subjection, thus annulling as it
   were the ordinance of subjection, let her be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.

   Whatever women shave their hair off, pretending to do so out of
   reverence for God, let them be anathema.

   Hefele.

   The apostle Paul, in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, xi. 10,
   represents the long hair of women, which is given them as a natural
   veil, as a token of their subjection to man.  We learn from the Synod
   of Gangra, that as many Eustathian women renounced this subjection, and
   left their husbands, so, as this canon says, they also did away with
   their long hair, which was the outward token of this subjection.  An
   old proverb says:  duo si faciunt idem, non est idem.  In the Catholic
   Church also, when women and girls enter the cloister, they have their
   hair cut off, but from quite other reasons than those of the Eustathian
   women.  The former give up their hair, because it has gradually become
   the custom to consider the long hair of women as a special beauty, as
   their greatest ornament; but the Eustathians, like the ancient Church
   in general, regarded long hair as the token of subjection to the
   husband, and, because they renounced marriage and forsook their
   husbands, they cut it off.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. ij.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVIII.

   If any one, under pretence of asceticism, shall fast on Sunday, let him
   be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.

   Whoso fasts on the Lord's day or on the Sabbath let him be anathema.

   Zonaras.

   Eustathius appointed the Lord's day as a fast, whereas, because Christ
   rose from the grave and delivered human nature from sin on that day, we
   should spend it in offering joyous thanks to God.  But fasting carries
   with it the idea of grief and sorrow.  For this reason those who fast
   on Sunday are subjected to the punishment of anathema.

   Balsamon.

   By many canons we are warned against fasting or grieving on the festal
   and joyous Lord's day, in remembrance of the resurrection of the Lord;
   but that we should celebrate it and offer thanks to God, that we be
   raised from the fall of sin.  But this canon smites the Eustathians
   with anathema because they taught that the Lord's days should be
   fasted.  Canon LXIV. of the Apostolic Canons cuts off such of the laity
   as shall so fast, and deposes such of the clergy.  See also Canon LV.
   of the Council in Trullo.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. vij.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIX.

   If any of the ascetics, without bodily necessity, shall behave with
   insolence and disregard the fasts commonly prescribed and observed by
   the Church, because of his perfect understanding in the matter, let him
   be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.

   Whoso neglects the fasts of the Church, let him be anathema.

   I have followed Hefele's translation of the last clause, with which Van
   Espen seems to agree, as well as Zonaras.  But Hardouin and Mansi take
   an entirely different view and translate "if the Eustathian
   deliberately rejects the Church fasts."  Zonoras and Balsamon both
   refer to the LXIX^th of the Apostolical Canons as being the law the
   Eustathians violated.  Balsamon suggests that the Eustathians shared
   the error of the Bogomiles on the subject of fasting, but I see no
   reason to think that this was the case; Eustathius's action seems
   rather to be attributable to pride, and a desire to be different and
   original, "I thank thee that I am not as other men are," (as Van Espen
   points out).  All that Socrates says (H. E. II., xliii.) is that "he
   commanded that the prescribed fasts should be neglected, and that the
   Lord's days should be fasted."

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. viii., in an imperfect translation but not that
   of either Isidore or Dionysius.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XX.

   If any one shall, from a presumptuous disposition, condemn and abhor
   the assemblies [in honour] of the martyrs, or the services performed
   there, and the commemoration of them, let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.

   Whoever thinks lightly of the meetings in honour of the holy martyrs,
   let him be anathema.

   Hefele.

   Van Espen is of opinion that the Eustathians had generally rejected the
   common service as only fit for the less perfect, and that the martyr
   chapels are only mentioned here, because in old times service was
   usually held there.  According to this view, no especial weight need be
   attached to the expression.  But this canon plainly speaks of a
   disrespect shown by the Eustathians to the martyrs.  Compare the
   twelfth article of the Synodal Letter.  Fuchs thought that, as the
   Eustathians resembled the Aerians, who rejected the service for the
   dead, the same views might probably be ascribed to the Eustathians.
   But, in the first place, the Aerians are to be regarded rather as
   opposed than related in opinion to the Eustathians, being lax in
   contrast to these ultra-rigorists.  Besides which, Epiphanius only says
   that they rejected prayer for the salvation of the souls of the
   departed, but not that they did not honour the martyrs; and there is
   surely a great difference between a feast in honour of a saint, and a
   requiem for the good of a departed soul.  Why, however, the Eustathians
   rejected the veneration of martyrs is nowhere stated; perhaps because
   they considered themselves as saints, kat' exochen, exalted above the
   martyrs, who were for the most part only ordinary Christians, and many
   of whom had lived in marriage, while according to Eustathian views no
   married person could be saved, or consequently could be an object of
   veneration.

   Lastly, it must be observed that the first meaning of sunaxis, is an
   assembly for divine service, or the service itself; but here it seems
   to be taken to mean sunagoge the place of worship, so that the sunaxeis
   ton marturon seems to be identical with martyria, and different from
   the leitourgiai held in them, of which the latter words of the canon
   speak.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Epilogue.

   These things we write, not to cut off those who wish to lead in the
   Church of God an ascetic life, according to the Scriptures; but those
   who carry the pretence of asceticism to superciliousness; both exalting
   themselves above those who live more simply, and introducing novelties
   contrary to the Scriptures and the ecclesiastical Canons.  We do,
   assuredly, admire virginity accompanied by humility; and we have regard
   for continence, accompanied by godliness and gravity; and we praise the
   leaving of worldly occupations, [when it is made] with lowliness of
   mind; [but at the same time] we honour the holy companionship of
   marriage, and we do not contemn wealth enjoyed with uprightness and
   beneficence; and we commend plainness and frugality in apparel, [which
   is worn] only from attention, [and that] not over-fastidious, to the
   body; but dissolute and effeminate excess in dress we eschew; and we
   reverence the houses of God and embrace the assemblies held therein as
   holy and helpful, not confining religion within the houses, but
   reverencing every place built in the name of God; and we approve of
   gathering together in the Church itself for the common profit; and we
   bless the exceeding charities done by the brethren to the poor,
   according to the traditions of the Church; and, to sum up in a word, we
   wish that all things which have been delivered by the Holy Scriptures
   and the Apostolical traditions, may be observed in the Church.

   Notes.

   This is lacking in the ancient epitome; and while it occurs after Canon
   XX. in the versions of Dionysius Exiguus and of Isidore Mercator, it is
   not numbered as a canon.  Moreover in John of Antioch's Collection and
   in Photius's Nomocanon, the number of canons is said to be 20.  Only
   the Greek Scholiasts number it as Canon XXI., but its genuineness is
   unquestioned.

   It is curiously enough found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, divided into
   two canons!  Gratian's Decretum, Pars I., Dist. XXX., c. xvj., and
   Dist. xli., c. v.

   Van Espen.

   The Fathers of Gangra recognize not only the Holy Scriptures, but also
   the Apostolical traditions for the rule of morals.

   From this [canon] it is by no means doubtful that the fathers of this
   Synod considered that the Eustathians had violated some already
   existing ecclesiastical canons.  Beveridge is of opinion that these are
   those commonly called the Canons of the Apostles (Synod. I. 5).  Nor is
   this unlikely to be true, for there can be no doubt that the doctrines
   of the Eustathians condemned by this synod are directly opposed to
   those very "Canons of the Apostles"; and no small argument is drawn for
   the authority and antiquity of the Canons of the Apostles from the
   large number of Eustathian teachings found to be therein condemned, as
   Beveridge has pointed out and as can easily be seen by comparing the
   two.

   The Synod of Antioch in Encæniis.

   a.d. 341.

   Historical Introduction.

   The Synodal Letter.

   The Canons, with the Ancient Epitome and Notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Historical Introduction.

   Of the Synod of Antioch which adopted the canons subsequently received
   into the code of the universal church we know the exact date.  This is
   fixed by the fact that the synod was held at the time of the dedication
   of the great church in Antioch, known as the "Golden," which had been
   begun by his father, Constantine the Great, and was finished in the
   days of Constantius.  The synod has for this reason always been known
   as the Synod of Antioch in Encæniis, i.e., at the dedication (in
   Dedicatione), and was holden in the summer of the year 341.
   Ninety-seven bishops assembled together and a large number of them were
   hostile to St. Athanasius, being professed Eusebians, all of them were
   Orientals and most of them belonged to the patriarchate of Antioch.
   Not a single Western or Latin bishop was present and the pope, Julius,
   was in no way represented.  This fact gave Socrates the historian the
   opportunity of making the statement (around which such polemics have
   raged), that "an ecclesiastical canon commands that the churches should
   not make decrees against the opinion of the bishop of Rome." [160]

   But while this much is all clear, there is no council that presents a
   greater amount of difficulty to the historian as well as to the
   theologian.  No one can deny that St. Hilary of Poictiers, who was a
   contemporary, styled it a Synod of Saints (Synodus Sanctorum) [161] ;
   that two of its canons were read at Chalcedon as the "canons of the
   Holy Fathers"; and that Popes John II., Zacharias, and Leo. IV. all
   approved these canons, and attributed them to "Holy Fathers."  And yet
   this synod set forth creeds to rival that of Nice, and, it is said,
   that some of the canons were adopted to condemn Athanasius.

   Various attempts have been made to escape from these difficulties.

   It has been suggested that there really were two Synods at Antioch, the
   one orthodox, which adopted the canons, the other heretical.

   Father Emanuel Schelstraten, S. J. [162] improved on this theory.  He
   supposed that the Eusebians stopped behind in Antioch after the
   orthodox bishops left and then passed the decrees against Athanasius,
   giving out that the synod was still in session.  This has been adopted
   by Pagi, Remi Ceillier, Walch, and to a certain extent by Schröckh and
   others.  But Tillemont demurs to this view, urging that according to
   Socrates [163] the deposition of Athanasius came first and the adoption
   of the canons afterwards.  But Tillemont would seem to have
   misunderstood Socrates on this point and this objection falls to the
   ground.  But another objection remains, viz., that both Socrates and
   Sozomen say that the creeds were drawn up after the deposition of
   Athanasius, "and yet" (as Hefele remarks, Vol. II., p. 63), "St. Hilary
   says that these creeds proceeded from a Synod of Saints.'"

   Schelstraten's hypothesis not being satisfactory, the learned
   Ballerini, in their appendix to the Opera S. Leonis M., have set forth
   another theory with which Mansi agrees in his "Notes on Alexander
   Natalis's Church History."  These maintain that the canons did not come
   from the Council in Encæniis at all, but from another synod held
   before, in 332; but Hefele rejects this hypothesis altogether, on the
   following grounds.  First and chiefest because it has no external
   evidence to support it; and secondly because the internal evidence is
   most unsatisfactory.  But even if the 25 canons were adopted by a synod
   at Antioch in 332, the real difficulty would not be obviated, for
   Socrates says [164] of that synod that there too the "opposers of the
   Nicene faith" were able to elect their candidate to fill the place of
   the banished bishop Eustathius!

   Hefele seems to give the true solution of the whole difficulty when he
   says:  "Certainly Athanasius identified the Eusebians with the Arians
   and we regard them as at least Semi-arians; but at that time, after
   they had made the orthodox confession of faith, and repeatedly declared
   their disapproval of the heresies condemned at Nice, they were
   considered, by the greater number, as lawful bishops, and thoroughly
   orthodox and saintly men might without hesitation unite with them at a
   synod." [165]

   Pope Julius styles the very Eusebian synod that deposed Athanasius
   "dear brethren" while blaming their action, and invited them to a
   common synod to enquire into the charges made against the Saint.  In
   view of all this we may well believe that both orthodox and Eusebians
   met together at the consecration of the Emperor's new church, and that
   the whole church afterwards awarded the canons then adopted a rank in
   accordance with their intrinsic worth, and without any regard to the
   motives or shades of theological opinion that swayed those who drafted
   and voted for them.

   The Synodal Letter.

   (Found in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. II., col. 559.  It really
   is no part of the canons, but I have placed it here, because, as Labbe
   notes, "it is usually prefixed to the canons in the Greek.")

   The holy and most peaceful Synod which has been gathered together in
   Antioch from the provinces of Coele-Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine,
   Arabia, Mesopotamia, Cilicia, and Isauria; [166] to our like-minded and
   holy fellow Ministers in every Province, health in the Lord.

   The grace and truth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ hath regarded
   the holy Church of the Antiochians, and, by joining it together with
   unity of mind and concord and the Spirit of Peace, hath likewise
   bettered many other things; and in them all this betterment is wrought
   by the assistance of the holy and peace-giving Spirit.  Wherefore, that
   which after much examination and investigation, was unanimously agreed
   upon by us bishops, who coming out of various Provinces have met
   together in Antioch, we have now brought to your knowledge; trusting in
   the grace of Christ and in the Holy Spirit of Peace, that ye also will
   agree with us and stand by us as far as in you lies, striving with us
   in prayers, and being even more united with us, following the Holy
   Spirit, uniting in our definitions, and decreeing the same things as
   we; ye, in the concord which proceedeth of the Holy Spirit, sealing and
   confirming what has been determined.

   Now the Canons of the Church which have been settled are hereto
   appended.

   The Canons of the Blessed and Holy Fathers Assembled at Antioch in
   Syria. [167]

   Canon I.

   Whosoever shall presume to set aside the decree of the holy and great
   Synod which was assembled at Nice in the presence of the pious Emperor
   Constantine, beloved of God, concerning the holy and salutary feast of
   Easter; if they shall obstinately persist in opposing what was [then]
   rightly ordained, let them be excommunicated and cast out of the
   Church; this is said concerning the laity.  But if any one of those who
   preside in the Church, whether he be bishop, presbyter, or deacon,
   shall presume, after this decree, to exercise his own private judgment
   to the subversion of the people and to the disturbance of the churches,
   by observing Easter [at the same time] with the Jews, the holy Synod
   decrees that he shall thenceforth be an alien from the Church, as one
   who not only heaps sins upon himself, but who is also the cause of
   destruction and subversion to many; and it deposes not only such
   persons themselves from their ministry, but those also who after their
   deposition shall presume to communicate with them.  And the deposed
   shall be deprived even of that external honour, of which the holy Canon
   and God's priesthood partake.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   Whoso endeavours to change the lawful tradition of Easter, if he be a
   layman let him be excommunicated, but if a cleric let him be cast out
   of the Church.

   The connexion between these canons of Antioch and the Apostolical
   Canons is so evident and so intimate that I shall note it, in each
   case, for the convenience of the student.

   Zonaras and Balsamon both point out that from this first canon it is
   evident that the Council of Nice did take action upon the Paschal
   question, and in a form well known to the Church.

   Van Espen.

   From this canon it appears that the fathers did not deem laymen
   deserving of excommunication who merely broke the decrees, but only
   those who "obstinately persist in opposing the decrees sanctioned and
   received by the Church; for by their refusal to obey they are
   attempting to overturn."  And this being the case, why should such not
   be repelled or cast forth from the Church as rebels?

   Finally this Canon proves that not only bishops and presbyters, but
   also deacons were reckoned among them who, "preside in the Church."  An
   argument in favour of the opinion that the deacons of that time were
   entrusted with hierarchical functions.

   It is curious that as a matter of fact the entire clergy and people of
   the West fell under the anathema of this canon in 1825, when they
   observed Easter on the same day as the Jews.  This was owing to the
   adoption of the Gregorian calendar, and this misfortune while that
   calendar is followed it is almost impossible to prevent. [168]

   Compare Apostolic Canons; Canon VII.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [167] This is the title in the codices of Zonaras; the Parisian edition
   of Balsamon simply reads "The Synod at Antioch."  The Bodleian ms.
   reads "Canons of the Synod at Antioch in Syria."

   [168] There seems but little doubt that the Gregorian Calendar will be
   introduced before many years into Russia.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon II.

   All who enter the church of God and hear the Holy Scriptures, but do
   not communicate with the people in prayers, or who turn away, by reason
   of some disorder, from the holy partaking of the Eucharist, are to be
   cast out of the Church, until, after they shall have made confession,
   and having brought forth the fruits of penance, and made earnest
   entreaty, they shall have obtained forgiveness; and it is unlawful to
   communicate with excommunicated persons, or to assemble in private
   houses and pray with those who do not pray in the Church; or to receive
   in one Church those who do not assemble with another Church.  And, if
   any one of the bishops, presbyters, or deacons, or any one in the Canon
   shall be found communicating with excommunicated persons, let him also
   be excommunicated, as one who brings confusion on the order of the
   Church.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   Whoso comes to church, and attentively hears the holy Scriptures, and
   then despises, goes forth from, and turns his back upon the Communion,
   let him be cast out, until after having brought forth fruits of
   penance, he shall be indulged.  And whoso communicates with one
   excommunicated, shall be excommunicated, and whoso prays with him who
   prays not with the Church is guilty, and even whoso receives him who
   does not attend the services of the Church is not without guilt.

   Balsamon.

   In the Eighth and Ninth canons of the Apostles it is set forth how
   those are to be punished who will not wait for the prayers, and the
   holy Communion:  So, too, in the Tenth canon provision is made with
   respect to those who communicate with the excommunicated.  In pursuance
   of this the present canon provides that they are to be cut off who come
   to church and do not wait for the prayer, and through disorder [?
   ataxian] [169] will not receive the holy Communion; for such are to be
   cast out until with confession they shew forth worthy penance.

   Zonaras.

   In this canon the Fathers refer to such as go to church but will not
   tarry to the prayer nor receive holy Communion, held back by some
   perversity or license, that is to say without any just cause, but
   petulantly, and by reason of some disorder [ataxian]; these are
   forbidden to be expelled from the Church, that is to say cut off from
   the congregation of the faithful.  But the Fathers call it a turning
   away from, not a hatred of the divine Communion, which holds them back
   from communion; a certain kind of flight from it, brought about
   perchance by reverence and lowliness of mind.  Those who object to
   communicate by reason of hatred or disgust, such must be punished not
   with mere separation, but by an altogether absolute excommunication,
   and be cursed with anathema.

   It need hardly be remarked that this canon has no reference to such of
   the faithful as tarry to the end of the service and yet do not partake
   of the holy sacrament, being held back by some good reason, recognized
   by the Church as such.  It will be remembered that the highest grade of
   Penitents did this habitually, and that it was looked upon as a great
   privilege to be allowed to be present when the Divine Mysteries were
   performed, even though those assisting as spectators might not be
   partakers of them.  What this canon condemns is leaving the Church
   before the service of the Holy Eucharist is done; this much is clear,
   the difficulty is to understand just why these particular people,
   against whom the canon is directed, did so.

   This canon should be compared with the Apostolic canons viij., ix., x.,
   xj. xij. and xiij.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [169] I confess I do not know what the phrase kata tina ataxian means,
   nor do the Greek Commentators give much help.  I have translated "by
   reason of some disorder" in the canon itself, and in the notes, but
   Beveridge renders it propter aliquam insolentiam, which to me appears
   very unsatisfactory.  The pro quædam intemperantia of the ordinary
   Latin seems no better.  The same word is used in the next canon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon III.

   If any presbyter or deacon, or any one whatever belonging to the
   priesthood, shall forsake his own parish, and shall depart, and, having
   wholly changed his residence, shall set himself to remain for a long
   time in another parish, let him no longer officiate; especially if his
   own bishop shall summon and urge him to return to his own parish and he
   shall disobey.  And if he persist in his disorder, let him be wholly
   deposed from his ministry, so that no further room be left for his
   restoration.  And if another bishop shall receive a man deposed for
   this cause, let him be punished by the Common Synod as one who
   nullifies the ecclesiastical laws.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   If any cleric leaves his own parish and goes off to another, travelling
   here and there, and stays for a long time in that other, let him not
   offer the sacrifice (leitourgeito ), especially if he do not return
   when called by his own bishop.  But if he perseveres in his insolence
   let him be deposed, neither afterwards let him have any power to
   return.  And if any bishop shall receive him thus deposed, he shall be
   punished by the Common Synod for breach of the ecclesiastical laws.

   Compare with Canons of the Apostles xv. and xvi.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa VII., Quæst. I., Can. xxiv. [170]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [170] Hefele seems to have overlooked this.  The note referring to the
   Apostolic Canons is all wrong (p. 68, n. 1.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IV.

   If any bishop who has been deposed by a synod, or any presbyter or
   deacon who has been deposed by his bishop shall presume to execute any
   part of the ministry, whether it be a bishop according to his former
   custom, or a presbyter, or a deacon, he shall no longer have any
   prospect of restoration in another Synod; nor any opportunity of making
   his defence; but they who communicate with him shall all be cast out of
   the Church, and particularly if they have presumed to communicate with
   the persons aforementioned, knowing the sentence pronounced against
   them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   If a bishop deposed by a synod shall dare to celebrate the liturgy, let
   him have no chance of return.

   This canon derives its chief interest from the fact that it is usually
   considered to have been adopted at the instigation of the party opposed
   to St. Athanasius and that afterwards it was used against St.
   Chrysostom.  But while such may have been the secret reason why some
   voted for it and others prized it, it must be remembered that its
   provision is identical with that of the Apostolic Canons, and that it
   was read at the Council of Chalcedon as Canon eighty-three.  Remi
   Ceillier (Histoire Genéral des Autheurs, p. 659) tries to prove that
   this is not the canon which St. Chrysostom and his friends rejected,
   but Hefele thinks his position "altogether untenable" (Hist. of the
   Councils, Vol. II., p. 62, n. 1), and refers to Tillemont (Mémoires, p.
   329, Sur les Arians, and Fuchs' Bib. der Kirchenversammlungen, P. II.,
   p. 59. [171] )

   Compare Apostolic Canon xxviij.

   This canon is found twice in the Juris Corpus Canonici, Gratian's
   Decretum, Pars II., Causa XI., Quæst. III., Can. vj., and Can. vij. in
   the version of Martin Bracarensis.  This version is very interesting as
   expanding the phrase "to execute any part of the ministry" into "to
   make the oblation, or to perform the morning or evening sacrifice as
   though he were in office just as before, etc."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [171] Hefele on the preceding page (p. 61, n. 1) says "Of course the
   sentence or canon to which the adversaries of Chrysostom referred must
   be distinguished from the fourth and twelfth true Antiochian canons.
   It seems somewhat difficult to reconcile this with what I have cited
   above, and with the following (p. 65):  "In the affair of St.
   Chrysostom the canon employed against him was represented as proceeding
   from the Arians, and all attempts to deny its identity with our fourth
   and twelfth Antiochian canons are fruitless."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   If any presbyter or deacon, despising this own bishop, has separated
   himself from the Church, and gathered a private assembly, and set up an
   altar; and if, when summoned by his bishop, he shall refuse to be
   persuaded and will not obey, even though he summon him a first and a
   second time, let such an one be wholly deposed and have no further
   remedy, neither be capable of regaining his rank.  And if he persist in
   troubling and disturbing the Church, let him be corrected, as a
   seditious person, by the civil power.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   Any presbyter or deacon who spurns his bishop, and withdraws from him,
   and sets up another altar, if after being thrice called by the bishop,
   he shall persist in his arrogancy, let him be deposed and be deprived
   of all hope of restoration.

   It will be noted that the Ancient Epitome mentions three warnings, and
   the canon only two.  The epitome in this evidently follows the
   Apostolical Canon, number thirty-one.  It is somewhat curious that
   Aristenus in commenting on this canon does not note the discrepancy.

   Van Espen.

   This canon, together with the preceding was read from the Code of
   Canons at the Council of Chalcedon, at the Fourth Session in connexion
   with the case of Carosus and Dorothoeus, and of other monks who adhered
   to them.  And a sentence in accordance with them was conceived in these
   words against those who would not obey the Council in the condemnation
   of Eutyches, "Let them know that they together with the monks who are
   with them, are deprived of grade, and of all dignity, and of communion,
   as well as he, so that they cease to preside over their monasteries:
   and if they attempt to escape, this holy and universal great council
   decrees the same punishment shall attach to them, that is to say the
   external authority, according to the divine and holy laws of the
   Fathers, shall carry out the sentence passed against the contumacious."

   This canon shews that monks and clerics who were rebellious were
   sometimes coerced by the Secular Power, when the ecclesiastical power
   was not sufficient to coerce them, and hence it was that the secular
   arm was called in.

   Compare with this Apostolic Canon XXXI.

   The last clause of this canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici,
   Gratian's Decretum, Pars II. Causa XI., Quæst VIII. Can. vij.  (The
   Latin however for "by the civil power" is, as is pointed out by the
   Roman Correctors, per forinsecam potestatem or per forasticam
   potestatem.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   If any one has been excommunicated by his own bishop, let him not be
   received by others until he has either been restored by his own bishop,
   or until, when a synod is held, he shall have appeared and made his
   defence, and, having convinced the synod, shall have received a
   different sentence.  And let this decree apply to the laity, and to
   presbyters and deacons, and all who are enrolled in the clergy-list.

   Notes.

   The sentence of the greater synod upon a clerk excommunicated by his
   bishop, whether of acquittal or condemnation, shall stand.

   Correctors note that Dionysius must have had a different reading from
   the Greek we know.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VIII.

   Let not country presbyters give letters canonical, or let them send
   such letters only to the neighbouring bishops.  But the chorepiscopi of
   good report may give letters pacifical.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   A country presbyter is not to give canonical letters, or [at most] only
   to a neighbouring bishop.

   These "letters canonical" were called in the West letters "formatæ,"
   and no greater proof of the great influence they had in the early days
   of the Church in binding the faithful together can be found than the
   fact that Julian the Apostate made an attempt to introduce something
   similar among the pagans of his empire.

   "Commendatory letters" (epistolai sustatikai) are spoken of by St. Paul
   in 2 Cor. iii. 1, and the reader will find some interesting remarks on
   this and cognate subjects in J. J. Blunt's, The Christian Church during
   the first three Centuries (Chapter II).

   By means of these letters even the lay people found hospitality and
   care in every part of the world, and it was thrown up against the
   Donatists as a mark of their being schismatics that their canonical
   letters were good only among themselves.

   Pseudo-Isidore informs us that it was stated at the Council of
   Chalcedon by Atticus, bishop of Constantinople, that it was agreed at
   the Council of Nice that all such letters should be marked P. U. A. P.
   (i.e. Father, Son, Holy Spirit), and it is asserted (Herzog,
   Real-Encyk., s.v. Literæ Formatæ) that this form is found in German
   documents of the sixth century.

   As will be seen among the Canons of Chalcedon, the old name, Letters
   Commendatory, is continued, but in this canon and in the 41st of
   Laodicea the expression "Canonical Letters" is used.  In the West, at
   least, these letters received the episcopal seal of the diocese to
   avoid all possibility of imposture.  Dean Plumptre (whom I am following
   very closely in this note) believes the earliest evidence of this use
   of the diocesan seal is in Augustine (Epist. lix. al. ccxvij.)  He also
   refers to Ducange, s.v. Formatæ.

   As these letters admitted their bearers to communion they were
   sometimes called "Communion letters" (koinonikai ), and are so
   described by St. Cyril of Alexandria; and by the Council of Elvira
   (canon xxv.), and by St. Augustine (Epist. xliii. al. clxii).

   The "Letters Pacifical" appear to have been of an eleemosynary
   character, so that the bearers of them obtained bodily help.  Chalcedon
   in its eleventh canon ordains these "Letters pacifical" shall be given
   to the poor, whether they be clerics or laics.  The same expression is
   used in the preceding canon of the synod.

   A later form of ecclesiastical letter is that with which we are so
   familiar, the "letter dimissory."  This expression first occurs in
   Canon XVII. of the Council in Trullo.  On this expression Suicer
   (Thesaurus, s.v. apolutike) draws from the context the conclusion that
   "letters dimissory" were given only for permanent change of
   ecclesiastical residence, while, "letters commendatory" were given to
   those whose absence from their diocese was only temporary.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IX.

   It behoves the bishops in every province to acknowledge the bishop who
   presides in the metropolis, and who has to take thought for the whole
   province; because all men of business come together from every quarter
   to the metropolis.  Wherefore it is decreed that he have precedence in
   rank, and that the other bishops do nothing extraordinary without him,
   (according to the ancient canon which prevailed from [the times of] our
   Fathers) or such things only as pertain to their own particular
   parishes and the districts subject to them.  For each bishop has
   authority over his own parish, both to manage it with the piety which
   is incumbent on every one, and to make provision for the whole district
   which is dependent on his city; to ordain presbyters and deacons; and
   to settle everything with judgment.  But let him undertake nothing
   further without the bishop of the metropolis; neither the latter
   without the consent of the others.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   Bishops should be bound to the opinion of the metropolitan, and nothing
   should they do without his knowledge except only such things as have
   reference to the diocese of each, and let them ordain men free from
   blame.

   Van Espen.

   From this canon we see that causes of more importance and greater
   moment are to be considered in the Provincial Synod which consisted of
   the metropolitan and the other bishops of the province.

   By the "ancient canon" of which mention is here made, there can
   scarcely be a doubt is intended the xxxiv. of the Canons of the
   Apostles, since in it are read the same provisions (and almost in the
   same words) as here are set forth somewhat more at length; nor is there
   any other canon in which these provisions are found earlier in date
   than this synod, wherefore from this is deduced a strong argument for
   the integrity of the Canons of the Apostles.

   The wording of this canon should be compared with the famous sentence
   so often quoted of St. Irenæus.  "Ad hanc enim ecclesiam [i.e. of Rome]
   propter potentiorem principalitatem necesse est omnem convenire
   ecclesiam, hoc est, eos qui sunt undique fideles, in quâ semper ab his,
   qui sunt undique, conservata est eaque est ab Apostolis traditio."

   Is it not likely that in the lost Greek original the words translated
   convenire ad were suntrechein en?  Vide on the meaning of convenire ad,
   F. W. Puller, The Primitive Saints and the See of Rome, pp. 32 et seqq.

   Compare Apostolic Canon XXXIV.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon X.

   The Holy Synod decrees that persons in villages and districts, or those
   who are called chorepiscopi, even though they may have received
   ordination to the Episcopate, shall regard their own limits and manage
   the churches subject to them, and be content with the care and
   administration of these; but they may ordain readers, sub-deacons and
   exorcists, and shall be content with promoting these, but shall not
   presume to ordain either a presbyter or a deacon, without the consent
   of bishop of the city to which he and his district are subject.  And if
   he shall dare to transgress [these] decrees, he shall be deposed from
   the rank which he enjoys.  And a chorepiscopus is to be appointed by
   the bishop of the city to which he is subject.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   A chorepiscopus makes Exorcists, Lectors, Subdeacons and Singers, but
   not a presbyter or a deacon without the bishop of the city.  Who dares
   to transgress this law let him be deposed.  The bishop of the city
   makes the chorepiscopus.

   For the Minor Orders in the Early Church see the Excursus on the
   subject appended to Canon XXIV. of Laodicea.

   "Ordination to the episcopate."  In translating thus I have followed
   both Dionysius and Isidore, the former of whom translates "although
   they had received the imposition of the hand of the bishop and had been
   consecrated bishops;" and the latter "although they had received from
   bishops the imposition of the hand, and had been consecrated bishops."

   Van Espen.

   There can be no doubt that the Chorepiscopi, the authority of whom is
   limited by this canon, are supposed to be endowed with the episcopal
   character.  Among the learned there is a controversy as to whether
   Chorepiscopi were true bishops by virtue of the ordination to that
   office, and endowed with the episcopal character or were only bishops
   when accidentally so.  But whatever may be the merits of this
   controversy, there can be no doubt from the context of this canon that
   the Fathers of Antioch took it for granted that the chorepiscopi were
   true bishops by virtue of their ordination, but it is also evident that
   they were subject to the bishop of the greater city.  It must also be
   noted that these chorepiscopi were not instituted by the canons of the
   Councils of Ancyra, Neocæsarea, or even of Nice, for these speak of
   them and make their decrees as concerning something already existing.

   And from the very limitations of this canon it is by no means obscure
   that the fathers of Antioch supposed these chorepiscopi to be real
   bishops, for otherwise even with the license of the bishop of the city
   they could not ordain presbyters or deacons.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XI.

   If any bishop, or presbyter, or any one whatever of the canon shall
   presume to betake himself to the Emperor without the consent and
   letters of the bishop of the province, and particularly of the bishop
   of the metropolis, such a one shall be publicly deposed and cast out,
   not only from communion, but also from the rank which he happens to
   have; inasmuch as he dares to trouble the ears of our Emperor beloved
   of God, contrary to the law of the Church.  But, if necessary business
   shall require any one to go to the Emperor, let him do it with the
   advice and consent of the metropolitan and other bishops in the
   province, and let him undertake his journey with letters from them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   A bishop or presbyter who of his own motion and not at the bidding of
   the Metropolitan of the province goes to the Emperor shall be deprived
   both of communion and dignity.

   This canon is one of those magnificent efforts which the early church
   made to check the already growing inclination to what we have in later
   times learned to call Erastianism.  Not only did the State, as soon as
   it became Christian, interfere in spiritual matters at its own motion,
   but there were found bishops and others of the clergy who not being
   able to attain their ends otherwise, appealed to the civil power,
   usually to the Emperor himself, and thus the whole discipline of the
   Church was threatened, and the authority of spiritual synods set
   aside.  How unsuccessful the Church often was in this struggle is only
   too evident from the remarks of the Greek commentator Balsamon on this
   very canon.

   Hefele.

   Kellner (Das Buss. und Strafversahren, p. 61) remarks with reference to
   this, that deposition is here treated as a heavier punishment than
   exclusion from communion, and therefore the latter cannot mean actual
   excommunication but only suspension.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XII.

   If any presbyter or deacon deposed by his own bishop, or any bishop
   deposed by a synod, shall dare to trouble the ears of the Emperor, when
   it is his duty to submit his case to a greater synod of bishops, and to
   refer to more bishops the things which he thinks right, and to abide by
   the examination and decision made by them; if, despising these, he
   shall trouble the Emperor, he shall be entitled to no pardon, neither
   shall he have an opportunity of defence, nor any hope of future
   restoration.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   One deposed, if he shall have troubled the Emperor, shall seek the
   greater synod, and submit to its decree.  But if he again misbehave
   himself, he shall not have any chance of restoration.

   It is usually supposed that this canon, as well as the fourth, and the
   fourteenth and fifteenth, was directed against St. Athanasius, and it
   was used against St. Chrysostom by his enemies.  Vide Socrates,
   Ecclesiastical History, Book II., Chapter viij., and Sozomen's
   Ecclesiastical History, Book III., chapter v.; also ibid. Book VII.,
   chapter xx.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa XXI., Quæst. V., Can. ij., in Isidore's Version.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIII.

   No bishop shall presume to pass from one province to another, and
   ordain persons to the dignity of the ministry in the Church, not even
   should he have others with him, unless he should go at the written
   invitation of the metropolitan and bishops into whose country he goes.
   But if he should, without invitation, proceed irregularly to the
   ordination of any, or to the regulation of ecclesiastical affairs which
   do not concern him, the things done by him are null, and he himself
   shall suffer the due punishment of his irregularity and his
   unreasonable undertaking, by being forthwith deposed by the holy Synod.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   If without invitation a bishop shall go into another province, and
   shall ordain, and administer affairs, what he does shall be void and he
   himself shall be deposed.

   Compare with this Apostolic Canon xxxv.; also canon xxii. of this same
   synod.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa ix., Quæst. II., Can. vj. in the Versio Prisca.  The
   Roman Correctors are not satisfied with it, however, nor with any
   version and give the Greek text, to which they add an accurate
   translation.

   Canon XIV.

   If a bishop shall be tried on any accusations, and it should then
   happen that the bishops of the province disagree concerning him, some
   pronouncing the accused innocent, and others guilty; for the settlement
   of all disputes, the holy Synod decrees that the metropolitan call on
   some others belonging to the neighbouring province, who shall add their
   judgment and resolve the dispute, and thus, with those of the province,
   confirm what is determined.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   If the bishops of the province disagree among themselves as to an
   accused bishop, that the controversy may be certainly settled, let
   other neighbouring bishops be called in.

   Zonaras.

   When any bishop shall have been condemned with unanimous consent by all
   the bishops of the province, the condemnation cannot be called into
   doubt, as this synod has set forth in its fourth canon.  But if all the
   bishops are not of the same mind, but some contend that he should be
   condemned and others the contrary, then other bishops may be called in
   by the metropolitan from the neighbouring provinces, and when their
   votes are added to one or other of the parties among the bishops, then
   controversy should be brought to a close.  This also is the law of the
   Synod of Sardica, canons iii. and v.

   Aristenus.

   Every bishop accused of crimes should be judged by his own synod, but
   if the bishops of the province differ, some saying that he is innocent
   and some that he is guilty, the metropolitan can call other bishops
   from a neighbouring province that they may solve the controversy
   agitated by the bishops.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa vi., Quæst. iv., can. j.  The Roman Correctors note
   that the Latin translation implies that the neighbouring metropolitan
   is to be invited and say, "But, in truth, it hardly seems fitting that
   one metropolitan should come at the call of another, and that there
   should be two metropolitans in one synod."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XV.

   If any bishop, lying under any accusation, shall be judged by all the
   bishops in the province, and all shall unanimously deliver the same
   verdict concerning him, he shall not be again judged by others, but the
   unanimous sentence of the bishops of the province shall stand firm.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   If all the bishops of a province agree with regard to a bishop already
   sentenced, a new trial shall not be granted him.

   Van Espen.

   By the phrase "by others" must be understood bishops called from a
   neighbouring province, of which mention is made in the previous canon,
   where in the case of an agreement among the bishops, the synod did not
   wish to be called in, even if it were demanded by the condemned
   bishop.  This canon, therefore, is a supplement as it were to the
   preceding.  And for this reason in the Breviarium and in Cresconius's
   Collection of Canons they are placed under a common title, cap. 144,
   "Concerning the difference of opinion which happens in the judgment of
   bishops, or when a bishop is cut off by all the bishops of his
   province."

   From these canons it is manifest that at first the causes of bishops
   were agitated and decided in provincial synods, and this discipline
   continued for many centuries, and was little by little departed from in
   the VIII^th and IX^th centuries.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa VI., Quæst. IV., Can. v.  Gratian adds a note which Van
   Espen remarks smacks of his own date rather than of that of the Synod
   of Antioch.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVI.

   If any bishop without a see shall throw himself upon a vacant church
   and seize its throne, without a full synod, he shall be cast out, even
   if all the people over whom he has usurped jurisdiction should choose
   him.  And that shall be [accounted] a full synod, in which the
   metropolitan is present.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.

   Whoever without the full synod and without the Metropolitan Council,
   shall go over to a vacant church, even if he has no position, he shall
   be ejected.

   Beveridge.

   This, together with the following canon, was recited by Bishop Leontius
   in the Council of Chalcedon, from the book of the canons, in which this
   is called the 95th and the following the 96th, according to the order
   observed in that book of the canons.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XCII., Can. viij. in Isidore's version, and the Roman
   Correctors note its departure from the original.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVII.

   If any one having received the ordination of a bishop, and having been
   appointed to preside over a people, shall not accept his ministry, and
   will not be persuaded to proceed to the Church entrusted to him, he
   shall be excommunicated until he, being constrained, accept it, or
   until a full synod of the bishops of the province shall have determined
   concerning him.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.

   Whoso has received orders and abandoned them let him be excommunicated,
   until he shall have repented and been received.

   Zonaras.

   If any one called to the rule of the people refuse to undertake that
   office and ministry, let him be removed from communion, that is
   separated, until he accept the position.  But should he persist in his
   refusal, he can by no means be absolved from his separation, unless
   perchance the full synod shall take some action in his case.  For it is
   possible that he may assign reasonable causes why he should be excused
   from accepting the prelature offered him, reasons which would meet with
   the approbation of the synod.

   Balsamon explains the canon in the same sense and adds that by
   "ordination" here is intended ordination proper, not merely election,
   as some have held.

   Compare with this Apostolic Canon XXXVI.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XCII., C. vij.  The Roman Correctors note that
   Dionysius's version is nearer the Greek.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVIII.

   If any bishop ordained to a parish shall not proceed to the parish to
   which he has been ordained, not through any fault of his own, but
   either because of the rejection of the people, or for any other reason
   not arising from himself, let him enjoy his rank and ministry; only he
   shall not disturb the affairs of the Church which he joins; and he
   shall abide by whatever the full synod of the province shall determine,
   after judging the case.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.

   Let a bishop ordained but not received by his city have his part of the
   honour, and offer the liturgy only, waiting for the synod of the
   province to give judgment.

   Balsamon.

   In canon xvij. the fathers punished him who when ordained could not be
   persuaded to go to the church to which he was assigned.  In the present
   canon they grant pardon to him who is willing to take the charge of the
   diocese, for which he was consecrated, but is prevented from doing so
   by the impudence of the people or else by the incursions of the
   infidel; and therefore they allow him to enjoy, in whatever province he
   may happen to be, the honour due his rank, viz., his throne, his title,
   and the exercise of the episcopal office, with the knowledge and
   consent of the bishop of the diocese.  He must not, however, meddle
   with the affairs of the church of which he is a guest, that is to say
   he must not teach, nor ordain, nor perform any episcopal act without
   the consent of the bishop of the diocese; but he must observe quiet,
   until he learns what he ought to do by the determination of the full
   Synod.

   Aristenus explains that by keeping quiet is intended that he should not
   "use any military help or other power."

   This canon is found twice in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's
   Decretum, Pars I., Dist. xcii., c. iv. and v.; in the versions of
   Martin Bracarensis and of Dionysius.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIX.

   A bishop shall not be ordained without a synod and the presence of the
   metropolitan of the province.  And when he is present, it is by all
   means better that all his brethren in the ministry of the Province
   should assemble together with him; and these the metropolitan ought to
   invite by letter.  And it were better that all should meet; but if this
   be difficult, it is indispensable that a majority should either be
   present or take part by letter in the election, and that thus the
   appointment should be made in the presence, or with the consent, of the
   majority; but if it should be done contrary to these decrees, the
   ordination shall be of no force.  And if the appointment shall be made
   according to the prescribed canon, and any should object through
   natural love of contradiction, the decision of the majority shall
   prevail.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.

   If there be no synod and metropolitan, let there be no bishop.  If on
   account of some difficulty all do not meet together, at least let the
   greater number, or let them give their assent by letter.  But if after
   the affair is all settled a few are contentious, let the vote of the
   majority stand firm.

   Zonaras.

   In the first place it must be noted that by "ordination" in this place
   is meant election, and the laying on of the bishop's hand.

   Balsamon.

   The method of choosing a bishop is laid down in the canons of Nice,
   number iv., but the present canon adds the provision that an election
   which takes place in violation of the provisions of this decree is null
   and invalid:  and that when those who are electing are divided in
   opinion as to whom to choose, the votes of the majority shall prevail.
   But when you hear this canon saying that there should be no election
   without the presence of the Metropolitan, you must not say that he
   ought to be present at an election (for this was prohibited, as is
   found written in other canons) but rather say that his presence here is
   a permission or persuasion, without which no election could take place.

   Compare Apostolic Canon number j.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. LXV., can. iij.  Gratian has chosen Isidore's version,
   and the Roman Correctors point out that Dionysius' is preferable.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XX.

   With a view to the good of the Church and the settlement of disputes,
   it is decreed to be well that synods of the bishops, (of which the
   metropolitan shall give notice to the provincials), should be held in
   every province twice a year, one after the third week of the feast of
   Easter, so that the synod may be ended in the fourth week of the
   Pentecost; and the second on the ides of October which is the tenth [or
   fifteenth] day of the month Hyperberetæus; so that presbyters and
   deacons, and all who think themselves unjustly dealt with, may resort
   to these synods and obtain the judgment of the synod.  But it shall be
   unlawful for any to hold synods by themselves without those who are
   entrusted with the Metropolitan Sees.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.

   On account of ecclesiastical necessities the synod in every province
   shall meet twice a year, in the fourth week of Pentecost and on the
   tenth day of Hyperberetæus.

   Schelestratius (cit. Van Espen).

   The time fixed by the Council of Nice before Lent for the meeting of
   the synod was not received in the East, and the bishops kept on in the
   old custom of celebrating the council in the fourth week after Easter,
   for the time before Lent often presented the greatest difficulties for
   those in the far separated cities to come to the provincial metropolis.

   Van Espen.

   In this canon the decree of Nice in canon v. is renewed, but with this
   difference that the Nicene synod orders one synod to be held before
   Lent, but this synod that it should be held the fourth week after
   Easter.

   It will be remembered that the whole period of the great fifty days
   from Easter to Whitsunday was known as "Pentecost."

   Compare with this Apostolic Canon number XXXVII.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XVIII., c. xv., attributed to a council held by Pope
   Martin.  The Roman Correctors point out that this "Pope Martin" was a
   bishop of Braga (Bracarensis) from whose collection of the decrees of
   the Greek synods Gratian often quotes; the Correctors also note, "For
   bishops in old times were usually called Popes" (Antiquitus enim
   episcopi Papæ dicebantur).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXI.

   A bishop may not be translated from one parish to another, either
   intruding himself of his own suggestion, or under compulsion by the
   people, or by constraint of the bishops; but he shall remain in the
   Church to which he was allotted by God from the beginning, and shall
   not be translated from it, according to the decree formerly passed on
   the subject.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.

   A bishop even if compelled by the people, and compelled by the bishops,
   must not be translated to another diocese.

   See the treatment of the translation of bishops in the Excursus to
   canon xv. of Nice.

   Compare this canon with Apostolical Canon number xiv.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa VII., Quæst. I., can. xxv., from Isidore's version.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXII.

   Let not a bishop go to a strange city, which is not subject to himself,
   nor into a district which does not belong to him, either to ordain any
   one, or to appoint presbyters or deacons to places within the
   jurisdiction of another bishop, unless with the consent of the proper
   bishop of the place.  And if any one shall presume to do any such
   thing, the ordination shall be void, and he himself shall be punished
   by the synod.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.

   A bishop shall not go from city to city ordaining people, except by the
   will of the bishop of the city:  otherwise the ordination shall be
   without force, and he himself exposed to censure.

   If we do not draw a rash conclusion, we should say that the
   interference of bishops in dioceses not their own, must have been very
   frequent in early days.  This one synod enacted two canons (number
   XIII. and this present canon) on the subject.  The same prohibition is
   found in canons XIV. and XXXV. of the Apostolic canons, in canon XV. of
   Nice, canon ij. of I. Constantinople and in many others.  On account of
   the similarity of this canon to canon xiii. some have supposed it to be
   spurious, the enactment of some other synod, and this was the opinion
   of Godefrides Hermantius (Vita S. Athanasii, Lib. IV., cap. xij.) as
   well as of Alexander Natalis (Hist. Soec., IV., Dissert. xxv.).  Van
   Espen, however, is of opinion that the two canons do not cover exactly
   the same ground, for he says Canon XIII. requires letters both from the
   Metropolitan and from the other bishops of the province, while this
   canon XXII. requires only the consent of the diocesan.  He concludes
   that Canon XIII. refers to a diocese sede vacante, when the
   Metropolitan with the other bishops took care of the widowed church,
   but that Canon XXII. refers to a diocese with its own bishop, whose
   will is all that is needed for the performance of episcopal acts by
   another bishop.  And this distinction Schelestratius makes still more
   evident by his discussion of the matter in his scholion on Canon XIII.

   Compare with this canon of the Apostolic Canons number XXXV. also
   number XIV.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa IX., Quæst. II., can. vij., but in a form differing far
   from the Greek original, as the Roman Correctors point out; and even
   Gratian's present text is not as he wrote it, but amended.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXIII.

   It shall not be lawful for a bishop, even at the close of life, to
   appoint another as successor to himself; and if any such thing should
   be done, the appointment shall be void.  But the ecclesiastical law
   must be observed, that a bishop must not be appointed otherwise than by
   a synod and with the judgment of the bishops, who have the authority to
   promote the man who is worthy, after the falling asleep of him who has
   ceased from his labours.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIII.

   A dying bishop shall not appoint another bishop.  But when he is dead a
   worthy successor shall be provided by a synod of those who have this
   power.

   Nothing could be more important than the provision of this canon.  It
   is evidently intended to prevent nepotism in every form, and to leave
   the appointment to the vacant see absolutely to the free choice of the
   Metropolitan and his synod.  The history of the Church, and its present
   practice, is a curious commentary upon the ancient legislation, and the
   appointment of coadjutor bishops cum jure successionis, so common in
   later days, seems to be a somewhat ingenious way of escaping the force
   of the canon.  Van Espen, however, reminds his readers of the most
   interesting case of St. Augustine of Hippo (which he himself narrates
   in his Epistle CCXIII.) of how he was chosen by his predecessor as
   bishop of Hippo, both he and the then bishop being ignorant of the fact
   that it was prohibited by the canons.  And how when in his old age the
   people wished him to have one chosen bishop to help him till his death
   and to succeed him afterwards, he declined saying:  "What was worthy of
   blame in my own case, shall not be a blot likewise upon my son."  He
   did not hesitate to say who he thought most worthy to succeed him, but
   he added, "he shall be a presbyter, as he is, and when God so wills he
   shall be a bishop."  Van Espen adds; "All this should be read carefully
   that thence may be learned how St. Augustine set an example to bishops
   and pastors of taking all the pains possible that after their deaths
   true pastors, and not thieves and wolves, should enter into their
   flocks, who in a short time would destroy all they had accomplished by
   so much labour in so long a time."  (Cf. Eusebius.  H. E., Lib. VI.,
   cap. xj. and cap. xxxij.)

   Compare Apostolic Canon number LXXVI.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa VIII., Quæst. I., can. III., in Dionysius's version,
   and again Canon IV. in that of Martin Bracarensis.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXIV.

   It is right that what belongs to the Church be preserved with all care
   to the Church, with a good conscience and faith in God, the inspector
   and judge of all.  And these things ought to be administered under the
   judgment and authority of the bishop, who is entrusted with the whole
   people and with the souls of the congregation.  But it should be
   manifest what is church property, with the knowledge of the presbyters
   and deacons about him; so that these may know assuredly what things
   belong to the Church, and that nothing be concealed from them, in order
   that, when the bishop may happen to depart this life, the property
   belonging to the Church being well known, may not be embezzled nor
   lost, and in order that the private property of the bishop may not be
   disturbed on a pretence that it is part of the ecclesiastical goods.
   For it is just and well-pleasing to God and man that the private
   property of the bishop be bequeathed to whomsoever he will, but that
   for the Church be kept whatever belongs to the Church; so that neither
   the Church may suffer loss, nor the bishop be injured under pretext of
   the Church's interest, nor those who belong to him fall into lawsuits,
   and himself, after his death, be brought under reproach.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIV.

   All the clergy should be cognizant of ecclesiastical matters; so that
   when the bishop dies the Church may preserve her own goods; but what
   belongs to the bishop shall be disposed of according to his directions.

   Van Espen.

   This canon shews the early discipline according to which the presbyters
   and deacons of the episcopal city, who were said to be "about him" or
   to pertain to his chair, represented the senate of the church, who
   together with the bishop administered the church affairs, and, when the
   see was vacant, had the charge of it.  All this Martin of Braga sets
   forth more clearly in his version, and I have treated of the matter at
   large in my work on Ecclesiastical Law, Pars I., Tit. viii., cap. i.,
   where I have shewn that the Cathedral chapter succeeded to this senate
   of presbyters and deacons.

   Compare with this canon Apostolical Canon XL.

   This canon in a somewhat changed form is found in the Corpus Juris
   Canonici, Gratian's Decretum, Pars II., Causa XII., Quæst. I., can.
   xx., and attributed to "Pope Martin's Council"; also compare with this
   the ensuing canon, number XXI.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXV.

   Let the bishop have power over the funds of the Church, so as to
   dispense them with all piety and in the fear of God to all who need.
   And if there be occasion, let him take what he requires for his own
   necessary uses and those of his brethren sojourning with him, so that
   they may in no way lack, according to the divine Apostle, who says,
   "Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content."  And if he
   shall not be content with these, but shall apply the funds to his own
   private uses, and not manage the revenues of the Church, or the rent of
   the farms, with the consent of the presbyters and deacons, but shall
   give the authority to his own domestics and kinsmen, or brothers, or
   sons, so that the accounts of the Church are secretly injured, he
   himself shall submit to an investigation by the synod of the province.
   But if, on the other hand, the bishop or his presbyters shall be
   defamed as appropriating to themselves what belongs to the Church,
   (whether from lands or any other ecclesiastical resources), so that the
   poor are oppressed, and accusation and infamy are brought upon the
   account and on those who so administer it, let them also be subject to
   correction, the holy synod determining what is right.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXV.

   The bishop shall have power over ecclesiastical goods.  But should he
   not be content with those things which are sufficient for him but shall
   alienate the goods and revenues of the church, without the advice of
   the clergy, penalties shall be exacted from him in the presence of the
   synod.  But if he has converted to his own uses what was given for the
   poor, of this also let him give an explanation to the synod.

   Compare with this canon Apostolic Canon number XLI.

   This Canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa XII., Quæst I., can. XXIII. and with this should be
   compared canon XXII. immediately preceding.

   At the end of this canon in Labbe's version of Dionysius we find these
   words added.  "And thirty bishops signed who were gathered together at
   this Synod."  Isidore Mercator has a still fuller text, viz.:  "I,
   Eusebius, being present subscribe to all things constituted by this
   holy Synod.  Theodore, Nicetas, Macedonius, Anatolius, Tarcodimantus,
   Æthereus, Narcissus, Eustachius, Hesychius, Mauricius, Paulus, and the
   rest, thirty bishops agreed and signed."  Van Espen after noting that
   this addition is not found in the Greek, nor in Martin Bracarensis,
   adds "there is little probability that this clause is of the same
   antiquity as the canons."

   Historical Introduction.

   The Laodicea at which the Synod met is Laodicea in Phrygia Pacatiana,
   also called Laodicea ad Lycum, and to be carefully distinguished from
   the Laodicea in Syria.  This much is certain, but as to the exact date
   of the Synod there is much discussion.  Peter de Marca fixed it at the
   year 365, but Pagi in his Critica on Baronius's Annals [172] seems to
   have overthrown the arguments upon which de Marca rested, and agrees
   with Gothofred in placing it circa 363.  At first sight it would seem
   that the Seventh Canon gave a clue which would settle the date,
   inasmuch as the Photinians are mentioned, and Bishop Photinus began to
   be prominent in the middle of the fourth century and was anathematized
   by the Eusebians in a synod at Antioch in 344, and by the orthodox at
   Milan in 345; and finally, after several other condemnations, he died
   in banishment in 366.  But it is not quite certain whether the word
   "Photinians" is not an interpolation.  Something with regard to the
   date may perhaps be drawn from the word Pakatianes as descriptive of
   Phrygia, for it is probable that this division was not yet made at the
   time of the Sardican Council in 343.  Hefele concludes that "Under such
   circumstances, it is best, with Remi Ceillier, Tillemont, and others,
   to place the meeting of the synod of Laodicea generally somewhere
   between the years 343 and 381, i.e., between the Sardican and the
   Second Ecumenical Council--and to give up the attempt to discover a
   more exact date." [173]

   But since the traditional position of the canons of this Council is
   after those of Antioch and immediately before those of First
   Constantinople, I have followed this order.  Such is their position in
   "very many old collections of the Councils which have had their origin
   since the sixth or even in the fifth century," says Hefele.  It is true
   that Matthew Blastares places these canons after those of Sardica, but
   the Quinisext Synod in its Second Canon and Pope Leo IV., according to
   the Corpus Juris Canonici, [174] give them the position which they hold
   in this volume.

   The Canons of the Synod Held in the City of Laodicea, in Phrygia

   Were Gathered Together. [175]

   The holy synod which assembled at Laodicea in Phrygia Pacatiana, from
   divers regions of Asia; set forth the ecclesiastical definitions which
   are hereunder annexed.

   This brief preface, by some ancient collector, is found in the printed

   of the same word.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon I.

   It is right, according to the ecclesiastical Canon, that the Communion
   should by indulgence be given to those who have freely and lawfully
   joined in second marriages, not having previously made a secret
   marriage; after a short space, which is to be spent by them in prayer
   and fasting.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   A digamist not secretly married, after devoting himself for a short
   time to praying shall be held blameless afterwards.

   Van Espen.

   Many synods imposed a penance upon digamists, although the Church never
   condemned second marriages.

   On this whole subject of second marriages see notes on Canon VIII. of
   Nice, on Canons III. and VII. of Neocæsarea, and on Canon XIX. of
   Ancyra.  In treating of this canon Hefele does little but follow Van
   Espen, who accepts Bishop Beveridge's conclusions in opposition to
   Justellus and refers to him, as follows, "See this observation of
   Justellus' refuted more at length by William Beveridge in his notes on
   this canon," and Bp. Beveridge adopted and defended the exposition of
   the Greek commentators, viz.:  there is some fault and some punishment,
   they are to be held back from communion for "a short space," but after
   that, it is according to the law of the Church that they should be
   admitted to communion.  The phrase "not having previously made a secret
   marriage" means that there must not have been intercourse with the
   woman before the second marriage was "lawfully" contracted, for if so
   the punishment would have been for fornication, and neither light nor
   for "a short space."  The person referred to in the canon is a real
   digamist and not a bigamist, this is proved by the word "lawfully"
   which could not be used of the second marriage of a man who already had
   a living wife.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon II.

   They who have sinned in divers particulars, if they have persevered in
   the prayer of confession and penance, and are wholly converted from
   their faults, shall be received again to communion, through the mercy
   and goodness of God, after a time of penance appointed to them, in
   proportion to the nature of their offence.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   Those who have fallen unto various faults and have confessed them with
   compunction, and done the penance suitable to them, shall be favourably
   received.

   Hefele.

   Van Espen and others were of opinion that this canon treated only of
   those who had themselves been guilty of various criminal acts, and it
   has been asked whether any one guilty not only of one gross sin, but of
   several of various kinds, might also be again received into communion.
   It seems to me, however, that this canon with the words, "those who
   have sinned in divers particulars," simply means that "sinners of
   various kinds shall be treated exactly in proportion to the extent of
   their fall."  That the question is not necessarily of different sins
   committed by the same person appears from the words, "in proportion to
   the nature of their offence," as the singular, not the plural, is here
   used.

   But Van Espen, with Aubespine, is clearly right in not referring the
   words, "if they persevere in confession and repentance," to sacramental
   confession, to which the expression "persevere" would not be well
   suited.  Here is evidently meant the oft-repeated contrite confession
   before God and the congregation in prayer of sins committed, which
   preceded sacramental confession and absolution.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa XXVI., Quæst. vii., can. iv.

   A neophite is not ordainable.

   This rule is laid down in the Second Nicene canon.  Balsamon also

   Balsamon.

   Notwithstanding this provision, that great light, Nectarius, just
   separated from the flock of the catechumens, when he had washed away
   the sins of his life in the divine font, now pure himself, he put on
   the most pure dignity of the episcopate, and at the same time became
   bishop of the Imperial City, and president of the Second Holy
   Ecumenical Synod.

   Canon IV.

   They who are of the sacerdotal order ought not to lend and receive

   A priest is not to receive usury nor hemioliæ.

   The same rule is laid down in the seventeenth Canon of Nice.  For a
   treatment of the whole subject of usury see excursus to that canon.

   Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore have numbered this canon v., and our
   fifth they have as iv.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,

     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   Ordinations are not to be held in the presence of hearers.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   Ordinations are not to be performed in the presence of hearers.

   Balsamon.

   This canon calls elections "laying on of hands," and says that since in
   elections unworthy things are often said with regard to those who are
   elected, therefore they should not take place in the presence of any
   that might happen to come to hear.

   Zonaras also agrees that election is here intended, but Aristenus
   dissents and makes the reference to ordinations properly so-called, as
   follows:

   Aristenus.

   The prayers of ordination are not to be said out loud so that they may
   be heard by the people.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   It is not permitted to heretics to enter the house of God while they
   continue in heresy.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   The holy place is forbidden to heretics.

   Aristenus.

   Heretics are not to be permitted to enter the house of God, and yet
   Basil the Great, before this canon was set forth, admitted Valens to
   the perfecting of the faithful [i.e., to the witnessing the celebration
   of the Divine Mysteries].

   Van Espen.

   A heretic who pertinaciously rejects the doctrine of the Church is
   rightly not allowed to enter the house of God, in which his doctrine is
   set forth, so long as he continues in his heresy.  For this reason when
   Timothy, Archbishop of Alexandria, was consulted concerning the
   admission of heretics to church, answered in the IX^th Canon of his
   Canonical Epistle, that unless they were ready to promise to do penance
   and to abandon their heresy, they could in no way be admitted to the
   prayers of the faithful.

   Contrast with this Canon lxxxiv., of the so-called IV^th Council of
   Carthage, a.d. 398.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VII.

   Persons converted from heresies, that is, of the Novatians, Photinians,
   and Quartodecimans, whether they were catechumens or communicants among
   them, shall not be received until they shall have anathematized every
   heresy, and particularly that in which they were held; and afterwards
   those who among them were called communicants, having thoroughly
   learned the symbols of the faith, and having been anointed with the
   holy chrism, shall so communicate in the holy Mysteries.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   Novatians and Photinians, and Quartodecimans, unless they anathemathize
   their own and other heresies, are not to be received.  When they have
   been anointed, after their abjuration, let them communicate.

   I have allowed the word "Photinians" to stand in the text although
   whether it is not an interpolation is by no means certain.  They
   certainly were heretical on the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and
   therefore differed from the other dissidents mentioned in the canon,
   all of whom were orthodox on this matter.  It is also worthy of note
   that the word is not found in Ferrandus's Condensation (Breviatio
   Canonum, n. 177) nor in Isidore's version.  Moreover there is a Latin
   codex in Lucca, and also one in Paris (as is noted by Mansi, v. 585;
   ij. 591) in which it is lacking.  It was rejected by Baronius, Binius,
   and Remi Ceillier.

   The word "Catechumens" is wanting in many Greek mss. but found in
   Balsamon, moreover, Dionysius and Isidore had it in their texts.

   This canon possesses a great interest and value to the student from a
   different point of view.  Its provisions, both doctrinal and
   disciplinary, are in contrariety with the provisions of the council
   held at Carthage in the time of St. Cyprian, and yet both these canons,
   contradictory as they are, are accepted by the Council in Trullo and
   are given such ecumenical authority as canons on discipline ever can
   possess, by the Seventh Ecumenical.  This is not the only matter in
   which the various conciliar actions adopted and ratified do not agree
   inter se, and from this consideration it would seem evident that it was
   not intended that to each particular of each canon of each local synod
   adopted, the express sanction of the Universal Church was given, but
   that they were received in block as legislation well calculated for the
   good of the Church.  And that this must have been the understanding at
   the time is evinced by the fact that while the Trullan canons condemned
   a number of Western customs and usages, as I shall have occasion to
   point out in its proper place, no objection was made by the Roman
   legates to the canon of the Seventh Ecumenical which received them as
   authoritative.

   Canon VIII.

   Persons converted from the heresy of those who are called Phrygians,
   even should they be among those reputed by them as clergymen, and even
   should they be called the very chiefest, are with all care to be both
   instructed and baptized by the bishops and presbyters of the Church.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   When Phrygians return they are to be baptized anew, even if among them
   they were reckoned clergymen.

   Hefele.

   This synod here declares the baptism of the Montanists invalid, while
   in the preceding canon it recognised as valid the baptism of the
   Novatians and Quartodecimans.  From this, it would appear that the
   Montanists were suspected of heresy with regard to the doctrine of the
   Trinity.  Some other authorities of the ancient Church, however, judged
   differently, and for a long time it was a question in the Church
   whether to consider the baptism of the Montanists valid or not.
   Dionysius the Great of Alexandria was in favour of its validity:  but
   this Synod and the Second General Council rejected it as invalid, not
   to mention the Synod of Iconium (235), which declared all heretical
   baptism invalid.  This uncertainty of the ancient Church is accounted
   for thus:  (a) On one side the Montanists, and especially Tertullian,
   asserted that they held the same faith and sacraments, especially the
   same baptism (eadem lavacri sacramenta) as the Catholics.  St.
   Epiphanius concurred in this, and testified that the Montanists taught
   the same regarding the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, as did the
   Catholic Church.  (b) Other Fathers, however, thought less favourably
   of them, and for this reason, that the Montanists often expressed
   themselves so ambiguously, that they might, nay, must be said
   completely to identify the Holy Ghost with Montanus.  Thus Tertullian
   in quoting expressions of Montanus, actually says:  "the Paraclete
   speaks"; and therefore Firmilian, Cyril of Jerusalem, Basil the Great,
   and other Fathers, did in fact, reproach the Montanists with this
   identification, and consequently held their baptism to be invalid.  (c)
   Basil the Great goes to the greatest length in this direction in
   maintaining that the Montanists had baptized in the name of the Father,
   of the Son, and of Montanus and Priscilla.  But it is very probable, as
   Tillemont conjectured, that Basil only founded these strange stories of
   their manner of baptizing upon his assumption that they identified
   Montanus with the Holy Ghost; and, as Baronius maintains, it is equally
   "probable that the Montanists did not alter the form of baptism.  But,
   even admitting all this, their ambiguous expressions concerning
   Montanus and the Holy Ghost would alone have rendered it advisable to
   declare their baptism invalid."  (d) Besides this, a considerable
   number of Montanists, namely, the school of Æschines, fell into
   Sabellianism, and thus their baptism was decidedly invalid.  (Vide
   Article in Wetzer and Welte Kirchenlexicon s.v. Montanus; by myself
   [i.e. Hefele]).

   In conclusion, it must be observed that Balsamon and Zonaras rightly
   understood the words in our text, "even though they be called the very
   chiefest," "though they be held in the highest esteem," to refer to the
   most distinguished clergy and teachers of the Montanists.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IX.

   The members of the Church are not allowed to meet in the cemeteries,
   nor attend the so-called martyries of any of the heretics, for prayer
   or service; but such as so do, if they be communicants, shall be
   excommunicated for a time; but if they repent and confess that they
   have sinned they shall be received.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   Whoso prayeth in the cemeteries and martyries of heretics is to be
   excommunicated.

   Zonaras.

   By the word "service" (therapeias) in this canon is to be understood
   the healing of sickness.  The canon wishes that the faithful should
   under no pretence betake themselves to the prayers of heretical
   pseudo-martyrs nor pay them honour in the hope of obtaining the healing
   of sickness or the cure of their various temptations.  And if any do
   so, they are to be cut off, that is for a time forbidden communion (and
   this refers to the faithful who are only laymen), but when they have
   done penance and made confession of their fault, the canon orders that
   they are to be received back again.

   Balsamon.

   As canon vi. forbids heretics to enter the house of God, so this canon
   forbids the faithful to go to the cemeteries of heretics, which are
   called by them "Martyries."...For in the days of the persecution,
   certain of the heretics, calling themselves Christians, suffered even
   to death, and hence those who shared their opinions called them
   "martyrs."

   Van Espen.

   As Catholics had their martyrs, so too had the heretics, and especially
   the Montanists or Phrygians, who greatly boasted of them.  Apollinaris
   writes of these as may be seen in Eusebius (H. E., Lib. v., cap. xvj.)

   The places or cemeteries in which rested the bodies of those they
   boasted of as martyrs, they styled "Martyries" (martyria) as similar
   places among Catholics were wont to be called by the same name, from
   the bones of the martyrs that rested there.

   From the Greek text, as also from Isidore's version it is clear that
   this canon refers to all the faithful generally, and that "the members
   of the Church" (Lat. Ecclesiastici, the word Dionysius uses) must be
   taken in this wide signification.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon X.

   The members of the Church shall not indiscriminately marry their
   children to heretics.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   Thou shalt not marry a heretic.

   Fuchs.

   (Bib. der Kirchenvers., pt. ii., p. 324.)

   "Indiscriminately" means not that they might be given in marriage to
   some heretics and not to others; but that it should not be considered a
   matter of indifference whether they were married to heretics or
   orthodox.

   Zonaras and Balsamon, led astray by the similar canon enacted at
   Chalcedon (number xiv.), suppose this restriction only to apply to the
   children of the clergy, but Van Espen has shewn that the rule is of
   general application.  He adds, however, the following:

   Van Espen.

   Since by the custom of the Greeks, ecclesiastics are allowed to have
   wives, there is no doubt that the marriage of their children with
   heretics would be indecent in a very special degree, although there are
   many things which go to shew that marriage with heretics was
   universally deemed a thing to be avoided by Catholics, and was rightly
   forbidden.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XI.

   Presbytides, as they are called, or female presidents, are not to be
   appointed in the Church.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   Widows called presidents shall not be appointed in churches.

   Balsamon.

   In old days certain venerable women (presbutides) sat in Catholic
   churches, and took care that the other women kept good and modest
   order.  But from their habit of using improperly that which was proper,
   either through their arrogancy or through their base self-seeking,
   scandal arose.  Therefore the Fathers prohibited the existence in the
   Church thereafter of any more such women as are called presbytides or
   presidents.  And that no one may object that in the monasteries of
   women one woman must preside over the rest, it should be remembered
   that the renunciation which they make of themselves to God and the
   tonsure brings it to pass that they are thought of as one body though
   many; and all things which are theirs, relate only to the salvation of
   the soul.  But for woman to teach in a Catholic Church, where a
   multitude of men is gathered together, and women of different opinions,
   is, in the highest degree, indecorous and pernicious.

   Hefele.

   It is doubtful what was here intended, and this canon has received very
   different interpretations.  In the first place, what is the meaning of
   the words presbutides and prokathemenai ("presbytides" and female
   presidents)?  I think the first light is thrown on the subject by
   Epiphanius, who in his treatise against the Collyridians (Hær., lxxix.
   4) says that "women had never been allowed to offer sacrifice, as the
   Collyridians presumed to do, but were only allowed to minister.
   Therefore there were only deaconesses in the Church, and even if the
   oldest among them were called presbytides,' this term must be clearly
   distinguished from presbyteresses.  The latter would mean priestesses
   (hierissas), but presbytides' only designated their age, as seniors."
   According to this, the canon appears to treat of the superior
   deaconesses who were the overseers (prokathemenai) of the other
   deaconesses; and the further words of the text may then probably mean
   that in future no more such superior deaconesses or eldresses were to
   be appointed, probably because they had often outstepped their
   authority.

   Neander, Fuchs, and others, however, think it more probable that the
   terms in question are in this canon to be taken as simply meaning
   deaconesses, for even in the church they had been wont to preside over
   the female portion of the congregation (whence their name of
   "presidents"); and, according to St. Paul's rule, only widows over
   sixty years of age were to be chosen for this office (hence called
   "presbytides").  We may add, that this direction of the apostle was not
   very strictly adhered to subsequently, but still it was repeatedly
   enjoined that only elder persons should be chosen as deaconesses.
   Thus, for instance, the Council of Chalcedon, in its fifteenth canon,
   required that deaconesses should be at least forty years of age, while
   the Emperor Theodosius even prescribed the age of sixty.

   Supposing now that this canon simply treats of deaconesses, a fresh
   doubt arises as to how the last words--"they are not to be appointed in
   the Church" are to be understood.  For it may mean that "from
   henceforth no more deaconesses shall be appointed;" or, that "in future
   they shall no more be solemnly ordained in the church."  The first
   interpretation would, however, contradict the fact that the Greek
   Church had deaconesses long after the Synod of Laodicea.  For instance,
   in 692 the Synod in Trullo (Can. xiv.) ordered that "no one under forty
   years of age should be ordained deaconess."  Consequently the second
   interpretation, "they shall not be solemnly ordained in the church,"
   seems a better one, and Neander decidedly prefers it.  It is certainly
   true that several later synods distinctly forbade the old practice of
   conferring a sort of ordination upon deaconesses, as, for instance, the
   first Synod of Orange (Arausicanum I. of 441, Can. xxvj.) in the
   words--diaconæ omnimodis non ordinandæ; also the Synod at Epaon in 517
   (Can. xxj.), and the second Synod at Orleans in 533 (Can. xviij.); but
   in the Greek Church at least, an ordination, a cheirotoneisthai , took
   place as late as the Council in Trullo (Can. xiv.).  But this Canon of
   Laodicea does not speak of solemn dedication, and certainly not of
   ordination, but only of kathistasthai.  These reasons induce us to
   return to the first interpretation of this canon, and to understand it
   as forbidding from that time forward the appointment of any more chief
   deaconesses or "presbytides."

   Zonaras and Balsamon give yet another explanation.  In their opinion,
   these "presbytides" were not chief deaconesses, but aged women in
   general (ex populo), to whom was given the supervision of the females,
   in church.  The Synod of Laodicea, however, did away with this
   arrangement, probably because they had misused their office for
   purposes of pride, or money-making, bribery, etc.

   Compare with the foregoing the Excursus on Deaconesses, appended to
   Canon XIX. of Nice.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XXXII., c. xix., in Isidore's version; but Van Espen
   remarks that the Roman Correctors have pointed out that it departs
   widely from the Greek original.  The Roman Correctors further say "The
   note of Balsamon on this point should be seen;" and with this
   interpretation Morinus also agrees in his work on Holy Orders (De
   Ordinationibus, Pars III., Exercit. x., cap. iij., n. 3).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XII.

   Bishops are to be appointed to the ecclesiastical government by the
   judgment of the metropolitans and neighbouring bishops, after having
   been long proved both in the foundation of their faith and in the
   conversation of an honest life.

   Note.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   Whoever is most approved in faith and life and most learned, he is fit
   to be chosen bishop.

   The first part of this canon is in conformity with the provision in the
   IV. canon of Nice.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIII.

   The election of those who are to be appointed to the priesthood is not
   to be committed to the multitude.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   Whoso is chosen by seculars is ineligible.

   Balsamon.

   From this canon it is evident that in ancient times not only bishops
   but also priests were voted for by the multitude of the people.  This
   is here forbidden.

   Aristenus.

   Bishops are elected by metropolitans and other bishops.  If anyone in
   this manner shall not have been promoted to the Episcopate, but shall
   have been chosen by the multitude, he is not to be admitted nor
   elected.

   [It is clear from this that by "the Priesthood" Aristenus understands
   the episcopate, and I think rightly.]

   Van Espen.

   The word in the Greek to which "multitude" corresponds (ochlos)
   properly signifies a tumult. [176]

   What the fathers intend to forbid are tumultuous elections, that is,
   that no attention is to be paid to riotous demonstrations on the part
   of the people, when with acclamations they are demanding the ordination
   of anyone, with an appearance of sedition.  Such a state of affairs St.
   Augustine admirably describes in his Epistola ad Albinam (Epist.
   cxxvi., Tom. II, col. 548, Ed. Gaume).

   And it is manifest that by this canon the people were not excluded from
   all share in the election of bishops and priests from what St. Gregory
   Nazianzen says, in Epistola ad Cæsarienses, with regard to the election
   of St. Basil.  From this what could be more evident than that after
   this canon was put out the people in the East still had their part in
   the election of a bishop?  This also is clear from Justinian's "Novels"
   (Novellæ, cxxiij., c.j., and cxxxvij., c. ij.)

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. lxiii., can. vj,, but in proof of the proposition that
   laymen were hereby forbidden to have any share in elections.  Van Espen
   notes that Isidore's version favours Gratian's misunderstanding, and
   says that "no doubt that this version did much to exclude the people
   from the election of bishops."

   Canon XIV.

   The holy things are not to be sent into other dioceses at the feast of
   Easter by way of eulogiæ.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   It is not right to send the holy gifts to another parish.

   Hefele.

   It was a custom in the ancient Church, not indeed to consecrate, but to
   bless such of the several breads of the same form laid on the altar as
   were not needed for the communion, and to employ them, partly for the
   maintenance of the clergy, and partly for distributing to those of the
   faithful who did not communicate at the Mass.  The breads thus blessed
   were called eulogiæ.  Another very ancient custom was, that bishops as
   a sign of Church fellowship, should send the consecrated bread to one
   another.  That the Roman Popes of the first and second centuries did
   so, Irenæus testifies in his letter to Pope Victor in Eusebius.  In
   course of time, however, instead of the consecrated bread, only bread
   which had been blessed, or eulogiæ, were sent abroad.  For instance,
   Paulinus and Augustine sent one another these eulogiæ.  But at Easter
   the older custom still prevailed; and to invest the matter with more
   solemnity, instead of the eulogiæ, the consecrated bread, i.e., the
   Eucharist, was sent out.  The Synod of Laodicea forbids this, probably
   out of reverence to the holy Sacrament.

   Binterim (Denkwürdegkeiten, vol. IV., P. iij., p. 535.) gives another
   explanation.  He starts from the fact that, with the Greeks as well as
   the Latins, the wafer intended for communion is generally called sancta
   or hagia even before the consecration.  This is not only perfectly
   true, but a well-known fact; only it must not be forgotten that these
   wafers or oblations were only called sancta by anticipation, and
   because of the sanctificatio to which they were destined.  Binterim
   then states that by hagiain the canon is to be understood not the
   breads already consecrated, but those still unconsecrated.  He further
   conjectures that these unconsecrated breads were often sent about
   instead of the eulogiæ, and that the Synod of Laodicea had forbidden
   this, not during the whole year, but only at Easter.  He cannot,
   however, give any reason, and his statement is the more doubtful, as he
   cannot prove that these unconsecrated communion breads really used
   before to be sent about as eulogiæ.

   In connection with this, however, he adds another hypothesis.  It is
   known that the Greeks only consecrate a square piece of the little loaf
   intended for communion, which is first cut out with the so-called holy
   spear.  The remainder of the small loaf is divided into little pieces,
   which remain on or near the altar during Mass, after which they are
   distributed to the non-communicants.  These remains of the small loaf
   intended for consecration are called antidora and Binterim's second
   conjecture is, that these antidora might perhaps have been sent as
   eulogiæ and may be the hagia of this canon.  But he is unable to prove
   that these antidora were sent about, and is, moreover, obliged to
   confess that they are nowhere called eulogiæ, while this canon
   certainly speaks of eulogiæ.  To this must be added that, as with
   regard to the unconsecrated wafer, so we see no sufficient cause why
   the Synod should have forbidden these antidora being sent.

   Canon XV.

   No others shall sing in the Church, save only the canonical singers,
   who go up into the ambo and sing from a book.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   No one should ascend the ambon unless he is tonsured.

   Hefele.

   The only question [presented by this canon] is whether this synod
   forbade the laity to take any part in the Church music, as Binius and
   others have understood the words of the text, or whether it only
   intended to forbid those who were not cantors taking the lead.  Van
   Espen and Neander in particular were in favour of the latter meaning,
   pointing to the fact that certainly in the Greek Church after the Synod
   of Laodicea the people were accustomed to join in the singing, as
   Chrysostom and Basil the Great sufficiently testify.  Bingham
   propounded a peculiar opinion, namely, that this Synod did indeed
   forbid the laity to sing in the church, or even to join in the singing,
   but this only temporarily, for certain reasons.  I have no doubt,
   however, that Van Espen and Neander take the truer view.

   Canon XVI.

   The Gospels are to be read on the Sabbath [i.e. Saturday], with the
   other Scriptures.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.

   The Gospel, the Epistle [apostolos ] and the other Scriptures are to be
   read on the Sabbath.

   Balsamon.

   Before the arrangement of the Ecclesiastical Psalmody was settled,
   neither the Gospel nor the other Scriptures were accustomed to be read
   on the Sabbath.  But out of regard to the canons which forbade fasting
   or kneeling on the Sabbath, there were no services, so that there might
   be as much feasting as possible.  This the fathers prohibit, and decree
   that on the Sabbath the whole ecclesiastical office shall be said.

   Neander (Kirchengesch., 2d ed., vol. iij., p. 565 et seq.) suggests in
   addition to the interpretation just given another, viz.:  that it was
   the custom in many parts of the ancient Church to keep every Saturday
   as a feast in commemoration of the Creation.  Neander also suggests
   that possibly some Judaizers read on the Sabbath only the Old
   Testament; he, however, himself remarks that in this case euangelia and
   heteron graphon would require the article.

   Van Espen.

   Among the Greeks the Sabbath was kept exactly as the Lord's day except
   so far as the cessation of work was concerned, wherefore the Council
   wishes that, as on Sundays, after the other lessons there should follow
   the Gospel.

   For it is evident that by the intention of the Church the whole Divine
   Office was designed for the edification and instruction of the people,
   and especially was this the case on feast days, when the people were
   apt to be present in large numbers.

   Here we may note the origin of our present [Western] discipline, by
   which on Sundays and feast days the Gospel is wont to be read with the
   other Scriptures in the canonical hours, while such is not the case on
   ferial days, or in the order for ferias and "simples." [177]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [177] "Simples" (simplici) are distinguished from "doubles" (duplici)
   in not having their antiphons said double but only once.

   The Psalms are not to be joined together in the congregations, but a

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.

   In time of service lessons shall be interspersed with the Psalms.

   Aristenus.

   It was well to separate the Psalms by lessons when the congregation was
   gathered in church, and not to keep them continuously singing unbroken
   psalmody, lest those who had assembled might become careless through
   weariness.

   Zonaras.

   This was an ancient custom which has been laid aside since the new
   order of ecclesiastical matters has been instituted. [178]

   Van Espen.

   Here it may be remarked we find the real reason why in our present
   rite, the lections, verses, etc., of the nocturns are placed between
   the Psalms, so as to repel weariness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] I do not understand this note, as to-day in the Divine Office of
   the Greek Church the Psalms are still divided by Lessons.  Vide The

   Canon XVIII.

   The same service of prayers is to be said always both at nones and at
   vespers.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.

   The same prayers shall be said at nones and vespers.

   Hefele.

   Some feasts ended at the ninth hour, others only in the evening, and
   both alike with prayer.  The Synod here wills that in both cases the
   same prayers should be used.  Thus does Van Espen explain the words of
   the text, and I think rightly.  But the Greek commentator understands
   the Synod to order that the same prayers should be used in all places,
   thus excluding all individual caprice.  According to this, the rule of
   conformity would refer to places; while, according to Van Espen, the
   nones and vespers were to be the same.  If, however, this
   interpretation were correct, the Synod would not have only spoken of
   the prayers at nones and vespers, but would have said in general, "all
   dioceses shall use the same form of prayer."

   Excursus on the Choir Offices of the Early Church.

   Nothing is more marked in the lives of the early followers of Christ
   than the abiding sense which they had of the Divine Presence.  Prayer
   was not to them an occasional exercise but an unceasing practice.  If
   then the Psalmist sang in the old dispensation "Seven times a day do I
   praise thee" (Ps. cxix. 164), we may be quite certain that the
   Christians would never fall behind the Jewish example.  We know that
   among the Jews there were the "Hours of Prayer," and nothing would be,
   à priori, more likely than that with new and deeper significance these
   should pass over into the Christian Church.  I need not pause here to
   remind the reader of the observance of "the hour of prayer" which is
   mentioned in the New Testament, and shall pass on to my more immediate
   subject.

   Most liturgiologists have been agreed that the "Choir Offices" of the
   Christian Church, that is to say the recitation of the Psalms of David,
   with lessons from other parts of Holy Scripture and collects, [179] was
   an actual continuation of the Jewish worship, the melodies even of the
   Psalms being carried over and modified through the ages into the plain
   song of today.  For this view of the Jewish origin of the Canonical
   Hours there is so much to be said that one hesitates to accept a rival
   theory, recently set forth with much skill and learning, by a French
   priest, who had the inestimable happiness of sitting at the feet of De
   Rossi.  M. Pierre Battifol [180] is of opinion that the Canonical Hours
   in no way come from the Jewish Hours of Prayer but are the outgrowth of
   the Saturday Vigil service, which was wholly of Christian origin, and
   which he tells us was divided into three parts, j., the evening
   service, or lucernarium, which was the service of Vespers; ij., the
   midnight service, the origin of the Nocturns or Mattins; iij., the
   service at daybreak, the origin of Lauds.  Soon vigils were kept for
   all the martyr commemorations; and by the time of Tertullian, if not
   before, Wednesdays and Fridays had their vigils.  With the growth of
   monasticism they became daily.  This Mr. Battifol thinks was introduced
   into Antioch about a.d. 350, and soon spread all over the East.  The
   "little hours," that is Terce, Sext, and None, he thinks were monastic
   in origin and that Prime and Compline were transferred from the
   dormitory to the church, just as the martyrology was transferred from
   the refectory.

   Such is the new theory, which, even if rejected, at least is valuable
   in drawing attention to the great importance of the vigil-service in
   the Early Church, an importance still attaching to it in Russia on the
   night of Easter Even.

   Of the twilight service we have a most exquisite remains in the hymn to
   be sung at the lighting of the lamps.  This is one of the few Psalmi
   idiotici which has survived the condemnation of such compositions by
   the early councils, in fact the only two others are the Gloria in
   Excelsis and the Te Deum.  The hymn at the lighting of the lamps is as
   follows:

   "O gladsome light

   Of the Father Immortal,

   And of the celestial

   Sacred and blessed

   Jesus, our Saviour!"

   "Now to the sunset

   Again hast thou brought us;

   And seeing the evening

   Twilight, we bless thee,

   Praise thee, adore thee!"

   "Father omnipotent!

   Son, the Life-giver!

   Spirit, the Comforter!

   Worthy at all times

   Of worship and wonder! [181] "

   Dr. Battifol's new theory was promptly attacked by P. Suibbert Bäumer,
   a learned German Benedictine who had already written several magazine
   articles on the subject before Battifol's book had appeared.

   The title of Bäumer's book is Geschichte des Breviers, Versuch einer
   quellenmässigen Darstellung der Entwicklung des altkirchen und des
   römeschen Officiums bis auf unsere Tage. (Freiburg in Briesgau, 1895.)
   The following [182] may be taken as a fair resumé of the position taken
   in this work and most ably defended, a position which (if I may be
   allowed to express an opinion) is more likely to prevail as being most
   in accordance with the previous researches of the learned.

   "The early Christians separated from the Synagogues about a.d. 65; that
   is, about the same time as the first Epistle to Timothy was written,
   and at this moment of separation from the Synagogue the Apostles had
   already established, besides the liturgy, at least one, probably two,
   canonical hours of prayer, Mattins and Evensong.  Besides what we
   should call sermons, the service of these hours was made up of psalms,
   readings from Holy Scripture, and extempore prayers.  A few pages on
   (p. 42) Bäumer allows that even if this service had been daily in
   Jerusalem the Apostles' times, yet it had become limited to Sundays in
   the sub-Apostolic times, when persecution would not allow the Apostolic
   custom of daily morning and evening public prayer.  Yet the practice of
   private prayer at the third, sixth, and ninth hours continued, based
   upon an Apostolic tradition; and thus, when the tyranny of persecution
   was overpast, the idea of public prayer at these hours was saved and
   the practice carried on."

   The student should by no means omit to read Dom Prosper Guéranger's
   Institutions Liturgiques, which while written in a bitter and most
   partisan spirit, is yet a work of the most profound learning.  Above
   all anyone professing any familiarity with the literature on the
   subject must have mastered Cardinal Bona's invaluable De Divina
   Psalmodia, a mine of wisdom and a wonder of research.

   Canon XIX.

   After the sermons of the Bishops, the prayer for the catechumens is to
   be made first by itself; and after the catechumens have gone out, the
   prayer for those who are under penance; and, after these have passed
   under the hand [of the Bishop] and departed, there should then be
   offered the three prayers of the faithful, the first to be said
   entirely in silence, the second and third aloud, and then the [kiss of]
   peace is to be given.  And, after the presbyters have given the [kiss
   of] peace to the Bishop, then the laity are to give it [to one
   another], and so the Holy Oblation is to be completed.  And it is
   lawful to the priesthood alone to go to the Altar and [there]
   communicate.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.

   After the prayers of the catechumens shall be said those of the
   Penitents, and afterwards those of the faithful.  And after the peace,
   or embrace, has been given, the offering shall be made.  Only priests
   shall enter the sanctuary and make there their communion.

   The Greek commentators throw but little if any light upon this canon.
   A question has been raised as to who said the prayers mentioned.  Van
   Espen, following Isidore's translation "they also pray who are doing
   penance," thinks the prayer of the penitents, said by themselves, is
   intended, and not the prayer said by the Bishop.  But Hefele, following
   Dionysius's version--"the prayers over the catechumens," "over those
   who are doing penance"--thinks that the liturgical prayers are
   intended, which after the sermon were wont to be said "over" the
   different classes.  Dionysius does not say "over" the faithful, but
   describes them as "the prayers of the faithful," which Hefele thinks
   means that the faithful joined in reciting them.

   Excursus on the Worship of the Early Church.

   (Percival, H. R.:  Johnson's Universal Cyclopædia, Vol. V., s.v.
   Liturgics.)

   St. Paul is by some learned writers supposed to have quoted in several
   places the already existing liturgy, especially in I. Cor. ij. 9.,
   [183] and there can be no doubt that the Lord's prayer was used and
   certain other formulas which are referred to by St. Luke in the Acts of
   the Apostles [184] as "the Apostles' prayers."  How early these forms
   were committed to writing has been much disputed among the learned, and
   it would be rash to attempt to rule this question.  Pierre Le Brun
   [185] presents most strongly the denial of their having been written
   during the first three centuries, and Probst [186] argues against this
   opinion.  While it does not seem possible to prove that before the
   fourth century the liturgical books were written out in full, owing no
   doubt to the influence of the disciplina arcani, it seems to be true
   that much earlier than this there was a definite and fixed order in the
   celebration of divine worship and in the administration of the
   sacraments.  The famous passage in St. Justin Martyr [187] seems to
   point to the existence of such a form in his day, shewing how even then
   the service for the Holy Eucharist began with the Epistle and Gospel.
   St. Augustine and St. Chrysostom bear witness to the same thing. [188]

   Within, comparatively speaking, a few years, a good deal of information
   with regard to the worship of the early Church has been given us by the
   discovery of the Didache, and of the fragments the Germans describe as
   the K. O., and by the publication of M. Gamurrini's transcript of the
   Peregrinatio Silviæ. [189]

   From all these it is thought that liturgical information of the
   greatest value can be obtained.  Moreover the first two are thought to
   throw much light upon the age and construction of the Apostolical
   Constitutions.  Without in any way committing myself to the views I now
   proceed to quote, I lay them before the reader as the results of the
   most advanced criticism in the matter.

   (Duchesne.  Origines du Culte Chrétien, p. 54 et seq.)

   All known liturgies may be reduced to four principal types--the Syrian,
   the Alexandrian, the Roman, and the Gallican.  In the fourth century
   there certainly existed these four types at the least, for the Syrian
   had already given rise to several sub-types which were clearly marked.

   The most ancient documents of the Syrian Liturgy are:

   1.  The Catechetical Lectures of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, delivered
   about the year 347.

   2.  The Apostolic Constitutions (Bk. II., 57, and Bk. VIII., 5-15).

   3.  The homilies of St. John Chrysostom.

   St. John Chrysostom often quotes lines of thought and even prayers
   taken from the liturgy.  Bingham [190] was the first to have the idea
   of gathering together and putting in order these scattered references.
   This work has been recently taken in hand afresh by Mr. Hammond. [191]
     From this one can find much interesting corroborative evidence, but
   the orator does not give anywhere a systematic description of the
   liturgy, in the order of its rites and prayers.

   The Catechetical Lectures of St. Cyril are really a commentary upon the
   ceremonies of the mass, made to the neophytes after their initiation.
   The preacher does not treat of the missa catechumenorum because his
   hearers had so long been familiar with it; he presupposes the bread and
   wine to have been brought to and placed upon the altar, and begins at
   the moment when the bishop prepares himself to celebrate the Holy
   Mysteries by washing his hands.

   In the Apostolic Constitutions a distinction must be drawn between Book
   II. and Book VIII.  The first is very sketchy; it only contains a
   description of the rites without the words used, the other gives at
   length all the formulas of the prayers, but only from the end of the
   Gospel.

   We know now that the Apostolical Constitutions in the present state of
   the Greek text represent a melting down and fusing together of two
   analogous books--the Didaskale of the Apostles, of which only a Syriac
   version is extant; and the Didake of the Apostles, recently discovered
   by the metropolitan, Philotheus Bryennius.  The first of these two
   books has served as a basis for the first six books of the Apostolical
   Constitutions.  The second, much spread out, has become the seventh
   book of the same collection.  The eighth book is more homogeneous.  It
   must have been added to the seven others by the author of the recension
   of the Didaskale and of the Didake.  This author is the same as he who
   made the interpolations in the seven authentic letters of St. Ignatius,
   and added to them six others of his own manufacture.  He lived at
   Antioch in Syria, or else in the ecclesiastical region of which that
   city was the centre.  He wrote about the middle of the fourth century,
   at the very high tide of the Subordination theology, which finds
   expression more than once in his different compositions.  He is the
   author of the description of the liturgy, which is found in Book II.;
   in fact, that whole passage is lacking in the Syriac Didaskale.  Was it
   also he who composed the liturgy of the VIII^th book?  This is open to
   doubt, for there are certain differences between this liturgy and that
   of the II^d book. [192]

   I shall now describe the religious service such as these documents
   suppose, noting, where necessary, their divergences.

   The congregation is gathered together, the men on one side the women on
   the other, the clergy in the apsidal chancel.  The readings immediately
   begin; they are interrupted by chants.  A reader ascends the ambo,
   which stood in the middle of the church, between the clergy and the
   people, and read two lessons; then another goes up in his place to sing
   a psalm.  This he executes as a solo, but the congregation join in the
   last modulations of the chant and continue them.  This is what is
   called the "Response" (psalmus responsorius), which must be
   distinguished carefully from the "Antiphon," which was a psalm executed
   alternately by two choirs.  At this early date the antiphon did not
   exist, only the response was known.  There must have been a
   considerable number of readings, but we are not told how many.  The
   series ended with a lection from the Gospel, which is made not by a
   reader but by a priest or deacon.  The congregation stands during this
   lesson.

   When the lessons and psalmodies are done, the priests take the word,
   each in his turn, and after them the bishop.  The homily is always
   preceded by a salutation to the people, to which they answer, "And with
   thy spirit."

   After the sermon the sending out of the different categories of persons
   who should not assist at the holy Mysteries takes place.  First of all
   the catechumens.  Upon the invitation of the deacon they make a prayer
   in silence while the congregation prays for them.  The deacon gives the
   outline of this prayer by detailing the intentions and the things to be
   prayed for.  The faithful answer, and especially the children, by the
   supplication Kyrie eleison.  Then the catechumens rise up, and the
   deacon asks them to join with him in the prayer which he pronounces;
   next he makes them bow before the bishop to receive his benediction,
   after which he sends them home.

   The same form is used for the energumens, for the competentes, i.e.,
   for the catechumens who are preparing to receive baptism, and last of
   all for the penitents.

   When there remain in the church only the faithful communicants, these
   fall to prayer; and prostrate toward the East they listen while the
   deacon says the litany--"For the peace and good estate of the world;
   for the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church; for bishops, priests; for
   the Church's benefactors; for the neophytes; for the sick; for
   travellers; for little children; for those who are erring," etc.  And
   to all these petitions is added Kyrie eleison.  The litany ends with
   this special form "Save us, and raise us up, O God, for thy mercy's
   sake."  Then the voice of the bishop rises in the silence--he
   pronounces a solemn prayer of a grave and majestic style.

   Here ends the first part of the liturgy; that part which the Church had
   taken from the old use of the synagogues.  The second part, the
   Christian liturgy, properly so-called, begins by the salutation of the
   bishop, followed by the response of the people.  Then, at a sign given
   by a deacon, the clergy receive the kiss of peace from the bishop, and
   the faithful give it to each other, men to men, women to women.

   Then the deacons and the other lower ministers divide themselves
   between watching and serving at the altar.  The one division go through
   the congregation, keeping all in their proper place, and the little
   children on the outskirts of the sacred enclosure, and watching the
   door that no profane person may enter the church.  The others bring and
   set upon the altar the breads and the chalices prepared for the Sacred
   Banquet; two of them wave fans backwards and forwards to protect the
   holy offerings from insects.  The bishop washes his hands and vests
   himself in festal habit; the priests range themselves around him, and
   all together they approach the altar.  This is a solemn moment.  After
   private prayer the bishop makes the sign of the cross upon his brow and
   begins,

   "The grace of God Almighty, and the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you always!"

   "And with thy spirit."

   "Lift up your hearts."

   "We lift them up unto the Lord."

   "Let us give thanks unto our Lord."

   "It is meet and right so to do."

   "It is very meet," etc.

   And the eucharistic prayer goes on...concluding at last with a return
   to the mysterious Sanctuary where God abides in the midst of spirits,
   where the Cherubims and the Seraphims eternally make heaven ring with
   the trisagion.

   Here the whole multitude of the people lift up their voices and joining
   their song with that of the choir of Angels, sing, "Holy, Holy, Holy,"
   etc.

   When the hymn is done and silence returns, the bishop continues the
   interrupted eucharistic prayer.

   "Thou truly art holy," etc., and goes on to commemorate the work of
   Redemption, the Incarnation of the Word, his mortal life, his passion;
   now the officiant keeps close to the Gospel account of the last supper;
   the mysterious words pronounced at first by Jesus on the night before
   his death are heard over the holy table.  Then, taking his inspiration
   from the last words, "Do this in remembrance of me," the bishop
   develops the idea, recalling the Passion of the Son of God, his death,
   his resurrection, his ascension, the hope of his glorious return, and
   declaring that it is in order to observe this precept and make this
   memorial that the congregation offers to God this eucharistic bread and
   wine.  Finally he prays the Lord to turn upon the Oblation a favourable
   regard, and to send down upon it the power of his Holy Spirit, to make
   it the Body and Blood of Christ, the spiritual food of his faithful,
   and the pledge of their immortality.

   Thus ends the eucharistic prayer, properly so-called.  The mystery is
   consummated....The bishop then directs the prayers...and when this long
   prayer is finished by a doxology, all the congregation answer "Amen,"
   and thus ratify his acts of thanks and intercession.

   After this is said "Our Father," accompanied by a short litany....The
   bishop then pronounces his benediction on the people.

   The deacon awakes the attention of the faithful and the bishop cries
   aloud, "Holy things for holy persons."  And the people answer, "There
   is one only holy, one only Lord Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the
   Father," etc.

   No doubt at this moment took place the fraction of the bread, a
   ceremony which the documents of the fourth century do not mention in
   express terms.

   The communion then follows.  The bishop receives first, then the
   priests, the deacons, the sub-deacons, the readers, the singers, the
   ascetics, the deaconesses, the virgins, the widows, the little
   children, and last of all the people.

   The bishop places the consecrated bread in the right hand, which is
   open, and supported by the left; the deacon holds the chalice--they
   drink out of it directly.  To each communicant the bishop says, "The
   Body of Christ"; and the deacon says, "The Blood of Christ, the Cup of
   life," to which the answer is made, "Amen."

   During the communion the singers execute Psalm XXXIII. [XXXIV. Heb.
   numbering] Benedicam Dominum, in which the words "O, taste and see how
   gracious the Lord is," have a special suitability.

   When the communion is done, the deacon gives the sign for prayer, which
   the bishop offers in the name of all; then all bow to receive his
   blessing.  Finally the deacon dismisses the congregation, saying, "Go
   in peace." [193]

   Canon XX.

   It is not right for a deacon to sit in the presence of a presbyter,
   unless he be bidden by the presbyter to sit down.  Likewise the deacons
   shall have worship of the subdeacons and all the [inferior] clergy.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.

   A deacon shall not sit down unless bidden.

   This is another canon to curb the ambition of Levites who wish to take
   upon themselves the honours of the priesthood also.  Spiritual Cores
   seem to have been common in early times among the deacons and this is
   but one of many canons on the subject.  Compare Canon XVIII of the
   Council of Nice.  Van Espen points out that in the Apostolic
   Constitutions (Lib. II., cap. lvij), occurs the following passage, "Let
   the seat for the bishop be set in the midst, and on each side of him
   let the presbyters sit, and let the deacons stand, having their loins
   girded."

   Van Espen.

   Here it should be noted, by the way, that in this canon there is
   presented a hierarchy consisting of bishops, presbyters, and deacons
   and other inferior ministers, each with their mutual subordination one
   to the other.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xciii., c. xv., in Dionysius's version.

   Canon XXI.

   The subdeacons have no right to a place in the Diaconicum, nor to touch
   the Lord's vessels.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.

   A subdeacon shall not touch the vessels.

   The "Lord's vessels" are the chalice and what we call the sacred
   vessels.

   Aristenus.

   The ecclesiastical ministers shall not take into their hands the Lord's
   vessels, but they shall be carried to the Table by the priests or
   deacons.

   Both Balsamon and Zonaras agree that by huperetai is here meant
   subdeacons.

   Hefele.

   It is doubtful whether by diaconicum is here meant the place where the
   deacons stood during service, or the diaconicum generally so called,
   which answers to our sacristy of the present day.  In this diaconicum
   the sacred vessels and vestments were kept; and as the last part of the
   canon especially mentions these, I have no doubt that the diaconicum
   must mean the sacristy.  For the rest, this canon is only the concrete
   expression of the rule, that the subdeacons shall not assume the
   functions of the deacons.

   With regard to the last words of this canon, Morinus and Van Espen are
   of opinion that the subdeacons were not altogether forbidden to touch
   the sacred vessels, for this had never been the case, but that it was
   intended that at the solemn entrance to the altar, peculiar to the
   Greek service, the sacred vessels which were then carried should not be
   borne by the subdeacons.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxiii., c. xxvj.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXII.

   The subdeacon has no right to wear an orarium [i.e., stole], nor to
   leave the doors.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.

   A subdeacon must not wear an orarium nor leave the doors.

   The "orarium" is what we call now the stole.

   In old times, so we are told by Zonaras and Balsamon, it was the place
   of the subdeacons to stand at the church doors and to bring in and take
   out the catechumens and the penitents at the proper points in the
   service.  Zonaras remarks that no one need be surprised if this, like
   many other ancient customs, has been entirely changed and abandoned.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxxii., canon xxvij., but reads hostias instead of
   ostia, thus making the canon forbid the subdeacons to leave the Hosts;
   and to make this worse the ancient Glossator adds, "but the subdeacon
   should remain and consume them with the other ministers."  The Roman
   Correctors indeed note the error but have not felt themselves at
   liberty to correct it on account of the authority of the gloss.  Van
   Espen remarks "To-day if any Hosts remain which are not to be reserved,
   the celebrant consumes them himself, but perchance in the time the
   gloss was written, it was the custom that the subdeacons and other
   ministers of the altar were accustomed to do this, but whenever the
   ministers present gradually fell into the habit of not receiving the
   sacrament, this consumption of what remained devolved upon the
   celebrant." [194]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [194] It is interesting to note that the ancient custom is in full use
   in the Anglican Church today, ordered expressly by the rubrics of the
   Prayer Book.

   Excursus on the Vestments of the Early Church.

   It would be out of place to enter into any specific treatment of the
   different vestments worn by the clergy in the performance of their
   various duties.  For a full discussion of this whole matter I must
   refer my readers to the great writers on liturgical and kindred
   matters, especially to Cardinal Bona, De Rebus Liturgicis; Pugin,
   Ecclesiastical Glossary; Rock, Church of our Fathers; Hefele, Beiträge
   zu Kircheschichte, Archäologie und Liturgik (essay in Die Liturgischen
   Gervänder, vol. ij. p. 184 sqq.).  And I would take this opportunity of
   warning the student against the entirely unwarranted conclusions of
   Durandus's Rationale Divinorum Officiorum and of Marriott's Vestiarium
   Christianum.

   The manner in which the use of the stole is spoken of in this canon
   shews not only the great antiquity of that vestment but of other
   ecclesiastical vestments as well.  Before, however, giving the details
   of our knowledge with regard to this particular vestment I shall need
   no apology for quoting a passage, very germane to the whole subject,
   from the pen of that most delightful writer Curzon, to whose care and
   erudition all scholars and students of manuscripts are so deeply
   indebted.

   (Robert Curzon, Armenia, p. 202.)

   Here I will remark that the sacred vestures of the Christian Church are
   the same, with very insignificant modifications, among every
   denomination of Christians in the world; that they have always been the
   same, and never were otherwise in any country, from the remotest times
   when we have any written accounts of them, or any mosaics, sculptures,
   or pictures to explain their forms.  They are no more a Popish
   invention, or have anything more to do with the Roman Church, than any
   other usage which is common to all denominations of Christians.  They
   are and always have been, of general and universal--that is, of
   Catholic--use; they have never been used for many centuries for
   ornament or dress by the laity, having been considered as set apart to
   be used only by priests in the church during the celebration of the
   worship of Almighty God.

   Thus far the very learned Curzon.  As is natural the distinctive dress
   of the bishops is the first that we hear of, and that in connexion with
   St. John, who is said to have worn a golden mitre or fillet. [195]

   (Duchesne, Origines du Culte Chrétien, p. 376 et sqq.)

   It was not the bishops alone who were distinguished by insignia from
   the other ecclesiastics.  Priests and deacons had their distinctive
   insignia as well.  There was, however, a difference between Rome and
   the rest of the world in this matter.  At Rome it would seem that but
   little favour was extended at first to these marks of rank; the letter
   of Pope Celestine to the bishops shews this already.  But what makes it
   evident still more clearly, is that the orarium of the priest and of
   the deacon, looked upon as a visible and distinctive mark of these
   orders, was unknown at Rome, at least down to the tenth century, while
   it had been adopted everywhere else.

   To be sure, the orarium is spoken of in the ordines of the ninth
   century; but from these it is also evident that this vestment was worn
   by acolytes and subdeacons, as well as by the superior clergy, and that
   its place was under the top vestment, whether dalmatic or chasuble, and
   not over it.  But that orarium is nothing more than the ancient
   sweat-cloth (sudarium), the handkerchief, or cravat which has ended up
   by taking a special form and even by becoming an accessory of a
   ceremonial vestment:  but it is not an insignia.  I know no Roman
   representation of this earlier than the twelfth century.  The priests
   and deacons who figure in the mosaics never display this detail of
   costume.

   But such is not the case elsewhere.  Towards the end of the fourth
   century, the Council of Laodicea in Phrygia forbade inferior classes,
   subdeacons, readers, etc., to usurp the orarium.  St. Isidore of
   Pelusium knew it as somewhat analogous to the episcopal pallium, except
   that it was of linen, while the pallium was of wool.  The sermon on the
   Prodigal Son, sometimes attributed to St. John Chrysostom [Migne's Ed.,
   vol. viij., 520], uses the same term, othone; it adds that this piece
   of dress was worn over the left shoulder, and that as it swung back and
   forth it called to mind the wings of the angels.

   The deacons among the Greeks wear the stole in this fashion down to
   to-day, perfectly visible, over the top of the upper vestment, and
   fastened upon the left shoulder.  Its ancient name (orarion) still
   clings to it.  As for the orarium of the priests it is worn, like the
   stole of Latin priests, round the neck, the two ends falling in front,
   almost to the feet.  This is called the epitrachilion (epitrachelion).

   These distinctions were also found in Spain and Gaul.  The Council of
   Braga, in 561, ordered that deacons should wear these oraria, not under
   the tunicle, which caused them to be confounded with the subdeacon, but
   over it, over the shoulder.  The Council of Toledo, in 633, describes
   the orarium as the common mark of the three superior orders, bishops,
   priests, and deacons; and specifies that the deacon should wear his
   over his left shoulder, and that it should be white, without any
   mixture of colours or any gold embroidery.  Another Council of Braga
   forbade priests to say mass without having a stole around their necks
   and crossed upon the breast, exactly as Latin priests wear it to-day.
   St. Germanus of Paris speaks of the insignia of a bishop and of a
   deacon; to the first he assigns the name of pallium, and says that it
   is worn around the neck, and falls down upon the breast where it ends
   with a fringe.  As for the insignia of a deacon he calls it a stole
   (stola); and says that deacons wear it over the alb.  This fashion of
   wearing the stole of the deacon spread during the middle ages over
   nearly the whole of Italy and to the very gates of Rome.  And even at
   Rome the ancient usage seems to have been maintained with a
   compromise.  They ended up by adopting the stole for deacons and by
   placing it over the left shoulder, but they covered it up with the
   dalmatic or the chasuble.

   The priest's stole was also accepted:  and in the mosaics of Sta. Maria
   in Trastevere is seen a priest ornamented with this insignia.  It is
   worthy of notice that the four popes who are represented in the same
   mosaic wear the pallium but no stole.  The one seems to exclude the
   other.  And as a matter of fact the ordines of the ninth century in
   describing the costume of the pope omit always the stole.  One can
   readily understand that who bore one of these insignia should not wear
   the other.

   However, they ended by combining them, and at Ravenna, where they
   always had a taste for decorations, bishop Ecclesius in the mosaics of
   San Vitale wears both the priest's stole and the Roman pallium.  This,
   however, seems to be unique, and his successors have the pallium only.
   The two are found together again in the Sacramentary of Autun (Vide M.
   Lelisle's reproduction in the Gazette Archéologique, 1884, pl. 20), and
   on the paliotto of St. Ambrose of Milan; such seems to have been the
   usage of the Franks.

   In view of these facts one is led to the conclusion that all these
   insignia, called pallium, omophorion, orarium, stole, epitrachilion,
   have the same origin.  They are the marks of dignity, introduced into
   church usage during the fourth century, analogous to those which the
   Theodosian code orders for certain kinds of civil functionaries.  For
   one reason or another the Roman Church refused to receive these marks,
   or rather confined itself to the papal pallium, which then took a
   wholly technical signification.  But everywhere else, this mark of the
   then superior orders of the hierarchy was adopted, only varying
   slightly to mark the degree, the deacon wearing it over the left
   shoulder, the bishop and priest around the neck, the deacon over the
   tunicle which is his uppermost vestment, the priest under the chasuble;
   the bishop over his chasuble.  [196] However, for this distinction
   between a bishop and priest we have very little evidence.  The Canon of
   III Braga, already cited, which prescribes that priests shall wear the
   stole crossed over the breast, presupposes that it is worn under the
   chasuble, but the council understands that this method of wearing it
   pertains distinctively to priests, and that bishops have another method
   which they should observe; for the word sacerdotes, used by the
   council, includes bishops as well as priests.  The rest of the Spanish
   ecclesiastical literature gives us no information upon the point.  In
   Gaul, St. Germanus of Paris (as we have seen) speaks of the episcopal
   pallium after having described the chasuble, which makes one believe
   that it was worn on top.  I have already said that Bishop Ecclesius of
   Ravenna is represented with the stole pendant before, under the
   chasuble and at the same time with the pallium on top of it; and that
   this usage was adopted in France in the Carlovingian times.  Greek
   bishops also wear at the same time the epitrachilion and the
   omophorion.  This accumulation of insignia was forbidden in Spain in
   the seventh century (Vide IV Toledo, Canon XXXIX), and (as we have
   stated) the Pope abstained from it until about the twelfth century,
   contenting himself with the pallium without adding to it the stole.*

   The pallium, with the exception of the crosses which adorn its ends,
   was always white; so too was the deacon's stole and also that of the
   priest and bishop.  The pallium was always and everywhere made of wool;
   in the East the deacon's stole was of linen; I cannot say of what
   material the priest's and deacon's stole was in the West.

   Excursus on the Minor Orders of the Early Church.

   (Lightfoot, Apostolic Fathers, Ignatius, Vol. I., p. 258.)

   Some of these lower orders, the subdeacons, readers, door-keepers, and
   exorcists, are mentioned in the celebrated letter of Cornelius bishop
   of Rome (a.d. 251) preserved by Eusebius (H. E., vi., 43), and the
   readers existed at least half a century earlier (Tertull., de Præscr.,
   41).  In the Eastern Church, however, if we except the Apostolic
   Constitutions, of which the date and country are uncertain, the first
   reference to such offices is found in a canon of the Council of
   Antioch, a.d. 341, where readers, subdeacons, and exorcists, are
   mentioned, this being apparently intended as an exhaustive enumeration
   of the ecclesiastical orders below the diaconate; and for the first
   mention of door-keepers in the East, we must go to the still later
   Council of Laodicea, about a.d. 363, (see III., p. 240, for the
   references, where also fuller information is given).  But while most of
   these lower orders certainly existed in the West, and probably in the
   East, as early as the middle of the third century the case is different
   with the "singers" (psaltai) and the "labourers" (kopiatai).  Setting
   aside the Apostolic Constitutions, the first notice of the "singers"
   occurs in the canons of the above-mentioned Council of Laodicea.  This,
   however, may be accidental.  The history of the word copiatai affords a
   more precise and conclusive indication of date.  The term first occurs
   in a rescript of Constantius (a.d. 357), "clerici qui copiatai
   appellantur," and a little later (a.d. 361), the same emperor speaks of
   them as "hi quos copiatas recens usus instituit nuncupari."

   (Adolf Harnack, in his little book ridiculously intituled in the
   English version Sources of the Apostolic Canons, page 85.)

   Exorcists and readers there had been in the Church from old times,
   subdeacons are not essentially strange, as they participate in a name
   (deacon) which dates from the earliest days of Christianity.  But
   acolytes and door-keepers (puloroi) are quite strange, are really
   novelties.  And these acolytes even at the time of Cornelius stand at
   the head of the ordines minores:  for that the subdeacons follow on the
   deacons is self-evident.  Whence do they come?  Now if they do not
   spring out of the Christian tradition, their origin must be explained
   from the Roman.  It can in fact be shown there with desirable
   plainness.

   With regard to subdeacons the reader may also like to see some of
   Harnack's speculations.  In the volume just quoted he writes as follows
   (p. 85 note):

   According to Cornelius and Cyprian subdeacons were mentioned in the
   thirtieth canon of the Synod of Elvira (about 305), so that the sub
   diaconate must then have been acknowledged as a fixed general
   institution in the whole west (see Dale, The Synod of Elvira, Lond.,
   1882).  The same is seen in the "gesta apud Zenophilum."  As the
   appointment of the lower orders took place at Rome between about the
   years 222-249, the announcement in the Liber Pontificalis (see
   Duchesne's edition, fasc. 2, 1885, p. 148) is not to be despised, as
   according to it Bishop Fabian appointed seven subdeacons:  "Hic
   regiones dividit diaconibus et fecit vii. subdiaconos."  The Codex
   Liberianus indeed (see Duchesne, fasc. 1, pp. 4 and 5; Lipsius,
   Chronologie d. röm Bischöfe, p. 267), only contains the first half of
   the sentence, and what the Liber Pontif. has added of the account of
   the appointment of subdeacons (...qui vii notariis imminerent, ut
   gestas martyrum in integro fideliter colligerent) is, in spite of the
   explanation of Duchesne, not convincing.  According to Probst and other
   Catholic scholars the subdiaconate existed in Rome a long time before
   Fabian (Kirchl. Disciplin, p. 109), but Hippolytus is against them.
   Besides, it should be observed that the officials first, even in
   Carthage, are called hypo-deacons, though the word subdiaconus was by
   degrees used in the West.  This also points to a Roman origin of the
   office, for in the Roman church in the first part of the third century
   the Greek language was the prevailing one, but not at Carthage.

   But to return to the Acolythes, and door-keepers, whom Harnack thinks
   to be copies of the old Roman temple officers.  He refers to
   Marquardt's explanation of the sacrificial system of the Romans, and
   gives the following resumé (page 85 et seqq.):

   1.  The temples have only partially their own priests, but they all
   have a superintendent (oedituus-curator templi).  These oeditui, who
   lived in the temple, fall again into two classes.  At least "in the
   most important brotherhoods the chosen oedituus was not in a position
   to undertake in person the watching and cleaning of the sacellum.  He
   charged therefore with this service a freedman or slave."  "In this
   case the sacellum had two oeditui, the temple-keeper, originally called
   magister oedituus, and the temple-servant, who appears to be called the
   oedituus minister."  "To both it is common that they live in the
   temple, although in small chapels the presence of the servant is
   sufficient.  The temple-servant opens, shuts, and cleans the sacred
   place, and shows to strangers its curiosities, and allows, according to
   the rules of the temple, those persons to offer up prayers and
   sacrifices to whom this is permitted, while he sends away the others."

   2.  "Besides the endowment, the colleges of priests were also supplied
   with a body of servants"--the under officials--; "they were appointed
   to the priests,...by all of whom they were used partly as
   letter-carriers (tabellarii), partly as scribes, partly as assistants
   at the sacrifices."  Marquardt reckons, (page 218 and fol.) the various
   categories of them among the sacerdotes publici, lictores, pullarii,
   victimarii, tibicines, viatores, sixthly the calatores, in the priests'
   colleges free men or freedmen, not slaves, and in fact one for the
   personal service of each member.

   Here we have the forerunners of the Church door-keepers and acolytes.
   Thus says the fourth Council of Carthage, as far as refers to the
   former:  "Ostiarius cum ordinatur, postquam ab archidiacono instructus
   fuerit, qualiter in domo dei debeat conversari, ad suggestionem
   archidiaconi, tradat ei episcopus claves ecclesiæ de altari, dicens.
   Sic age, quasi redditurus deo rationem pro his rebus, quæ hisce
   clavibus recluduntur."  The ostiarius (puloros) is thus the ædituus
   minister.  He had to look after the opening and shutting of the doors,
   to watch over the coming in and going out of the faithful, to refuse
   entrance to suspicious persons, and, from the date of the more strict
   separation between the missa catechumenorum and the missa fidelium, to
   close the doors, after the dismissal of the catechumens, against those
   doing penance and unbelievers.  He first became necessary when there
   were special church buildings (there were such even in the second
   century), and they like the temples, together with the ceremonial of
   divine service, had come to be considered as holy, that is, since about
   225.  The church acolytes are without difficulty to be recognised in
   the under officials of the priests, especially in the "calatores," the
   personal servants of the priests.  According to Cyprian the acolytes
   and others are used by preference as tabellarii.  According to
   Cornelius there were in Rome forty-two acolytes.  As he gives the
   number of priests as forty-six, it may be concluded with something like
   certainty that the rule was that the number of the priests and of the
   acolytes should be equal, and that the little difference may have been
   caused by temporary vacancies.  If this view is correct, the identity
   of the calator with the acolyte is strikingly proved.  But the name
   "acolyte" plainly shows the acolyte was not, like the door-keeper,
   attached to a sacred thing, but to a sacred person.

   (Lightfoot, Apostolic Fathers, Ignatius, ad Antioch, xj., note.  Vol.
   II., Sec. II., p. 240.)

   The acolytes were confined to the Western Church and so are not
   mentioned here.  On the other hand the "deaconesses" seem to have been
   confined to the Eastern Church at this time.  See also Apost. Const.,
   iii., 11.; viii., 12; comp. viii., 19-28, 31; Apost. Can., 43; Conc.
   Laodic., Can. 24; Conc. Antioch, Can. 10.  Of these lower orders the
   "subdeacons" are first mentioned in the middle of the third century, in
   the passage of Cornelius already quoted and in the contemporary letters
   of Cyprian.  The "readers" occur as early as Tertullian de Præscr. 41
   "hodie diaconus, qui cras lector," where the language shows that this
   was already a firmly established order in the Church.  Of the "singers"
   the notices in the Apostolical Constitutions are probably the most
   ancient.  The "door-keepers," like the sub-deacons, seem to be first
   mentioned in the letter of Cornelius.  The kopiontes first appear a
   full century later; see the next note.  The "exorcists," as we have
   seen, are mentioned as a distinct order by Cornelius, while in Apost.
   Const., viii., 26, it is ordered that they shall not be ordained,
   because it is a spiritual function which comes direct from God and
   manifests itself by its results.  The name and the function, however,
   appear much earlier in the Christian Church; e.g., Justin Mart., Apol.
   ii., 6 (p. 45).  The forms eporkistes and exorkistes are convertible;
   e.g., Justin Mart., Dial., 85 (p. 311).  The "confessors" hardly
   deserve to be reckoned a distinct order, though accidentally they are
   mentioned in proximity with the different grades of clergy in Apost.
   Const., viii., 12, already quoted.  Perhaps the accidental connexion in
   this work has led to their confusion with the offices of the Christian
   ministry in our false Ignatius.  In Apost. Const., viii., 23, they are
   treated in much the same way as the exorcists, being regarded as in
   some sense an order and yet not subject to ordination.  Possibly,
   however, the word homologetai has here a different sense, "chanters,"
   as the corresponding Latin "confessores" seems sometimes to have, e.g.,
   in the Sacramentary of Gregory "Oremus et pro omnibus episcopis,
   presbyteris, diaconibus, acolythis, exorcistis, lectoribus, ostiariis,
   confessoribus, virginibus, viduis, et pro omni populo sancto Dei;" see
   Ducange, Gloss. Lat., s.v. (11. p. 530, Henschel).

   In a law of the year 357 (Cod. Theod., xiii., 1) mention is made of
   "clerici qui copiatæ appellantur," and another law of the year 361
   (Cod. Theod. xvi., 2, 15) runs "clerici vero vel his quos copiatas
   recens usus instituit nuncupari," etc.  From these passages it is clear
   that the name kopiontes was not in use much before the middle of the
   fourth century, though the office under its Latin name "fossores" or
   "fossarii" appears somewhat earlier.  Even later Epiphanius (Expos.
   Fid., 21) writes as if the word still needed some explanation.  In
   accordance with these facts, Zahn (I. v., A. p. 129), correctly argues
   with regard to our Ignatian writer, urging that on the one hand he
   would not have ascribed such language to Ignatius if the word had been
   quite recent, while on the other hand his using the participle (tous
   kopiontas) rather than the substantive indicates that it had not yet
   firmly established itself.  For these "copiatæ" see especially de
   Rossi, Roma Sotteranea, III., p. 533 sq., Gothofred on Cod. Theod.,
   II., cc., and for the Latin "fossores" Martigny, Dict. des Antiq.
   Chrét. s.v.  See also the inscriptions, C. I. G., 9227, Bull. de Corr.

   Canon XXV.

   A subdeacon must not give the Bread, nor bless the Cup.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXV.

   A subdeacon may not give the bread and the cup.

   Aristenus.

   Subdeacons are not allowed to perform the work of presbyters and
   deacons.  Wherefore they neither deliver the bread nor the cup to the
   people.

   Hefele.

   According to the Apostolic Constitutions, the communion was
   administered in the following manner:  the bishop gave to each the holy
   bread with the words:  "the Body of the Lord," and the recipient said,
   "Amen."  The deacon then gave the chalice with the words:  "the Blood
   of Christ, the chalice of life," and the recipient again answered,
   "Amen."  This giving of the chalice with the words:  "the Blood of
   Christ," etc., is called in the canon of Laodicea a "blessing"
   (eulogein).  The Greek commentator Aristenus in accordance with this,
   and quite rightly, gives the meaning of this canon.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Diet. XCIII., c. xix.; but reads "Deacons" instead of
   "Subdeacons."  The Roman Correctors point out the error.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXVI.

   They who have not been promoted [to that office] by the bishop, ought
   not to adjure, either in churches or in private houses.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVI.

   No one shall adjure without the bishop's promotion to that office.

   Balsamon.

   Some were in the habit of "adjuring," that is catechising the
   unbelievers, who had never received the imposition of the bishop's
   hands for that purpose; and when they were accused of doing so,
   contended that as they did not do it in church but only at home, they
   could not be considered as deserving of any punishment.  For this
   reason the Fathers rule that even to "adjure" (ephorkizein) is an
   ecclesiastical ministry, and must not be executed by anyone who shall
   not have been promoted thereto by a bishop.  But the "Exorcist" must be
   excepted who has been promoted by a Chorepiscopus, for he can indeed
   properly catechize although not promoted by a bishop; for from Canon X.
   of Antioch we learn that even a Chorepiscopus can make an Exorcist.

   Zonaras notes that from this canon it appears that "Chorepiscopi are
   considered to be in the number of bishops."

   Van Espen.

   "Promoted" (proachthentas ) by the bishops, by which is signified a
   mere designation or appointment, in conformity with the Greek
   discipline which never counted exorcism among the orders, but among the
   simple ministries which were committed to certain persons by the
   bishops, as Morinus proves at length in his work on Orders (De
   Ordinationibus, Pars III., Ex. XIV., cap. ij.).

   Double is the power of devils over men, the one part internal the other
   external.  The former is when they hold the soul captive by vice and
   sin.  The latter when they disturb the exterior and interior senses and
   lead anyone on to fury.  Those who are subject to the interior evils
   are the Catechumens and Penitents, and those who are subject to the
   exterior are the Energumens.  Whoever are occupied with the freeing
   from the power of the devil of either of these kinds, by prayers,
   exhortations, and exorcisms, are said "to exorcize" them; which seems
   to be what Balsamon means when he says--"exorcize' that is to catechize
   the unbelievers.'"  Vide this matter more at length in Ducange's
   Glossary (Gloss., s.v. Exorcizare).

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. LXIX. c. ij., Isidore's version.

   Canon XXVII.

   Neither they of the priesthood, nor clergymen, nor laymen, who are
   invited to a love feast, may take away their portions, for this is to
   cast reproach on the ecclesiastical order.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVII.

   A clergyman invited to a love feast shall carry nothing away with him;
   for this would bring his order into shame.

   Hefele.

   Van Espen translates:  "no one holding any office in the Church, be he
   cleric or layman," and appeals to the fact that already in early times
   among the Greeks many held offices in the Church without being
   ordained, as do now our sacristans and acolytes.  I do not think,
   however, with Van Espen, that by "they of the priesthood" is meant in
   general any one holding office in the Church, but only the higher ranks
   of the clergy, priests and deacons, as in the preceding twenty-fourth
   canon the presbyters and deacons alone are expressly numbered among the
   hieratikois and distinguished from the other (minor) clerics.  And
   afterwards, in canon XXX., there is a similar mention of three
   different grades, hieratikoi, klerikoi, and asketai.

   The taking away of the remains of the agape is here forbidden, because,
   on the one hand, it showed covetousness, and, on the other, was perhaps
   considered a profanation.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XLII., c. iij.

   Canon XXVIII.

   It is not permitted to hold love feasts, as they are called, in the
   Lord's Houses, or Churches, nor to eat and to spread couches in the

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVII.

   Beds shall not be set up in churches, nor shall love feasts be held
   there.

   Hefele.

   Eusebius (H. E., Lib. IX., Cap. X.) employs the expression kuriaka in
   the same sense as does this canon as identical with churches.  The
   prohibition itself, however, here given, as well as the preceding
   canon, proves that as early as the time of the Synod of Laodicea, many
   irregularities had crept into the agape.  For the rest, this Synod was
   not in a position permanently to banish the usage from the Church; for
   which reason the Trullan Synod in its seventy-fourth canon repeated
   this rule word for word.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Disk XLII., c. iv.

   Canon XXIX.

   Christians must not judaize by resting on the Sabbath, but must work on
   that day, rather honouring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting
   then as Christians.  But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let
   them be anathema from Christ.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIX.

   A Christian shall not stop work on the Sabbath, but on the Lord's Day.

   Balsamon.

   Here the Fathers order that no one of the faithful shall stop work on
   the Sabbath as do the Jews, but that they should honour the Lord's Day,
   on account of the Lord's resurrection, and that on that day they should
   abstain from manual labour and go to church.  But thus abstaining from
   work on Sunday they do not lay down as a necessity, but they add, "if
   they can."  For if through need or any other necessity any one worked
   on the Lord's day this was not reckoned against him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXX.

   None of the priesthood, nor clerics [of lower rank] nor ascetics, nor
   any Christian or layman, shall wash in a bath with women; for this is
   the greatest reproach among the heathen.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXX.

   It is an abomination to bathe with women.

   This canon was renewed by the Synod in Trullo, canon lxxvij.

   Zonaras explains that the bathers were entirely nude and hence arose
   the objection which was also felt by the heathen.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. LXXXI, c. xxviij.

   Canon XXXI.

   It is not lawful to make marriages with all [sorts of] heretics, nor to
   give our sons and daughters to them; but rather to take of them, if
   they promise to become Christians.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXI.

   It is not right to give children in marriage to heretics, but they
   should be received if they promise to become Christians.

   Van Espen.

   By this canon the faithful are forbidden to contract marriage with
   heretics or to join their children in such; for, as both Balsamon and
   Zonaras remark, "they imbue them with their errors, and lead them to
   embrace their own perverse opinions."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXXII.

   It is unlawful to receive the eulogiæ of heretics, for they are rather
   alogiai [i.e., follies], than eulogiæ [i.e., blessings].

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXII.

   The blessings of heretics are cursings.

   To keep the Latin play upon the words the translator has used
   bene-dictiones and male-dictiones, but at the expense of the accuracy
   of translation.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa II., Quæst. I., Can. lxvj.

   Canon XXXIII.

   No one shall join in prayers with heretics or schismatics.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXIII.

   Thou shalt not pray with heretics or schismatics.

   Van Espen.

   The underlying principle of this canon is the same as the last, for as
   the receiving of the Eulogiæ which were sent by heretics as a sign of
   communion, signified a communion with them in religious matters, so the
   sharing with them common prayer is a declaration of the same communion,
   and therefore to be avoided.  This is also set forth in Apostolical
   Canon number xlv.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXXIV.

   No Christian shall forsake the martyrs of Christ, and turn to false
   martyrs, that is, to those of the heretics, or those who formerly were
   heretics; for they are aliens from God.  Let those, therefore, who go
   after them, be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXIV.

   Whoso honours an heretical pseudo-martyr let him be anathema.

   Hefele.

   This canon forbids the honouring of martyrs not belonging to the
   orthodox church.  The number of Montanist martyrs of Phrygia was
   probably the occasion of this canon.

   The phrase which I have translated "to those who formerly were
   heretics" has caused great difficulty to all translators and scarcely
   two agree.  Hammond reads "those who have been reputed to have been
   heretics;" and with him Fulton agrees, but wrongly (as I think) by
   omitting the "to."  Lambert translates "to those who before were
   heretics" and correctly.  With him agrees Van Espen, thus, vel eos qui
   prius heretici fuere.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXXV.

   Christians must not forsake the Church of God, and go away and invoke
   angels and gather assemblies, which things are forbidden.  If,
   therefore, any one shall be found engaged in this covert idolatry, let
   him be anathema; for he has forsaken our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
   God, and has gone over to idolatry.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXV.

   Whoso calls assemblies in opposition to those of the Church and names
   angels, is near to idolatry and let him be anathema.

   Van Espen.

   Whatever the worship of angels condemned by this canon may have been,
   one thing is manifest, that it was a species of idolatry, and detracted
   from the worship due to Christ.

   Theodoret makes mention of this superstitious cult in his exposition of
   the Text of St. Paul, Col. ii. 18, and when writing of its condemnation
   by this synod he says, "they were leading to worship angels such as
   were defending the Law; for, said they, the Law was given through
   angels.  And this vice lasted for a long time in Phrygia and Pisidia.
   Therefore it was that the synod which met at Laodicea in Phrygia,
   prohibited by a canon, that prayer should be offered to angels, and
   even to-day an oratory of St. Michael can be seen among them, and their
   neighbours."

   In the Capitular of Charlemagne, a.d. 789 (cap. xvi.), it is said, "In
   that same council (Laodicea) it was ordered that angels should not be
   given unknown names, and that such should not be affixed to them, but
   that only they should be named by the names which we have by
   authority.  These are Michael, Gabriel, Raphael."  And then is
   subjoined the present canon.  The canon forbids "to name" (onomazein)
   angels, and this was understood as meaning to give them names instead
   of to call upon them by name.

   Perchance the authors of the Capitular had in mind the Roman Council
   under Pope Zachary, a.d. 745, against Aldebert, who was found to invoke
   by name eight angels in his prayers.

   It should be noted that some Latin versions of great authority and
   antiquity read angulos for angelos.  This would refer to doing these
   idolatrous rites in corners, hiddenly, secretly, occulte as in the
   Latin.  But this reading, though so respectable in the Latin, has no
   Greek authority for it.

   This canon has often been used in controversy as condemning the cultus
   which the Catholic Church has always given to the angels, but those who
   would make such a use of this canon should explain how these
   interpretations can be consistent with the cultus of the Martyrs so
   evidently approved by the same council; and how this canon came to be
   accepted by the Fathers of the Second Council of Nice, if it condemned
   the then universal practice of the Church, East and West.  Cf. Forbes,
   Considerationes Modestæ.

   Canon XXXVI.

   They who are of the priesthood, or of the clergy, shall not be
   magicians, enchanters, mathematicians, or astrologers; nor shall they
   make what are called amulets, which are chains for their own souls.
   And those who wear such, we command to be cast out of the Church.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXVI.

   Whoso will be priest must not be a magician, nor one who uses
   incantations, or mathematical or astrological charms, nor a putter on
   of amulets.

   Some interesting and valuable information on charms will be found in
   Ducange (Glossarium, s.v. Phylacterea).

   Balsamon.

   "Magicians" are those who for any purpose call Satan to their aid.
   "Enchantors" are those who sing charms or incantations, and through
   them draw demons to obey them.  "Mathematicians" are they who hold the
   opinion that the celestial bodies rule the universe, and that all
   earthly things are ruled by their influence.  "Astrologers" are they
   who divine by the stars through the agency of demons, and place their
   faith in them.

   Van Espen.

   Zonaras also notes that the science of mathematics or astronomy is not
   at all hereby forbidden to the clergy, but the excess and abuse of that
   science, which even more easily may happen in the case of clergymen and
   consecrated persons than in that of laymen.

   By anomalia, illness is commonly understood, and Dionysius Exiguus and

   unless he is ordered to do so.

   Van Espen.

   (On Canon xli.)

   It is well known that according to the true discipline of the Church no
   one should be ordained unless he be attached to some church, which as
   an ecclesiastical soldier he shall fight for and preserve.  As, then, a
   secular soldier cannot without his prefect's bidding leave his post and
   go to another, so the canons decree that no one in the ranks of the
   ecclesiastical military can travel about except at the bidding of the
   bishop who is in command of the army.  A slight trace of this
   discipline is observed even to-day in the fact that priests of other
   dioceses are not allowed to celebrate unless they are provided with
   Canonical letters or testimonials from their own bishops.

   (On Canon xlii.)

   The whole subject of Commendatory and other letters is treated of in
   the note to Canon VIII. of the Council of Antioch.

   Canon xlj. is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars III., Dist. V., De Consecrat, can. xxxvj.

   Canon xlij. is appended to the preceding, but, curiously enough,
   limited to laymen, reading as follows:  "a layman also without
   canonical letters," that is "formed letters," should not travel
   anywhere.  The Roman Correctors remark that in the Greek order this
   last is canon xli., and the former part of Gratian's canon, canon xlij.
   of the Greek, but such is not the order of the Greek in Zonaras nor in
   Balsamon.  The correctors add that in neither canon is there any
   mention made of laymen, nor in Dionysius's version; the Prisca,
   however, read for canon xlj., "It is not right for a minister of the
   altar, even for a layman, to travel, etc."

   Canon XLIII.

   The subdeacons may not leave the doors to engage in the prayer, even

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIII.

   A subdeacon should not leave the gates, even for a short time, to pray.

   On this canon the commentators find nothing to say in addition to their
   remarks on Canons xxj., and xxij., except that the "prayer" is not
   their own private prayer, but the prayer of the Liturgy.  It has struck
   me that possibly when there was no deacon to sing the litany outside
   the Holy Gates while the priest was going on with the holy action
   within, subdeacons may have left their places at the doors, assumed the
   deacon's stole and done his part of the office, and that it was to
   prevent this abuse that this canon was enacted, the "prayer" being the
   litany.  But as this is purely my own suggestion it is probably
   valueless.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLIV.

   Women may not go to the altar.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIV.

   The altar must not be approached by women.

   Van Espen.

   The discipline of this canon was often renewed even in the Latin
   Church, and therefore Balsamon unjustly attacks the Latins when he
   says; "Among the Latins women go without any shame up to the altar
   whenever they wish."  For the Latins have forbidden and do forbid this
   approach of women to the altar no less than the Greeks; and look upon
   the contrary custom as an abuse sprung of the insolence of the women
   and of the negligence of bishops and pastors.

   Zonaras.

   If it is prohibited to laymen to enter the Sanctuary by the lxix^th
   canon of the Sixth synod [i.e. Quinisext], much more are women
   forbidden to do so who are unwillingly indeed, but yet truly, polluted
   by the monthly flux of blood.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLV.

   [Candidates] for baptism are not to be received after the second week
   in Lent.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLV.

   After two weeks of Lent no one must be admitted for illumination, for
   all such should fast from its beginning.

   Van Espen.

   To the understanding of this canon it must be remembered that such of
   the Gentiles as desired to become Catholics and to be baptized, at
   first were privately instructed by the catechists.  After this, having
   acquired some knowledge of the Christian religion, they were admitted
   to the public instructions given by the bishop in church; and were
   therefore called Audientes and for the first time properly-speaking
   Catechumens.  But when these catechumens had been kept in this rank a
   sufficient time and had been there tried, they were allowed to go up to
   the higher grade called Genuflectentes.

   And when their exercises had been completed in this order they were
   brought by the catechists who had had the charge of them, to the
   bishop, that on the Holy Sabbath [Easter Even] they might receive
   baptism, and the catechumens gave their names at the same time, so that
   they might be set down for baptism at the coming Holy Sabbath.

   Moreover we learn from St. Augustine (Serm. xiii., Ad Neophitos,) that
   the time for the giving in of the names was the beginning of Lent.

   This council therefore in this canon decrees that such as do not hand
   in their names at the beginning of Lent, but after two weeks are past,
   shall not be admitted to baptism on the next Holy Sabbath.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLVI.

   They who are to be baptized must learn the faith [Creed] by heart, and
   recite it to the bishop, or to the presbyters, on the fifth day of the
   week.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVI.

   Vide infra.

   Hefele.

   It is doubtful whether by the Thursday of the text was meant only the
   Thursday of Holy Week, or every Thursday of the time during which the
   catechumens received instruction.  The Greek commentators are in favour
   of the latter, but Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore, and after them
   Bingham, are, and probably rightly, in favour of the former meaning.
   This canon was repeated by the Trullan Synod in its seventy-eighth
   canon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLVII.

   They who are baptized in sickness and afterwards recover, must learn
   the Creed by heart and know that the Divine gifts have been vouchsafed
   them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canons XLVI. and XLVII.

   Whoso is baptised by a bishop or presbyter let him recite the faith on
   the fifth feria of the week.  Also anyone baptized clinically a short
   while afterwards.

   Balsamon.

   Some unbelievers were baptized before they had been catechized, by
   reason of the urgency of the illness.  Now some thought that as their
   baptism did not follow their being catechumens, they ought to be
   catechized and baptized over again.  And in support of this opinion
   they urged Canon XII. of Neocæsarea, which does not permit one
   clinically baptized to become a priest rashly.  For this reason it is
   that the Fathers decree that such an one shall not be baptized a second
   time, but as soon as he gets well he shall learn the faith and the
   mystery of baptism, and to appreciate the divine gifts he has received,
   viz., the confession of the one true God and the remission of sins
   which comes to us in holy baptism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLVIII.

   They who are baptized must after Baptism be anointed with the heavenly
   chrism, and be partakers of the Kingdom of Christ.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVIII.

   Those illuminated should after their baptism be anointed.

   Van Espen.

   That this canon refers to the anointing with chrism on the forehead of
   the baptized, that is to say of the sacrament of confirmation, is the
   unanimous opinion of the Greek commentators, and Balsamon notes that
   this anointing is not simply styled "chrism" but "the heavenly chrism,"
   viz.:  "that which is sanctified by holy prayers and through the
   invocation of the Holy Spirit; and those who are anointed therewith, it
   sanctifies and makes partakers of the kingdom of heaven."

   Aubespine.

   (Lib. i., Observat. cap. xv.)

   Formerly no one was esteemed worthy of the name Christian or reckoned
   among the perfect who had not been confirmed and endowed with the gift
   of the Holy Ghost.

   The prayers for the consecration of the Holy Chrism according to the
   rites of the East and of the West should be carefully read by the
   student.  Those of the East are found in the Euchologion, and those of

   Canon XLIX.

   During Lent the Bread must not be offered except on the Sabbath Day and
   on the Lord's Day only.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIX.

   In Lent the offering should be made only on the Sabbath and on the
   Lord's day.

   Hefele.

   This canon, which was repeated by the Trullan Synod in its fifty-second
   canon, orders that on ordinary week days during Lent, only a Missa
   Præsanctificatorum should take place, as is still the custom with the
   Greeks on all days of penitence and mourning, when it appears to them
   unsuitable to have the full liturgy, and as Leo Allatius says, for this
   reason, that the consecration is a joyful act.  A comparison of the
   above sixteenth canon, however, shows that Saturday was a special
   exception.

   To the Saturdays and Sundays mentioned by Hefele must be added the
   feast of the Annunciation, which is always solemnized with a full
   celebration of the Liturgy, even when it falls upon Good Friday.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon L.

   The fast must not be broken on the fifth day of the last week in Lent
   [i.e., on Maunday Thursday], and the whole of Lent be dishonoured; but
   it is necessary to fast during all the Lenten season by eating only dry
   meats.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon L.

   It is not right on the fifth feria of the last week of Lent to break
   the fast, and thus spoil the whole of Lent; but the whole of Lent
   should be kept with fasting on dry food.

   That long before the date of the Quinisext Synod the fasting reception
   of the Holy Eucharist was the universal law of the Church no one can
   doubt who has devoted the slightest study to the point.  To produce the
   evidence here would be out of place, but the reader may be referred to
   the excellent presentation of it in Cardinal Bona's De Rebus
   Liturgicis.

   I shall here cite but one passage, from St. Augustine:

   "It is clear that when the disciples first received the body and blood
   of the Lord they had not been fasting.  Must we then censure the
   Universal Church because the sacrament is everywhere partaken of by
   persons fasting?  Nay, verily; for from that time it pleased the Holy
   Spirit to appoint, for the honour of so great a sacrament, that the
   body of the Lord should take the precedence of all other food entering
   the mouth of a Christian; and it is for this reason that the custom
   referred to is universally observed.  For the fact that the Lord
   instituted the sacrament after other food had been partaken of does not
   prove that brethren should come together to partake of that sacrament
   after having dined or supped, or imitate those whom the Apostle
   reproved and corrected for not distinguishing between the Lord's Supper
   and an ordinary meal.  The Saviour, indeed, in order to commend the
   depths of that mystery more affectingly to his disciples, was pleased
   to impress it on their hearts and memories by making its institution
   his last act before going from them to his passion.  And, therefore, he
   did not prescribe the order in which it was to be observed, reserving
   this to be done by the Apostles, through whom he intended to arrange
   all things pertaining to the churches.  Had he appointed that the
   sacrament should be always partaken of after other food, I believe that
   no one would have departed from that practice.  But when the Apostle,
   speaking of this sacrament, says, Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come
   together to eat, tarry one for another, and if any man hunger let him
   eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation,' he
   immediately adds, And the rest will I set in order when I come.'
   Whence we are given to understand that, since it was too much for him
   to prescribe completely in an epistle the method observed by the
   Universal Church throughout the world it was one of the things set in
   order by him in person; for we find its observance uniform amid all the
   variety of other customs." [198]

   In fact the utter absurdity of the attempt to maintain the opposite
   cannot better be seen than in reading Kingdon's Fasting Communion, an
   example of special pleading and disingenuousness rarely equalled even
   in controversial theological literature.  A brief but crushing
   refutation of the position taken by that writer will be found in an
   appendix to a pamphlet by H. P. Liddon, Evening Communions contrary to
   the Teaching and Practice of the Church in all Ages.

   But while this is true, it is also true that in some few places the
   custom had lingered on of making Maundy Thursday night an exception to
   this rule, and of having then a feast, in memory of our Lord's Last
   Supper, and after this having a celebration of the Divine Mysteries.
   This is the custom which is prohibited by this canon, but it is
   manifest both from the wording of the canon itself and from the remarks
   of the Greek commentators that the custom was condemned not because it
   necessitated an unfasting reception of the Holy Eucharist, but because
   it connoted a feast which was a breaking of the Lenten fast and a
   dishonour to the whole of the holy season.

   It is somewhat curious and a trifle amusing to read Zonaras gravely
   arguing the point as to whether the drinking of water is forbidden by
   this canon because it speaks of "dry meats," which he decides in the
   negative!

   Balsamon.

   Those, therefore, who without being ill, fast on oil and shell-fish, do
   contrary to this law; and much more they who eat on the fourth and
   sixth ferias fish.

   Canon LI.

   The nativities of Martyrs are not to be celebrated in Lent, but
   commemorations of the holy Martyrs are to be made on the Sabbaths and
   Lord's days.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LI.

   Commemorations of Martyrs shall only be held on Lord's days and
   Sabbaths.

   By this canon all Saints-days are forbidden to be observed in Lent on
   the days on which they fall, but must be transferred to a Sabbath or
   else to the Sunday, when they can be kept with the festival service of
   the full liturgy and not with the penitential incompleteness of the
   Mass of the Presanctified.  Compare canon xlix. of this Synod, and
   canon lij. of the Quinisext Council.

   Balsamon.

   The whole of Lent is a time of grief for our sins, and the memories of
   the Saints are not kept except on the Sabbaths.

   Van Espen remarks how in old calendars there are but few Saints-days in
   those months in which Lent ordinarily falls, and that the multitude of
   days now kept by the Roman ordo are mostly of modern introduction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LII.

   Marriages and birthday feasts are not to be celebrated in Lent.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LII.

   Marriage shall not be celebrated in Lent, nor birthdays.

   Hefele.

   By "birthday feasts" in this canon the natalitia martyrum is not to be
   understood as in the preceding canon, but the birthday feasts of
   princes.  This, as well as the preceding rule, was renewed in the sixth
   century by Bishop Martin of Bracara, now Braga, in Portugal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LIII.

   Christians, when they attend weddings, must not join in wanton dances,
   but modestly dine or breakfast, as is becoming to Christians.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LIII.

   It is unsuitable to dance or leap at weddings.

   Van Espen.

   This canon does not call for explanation but for reflexion, and greatly
   it is to be desired that it should be observed by Christians, and that
   through like improprieties, wedding-days, which should be days of holy
   joy and blessing, be not turned, even to the bride and groom
   themselves, into days of cursing.  Moreover the Synod of Trent
   admonishes bishops (Sess. xxiv., De Reform. Mat., cap. x.) to take care
   that at weddings there be only that which is modest and proper.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LIV.

   Members of the priesthood and of the clergy must not witness the plays
   at weddings or banquets; but, before the players enter, they must rise
   and depart.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LIV.

   Priests and clerics should leave before the play.

   Aristenus.

   Christians are admonished to feast modestly when they go to weddings
   and not to dance nor ballizein , that is to clap their hands and make a
   noise with them.  For this is unworthy of the Christian standing.  But
   consecrated persons must not see the play at weddings, but before the
   thymelici begin, they must go out.

   Compare with this Canons XXIV. and LI., of the Synod in Trullo.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars III., De Consecrat. Dist. v., can. xxxvij.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LV.

   Neither members of the priesthood nor of the clergy, nor yet laymen,
   may club together for drinking entertainments.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LV.

   Neither a layman nor a cleric shall celebrate a club feast.

   These meals, the expenses of which were defrayed by a number clubbing
   together and sharing the cost, were called "symbola" by Isidore, and by
   Melinus and Crabbe "comissalia," although the more ordinary form is
   "commensalia" or "comessalia."  Cf. Ducange Gloss., s.v. Commensalia
   and Confertum.

   This Canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XLIV., c. x. (Isidore's version), and c. xij., (Martin
   of Braga's version).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LVI.

   Presbyters may not enter and take their seats in the bema before the
   entrance of the Bishop:  but they must enter with the Bishop, unless he
   be at home sick, or absent.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LVI.

   A presbyter shall not enter the bema before the bishop, nor sit down.

   It is difficult to translate this canon without giving a false idea of
   its meaning.  It does not determine the order of dignity in an
   ecclesiastical procession, but something entirely different, viz., it
   provides that when the bishop enters the sanctuary he should not be
   alone and walk into a place already occupied, but that he should have
   with him, as a guard of honour, the clergy.  Whether these should walk
   before or after him would be a mere matter of local custom, the rule
   juniores priores did not universally prevail.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XCV., can. viij.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LVII.

   Bishops must not be appointed in villages or country districts, but
   visitors; and those who have been already appointed must do nothing
   without the consent of the bishop of the city.  Presbyters, in like
   manner, must do nothing without the consent of the bishop.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LVII.

   A bishop shall not be established in a village or in the country, but a
   periodeutes.  But should one be appointed he shall not perform any
   function without the bishop of the city.

   On the whole subject of Chorepiscopi see the Excursus to Canon VIII. of
   Nice, in this volume.

   Hefele.

   Compare the eighth and tenth canons of the Synod of Antioch of 341, the
   thirteenth of the Synod of Ancyra, and the second clause of the sixth
   canon of the Synod of Sardica.  The above canon orders that from
   henceforth, in the place of the rural bishops, priests of higher rank
   shall act as visitors of the country dioceses and country clergy.
   Dionysius Exiguus, Isidore, the Greek commentators, Van Espen, Remi
   Ceillier, Neander, and others thus interpret this canon; but Herbst, in
   the Tübingen Review, translates the word (periodeutai ) not visitors
   but physicians--physicians of the soul,--and for this he appeals to
   passages from the Fathers of the Church collected by Suicer in his
   Thesaurus.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. LXXX., c. v.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LVIII.

   The Oblation must not be made by bishops or presbyters in any private
   houses.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LVIII.

   Neither a bishop nor a presbyter shall make the offering in private
   houses.

   Van Espen.

   By "the oblation" here is intended the oblation of the unbloody
   sacrifice according to the mind of the Greek interpreters.  Zonaras
   says:  "The faithful can pray to God and be intent upon their prayers
   everywhere, whether in the house, in the field, or in any place they
   possess:  but to offer or perform the oblation must by no means be done
   except in a church and at an altar."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LIX.

   No psalms composed by private individuals nor any uncanonical books may
   be read in the church, but only the Canonical Books of the Old and New
   Testaments.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LIX.

   Psalms of private origin, or books uncanonical are not to be sung in
   temples; but the canonical writings of the old and new testaments.

   Hefele.

   Several heretics, for instance Bardesanes, Paul of Samosata, and
   Apollinaris--had composed psalms, i.e., Church hymns.  The Synod of
   Laodicea forbade the use of any composed by private individuals, namely
   all unauthorized Church hymns.  Lüft remarks that by this it was not
   intended to forbid the use of all but the Bible psalms and hymns, for
   it is known that even after this Synod many hymns composed by
   individual Christians, for instance, Prudentius, Clement, Ambrose, came
   into use in the Church.  Only those not sanctioned were to be banished.

   This idea was greatly exaggerated by some Gallicans in the seventeenth
   century who wished that all the Antiphons, etc., should be in the words
   of Holy Scripture.  A learned but somewhat distorted account of this
   whole matter will be found in the Institutions Liturgiques by Dom
   Prosper Guéranger, tome ij., and a shorter but more temperate account
   in Dr. Batiffol's Histoire du Bréviaire Romain, Chap. vj.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LX.

   [N. B.--This Canon is of most questionable genuineness.]

   These are all the books of Old Testament appointed to be read:  1,
   Genesis of the world; 2, The Exodus from Egypt; 3, Leviticus; 4,
   Numbers; 5, Deuteronomy; 6, Joshua, the son of Nun; 7, Judges, Ruth; 8,
   Esther; 9, Of the Kings, First and Second; 10, Of the Kings, Third and
   Fourth; 11, Chronicles, First and Second; 12, Esdras, First and Second;
   13, The Book of Psalms; 14, The Proverbs of Solomon; 15, Ecclesiastes;
   16, The Song of Songs; 17, Job; 18, The Twelve Prophets; 19, Isaiah;
   20, Jeremiah, and Baruch, the Lamentations, and the Epistle; 21,
   Ezekiel; 22, Daniel.

   And these are the books of the New Testament:  Four Gospels, according
   to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; The Acts of the Apostles; Seven
   Catholic Epistles, to wit, one of James, two of Peter, three of John,
   one of Jude; Fourteen Epistles of Paul, one to the Romans, two to the
   Corinthians, one to the Galatians, one to the Ephesians, one to the
   Philippians, one to the Colossians, two to the Thessalonians, one to
   the Hebrews, two to Timothy, one to Titus, and one to Philemon.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LX.

   But of the new, the four Gospels--of Matthew, of Mark, of Luke, of
   John; Acts; Seven Catholic epistles, viz. of James one, of Peter two,
   of John three, of Jude one; of Paul fourteen, viz.:  to the Romans one,
   to the Corinthians two, to the Galatians one, to the Ephesians one, to
   the Phillipians one, to the Colossians one, to the Thessalonians two,
   to the Hebrews one, to Timothy two, to Titus one, and to Philemon one.

   It will be noticed that while this canon has often been used for
   controversial purposes it really has little or no value in this
   connexion, for the absence of the Revelation of St. John from the New
   Testament to all orthodox Christians is, to say the least, as fatal to
   its reception as an ecumenical definition of the canon of Holy
   Scripture, as the absence of the book of Wisdom, etc., from the Old
   Testament is to its reception by those who accept the books of what we
   may call for convenience the Greek canon, as distinguished from the
   Hebrew, as canonical.

   We may therefore leave this question wholly out of account, and merely
   consider the matter from the evidence we possess.

   In 1777 Spittler published a special treatise [199] to shew that the
   list of scriptural books was no part of the original canon adopted by
   Laodicea.  Hefele gives the following resume of his argument: [200]

   (a)  That Dionysius Exiguus has not this canon in his translation of
   the Laodicean decrees.  It might, indeed, be said with Dallæus and Van
   Espen, that Dionysius omitted this list of the books of Scripture
   because in Rome, where he composed his work, another by Innocent I. was
   in general use.

   (b)  But, apart from the fact that Dionysius is always a most faithful
   translator, this sixtieth canon is also omitted by John of Antioch, one
   of the most esteemed and oldest Greek collectors of canons, who could
   have had no such reasons as Dionysius for his omission.

   (c)  Lastly, Bishop Martin of Braga in the sixth century, though he has
   the fifty-ninth, has also not included in his collection the sixtieth
   canon so nearly related to it, nor does the Isidorian translation
   appear at first to have had this canon. [201]   Herbst, in the Tübingen
   Review, also accedes to these arguments of Spittler's, as did Fuchs and
   others before him.  Mr. Ffoulkes in his article on the Council of
   Laodicea in Smith and Cheetham's Dictionary of Christian Antiquities at
   length attempts to refute all objections, and affirms the genuineness
   of the list, but his conclusions can hardly be accepted when the
   careful consideration and discussion of the matter by Bishop Westcott
   is kept in mind.  (History of the Canon of the New Testament, III^d.
   Period, chapter ii. [p. 428 of the 4th Edition.])

   Historical Introduction.

   In the whole history of the Church there is no council which bristles
   with such astonishing facts as the First Council of Constantinople.  It
   is one of the "undisputed General Councils," one of the four which St.
   Gregory said he revered as he did the four holy Gospels, and he would
   be rash indeed who denied its right to the position it has so long
   occupied; and yet

   1.  It was not intended to be an Ecumenical Synod at all.

   2.  It was a local gathering of only one hundred and fifty bishops.

   3.  It was not summoned by the Pope, nor was he invited to it.

   4.  No diocese of the West was present either by representation or in
   the person of its bishop; neither the see of Rome, nor any other see.

   5.  It was a council of Saints, Cardinal Orsi, the Roman Historian,
   says:  "Besides St. Gregory of Nyssa, and St. Peter of Sebaste, there
   were also at Constantinople on account of the Synod many other Bishops,
   remarkable either for the holiness of their life, or for their zeal for
   the faith, or for their learning, or for the eminence of their Sees, as
   St. Amphilochius of Iconium, Helladius of Cesarea in Cappadocia,
   Optimus of Antioch in Pisidia, Diodorus of Tarsus, St. Pelagius of
   Laodicea, St. Eulogius of Edessa, Acacius of Berea, Isidorus of Cyrus,
   St. Cyril of Jerusalem, Gelasius of Cesarea in Palestine, Vitus of
   Carres, Dionysius of Diospolis, Abram of Batnes, and Antiochus of
   Samosata, all three Confessors, Bosphorus of Colonia, and Otreius of
   Melitina, and various others whose names appear with honour in history.
    So that perhaps there has not been a council, in which has been found
   a greater number of Confessors and of Saints." [203]

   6.  It was presided over at first by St. Meletius, the bishop of
   Antioch who was bishop not in communion with Rome, [204] who died
   during its session and was styled a Saint in the panegyric delivered
   over him and who has since been canonized as a Saint of the Roman
   Church by the Pope.

   7.  Its second president was St. Gregory Nazianzen, who was at that
   time liable to censure for a breach of the canons which forbade his
   translation to Constantinople.

   8.  Its action in continuing the Meletian Schism was condemned at Rome,
   and its Canons rejected for a thousand years.

   9.  Its canons were not placed in their natural position after those of
   Nice in the codex which was used at the Council of Chalcedon, although
   this was an Eastern codex.

   10.  Its Creed was not read nor mentioned, so far as the acts record,
   at the Council of Ephesus, fifty years afterwards.

   11.  Its title to being (as it undoubtedly is) the Second of the
   Ecumenical Synods rests upon its Creed having found a reception in the
   whole world.  And now--mirabile dictu--an English scholar comes
   forward, ready to defend the proposition that the First Council of
   Constantinople never set forth any creed at all! [205]

   and St. Daniel the Stylite stricken from the Martyrology."  Cf. F. W.
   Puller, The Primitive Saints and See of Rome, pp. 174 and 238. Many
   attempts have been made to explain this fact away, but without
   success.  Not only was the president of the Council a persona non grata
   to the Pope, but the members of the Council were well aware of the
   fact, and much pleased that such was the case, and Hefele acknowledges
   that the reason the council determined to continue the Meletian Schism
   was because allowing Paulinus to succeed to Meletius would be "too
   great a concession to the Latins" (vol. III., p. 346).

   Scripture and tradition, II. On the Constantinopolitan Creed and other
   Eastern Creeds of the 4th Century.  It should be added that Dr. Hort
   acknowledges that, "we may well believe that they [i.e. the 150 fathers
   of Constantinople] had expressed approval" of the creed ordinarily
   attributed to them (p. 115).  The whole dissertation is a fine example
   of what Dr. Salmon so well called Dr. Hort's "perfervidum ingenium as
   an advocate," and of his "exaggeration of judgment."  (Salmon.
   Criticism of the Text of the New Testament, p. 12, also see p. 34.)
   Swainson, in his The Nicene and Apostles' Creeds, has all the material
   points found in Hort's Dissertation.  Harnack goes much further.  He is
   of opinion that the Creed of Constantinople (as we call it), the Creed
   which has been the symbol of orthodoxy for fifteen hundred years, is
   really a Semi-Arian, anti-Nicene, and quasi Macedonian confession!  The
   first contention he supports, not without a show of plausibility, by
   the fact that it omits the words (which were really most crucial) "that
   is to say of the substance of the Father."  In support of the second
   opinion he writes as follows:  "The words [with regard to the Holy
   Ghost] are in entire harmony with the form which the doctrine of the
   Holy Spirit had in the sixties.  A Pneumatochian could have subscribed
   this formula at a pinch; and just because of this it is certain that
   the Council of 381 did not accept this creed."  Some scholars arrive at
   "certainty" more easily than others, even Harnack himself only attains
   this "certainty" in the foot-note!  The reader will remark that what
   Harnack is "certain "of in the foot-note is that the Council "did not
   accept" this creed, not that it "did not frame" it, which is entirely a
   different question.  (Adolf Harnack, History of Dogma, [Eng. Trans.],
   Vol. iv., p. 99.)

   The Holy Creed Which the 150 Holy Fathers Set Forth, Which is Consonant
   with the Holy and Great Synod of Nice [206] .

   (Found in all the Collections in the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon.)

   Introductory Note.

   The reader should know that Tillemont (Mémoires, t. ix., art. 78 in the
   treatise on St. Greg. Naz.) broached the theory that the Creed adopted
   at Constantinople was not a new expansion of the Nicene but rather the
   adoption of a Creed already in use.  Hefele is of the same opinion
   (Hist. of the Councils, II., p. 349), and the learned Professor of
   Divinity in the University of Jena, Dr. Lipsius, says, of St.
   Epiphanius:  "Though not himself present at the Ecumenical Council of
   Constantinople, a.d. 381, which ensured the triumph of the Nicene
   doctrine in the Oriental Churches, his shorter confession of faith,
   which is found at the end of his Ancoratus, and seems to have been the
   baptismal creed of the Church of Salamis, agrees almost word for word
   with the Constantinopolitan formula."  (Smith and Wace, Dict. Chr.
   Biog., s.v. Epiphanius).  "The Ancoratus," St. Epiphanius distinctly
   tells us, was written as early as a.d. 374, and toward the end of
   chapter cxix., he writes as follows.  "The children of the Church have
   received from the holy fathers, that is from the holy Apostles, the
   faith to keep, and to hand down, and to teach their children.  To these
   children you belong, and I beg you to receive it and pass it on.  And
   whilst you teach your children these things and such as these from the
   holy Scriptures, cease not to confirm and strengthen them, and indeed
   all who hear you:  tell them that this is the holy faith of the Holy
   Catholic Church, as the one holy Virgin of God received it from the
   holy Apostles of the Lord to keep:  and thus every person who is in
   preparation for the holy laver of baptism must learn it:  they must
   learn it themselves, and teach it expressly, as the one Mother of all,
   of you and of us, proclaims it, saying."  Then follows the Creed as on
   page 164.

   We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth
   and of all things visible and invisible.  And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
   the only begotten Son of God, begotten of his Father before all worlds,
   Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made, being of one
   substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.  Who for us
   men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by
   the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified
   also for us under Pontius Pilate.  He suffered and was buried, and the
   third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into
   heaven, and sitteth at the Right Hand of the Father.  And he shall come
   again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead.  Whose kingdom
   shall have no end.  (I)

   And [we believe] in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver-of-Life, who
   proceedeth from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is
   worshipped and glorified, who spake by the prophets.  And [we believe]
   in one, holy, (II) Catholic and Apostolic Church.  We acknowledge one
   Baptism for the remission of sins, [and] we look for the resurrection
   of the dead and the life of the world to come.  Amen.

   Note I.

   This clause had already, so far as the meaning is concerned, been added
   to the Nicene Creed, years before, in correction of the heresy of
   Marcellus of Ancyra, of whose heresy a statement will be found in the
   notes on Canon I. of this Council.  One of the creeds of the Council of
   Antioch in Encæniis (a.d. 341) reads:  "and he sitteth at the right
   hand of the Father, and he shall come again to judge both the quick and
   the dead, and he remaineth God and King to all eternity." [207]

   Note II.

   The word "Holy" is omitted in some texts of this Creed, notably in the
   Latin version in the collection of Isidore Mercator.  Vide Labbe,
   Conc., II., 960.  Cf. Creed in English Prayer-Book.

   Notes.

   The Creed Found in Epiphanius's Ancoratus (Cap. cxx.) [208]

   We believe in one God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth,
   and of all things visible and invisible:  and in one Lord Jesus Christ,
   the only begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds,
   that is of the substance of the Father, Light of Light, very God of
   very God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father:  by whom
   all things were made, both in heaven and earth:  who for us men and for
   our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy
   Ghost and the Virgin Mary, and was made man, was crucified also for us
   under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried, and on the third
   day he rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into
   heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father, and from thence he
   shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead, whose
   kingdom shall have no end.  And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver
   of life, who proceedeth from the Father; who, with the Father and the
   Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the prophets:
   in one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  We acknowledge one baptism
   for the remission of sins; we look for the resurrection of the dead,
   and the life of the world to come.  And those who say that there was a
   time when the Son of God was not, and before he was begotten he was
   not, or that he was of things which are not, or that he is of a
   different hypostasis or substance, or pretend that he is effluent or
   changeable, these the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes.

   Epiphanius thus continues:

   "And this faith was delivered from the Holy Apostles and in the Church,
   the Holy City, from all the Holy Bishops together more than three
   hundred and ten in number."

   "In our generation, that is in the times of Valentinus and Valens, and
   the ninetieth year from the succession of Diocletian the tyrant, [209]
   you and we and all the orthodox bishops of the whole Catholic Church
   together, make this address to those who come to baptism, in order that
   they may proclaim and say as follows:"

   Epiphanius then gives this creed:

   We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things,
   invisible and visible.  And in one Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God,
   begotten of God the Father, only begotten, that is of the substance of
   the Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten
   not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things
   were made, both which be in heaven and in earth, whether they be
   visible or invisible.  Who for us men and for our salvation came down,
   and was incarnate, that is to say was conceived perfectly through the
   Holy Ghost of the holy ever-virgin Mary, and was made man, that is to
   say a perfect man, receiving a soul, and body, and intellect, and all
   that make up a man, but without sin, not from human seed, nor [that he
   dwelt] in a man, but taking flesh to himself into one holy entity; not
   as he inspired the prophets and spake and worked [in them], but was
   perfectly made man, for the Word was made flesh; neither did he
   experience any change, nor did he convert his divine nature into the
   nature of man, but united it to his one holy perfection and Divinity.

   For there is one Lord Jesus Christ, not two, the same is God, the same
   is Lord, the same is King.  He suffered in the flesh, and rose again,
   and ascended into heaven in the same body, and with glory he sat down
   at the right hand of the Father, and in the same body he will come in
   glory to judge both the quick and the dead, and of his kingdom there
   shall be no end.

   And we believe in the Holy Ghost, who spake in the Law, and preached in
   the Prophets, and descended at Jordan, and spake in the Apostles, and
   indwells the Saints.  And thus we believe in him, that he is the Holy
   Spirit, the Spirit of God, the perfect Spirit, the Spirit the
   Comforter, uncreate, who proceedeth from the Father, receiving of the
   Son (ek tou Patros ekporeuomenon, kai ek tou Huiou lambanomenon), and
   believed on.  (kai pisteuomenon, which the Latin version gives in quem
   credimus; and proceeds to insert, Præterea credimus in unam, etc.  It
   certainly looks as if it had read pisteuomen, and had belonged to the
   following phrase.)

   [We believe] in one Catholic and Apostolic Church.  And in one baptism
   of penitence, and in the resurrection of the dead, and the just
   judgment of souls and bodies, and in the Kingdom of heaven and in life
   everlasting.

   And those who say that there was a time when the Son was not, or when
   the Holy Ghost was not, or that either was made of that which
   previously had no being, or that he is of a different nature or
   substance, and affirm that the Son of God and the Holy Spirit are
   subject to change and mutation; all such the Catholic and Apostolic
   Church, the mother both of you and of us, anathematizes.  And further
   we anathematize such as do not confess the resurrection of the dead, as
   well as all heresies which are not in accord with the true faith.

   Finally, you and your children thus believing and keeping the
   commandments of this same faith, we trust that you will always pray for
   us, that we may have a share and lot in that same faith and in the
   keeping of these same commandments.  For us make your intercessions,
   you and all who believe thus, and keep the commandments of the Lord in
   our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with whom, glory be to the
   Father with the Holy Spirit for ever and ever.  Amen.

   Historical Excursus on the Introduction into the Creed of the Words
   "and the Son."

   The introduction into the Nicene Creed of the words "and the Son"
   (Filioque) has given rise to, or has been the pretext for, such bitter
   reviling between East and West (during which many statements
   unsupported by fact have become more or less commonly believed) that I
   think it well in this place to set forth as dispassionately as possible
   the real facts of the case.  I shall briefly then give the proof of the
   following propositions:

   1.  That no pretence is made by the West that the words in dispute
   formed part of the original creed as adopted at Constantinople, or that
   they now form part of that Creed.

   2.  That so far from the insertion being made by the Pope, it was made
   in direct opposition to his wishes and command.

   3.  That it never was intended by the words to assert that there were
   two 'Archai in the Trinity, nor in any respect on this point to differ
   from the teaching of the East.

   4.  That it is quite possible that the words were not an intentional
   insertion at all.

   5.  And finally that the doctrine of the East as set forth by St. John
   Damascene is now and always has been the doctrine of the West on the
   procession of the Holy Spirit, however much through
   ecclesiastico-political contingencies this fact may have become
   obscured.

   With the truth or falsity of the doctrine set forth by the Western
   addition to the creed this work has no concern, nor even am I called
   upon to treat the historical question as to when and where the
   expression "and the Son" was first used.  For a temperate and eminently
   scholarly treatment of this point from a Western point of view, I would
   refer the reader to Professor Swete's On the History of the Doctrine of
   the Procession of the Holy Spirit.  In J. M. Neale's History of the
   Holy Eastern Church will be found a statement from the opposite point
   of view.  The great treatises of past years I need not mention here,
   but may be allowed to enter a warning to the reader, that they were
   often written in the period of hot controversy, and make more for
   strife than for peace, magnifying rather than lessening differences
   both of thought and expression.

   Perhaps, too, I may be allowed here to remind the readers that it has
   been said that while "ex Patre Filioque procedens" in Latin does not
   necessitate a double source of the Holy Spirit, the expression
   ekporeuomenon ek tou patros kai ek tou Huiou does.  On such a point I
   am not fit to give an opinion, but St. John Damascene does not use this
   expression.

   1.  That no pretence is made by the West that the words in dispute ever
   formed part of the creed as adopted at Constantinople is evidently
   proved by the patent fact that it is printed without those words in all
   our Concilias and in all our histories.  It is true that at the Council
   of Florence it was asserted that the words were found in a copy of the
   Acts of the Seventh Ecumenical which they had, but no stress was even
   at that eminently Western council laid upon the point, which even if it
   had been the case would have shewn nothing with regard to the true
   reading of the Creed as adopted by the Second Synod. [210]   On this
   point there never was nor can be any doubt.

   2.  The addition was not made at the will and at the bidding of the
   Pope.  It has frequently been said that it was a proof of the
   insufferable arrogancy of the See of Rome that it dared to tamper with
   the creed set forth by the authority of an Ecumenical Synod and which
   had been received by the world.  Now so far from the history of this
   addition to the creed being a ground of pride and complacency to the
   advocates of the Papal claims, it is a most marked instance of the
   weakness of the papal power even in the West.

   "Baronius," says Dr. Pusey, "endeavours in vain to find any Pope, to
   whom the formal addition' may be ascribed, and rests at last on a
   statement of a writer towards the end of the 12th century, writing
   against the Greeks.  If the Council of Constantinople added to the
   Nicene Creed, in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, and Giver of life,' and the
   Council of Chalcedon to that of Constantinople, perfect in Divinity and
   perfect in Humanity, consubstantial with the Father as touching his
   Godhead, consubstantial with us as touching his manhood,' and some
   other things as aforesaid, the Bishop of the elder Rome ought not to be
   calumniated, because for explanation, he added one word [that the Holy
   Spirit proceeds from the Son] having the consent of very many bishops
   and most learned Cardinals.'  For the truth of which,' says Le Quien,
   be the author responsible!'  It seems to me inconceivable, that all
   account of any such proceeding, if it ever took place, should have been
   lost." [211]

   We may then dismiss this point and briefly review the history of the
   matter.

   There seems little doubt that the words were first inserted in Spain.
   As early as the year 400 it had been found necessary at a Council of
   Toledo to affirm the double procession against the Priscillianists,
   [212] and in 589 by the authority of the Third Council of Toledo the
   newly converted Goths were required to sign the creed with the
   addition. [213]   From this time it became for Spain the accepted form,
   and was so recited at the Eighth Council of Toledo in 653, and again in
   681 at the Twelfth Council of Toledo. [214]

   But this was at first only true of Spain, and at Rome nothing of the
   kind was known.  In the Gelasian Sacramentary the Creed is found in its
   original form. [215]   The same is the case with the old Gallican
   Sacramentary of the vii^th or viii^th century. [216]

   However, there can be no doubt that its introduction spread very
   rapidly through the West and that before long it was received
   practically everywhere except at Rome.

   In 809 a council was held at Aix-la-Chapelle by Charlemagne, and from
   it three divines were sent to confer with the Pope, Leo III, upon the
   subject.  The Pope opposed the insertion of the Filioque on the express
   ground that the General Councils had forbidden any addition to be made
   to their formulary. [217]   Later on, the Frankish Emperor asked his
   bishops what was "the meaning of the Creed according to the Latins,"
   [218] and Fleury gives the result of the investigations to have been,
   "In France they continued to chant the creed with the word Filioque,
   and at Rome they continued not to chant it." [219]

   So firmly resolved was the Pope that the clause should not be
   introduced into the creed that he presented two silver shields to the
   Confessio in St. Peter's at Rome, on one of which was engraved the
   creed in Latin and on the other in Greek, without the addition.  This
   act the Greeks never forgot during the controversy.  Photius refers to
   it in writing to the Patriarch of Acquileia.  About two centuries later
   St. Peter Damian [220] mentions them as still in place; and about two
   centuries later on, Veccur, Patriarch of Constantinople, declares they
   hung there still. [221]

   It was not till 1014 that for the first time the interpolated creed was
   used at mass with the sanction of the Pope.  In that year Benedict
   VIII. acceded to the urgent request of Henry II. of Germany and so the
   papal authority was forced to yield, and the silver shields have
   disappeared from St. Peter's.

   3.  Nothing could be clearer than that the theologians of the West
   never had any idea of teaching a double source of the Godhead.  The
   doctrine of the Divine Monarchy was always intended to be preserved,
   and while in the heat of the controversy sometimes expressions highly
   dangerous, or at least clearly inaccurate, may have been used, yet the
   intention must be judged from the prevailing teaching of the approved
   theologians.  And what this was is evident from the definition of the
   Council of Florence, which, while indeed it was not received by the
   Eastern Church, and therefore cannot be accepted as an authoritative
   exposition of its views, yet certainly must be regarded as a true and
   full expression of the teaching of the West.  "The Greeks asserted that
   when they say the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father, they do not use
   it because they wish to exclude the Son; but because it seemed to them,
   as they say, that the Latins assert the Holy Spirit to proceed from the
   Father and the Son, as from two principles and by two spirations, and
   therefore they abstain from saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from
   the Father and the Son.  But the Latins affirm that they have no
   intention when they say the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the
   Son to deprive the Father of his prerogative of being the fountain and
   principle of the entire Godhead, viz. of the Son and of the Holy Ghost;
   nor do they deny that the very procession of the Holy Ghost from the
   Son, the Son derives from the Father; nor do they teach two principles
   or two spirations; but they assert that there is one only principle,
   one only spiration, as they have always asserted up to this time."

   4.  It is quite possible that when these words were first used there
   was no knowledge on the part of those using them that there had been
   made any addition to the Creed.  As I have already pointed out, the
   year 589 is the earliest date at which we find the words actually
   introduced into the Creed.  Now there can be no doubt whatever that the
   Council of Toledo of that year had no suspicion that the creed as they
   had it was not the creed exactly as adopted at Constantinople.  This is
   capable of the most ample proof.

   In the first place they declared, "Whosoever believes that there is any
   other Catholic faith and communion, besides that of the Universal
   Church, that Church which holds and honours the decrees of the Councils
   of Nice, Constantinople, I. Ephesus, and Chalcedon, let him be
   anathema."  After some further anathemas in the same sense they repeat
   "the creed published at the council of Nice," and next, "The holy faith
   which the 150 fathers of the Council of Constantinople explained,
   consonant with the great Council of Nice."  And then lastly, "The holy
   faith which the translators of the council of Chalcedon explained."
   The creed of Constantinople as recited contained the words "and from
   the Son."  Now the fathers at Toledo were not ignorant of the decree of
   Ephesus forbidding the making of "another faith" (heteran pistin) for
   they themselves cite it, as follows from the acts of Chalcedon; "The
   holy and universal Synod forbids to bring forward any other faith; or
   to write or believe or to teach other, or be otherwise minded.  But
   whoso shall dare either to expound or produce or deliver any other
   faith to those who wish to be converted etc."  Upon this Dr. Pusey well
   remarks, [222] "It is, of course, impossible to suppose that they can
   have believed any addition to the creed to have been forbidden by the
   clause, and, accepting it with its anathema, themselves to have added
   to the creed of Constantinople."

   But while this is the case it might be that they understood heteran of
   the Ephesine decree to forbid the making of contradictory and new
   creeds and not explanatory additions to the existing one.  Of this
   interpretation of the decree, which would seem without any doubt to be
   the only tenable one, I shall treat in its proper place.

   We have however further proof that the Council of Toledo thought they
   were using the unaltered creed of Constantinople.  In these acts we
   find they adopted the following; "for reverence of the most holy faith
   and for the strengthening of the weak minds of men, the holy Synod
   enacts, with the advice of our most pious and most glorious Lord, King
   Recarede, that through all the churches of Spain and Gallæcia, the
   symbol of faith of the council of Constantinople, i.e. of the 150
   bishops, should be recited according to the form of the Eastern Church,
   etc."

   This seems to make the matter clear and the next question which arises
   is, How the words could have got into the Spanish creed?  I venture to
   suggest a possible explanation.  Epiphanius tells us that in the year
   374 "all the orthodox bishops of the whole Catholic Church together
   make this address to those who come to baptism, in order that they may
   proclaim and say as follows." [223]   If this is to be understood
   literally of course Spain was included.  Now the creed thus taught the
   catechumens reads as follows at the point about which our interest
   centres:

   Kai eis to hagion pneuma pisteuomen,...ek tou patros ekporeuomenon kai
   ek tou Huiou lambanomenon kai pisteuomenon, eis mian katholiken k.t.l.
   Now it looks to me as if the text had got corrupted and that there
   should be a full stop after lambanomenon, and that pisteuomenon should
   be pisteuomen.  These emendations are not necessary however for my
   suggestion although they would make it more perfect, for in that case
   by the single omission of the word lambanomenon the Western form is
   obtained.  It will be noticed that this was some years before the
   Constantinopolitan Council and therefore nothing would be more natural
   than that a scribe accustomed to writing the old baptismal creed and
   now given the Constantinopolitan creed, so similar to it, to copy,
   should have gone on and added the kai ek tou Huiou, according to habit.

   However this is a mere suggestion, I think I have shewn that there is
   strong reason to believe that whatever the explanation may be, the
   Spanish Church was unaware that it had added to or changed the
   Constantinopolitan creed.

   5.  There remains now only the last point, which is the most important
   of all, but which does not belong to the subject matter of this volume
   and which therefore I shall treat with the greatest brevity.  The
   writings of St. John Damascene are certainly deemed entirely orthodox
   by the Easterns and always have been.  On the other hand their entire
   orthodoxy has never been disputed in the West, but a citation from
   Damascene is considered by St. Thomas as conclusive.  Under these
   circumstances it seems hard to resist the conclusion that the faith of
   the East and the West, so far as its official setting forth is
   concerned, is the same and always has been.  And perhaps no better
   proof of the Western acceptance of the Eastern doctrine concerning the
   eternal procession of the Holy Spirit can be found than the fact that
   St. John Damascene has been in recent years raised by the pope for his
   followers to the rank of a Doctor of the Catholic Church.

   Perhaps I may be allowed to close with two moderate statements of the
   Western position, the one by the learned and pious Dr. Pusey and the
   other by the none less famous Bishop Pearson.

   Dr. Pusey says:

   "Since, however, the clause, which found its way into the Creed, was,
   in the first instance, admitted, as being supposed to be part of the
   Constantinopolitan Creed, and, since after it had been rooted for 200
   years, it was not uprooted, for fear of uprooting also or perplexing
   the faith of the people, there was no fault either in its first
   reception or in its subsequent retention."

   "The Greeks would condemn forefathers of their own, if they were to
   pronounce the clause to be heretical.  For it would be against the
   principles of the Church to be in communion with an heretical body.
   But from the deposition of Photius, a.d. 886 to at least a.d. 1009,
   East and West retained their own expression of faith without schism.
   [224] "

   "a.d. 1077, Theophylact did not object to the West, retaining for
   itself the confession of faith contained in the words, but only
   excepted against the insertion of the words in the Creed. [225] "

   And Bp. Pearson, explaining Article VIII. of the Creed says:  "Now
   although the addition of words to the formal Creed without the consent,
   and against the protestations of the Oriental Church be not
   justifiable; yet that which was added is nevertheless a certain truth,
   and may be so used in that Creed by them who believe the same to be a
   truth; so long as they pretend it not to be a definition of that
   Council, but an addition or explication inserted, and condemn not those
   who, out of a greater respect to such synodical determinations, will
   admit of no such insertions, nor speak any other language than the
   Scriptures and their Fathers spoke."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [210] In fact the contention of the Latins was that the words were
   inserted by II. Nice!  To this the Easterns answered most pertinently
   "Why did you not tell us this long ago?"  They were not so fortunate
   when they insisted that St. Thomas would have quoted it, for some
   scholars have thought St. Thomas but ill acquainted with the
   proceedings at the Seventh Synod.  Vide Hefele, Concil. XLVIII., § 810.

   Historical Note on the Lost "Tome" of the Second Council.

   We know from the Synodical letter sent by the bishops who assembled at
   Constantinople in a.d. 382 (the next year after the Second Ecumenical
   Council) sent to Pope Damasus and other Western bishops, that the
   Second Council set forth a "Tome," containing a statement of the
   doctrinal points at issue.  This letter will be found in full at the
   end of the treatment of this council.  The Council of Chalcedon in its
   address to the Emperor says:  "The bishops who at Constantinople
   detected the taint of Apollinarianism, communicated to the Westerns
   their decision in the matter."  From this we may reasonably conclude,
   with Tillemont, [226] that the lost Tome treated also of the
   Apollinarian heresy.  It is moreover by no means unlikely that the
   Creed as it has come down to us, was the summary at the end of the
   Tome, and was followed by the anathemas which now form our Canon I.  It
   also is likely that the very accurate doctrinal statements contained in
   the Letter of the Synod of 382 may be taken almost, if not quite,
   verbatim from this Tome.  It seems perfectly evident that at least one
   copy of the Tome was sent to the West but how it got lost is a matter
   on which at present we are entirely in the dark.

   Letter of the Same Holy Synod to the Most Pious Emperor Theodosius the
   Great, to Which are Appended the Canons Enacted by Them.

   (Found in Labbe, Concilia, Tom. II., 945.)

   To the most religious Emperor Theodosius, the Holy Synod of Bishops
   assembled in Constantinople out of different Provinces.

   We begin our letter to your Piety with thanks to God, who has
   established the empire of your Piety for the common peace of the
   Churches and for the support of the true Faith.  And, after rendering
   due thanks unto God, as in duty bound we lay before your Piety the
   things which have been done in the Holy Synod.  When, then, we had
   assembled in Constantinople, according to the letter of your Piety, we
   first of all renewed our unity of heart each with the other, and then
   we pronounced some concise definitions, ratifying the Faith of the
   Nicene Fathers, and anathematizing the heresies which have sprung up,
   contrary thereto.  Besides these things, we also framed certain Canons
   for the better ordering of the Churches, all which we have subjoined to
   this our letter.  Wherefore we beseech your Piety that the decree of
   the Synod may be ratified, to the end that, as you have honoured the
   Church by your letter of citation, so you should set your seal to the
   conclusion of what has been decreed.  May the Lord establish your
   empire in peace and righteousness, and prolong it from generation to
   generation; and may he add unto your earthly power the fruition of the
   heavenly kingdom also.  May God by the prayers (euchais ton hagion) of
   the Saints, [227] show favour to the world, that you may be strong and
   eminent in all good things as an Emperor most truly pious and beloved
   of God.

   the less hesitation in referring to my own work as it is, so far as I
   can discover, the only book in the English language devoted to an
   historical and theological consideration of the subject.  Of course the
   subject is treated of cursorily in numerous theological treatises and
   dictionaries.

   Introduction on the Number of the Canons.

   (Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. II., p. 351.)

   The number of canons drawn up by this synod is doubtful.  The old Greek
   codices and the Greek commentators of the Middle Ages, Zonaras and
   Balsamon, enumerate seven; the old Latin translations--viz. the Prisca,
   those by Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore, as well as the Codex of
   Luna--only recognize the first four canons of the Greek text, and the
   fact that they agree in this point is the more important as they are
   wholly independent of each other, and divide and arrange those canons
   of Constantinople which they do acknowledge quite differently.

   Because, however, in the Prisca the canons of Constantinople are only
   placed after those of the fourth General Council, the Ballerini
   brothers conclude that they were not contained at all in the oldest
   Greek collections of canons, and were inserted after the Council of
   Chalcedon.  But it was at this very Council of Chalcedon that the first
   three canons of Constantinople were read out word for word.  As
   however, they were not separately numbered, but were there read under
   the general title of Synodicon Synodi Secundæ, Fuchs concluded they
   were not originally in the form in which we now possess them, but,
   without being divided into numbers, formed a larger and unbroken
   decree, the contents of which were divided by later copyists and
   translators into several different canons.  And hence the very
   different divisions of these canons in the Prisca, Dionysius, and
   Isidore may be explained.  The fact, however, that the old Latin
   translations all agree in only giving the first four canons of the
   Greek text, seems to show that the oldest Greek manuscripts, from which
   those translations were made, did not contain the fifth, sixth, and
   seventh, and that these last did not properly belong to this Synod, but
   were later additions.  To this must be added that the old Greek
   Church-historians, in speaking of the affairs of the second General
   Council, only mention those points which are contained in the first
   four canons, and say nothing of what, according to the fifth, sixth,
   and seventh canons, had also been decided at Constantinople.  At the
   very least, the seventh canon cannot have emanated from this Council,
   since in the sixth century John Scholasticus did not receive it into
   his collection, although he adopted the fifth and sixth.  It is also
   missing in many other collections; and in treating specially of this
   canon further on, we shall endeavour to show the time and manner of its
   origin.  But the fifth and sixth canons probably belong to the Synod of
   Constantinople of the following year, as Beveridge, the Ballerini, and
   others conjectured.  The Greek scholiasts, Zonaras and Balsamon, and
   later on Tillemont, Beveridge, Van Espen and Herbst, have given more or
   less detailed commentaries on all these canons.

   Canons of the One Hundred and Fifty Fathers who assembled at
   Constantinople during the Consulate of those Illustrious Men, Flavius
   Eucherius and Flavius Evagrius on the VII of the Ides of July. [228]

   The Bishops out of different provinces assembled by the grace of God in
   Constantinople, on the summons of the most religious Emperor
   Theodosius, have decreed as follows:

   Canon I.

   The Faith of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Fathers assembled at Nice
   in Bithynia shall not be set aside, but shall remain firm.  And every
   heresy shall be anathematized, particularly that of the Eunomians or
   [Anomæans, the Arians or] Eudoxians, and that of the Semi-Arians or
   Pneumatomachi, and that of the Sabellians, and that of the Marcellians,
   and that of the Photinians, and that of the Apollinarians.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   Let the Nicene faith stand firm.  Anathema to heresy.

   There is a difference of reading in the list of the heretics.  The
   reading I have followed in the text is that given in Beveridge's
   Synodicon.  The Greek text, however, in Labbe, and with it agree the
   version of Hervetus and the text of Hefele, reads:  "the Eunomians or
   Anomæans, the Arians or Eudoxians, the Semi-Arians or Pneumatomachi,
   the Sabellians, Marcellians, Photinians and Apollinarians."  From this
   Dionysius only varies by substituting "Macedonians" for "Semi-Arians."
   It would seem that this was the correct reading.  I, however, have
   followed the other as being the more usual.

   Hefele.

   By the Eudoxians, whom this canon identifies with the Arians [according
   to his text, vide supra,] is meant that faction who, in
   contradistinction to the strict Arians or Anomæans on one side, and the
   Semi-Arians on the other side, followed the leadership of the Court
   Bishop Eudoxius (Bishop of Constantinople under the Emperor Valens),
   and without being entirely Anomæan, yet very decidedly inclined to the
   left of the Arian party--probably claiming to represent the old and
   original Arianism.  But this canon makes the Semi-Arians identical with
   the Pneumatomachians, and so far rightly, that the latter sprang from
   the Semi-Arian party, and applied the Arian principle to their doctrine
   of the Holy Ghost.  Lastly, by the Marcellians are meant those pupils
   of Marcellus of Ancyra who remained in the errors formerly propounded
   by him, while afterwards others, and indeed he himself, once more
   acknowledged the truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [228] Such is the caption in the old Greek codices.  The vij^th of the
   Ides is July 9th.  "From this (says Hefele) we may conclude that this
   synod which according to Socrates, H. E., v. 8) begun May 381, lasted
   until July of that year."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Excursus on the Heresies Condemned in Canon I.

   In treating of these heresies I shall invert the order of the canon,
   and shall speak of the Macedonian and Apollinarian heresies first, as
   being most nearly connected with the object for which the
   Constantinopolitan Synod was assembled.

   The Semi-Arians, Macedonians or Pneumatomachi.

   Peace indeed seemed to have been secured by the Nicene decision but
   there was an element of discord still extant, and so shortly afterwards
   as in 359 the double-synod of Rimini (Ariminum) and Selencia rejected
   the expressions homousion and homoeusion equally, and Jerome gave birth
   to his famous phrase, "the world awoke to find itself Arian."  The
   cause of this was the weight attaching to the Semi-Arian party, which
   counted among its numbers men of note and holiness, such as St. Cyril
   of Jerusalem.  Of the developments of this party it seems right that
   some mention should be made in this place, since it brought forth the
   Macedonian heresy.

   (Wm. Bright, D.D., St. Leo on the Incarnation, pp. 213 et seqq.)

   The Semi-Arian party in the fourth century attempted to steer a middle
   course between calling the Son Consubstantial and calling him a
   creature.  Their position, indeed, was untenable, but several persisted
   in clinging to it; and it was adopted by Macedonius, who occupied the
   see of Constantinople.  It was through their adoption of a more
   reverential language about the Son than had been used by the old
   Arians, that what is called the Macedonian heresy showed itself.
   Arianism had spoken both of the Son and the Holy Spirit as creatures.
   The Macedonians, rising up out of Semi-Arianism, gradually reached the
   Church's belief as to the uncreated majesty of the Son, even if they
   retained their objection to the homoousion as a formula.  But having,
   in their previously Semi-Arian position, refused to extend their own
   "homoiousion" to the Holy Spirit, they afterwards persisted in
   regarding him as "external to the one indivisible Godhead," Newman's
   Arians, p. 226; or as Tillemont says (Mém. vi., 527), "the denial of
   the divinity of the Holy Spirit was at last their capital or only
   error."  St. Athanasius, while an exile under Constantius for the
   second time, "heard with pain," as he says (Ep. i. ad Serap., 1) that
   "some who had left the Arians from disgust at their blasphemy against
   the Son of God, yet called the Spirit a creature, and one of the
   ministering spirits, differing only in degree from the Angels:"  and
   soon afterwards, in 362, the Council of Alexandria condemned the notion
   that the Spirit was a creature, as being "no true avoidance of the
   detestable Arian heresy."  See "Later Treatises of St. Athanasius," p.
   5.  Athanasius insisted that the Nicene Fathers, although silent on the
   nature of the Holy Spirit, had by implication ranked him with the
   Father and the Son as an object of belief (ad Afros, 11).  After the
   death of St. Athanasius, the new heresy was rejected on behalf of the
   West by Pope Damasus, who declared the Spirit to be truly and properly
   from the Father (as the Son from the Divine substance) and very God,
   "omnia posse et omnia nosse, et ubique esse," coequal and adorable
   (Mansi, iii., 483).  The Illyrian bishops also, in 374, wrote to the
   bishops of Asia Minor, affirming the consubstantiality of the Three
   Divine Persons (Theodoret, H. E., iv., 9).  St. Basil wrote his De
   Spiritu Sancto in the same sense (see Swete, Early History of the
   Doctrine of the Holy Spirit, pp. 58, 67), and in order to vindicate
   this truth against the Pneumatomachi, as the Macedonians were called by
   the Catholics, the Constantinopolitan recension of the Nicene Creed
   added the words, "the Lord and the Life-giver, proceeding from the
   Father, with the Father and the Son worshipped and glorified" etc.,
   which had already formed part of local Creeds in the East.

   From the foregoing by Canon Bright, the reader will be able to
   understand the connexion between the Semi-Arians and Pneumatomachi, as
   well as to see how the undestroyed heretical germs of the Semi-Asian
   heresy necessitated by their development the condemnation of a second
   synod.

   The Apollinarians.

   (Philip Schaff, in Smith and Wace, Dict. Christ. Biog., s.v.
   Apollinaris.)

   Apollinaris was the first to apply the results of the Nicene
   controversy to Christology proper, and to call the attention of the
   Church to the psychical and pneumatic element in the humanity of
   Christ; but in his zeal for the true deity of Christ, and fear of a
   double personality, he fell into the error of a partial denial of his
   true humanity.  Adopting the psychological trichotomy of Plato (soma
   psuche, pneuma), for which he quoted 1. Thess. v. 23 and Gal. v. 17, he
   attributed to Christ a human body (soma) and a human soul (the psuche
   alogos, the anima animans which man has in common with the animal), but
   not a rational spirit (nous, pneuma, psuche logike, anima rationalis,)
   and put in the place of the latter the divine Logos.  In opposition to
   the idea of a mere connection of the Logos with the man Jesus, he
   wished to secure an organic unity of the two, and so a true
   incarnation; but he sought this at the expense of the most important
   constituent of man.  He reached only a Theos sarkophoros as
   Nestorianism only an anthropos theophoros instead of the proper
   theandrotos .  He appealed to the fact that the Scripture says, "the
   Word was made flesh"--not spirit; "God was manifest in the flesh" etc.
   To which Gregory Nazianzen justly replied that in these passages the
   term sarx was used by synecdoche for the whole human nature.  In this
   way Apollinaris established so close a connection of the Logos with
   human flesh, that all the divine attributes were transferred to the
   human nature, and all the human attributes to the divine, and the two
   merged in one nature in Christ.  Hence he could speak of a crucifixion
   of the Logos, and a worship of his flesh.  He made Christ a middle
   being between God and man, in whom, as it were, one part divine and two
   parts human were fused in the unity of a new nature.  He even ventured
   to adduce created analogies, such as the mule, midway between the horse
   and the ass; the grey colour, a mixture of white and black; and spring,
   in distinction from winter and summer.  Christ, said he, is neither
   whole man, nor God, but a mixture (mixis) of God and man.  On the other
   hand, he regarded the orthodox view of a union of full humanity with a
   full divinity in one person--of two wholes in one whole--as an
   absurdity.  He called the result of this construction anthropotheos , a
   sort of monstrosity, which he put in the same category with the
   mythological figure of the Minotaur.  But the Apollinarian idea of the
   union of the Logos with a truncated human nature might be itself more
   justly compared with this monster.  Starting from the Nicene homoousion
   as to the Logos, but denying the completeness of Christ's humanity, he
   met Arianism half-way, which likewise put the divine Logos in the place
   of the human spirit in Christ.  But he strongly asserted his
   unchangeableness, while Arians taught his changeableness (treptotes).

   The faith of the Church revolted against such a mutilated and stunted
   humanity of Christ which necessarily involved also a merely partial
   redemption.  The incarnation is an assumption of the entire human
   nature, sin only excluded.  The ensarkosis is enanthropesis.  To be a
   full and complete Redeemer, Christ must be a perfect man (teleios
   anthropos).  The spirit or rational soul is the most important element
   in man, his crowning glory, the seat of intelligence and freedom, and
   needs redemption as well as the soul and the body; for sin has entered
   and corrupted all the faculties.

   In the sentence immediately preceding the above Dr. Scruff remarks "but
   the peculiar Christology of Apollinaris has reappeared from time to
   time in a modified shape, as isolated theological opinion."  No doubt
   Dr. Schaff had in mind the fathers of the so-called "Kenoticism" of
   to-day, Gess and Ebrard, who teach, unless they have been
   misunderstood, that the incarnate Son had no human intellect or
   rational soul (nous) but that the divine personality took its place, by
   being changed into it.  By this last modification, they claim to escape
   from the taint of the Apollinarian heresy. [229]

   The Eunomians or Anomoeans.

   (Bright, Notes on the Canons, Canon I. of I. Const.)

   "The Eunomians or Anomoeans."  These were the ultra-Arians, who carried
   to its legitimate issue the original Arian denial of the eternity and
   uncreatedness of the Son, while they further rejected what Arius had
   affirmed as to the essential mysteriousness of the Divine nature (Soc.,
   H. E., iv., 7; comp. Athan., De Synod., 15).  Their founder was Aëtius,
   the most versatile of theological adventurers (cf. Athan., De Synod.,
   31; Soc., H. E., ii., 45; and see a summary of his career in Newman's
   Arians, p. 347); but their leader at the time of the Council was the
   daring and indefatigable Eunomius (for whose personal characteristics,
   see his admirer Philostorgius, x., 6).  He, too, had gone through many
   vicissitudes from his first employment as the secretary of Aëtius, and
   his ordination as deacon by Eudoxius; as bishop of Cyzicus, he had been
   lured into a disclosure of his true sentiments, and then denounced as a
   heretic (Theod., H. E., ii., 29); with Aëtius he had openly separated
   from Eudoxius as a disingenuous time-server, and had gone into
   retirement at Chalcedon (Philostorg., ix., 4).  The distinctive formula
   of his adherents was the "Anomoion."  The Son, they said, was not "like
   to the Father in essence"; even to call him simply "like" was to
   obscure the fact that he was simply a creature, and, as such, "unlike"
   to his Creator.  In other words, they thought the Semi-Arian
   "homoiousion" little better than the Catholic "homoousion":  the
   "homoion" of the more "respectable" Arians represented in their eyes an
   ignoble reticence; the plain truth, however it might shock devout
   prejudice, must be put into words which would bar all
   misunderstanding:  the Son might be called "God," but in a sense merely
   titular, so as to leave an impassable gulf between him and the
   uncreated Godhead (see Eunomius's Exposition in Valesius's note on
   Soc., H. E., v., 10).  Compare Basil (Epist., 233, and his work against
   Eunomius), and Epiphanius (Hær., 76).

   The Arians or Eudoxians.

   (Bright.  Ut supra.)

   "The Arians or Eudoxians."  By these are meant the ordinary Arians of
   the period, or, as they may be called, the Acacian party, directed for
   several years by the essentially worldly and unconscientious Eudoxius.
   His real sympathies were with the Anomoeans (see Tillemont, Mémoires,
   vi., 423, and compare his profane speech recorded by Socrates, H. E.,
   ii., 43): but, as a bishop of Constantinople, he felt it necessary to
   discourage them, and to abide by the vague formula invented by Acacius
   of Cæsarea, which described the Son as "like to the Father," without
   saying whether this likeness was supposed to be more than moral (cf.
   Newman, Arians, p. 317), so that the practical effect of this "homoion"
   was to prepare the way for that very Anomoeanism which its maintainers
   were ready for political purposes to disown.

   The Sabellians.

   (Bright.  Ut supra.)

   "The Sabellians," whose theory is traceable to Noetus and Praxeas in
   the latter part of the second century:  they regarded the Son and the
   Holy Spirit as aspects and modes of, or as emanations from, the One
   Person of the Father (see Newman's Arians, pp. 120 et seqq.).  Such a
   view tended directly to dissolve Christian belief in the Trinity and in
   the Incarnation (Vide Wilberforce, Incarnation, pp. 112, 197).  Hence
   the gentle Dionysius of Alexandria characterised it in severe terms as
   involving "blasphemy, unbelief, and irreverence, towards the Father,
   the Son, and the Holy Spirit" (Euseb., H. E., vii.. 6).  Hence the deep
   repugnance which it excited, and the facility with which the imputation
   of "Sabellianizing" could be utilised by the Arians against maintainers
   of the Consubstantiality (Hilary, De Trinit., iv., 4; De Synod., 68;
   Fragm., 11; Basil, Epist., 189, 2).  No organized Sabellian sect was in
   existence at the date of this anathema:  but Sabellian ideas were "in
   the air," and St. Basil could speak of a revival of this old misbelief
   (Epist., 126).  We find it again asserted by Chilperic I., King of
   Neustria, in the latter part of the sixth century (Greg. Turon., Hist.
   Fr., v., 45).

   The Marcellians.

   (Bright.  Ut supra.)

   "The Marcellians," called after Marcellus bishop of Ancyra, who was
   persistently denounced not only by the Arianizers, but by St. Basil,
   and for a time, at least, suspected by St. Athanasius (Vide Epiphan.,
   Hær., 72, 4) as one who held notions akin to Sabellianism, and fatal to
   a true belief in the Divine Sonship and the Incarnation.  The theory
   ascribed to him was that the Logos was an impersonal Divine power,
   immanent from eternity in God, but issuing from him in the act of
   creation, and entering at last into relations with the human person of
   Jesus, who thus became God's Son.  But this expansion of the original
   divine unity would be followed by a "contraction," when the Logos would
   retire from Jesus, and God would again be all in all.  Some nine years
   before the council, Marcellus, then in extreme old age, had sent his
   deacon Eugenius to St. Athanasius, with a written confession of faith,
   quite orthodox as to the eternity of the Trinity, and the identity of
   the Logos with a pre-existing and personal Son, although not verbally
   explicit as to the permanence of Christ's "kingdom,"--the point
   insisted on in one of the Epiphanian-Constantinopolitan additions to
   the Creed (Montfaucon, Collect. Nov., ii., 1).  The question whether
   Marcellus was personally heterodox--i.e. whether the extracts from his
   treatise, made by his adversary Eusebius of Cæsarea, give a fair
   account of his real views--has been answered unfavourably by some
   writers, as Newman (Athanasian Treatises, ii., 200, ed. 2), and
   Döllinger (Hippolytus and Callistus, p. 217, E. T. p. 201), while
   others, like Neale, think that "charity and truth" suggest his
   "acquittal" (Hist. Patr. Antioch., p. 106).  Montfaucon thinks that his
   written statements might be favourably interpreted, but that his oral
   statements must have given ground for suspicion.

   The Photinians.

   (Bright.  Ut supra. )

   "The Photinians," or followers of Marcellus's disciple Photinus, bishop
   of Sirmium, the ready-witted and pertinacious disputant whom four
   successive synods condemned before he could be got rid of, by State
   power, in a.d. 351.  (See St. Athanasius's Historical Writings, Introd.
   p. lxxxix.)  In his representation of the "Marcellian" theology, he
   laid special stress on its Christological position--that Jesus, on whom
   the Logos rested with exceptional fulness, was a mere man.  See
   Athanasius, De Synodis, 26, 27, for two creeds in which Photinianism is
   censured; also Soc. H. E. ii., 18, 29, 30; vii., 32.  There is an
   obvious affinity between it and the "Samosatene" or Paulionist theory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [229] The theological views of Gess and Ebrard I know only from the
   statements of them in writers on the subject of the Incarnation,
   especially from those made by the Rev. A. B. Bruce, D D., Professor at
   Free Church College, Glasgow, in his work "The Humiliation of Christ."
   (Lecture IV.)  The following passage (cited by Dr. Bruce) seems to
   prove his contention so far as Gess is concerned.  "Dass eine wahrhaft
   menschliche Seele in Jesu war, versteht sich für und von selbt:  er war
   ja sonst kein wirklicher Mensch.  Aber die Frage ist, ob der in's
   Werden eingegangene Logos selbst diese menschliche Seele, oder ob neben
   dem in's Werden eingegangenen Logos noch eine becondere menschliche
   Seele in Jesu war?"  (Gess.  Die Lehre v. d. Person Christi, ii. p.
   321.)  Bruce understands Gess to teach that "The only difference
   between the Logos and a human soul was, that he became human by
   voluntary kenosis, while an ordinary human soul derives its existence
   from a creative act."  (And refers to Gess, ut supra, p. 325 et seqq.)
   For Ebrard's view, see his Christliche Dogmatik, ii., p. 40.  Ritschl
   dubbed the whole kenotic theory as "Verschämter Socinianismus."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon II.

   The bishops are not to go beyond their dioceses to churches lying
   outside of their bounds, nor bring confusion on the churches; but let
   the Bishop of Alexandria, according to the canons, alone administer the
   affairs of Egypt; and let the bishops of the East manage the East
   alone, the privileges of the Church in Antioch, which are mentioned in
   the canons of Nice, being preserved; and let the bishops of the Asian
   Diocese administer the Asian affairs only; and the Pontic bishops only
   Pontic matters; and the Thracian bishops only Thracian affairs.  And
   let not bishops go beyond their dioceses for ordination or any other
   ecclesiastical ministrations, unless they be invited.  And the
   aforesaid canon concerning dioceses being observed, it is evident that
   the synod of every province will administer the affairs of that
   particular province as was decreed at Nice.  But the Churches of God in
   heathen nations must be governed according to the custom which has
   prevailed from the times of the Fathers.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   No traveller shall introduce confusion into the Churches either by
   ordaining or by enthroning.  Nevertheless in Churches which are among
   the heathen the tradition of the Fathers shall be preserved.

   In the above Ancient Epitome it will be noticed that not only is
   ordination mentioned but also the "inthronization" of bishops.  Few
   ceremonies are of greater antiquity in the Christian Church than the
   solemn placing of the newly chosen bishop in the episcopal chair of his
   diocese.  It is mentioned in the Apostolical Constitutions, and in the
   Greek Pontificals.  Also in the Arabic version of the Nicene Canons.
   (No. lxxi.).  A sermon was usually delivered by the newly consecrated
   bishop, called the "sermo enthronisticus."  He also sent to
   neighbouring bishops sullabai enthronistikai, and the fees the new
   bishops paid were called ta enthronistika.

   Valesius.

   (Note on Socrates, H. E., v., 8).

   This rule seems to have been made chiefly on account of Meletius,
   Bishop of Antioch, Gregory Nazianzen, and Peter of Alexandria.  For
   Meletius leaving the Eastern diocese had come to Constantinople to
   ordain Gregory bishop there.  And Gregory having abandoned the
   bishoprick of Sasima, which was in the Pontic diocese, had removed to
   Constantinople.  While Peter of Alexandria had sent to Constantinople
   seven Egyptian bishops to ordain Maximus the Cynic.  For the purpose
   therefore of repressing these [disorders], the fathers of the Synod of
   Constantinople made this canon.

   Balsamon.

   Take notice from the present canon that formerly all the Metropolitans
   of provinces were themselves the heads of their own provinces, and were
   ordained by their own synods.  But all this was changed by Canon xxviij
   of the Synod of Chalcedon, which directs that the Metropolitans of the
   dioceses of Pontus, Asia, and Thrace, and certain others which are
   mentioned in this Canon should be ordained by the Patriarch of
   Constantinople and should be subject to him.  But if you find other
   churches which are autocephalous as the Church of Bulgaria, of Cyprus,
   of Iberia, you need not be astonished.  For the Emperor Justinian gave
   this honour to the Archbishop of Bulgaria....The third Synod gave this
   honour to the Archbishop of Cyprus, and by the law of the same synod
   (Canon viii.), and by the Sixth Synod in its xxxix^th Canon, the
   judgment of the Synod of Antioch is annulled and this honour granted to
   the bishop of Iberia.

   Tillemont.

   (Mém. ix., 489).

   The Council seems likewise to reject, whether designedly or
   inadvertently, what had been ordained by the Council of Sardica in
   favour of Rome.  But as assuredly it did not affect to prevent either
   Ecumenical Councils, or even general Councils of the East, from judging
   of matters brought before them, so I do not know if one may conclude
   absolutely that they intended to forbid appeals to Rome.  It regulates
   proceedings between Dioceses, but not what might concern superior
   tribunals.

   Fleury.

   (Hist. Eccl. in loc.).

   This Canon, which gives to the councils of particular places full
   authority in Ecclesiastical matters, seems to take away the power of
   appealing to the Pope granted by the Council of Sardica, and to restore
   the ancient right.

   Hefele.

   An exception to the rule against interference in other patriarchates
   was made with regard to those Churches newly founded amongst barbarous
   nations (not belonging to the Roman Empire), as these were of course
   obliged to receive their first bishops from strange patriarchates, and
   remained afterwards too few in number to form patriarchates of their
   own and were therefore governed as belonging to other patriarchates,
   as, for instance, Abyssinia by the patriarchate of Alexandria.

   Canon III.

   The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of
   honour after the Bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   The bishop of Constantinople is to be honoured next after the bishop of
   Rome.

   It should be remembered that the change effected by this canon did not
   affect Rome directly in any way, but did seriously affect Alexandria
   and Antioch, which till then had ranked next after the see of Rome.
   When the pope refused to acknowledge the authority of this canon, he
   was in reality defending the principle laid down in the canon of Nice,
   that in such matters the ancient customs should continue.  Even the
   last clause, it would seem, could give no offence to the most sensitive
   on the papal claims, for it implies a wonderful power in the rank of
   Old Rome, if a see is to rank next to it because it happens to be "New
   Rome."  Of course these remarks only refer to the wording of the canon
   which is carefully guarded; the intention doubtless was to exalt the
   see of Constantinople, the chief see of the East, to a position of as
   near equality as possible with the chief see of the West.

   Zonaras.

   In this place the Council takes action concerning Constantinople, to
   which it decrees the prerogative of honour, the priority, and the glory
   after the Bishop of Rome as being New Rome and the Queen of cities.
   Some indeed wish to understand the preposition meta here of time and
   not of inferiority of grade.  And they strive to confirm this
   interpretation by a consideration of the XXVIII canon of Chalcedon,
   urging that if Constantinople is to enjoy equal honours, the
   preposition "after" cannot signify subjection.  But on the other hand
   the hundred and thirtieth novel of Justinian, [230] Book V of the
   Imperial Constitutions, title three, understands the canon otherwise.
   For, it says, "we decree that the most holy Pope of Old Rome, according
   to the decrees of the holy synods is the first of all priests, and that
   the most blessed bishop of Constantinople and of New Rome, should have
   the second place after the Apostolic Throne of the Elder Rome, and
   should be superior in honour to all others."  From this therefore it is
   abundantly evident that "after" denotes subjection (hupobibasmon) and
   diminution.  And otherwise it would be impossible to guard this
   equality of honour in each see.  For in reciting their names, or
   assigning them seats when they are to sit together, or arranging the
   order of their signatures to documents, one must come before the
   other.  Whoever therefore shall explain this particle meta as only
   referring to time, and does not admit that it signifies an inferior
   grade of dignity, does violence to the passage and draws from it a
   meaning neither true nor good.  Moreover in Canon xxxvj of the Council
   in Trullo, meta manifestly denotes subjection, assigning to
   Constantinople the second place after the throne of Old Rome; and then
   adds, after this Alexandria, then Antioch, and last of all shall be
   placed Jerusalem.

   Hefele.

   If we enquire the reason why this Council tried to change the order of
   rank of the great Sees, which had been established in the sixth Nicene
   canon, we must first take into consideration that, since the elevation
   of Constantinople to the Imperial residence, as New Rome, the bishops
   as well as the Emperors naturally wished to see the new imperial
   residence, New Rome, placed immediately after Old Rome in
   ecclesiastical rank also; the rather, as with the Greeks it was the
   rule for the ecclesiastical rank of a See to follow the civil rank of
   the city.  The Synod of Antioch in 341, in its ninth canon, had plainly
   declared this, and subsequently the fourth General Council, in its
   seventeenth canon, spoke in the same sense.  But how these principles
   were protested against on the side of Rome, we shall see further on in
   the history of the fourth General Council.  For the present, it may
   suffice to add that the aversion to Alexandria which, by favouring
   Maximus, had exercised such a disturbing influence on Church affairs in
   Constantinople, may well have helped to effect the elevation of the See
   of Constantinople over that of Alexandria.  Moreover, for many
   centuries Rome did not recognize this change of the old ecclesiastical
   order.  In the sixteenth session of the fourth General Council, the
   Papal Legate, Lucentius, expressly declared this.  In like manner the
   Popes Leo the Great and Gregory the Great pronounced against it; and
   though even Gratian adopted this canon in his collection the Roman
   critics added the following note:  Canon hic ex iis est, quos
   Apostolica Romana Sedes a principio et longo post tempore non recepit.
   It was only when, after the conquest of Constantinople by the Latins, a
   Latin patriarchate was founded there in 1204, that Pope Innocent III,
   and the twelfth General Council, in 1215, allowed this patriarch the
   first rank after the Roman; and the same recognition was expressly
   awarded to the Greek Patriarch at the Florentine Union in 1439.

   T. W. Allies. [231]

   Remarkable enough it is that when, in the Council of Chalcedon, appeal
   was made to this third Canon, the Pope St. Leo declared that it had
   never been notified to Rome.  As in the mean time it had taken effect
   throughout the whole East, as in this very council Nectarius, as soon
   as he is elected, presides instead of Timothy of Alexandria, it puts in
   a strong point of view the real self-government of the Eastern Church
   at this time; for the giving the Bishop of Constantinople precedence
   over Alexandria and Antioch was a proceeding which affected the whole
   Church, and so far altered its original order--one in which certainly
   the West might claim to have a voice.  Tillemont goes on:  "It would be
   very difficult to justify St. Leo, if he meant that the Roman Church
   had never known that the Bishop of Constantinople took the second place
   in the Church, and the first in the East, since his legates, whose
   conduct he entirely approves, had just themselves authorized it as a
   thing beyond dispute, and Eusebius of Dorylæum maintained that St. Leo
   himself had proved it."  The simple fact is, that, exceedingly
   unwilling as the Bishops of Rome were to sanction it, from this time,
   381, to say the least, the Bishop of Constantinople appears uniformly
   as first bishop of the East.

   Cardinal Baronius in his Annals (a.d. 381, n. 35, 36) has disputed the
   genuineness of this Canon!  As already mentioned it is found in the
   Corpus Juris Canonici, Decretum, Pars I., Dist. XXII, c. iij.  The note
   added to this in Gratian reads as follows:

   Note in Gratian's "Decretum."

   This canon is of the number of those which the Apostolic See of Rome
   did not at first nor for long years afterwards receive.  This is
   evident from Epistle LI. (or LIII.) of Pope Leo I. to Anatolius of
   Constantinople and from several other of his letters.  The same thing
   also is shewn by two letters of Leo IX.'s, the one against the
   presumptuous acts of Michael and Leo (cap. 28) and the other addressed
   to the same Michael.  But still more clearly is this seen from the
   letter of Blessed Gregory (xxxj., lib. VI.) to Eulogius of Alexandria
   and Anastasius of Antioch, and from the letter of Nicholas I. to the
   Emperor Michel which begins "Proposueramus."  However, the bishops of
   Constantinople, sustained by the authority of the Emperors, usurped to
   themselves the second place among the patriarchs, and this at length
   was granted to them for the sake of peace and tranquillity, as Pope
   Innocent III. declares (in cap. antiqua de privileg.). [232]

   This canon Dionysius Exiguus appends to Canon 2, and dropping 5, 6, and
   7 he has but three canons of this Synod.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [230] The reader will notice that this is not even an approximately
   contemporaneous interpretation, but more than a century and a half
   later, after Leo I. had done so much to establish the power of his see.

   [231] T. W. Allies.  The Ch. of Eng. cleared from the Charge of
   Schism.  (Written while an Anglican) p. 94 (2d Edition).

   [232] For some reason this canon does not seem to be any more
   acceptable to modern champions of the Papacy than it was to the Church
   of Rome fifteen hundred years ago.  I give as a sample of this the
   following from a recent Roman Catholic writer:  "The decree which goes
   by the name of the Third Canon of Constantinople was the germ of the
   successful mendacity of the arch-rebel Photius."  (Rivington.  The
   Prim. Ch., p. 263).  The phraseology seems to suggest warm discontent
   at the canon.

   Canon IV.

   Concerning Maximus the Cynic and the disorder which has happened in
   Constantinople on his account, it is decreed that Maximus never was and
   is not now a Bishop; that those who have been ordained by him are in no
   order whatever of the clergy; since all which has been done concerning
   him or by him, is declared to be invalid.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   Let Maximus the Cynic be cast out from among the bishops, and anyone
   who was inscribed by him on the clergy list shall be held as profane.

   Edmund Venables.

   (Smith and Wace, Dict. Christ. Biog.)

   Maximus the Cynic; the intrusive bishop of Constantinople, a.d. 380.
   Ecclesiastical history hardly presents a more extraordinary career than
   that of this man, who, after a most disreputable youth, more than once
   brought to justice for his misdeeds, and bearing the scars of his
   punishments, by sheer impudence, clever flattery, and adroit management
   of opportunities, contrived to gain the confidence successively of no
   less men than Peter of Alexandria, Gregory Nazianzen, and Ambrose, and
   to install himself in one of the first sees of the church, from which
   he was with difficulty dislodged by a decree of an ecumenical council.
   His history also illustrates the jealousy felt by the churches of
   Alexandria and Rome towards their young and vigorous rival for
   patriarchal honours, the church of Constantinople; as well as their
   claim to interfere with her government, and to impose prelates upon her
   according to their pleasure.  Alexandria, as the chief see of the
   Eastern world, from the first asserted a jurisdiction which she has
   never formally relinquished over the see of Constantinople, more
   particularly in a vacancy in the episcopate (Neale, Patr. of
   Alexandria, i., 206).  The conduct of Peter, the successor of
   Athanasius, first in instituting Gregory Nazianzen bishop of
   Constantinople by his letters and sending a formal recognition of his
   appointment and then in substituting Maximus, as has been remarked by
   Milman (History of Christianity, iii., 115, note) and Ullman (Greg.
   Naz., p. 203 [Cox's translation]), furnish unmistakable indications of
   the desire to erect an Oriental papacy, by establishing the primacy of
   Alexandria over Constantinople and so over the East, which was still
   further illustrated a few years later by the high-handed behaviour of
   Theophilus towards Chrysostom.

   Maximus was a native of Alexandria of low parentage.  He boasted that
   his family had produced martyrs.  He got instructed in the rudiments of
   the Christian faith and received baptism, but strangely enough sought
   to combine the Christian profession with Cynic philosophy.

   When he presented himself at the Eastern capital he wore the white robe
   of a Cynic, and carried a philosopher's staff, his head being laden
   with a huge crop of crisp curling hair, dyed a golden yellow, and
   swinging over his shoulders in long ringlets.  He represented himself
   as a confessor for the Nicene faith, and his banishment to the Oasis as
   a suffering for the truth (Orat. xxiii., p. 419).  Before long he
   completely gained the ear and heart of Gregory, who admitted him to the
   closest companionship.  Maximus proclaimed the most unbounded
   admiration for Gregory's discourses, which he praised in private, and,
   according to the custom of the age, applauded in public.  His zeal
   against heretics was most fierce, and his denunciation of them
   uncompromising.  The simple-hearted Gregory became the complete dupe of
   Maximus.

   All this time Maximus was secretly maturing a plot for ousting his
   unsuspicious patron from his throne.  He gained the ear and the
   confidence of Peter of Alexandria, and induced him to favour his
   ambitious views.  Gregory, he asserted, had never been formally
   enthroned bishop of Constantinople; his translation thither was a
   violation of the canons of the church; rustic in manners, he had proved
   himself quite unfitted for the place.  Constantinople was getting weary
   of him.  It was time the patriarch of the Eastern world should exercise
   his prerogative and give New Rome a more suitable bishop.  The old man
   was imposed on as Gregory had been, and lent himself to Maximus's
   projects.  Maximus found a ready tool in a presbyter of Constantinople,
   envious of Gregory's talents and popularity (de Vit., p. 13).  Others
   were gained by bribes.  Seven unscrupulous sailor fellows were
   despatched from Alexandria to mix with the people, and watch for a
   favourable opportunity for carrying out the plot.  When all was ripe
   they were followed by a bevy of bishops, with secret instructions from
   the patriarch to consecrate Maximus.

   The conspirators chose the night for the accomplishment of their
   enterprise.  Gregory they knew was confined by illness.  They forced
   their way into the cathedral, and commenced the rite of ordination.  By
   the time they had set the Cynic on the archiepiscopal throne, and had
   just begun shearing away his long curls, they were surprised by the
   dawn.  The news quickly spread, and everybody rushed to the church.
   The magistrates appeared on the scene with their officers; Maximus and
   his consecrators were driven from the sacred precincts, and in the
   house or shop of a flute-player the tonsure was completed.  Maximus
   repaired to Thessalonica to lay his cause before Theodosius.  He met
   with a cold reception from the emperor, who committed the matter to
   Ascholius, the much respected bishop of that city, charging him to
   refer it to pope Damasus.  We have two letters of Damasus's on this
   subject.  In the first, addressed to Ascholius and the Macedonian
   bishops, he vehemently condemns the "ardor animi et foeda presumptio"
   which had led certain persons coming from Egypt, in violation of the
   rule of ecclesiastical discipline, to have proposed to consecrate a
   restless man, an alien from the Christian profession, not worthy to be
   called a Christian, who wore an idolatrous garb ("habitus idoli") and
   the long hair which St. Paul said was a shame to a man, and remarks on
   the fact that being expelled from the church they were compelled to
   complete the ordination "intra parietes alienos."  In the second letter
   addressed to Ascholius individually (Ep. vi.) he repeats his
   condemnation of the ordination of the long-haired Maximus ("comatum")
   and asks him to take special care that a Catholic bishop may be
   ordained (Migne, Patrolog., xiii., pp. 366-369; Ep. 5; 5, 6).

   Maximus returned to Alexandria, and demanded that Peter should assist
   him in re-establishing himself at Constantinople.  But Peter had
   discovered the man's true character, and received him as coldly as
   Theodosius had done.  Determined to carry his point he presented
   himself to the patriarch at the head of a disorderly mob, with the
   threat that if he did not help him to gain the throne of Constantinople
   he would have that of Alexandria.  Peter appealed to the prefect, by
   whom Maximus was driven out of Egypt.  The death of Peter and the
   accession of Timotheus are placed Feb. 14, 380.  The events described
   must therefore have occurred in 379.  When the second ecumenical
   council met at Constantinople in 381, the question of Maximus's claim
   to the see of Constantinople came up for consideration.  His
   pretensions were unanimously rejected.

   Bright.

   (Notes on the Canons, in loc.)

   Maximus, however, having been expelled from Egypt, made his way into
   Northern Italy, presented to Gratian at Milan a large work which he had
   written against the Arians (as to which Gregory sarcastically
   remarks--"Saul a prophet, Maximus an author!"  Carm. adv. Mar., 21),
   and deceived St. Ambrose and his suffragans by showing the record of
   his consecration, with letters which Peter had once written in his
   behalf.  To these prelates of the "Italic diocese" the appeal of
   Maximus seemed like the appeal of Athanasius, and more recently of
   Peter himself, to the sympathy of the church of Rome; and they
   requested Theodosius to let the case be heard before a really General
   Council (Mansi, iii. 631).  Nothing further came of it; perhaps, says
   Tillemont, those who thus wrote in favour of Maximus "reconnurent
   bientôt quel il était" (ix., 502):  so that when a Council did meet at
   Rome towards the end of 382, no steps were taken in his behalf.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   (Probably adopted at a Council held in Constantinople the next year,
   382.  Vide. Introduction on the number of the Canons.)

   In regard to the tome of the Western [Bishops], we receive those in
   Antioch also who confess the unity of the Godhead of the Father, and of
   the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   The Tome of the Westerns which recognizes the Father, the Son, and the
   Holy Spirit as consubstantial is highly acceptable.

   Beveridge and Van Espen translate this canon differently, thus, "With
   regard to the tome of the Westerns, we agree with those in Antioch
   [i.e. the Synod of 378] who (accepted it and) acknowledged the unity of
   the Godhead of the Father etc."  In opposition to this translation
   Hefele urges that apodechesthai in ecclesiastical language usually
   refers to receiving persons and recognizing them, not opinions or
   doctrines.

   Hefele.

   This canon probably does not belong to the second General Council, but
   to the Synod held in the following year at Constantinople consisting of
   nearly the same bishops.

   It is certain that by the "Tome of the Westerns" a dogmatic work of the
   Western bishops is to be understood, and the only question is which
   Tome of the Westerns is here meant.  Several--for instance, the Greek
   commentators, Balsamon and Zonaras, and the spokesman of the Latins at
   the Synod of Florence in 1439 (Archbishop Andrew of Rhodes)--understood
   by it the decrees of the Synod of Sardica; but it seems to me that this
   canon undoubtedly indicates that the Tome of the Westerns also
   mentioned the condition of the Antiochian Church, and the division into
   two parties of the orthodox of that place--the Meletian schism.  Now,
   as this was not mentioned, nay, could not have been, at the Synod of
   Sardica--for this schism at Antioch only broke out seventeen years
   later--some other document of the Latins must certainly be meant.  But
   we know that Pope Damasus, and the synod assembled by him in 369,
   addressed a Tome to the Orientals, of which fragments are still
   preserved, and that nine years later, in 379, a great synod at Antioch
   of one hundred and forty-six orthodox Oriental bishops, under Meletius,
   accepted and signed this Tome, and at the same time sought to put a
   stop to the Meletian schism.  Soon afterwards, in 380, Pope Damasus and
   his fourth Roman Synod again sent a treatise on the faith, of which we
   still possess a portion, containing anathemas, to the Orientals,
   especially to Bishop Paul of Antioch, head of the Eustathians of that
   city.  Under these circumstances, we are justified in referring the
   expression "the tome of the Westerns" either to the Roman treatise of
   369 or to that of 380, and I am disposed to give the preference to the
   former, for the following reasons:--

   (1.)  As has been already observed, this canon belongs to the Synod
   held at Constantinople in 382.

   (2.)  We still possess in Theodoret a Synodal Letter to the Latins from
   this later Synod.

   (3.)  The canon in question, as proceeding from the same source, is, of
   course to a certain extent, connected with this letter.

   (4.)  In this Synodal Letter, the Eastern bishops, in order to convince
   the Latins of their orthodoxy, appeal to two documents, the one a
   "tome" of an Antiochian Synod, and the other a "tome" of the Ecumenical
   Council held at Constantinople in 381.

   (5.)  By the Antiochian Synod here mentioned, I understand the great
   synod of 378, and, as a necessary consequence, believe the "tome" there
   produced to be none other than the Roman Tome of 369, which was then
   accepted at Antioch.

   (6.)  It is quite certain that the Synod of Antioch sent a copy of this
   Tome, with the declaration of its acceptance and the signatures of the
   members, back to Rome, as a supplement to its Synodal Letter; and hence
   Lucas Holstenius was still able to find fragments of it in Rome.

   (7.)  The Synod of Constantinople of 382 might well call this Tome,
   sent back to Rome with the acceptance and signatures of the Easterns, a
   "Tome established at Antioch," although it was really drawn up at Rome.

   (8.)  If, however, the Synod of Constantinople in its Synodal Letter
   speaks of this Tome, we are justified in supposing that the one
   mentioned in its canon is the same.

   (9.)  That which still remains of the Roman Tome of 369, treats
   expressly of the oneness of the Godhead of the Father, the Son, and the
   Holy Ghost; and such were the contents of the Tome according to this
   canon.

   (10.)  It is true that the fragments still preserved of this Tome
   contain no passage directly referring to the Antiochian schism; but, in
   the first place, very little remains of it, and there is the more
   reason to suppose that the Meletian schism was spoken of in the portion
   which has been lost, as it was the same Antiochian Synod that accepted
   the Tome which urged the putting an end to that schism.  It is still
   more to the purpose that the Italian bishops, in their letter to the
   Easterns in 381, expressly say that they had already long before
   (dudum) written to the Orientals in order to put an end to the division
   between the orthodox at Antioch.  By this "dudum" I conclude that they
   refer to the Roman Tome of 369; and if the Westerns in their letter to
   the Easterns in 381 pointed to this Tome, it was natural that the Synod
   of Constantinople of 382 should also have referred to it, for it was
   that very letter of the Latins which occasioned and called the synod
   into being.

   Lastly, for the full understanding of this canon, it is necessary to
   observe that the Latins, in their letter just mentioned of 381, say
   that "they had already in their earlier missive (i.e. as we suppose, in
   the Tome of 369) spoken to the effect that both parties at Antioch, one
   as much as the other, were orthodox."  Agreeing with this remark of the
   Westerns, repeated in their letter of 381, the Easterns in this canon
   say, "We also recognise all Antiochians as orthodox who acknowledge the
   oneness of the Godhead of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   (Probably adopted at a Council held in Constantinople the next year,
   382.  Vide Introduction on the number of Canons.)

   Forasmuch as many wishing to confuse and overturn ecclesiastical order,
   do contentiously and slanderously fabricate charges against the
   orthodox bishops who have the administration of the Churches, intending
   nothing else than to stain the reputation of the priests and raise up
   disturbances amongst the peaceful laity; therefore it seemed right to
   the Holy Synod of Bishops assembled together in Constantinople, not to
   admit accusers without examination; and neither to allow all persons
   whatsoever to bring accusations against the rulers of the Church, nor,
   on the other hand, to exclude all.  If then, any one shall bring a
   private complaint against the Bishop, that is, one relating to his own
   affairs, as, for example, that he has been defrauded, or otherwise
   unjustly treated by him, in such accusations no examination shall be
   made, either of the person or of the religion of the accuser; for it is
   by all means necessary that the conscience of the Bishop should be
   free, and that he who says he has been wronged should meet with
   righteous judgment, of whatever religion he may be.  But if the charge
   alleged against the Bishop be that of some ecclesiastical offence, then
   it is necessary to examine carefully the persons of the accusers, so
   that, in the first place, heretics may not be suffered to bring
   accusations touching ecclesiastical matters against orthodox bishops.
   And by heretics we mean both those who were aforetime cast out and
   those whom we ourselves have since anathematized, and also those
   professing to hold the true faith who have separated from our canonical
   bishops, and set up conventicles in opposition [to them].  Moreover, if
   there be any who have been condemned for faults and cast out of the
   Church, or excommunicated, whether of the clergy or the laity, neither
   shall it be lawful for these to bring an accusation against the bishop,
   until they have cleared away the charge against themselves.  In like
   manner, persons who are under previous accusations are not to be
   permitted to bring charges against a bishop or any other clergyman,
   until they shall have proved their own innocence of the accusation
   brought against them.  But if any, being neither heretics, nor
   excommunicate, nor condemned, nor under previous accusation for alleged
   faults, should declare that they have any ecclesiastical charge against
   the bishop, the Holy Synod bids them first lay their charges before all
   the Bishops of the Province, and before them prove the accusations,
   whatsoever they may be, which they have brought against the bishop.
   And if the comprovincials should be unable rightly to settle the
   charges brought against the bishop, then the parties must betake
   themselves to a greater synod of the bishops of that diocese called
   together for this purpose; and they shall not produce their allegations
   before they have promised in writing to undergo an equal penalty to be
   exacted from themselves, if, in the course of the examination, they
   shall be proved to have slandered the accused bishop.  And if anyone,
   despising what has been decreed concerning these things, shall presume
   to annoy the ears of the Emperor, or the courts of temporal judges, or,
   to the dishonour of all the Bishops of his Province, shall trouble an
   Ecumenical Synod, such an one shall by no means be admitted as an
   accuser; forasmuch as he has cast contempt upon the Canons, and brought
   reproach upon the order of the Church.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   Even one that is of ill repute, if he have suffered any injury, let him
   bring a charge against the bishop.  If however it be a crime of
   ecclesiastical matters let him not speak.  Nor shall another condemned
   before, speak.  Let not one excommunicated, or cast forth, or charged
   with any crimes speak, until he is cleared of them.  But those who
   should bring the charge are the orthodox, who are communicants,
   uncondemned, unaccused.  Let the case be heard by the provincials.  If
   however they are not able to decide the case, let them have recourse to
   a greater synod and let them not be heard, without a written
   declaration of liability to the same sufferings [i.e. of their
   readiness to be tried by the lex talionis.]  But should anyone contrary
   to the provisions appeal to the Emperor and trouble him, let such be
   cast forth.

   The phrase "who have the administration of the Churches," Hatch in his
   Bampton Lectures (Lect. I., p. 41) erroneously supposes to refer only
   to the administration of the Church's alms.  But this, as Dr. Bright
   well points out ("Notes on the Canons," in loc.) cannot be the meaning
   of oikonamein when used absolutely as in this canon.  He says, "When a
   merely economic' function is intended, the context shows it, as in
   Chalcedon, Canon xxvj."  He also points out that in Canon ij., and in
   Eusebius (H. E. iv., 4), and when St. Basil wishes his brother to
   oikonomein a church suited to his temperament (Epist. xcviij., 2) the
   meaning of the word is evidently spiritual stewardship.

   Zonaras.

   By "those who were cast out of the Church" are to be understood those
   who were altogether cut off from the Church; but by those who were
   "excommunicated" the holy fathers intend all those, whether clerics or
   laymen, who are deprived of communion for a set time.

   Van Espen.

   It is evident from the context of this canon that "Diocese" here does
   not signify the district or territory assigned to any one bishop, as we
   to-day use the word; but for a district, which not only contained many
   episcopal districts, as today do ecclesiastical provinces, but which
   contained also many provinces, and this was the meaning of the word at
   the time of this Council's session.

   Zonaras.

   We call Adrianople, for example, or Philopopolis with the bishops of
   each a "Province," but the whole of Thrace or Macedonia we call a
   "Diocese."  When these crimes were brought forward to be corrected, for
   the judging of which the provincial bishops were by no means
   sufficient, then the Canon orders the bishops of the diocese to
   assemble, and determine the charges preferred against the bishop.

   Van Espen.

   Both the Canon and the Civil Law require the accusers to submit
   themselves to the law of retaliation (lex talionis).  Vide Gratian, Pt.
   II., Causa II., Quæst. III., 2 and 3, where we read from the decree of
   Pope Hadrian; "Whoever shall not prove what he advances, shall himself
   suffer the penalty due the crime he charged."  And under the name of
   Damasus, "The calumniator, if he fail in proving his accusation, shall
   receive his tale."  The Civil Law is in L. x., Cod. de Calumniatoribus,
   and reads, "Whoso charges a crime, shall not have licence to lie with
   impunity, since justice requires that calumniators shall endure the
   punishment due the crime which they failed to prove."

   The Council wishes that all accusations of bishops for ecclesiastical
   offences shall be kept out of the secular courts, and shall be heard by
   synods of bishops, in the manner and form here prescribed, which is in
   accordance with the Constitution which under the names of Valens,
   Gratian, and Valentinian, the Emperors, is referred to in law xxiij. of
   the Code of Theodosius, De Episcopis et Clericis.

   Whatever may be said of the meeting of bishops at which this canon was
   enacted, this is clear, no mention was made of the Roman Pontiff, nor
   of the Council of Sardica, as Fleury notes in his Histoire
   Ecclesiastique, Lib. xviij., n. 8.  From this it is evident either that
   at that time the Orientals did not admit, especially for bishops,
   appeals to the Roman Pontiff; nor did they accept the authority of the
   Synod of Sardica, in so far as it permitted that the sentence given in
   a provincial synod, should be reopened by the neighbouring bishops
   together with the bishops of the province, and if it seemed good, that
   the cause might be referred to Rome.

   Warning to the Reader Touching Canon VII.

   (Beveridge, Synodicon, Tom. II., in loc.)

   This canon, I confess, is contained in all the editions of the
   Commentaries of Balsamon and Zonaras.  It is cited also by Photius in
   Nomocanon, Tit. xii. ch. xiv., besides it is extant in a contracted
   form in the Epitome of Alexius Aristenus.  But it is wanting in all the
   Latin versions of the Canons, in the ancient translations of Dionys.
   Exig., Isidore Mercator, etc.; also in the Epitome of Sym. Logothet.,
   and the Arabic paraphrase of Josephus Ægyp., and what is particularly
   to be observed, in the collection and nomocanon of John of Antioch; and
   this not through want of attention on his part, as is clear from this
   namely, that in the order of the Canons as given by him he attributes
   six Canons only to this second General Council, saying "...of the
   Fathers who assembled at Constantinople, by whom six Canons were set
   forth," so that it is clear the present was not reckoned among the
   canons of this council in those days.  Nay, the whole composition of
   this canon clearly indicates that it is to be ascribed, neither to this
   present council, nor to any other (unless perhaps to that of Trullo, of
   which we shall speak afterwards).  For nothing is appointed in it,
   nothing confirmed, but a certain ancient custom of receiving converted
   heretics, is here merely recited.

   (Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. II., p. 368.)

   As we possess a letter from the Church at Constantinople in the middle
   of the fifth century to Bishop Martyrius of Antioch, in which the same
   subject is referred to in a precisely similar way, Beveridge is
   probably right in conjecturing that the canon was only an extract from
   this letter to Martyrius; therefore in no way a decree of the second
   General Council, nor even of the Synod of 382, but at least eighty
   years later than the latter.  This canon, with an addition, was
   afterwards adopted by the Quinisext Synod as its ninety-fifth, without,
   however, giving its origin.

   Canon VII.

   Those who from heresy turn to orthodoxy, and to the portion of those
   who are being saved, we receive according to the following method and
   custom:  Arians, and Macedonians, and Sabbatians, and Novatians, who
   call themselves Cathari or Aristori, and Quarto-decimans or Tetradites,
   and Apollinarians, we receive, upon their giving a written renunciation
   [of their errors] and anathematize every heresy which is not in
   accordance with the Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church of God.
   Thereupon, they are first sealed or anointed with the holy oil upon the
   forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, and ears; and when we seal them, we
   say, "The Seal of the gift of the Holy Ghost."  But Eunomians, who are
   baptized with only one immersion, and Montanists, who are here called
   Phrygians, and Sabellians, who teach the identity of Father and Son,
   and do sundry other mischievous things, and [the partisans of] all
   other heresies--for there are many such here, particularly among those
   who come from the country of the Galatians:--all these, when they
   desire to turn to orthodoxy, we receive as heathen.  On the first day
   we make them Christians; on the second, catechumens; on the third, we
   exorcise them by breathing thrice in their face and ears; and thus we
   instruct them and oblige them to spend some time in the Church, and to
   hear the Scriptures; and then we baptize them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII. [233]

   Quarto-decimans or Tetradites, Arians, Macedonians, Sabbatians, and
   Apollinarians ought to be received with their books and anointed in all
   their organs of sense.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   Eunomians baptized with one immersion, Sabellians, and Phrygians are to
   be received as heathen.

   Aristemus (inCan. vij.).

   Those giving up their books and execrating every heresy are received
   with only anointing with chrism of the eyes, the nostrils, the ears,
   the mouth, and the brow; and signing them with the words, "The Seal of
   the gift of the Holy Ghost."

   For the "Cathari," see Notes on Canon viij. of I. Nice.

   Hammond.

   Sabbatians.  Sabbatius was a presbyter who adopted the sentiments of
   Novatius, but as it is clear from the histories of Socrates and
   Sozomen, that he did not do so till at least eight years after the
   celebration of this council, it is of course equally clear that this
   canon could not have been framed by this council.

   Aristeri.  This is probably a false reading for Aristi, i.e. the best.
   In the letter above mentioned the expression is Cathari and
   Catheroteri, i.e. the pure, and the more pure.

   The Quarto-decimans, or Tetradites, were those persons who persisted in
   observing the Easter festival with the Jews, on the fourteenth day of
   the first month, whatever day of the week it happened to be.

   Montanists.  One of the older sects, so called from Montanus, who
   embraced Christianity in the second century.  He professed to be
   inspired in a peculiar way by the Holy Ghost, and to prophesy.  He was
   supported in his errors by two women, Priscilla and Maximilla, who also
   pretended to prophesy.  His heresy infected many persons, amongst
   others Tertullian, but being condemned by the Church. his followers
   formed a sect remarkable for extreme austerity.  But although they
   asserted that the Holy Ghost had inspired Montanus to introduce a
   system of greater perfection than the Church had before known, and
   condemned those who would not join them as carnal, they did not at
   first innovate in any of the articles of the Creed.  This sect lasted a
   long time, and spread much in Phrygia and the neighbouring districts,
   whence they were called Phryges and Cata-phryges, and latterly adopted
   the errors of Sabellius respecting the Trinity.

   The other heresies mentioned in this canon have been treated of in the
   excursus to Canon j.

   Excursus on the Authority of the Second Ecumenical Council.

   (Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. II., pp. 370, et seqq.)

   Lastly, to turn to the question of the authority of this Council, it
   appears, first of all, that immediately after its close, in the same
   year, 381, several of its acts were censured by a Council of Latins,
   namely, the prolongation of the Meletian schism (by the elevation of
   Flavian), and the choice of Nectarius as Bishop of Constantinople,
   while, as is known, the Westerns held (the Cynic) Maximus to be the
   rightful bishop of that city.

   In consequence of this, the new Synod assembled in the following year,
   382, at Constantinople, sent the Latins a copy of the decrees of faith
   composed the year before, expressly calling this Synod oikoumenike and
   at the same time seeking to justify it in those points which had been
   censured.  Photius [234] maintains that soon afterwards Pope Damasus
   confirmed this synod; but, as the following will show, this
   confirmation could only have referred to the creed and not to the
   canons.  As late as about the middle of the fifth century, Pope Leo I.
   spoke in a very depreciatory manner of these canons, especially of the
   third, which concerned the ecclesiastical rank of Constantinople,
   remarking that it was never sent to the See of Rome.  Still later,
   Gregory the Great wrote in the same sense:  Romana autem Ecclesia
   eosdam canones vel gesta Synodi illius hactenus non habet, nec accepit;
   in hoc autem eam accepit, quod est per eam contra Macedonium definitum.
   [235]

   Thus, as late as the year 600, only the creed, but not the canons of
   the Synod of Constantinople were accepted at Rome; but on account of
   its creed, Gregory the Great reckons it as one of the four Ecumenical
   Councils, which he compares to the four Gospels.  So also before him
   the popes Vigilius and Pelagius II, reckoned this Synod among the
   Ecumenical Councils.

   The question is, from what date the Council of Constantinople was
   considered ecumenical by the Latins as well as by the Greeks.  We will
   begin with the latter.  Although as we have seen, the Synod of 382 had
   already designated this council as ecumenical, yet it could not for a
   long time obtain an equal rank with the Council of Nicæa, for which
   reason the General Council of Ephesus mentions that of Nicæa and its
   creed with the greatest respect, but is totally silent as to this
   Synod.  Soon afterwards, the so-called Robber-Synod in 449, spoke of
   two (General) Councils, at Nicæa and Ephesus, and designated the latter
   as he deutera sunodos, as a plain token that it did not ascribe such a
   high rank to the assembly at Constantinople.  It might perhaps be
   objected that only the Monophysites, who notoriously ruled the
   Robber-Synod, used this language; but the most determined opponent of
   the Monophysites, their accuser, Bishop Eusebius of Dorylæum, in like
   manner also brought forward only the two Synods of Nicæa and Ephesus,
   and declared that "he held to the faith of the three hundred and
   eighteen Fathers assembled at Nicæa, and to all that was done at the
   great and Holy Synod at Ephesus."

   The Creed of Constantinople appears for the first time to have been
   highly honoured at the fourth General Council, which had it recited
   after that of Nicæa, and thus solemnly approved it.  Since then this
   Synod has been universally honoured as ecumenical by the Greeks, and
   was mentioned by the Emperor Justinian with the Councils of Nicæa,
   Ephesus, and Chalcedon, as of equal rank. [236]

   But in the West, and especially in Rome, however satisfied people were
   with the decree of faith enacted by this Synod, and its completion of
   the creed, yet its third canon, respecting the rank of Constantinople,
   for a long time proved a hindrance to its acknowledgment.  This was
   especially shown at the Council of Chalcedon, and during the time
   immediately following.  When at that Council the creed of
   Constantinople was praised, repeated, and confirmed the Papal Legates
   fully concurred; but when the Council also renewed and confirmed the
   third canon of Constantinople, the Legates left the assembly, lodged a
   protest against it on the following day, and declared that the rules of
   the hundred and fifty bishops at Constantinople were never inserted
   among the Synodal canons (which were recognised at Rome).  The same was
   mentioned by Pope Leo himself, who, immediately after the close of the
   Council of Chalcedon wrote to Bishop Anatolius of Constantinople:
   "that document of certain bishops (i.e. the third canon of
   Constantinople) was never brought by your predecessors to the knowledge
   of the Apostolic See." [237]   Leo also, in his 105th letter to the
   Empress Pulcheria, speaks just as depreciatingly of this Council of
   Constantinople; and Quesnel is entirely wrong in maintaining that the
   Papal Legates at the Synod of Chalcedon at first practically
   acknowledged the validity of the third canon of Constantinople.  Bishop
   Eusebius of Dorylæum was equally mistaken in maintaining at Chalcedon
   itself, that the third canon had been sanctioned by the Pope; and we
   shall have occasion further on, in the history of the Council of
   Chalcedon, to show the untenable character of both statements.

   Pope Felix III. took the same view as Pope Leo, when, in his letter to
   the monks at Constantinople and Bithynia in 485, he only spoke of three
   General Councils at Nicæa, Ephesus, and Chalcedon; neither did his
   successor Gelasius (492-496) in his genuine decree, De libris
   recipiendis, mention this Synod.  It may certainly be said, on the
   other hand, that in the sixth century its ecumenical character had come
   to be most distinctly acknowledged in the Latin Church also, and, as we
   have seen above, had been expressly affirmed by the Popes Vigilius,
   Pelagius II., and Gregory the Great.  But this acknowledgment, even
   when it is not expressly stated, only referred to the decrees on faith
   of the Council of Constantinople, and not to its canons, as we have
   already observed in reference to the third and sixth of them.

   Council of Constantinople.

   a.d. 382.

   The Synodical Letter. [238]

   To the right honourable lords our right reverend brethren and
   colleagues, Damasus, Ambrosius, Britton, Valerianus, Ascholius,
   Anemius, Basilius and the rest of the holy bishops assembled in the
   great city of Rome, the holy synod of the orthodox bishops assembled at
   the great city of Constantinople sends greeting in the Lord.

   To recount all the sufferings inflicted on us by the power of the
   Arians, and to attempt to give information to your reverences, as
   though you were not already well acquainted with them, might seem
   superfluous.  For we do not suppose your piety to hold what is
   befalling us as of such secondary importance as that you stand in any
   need of information on matters which cannot but evoke your sympathy.
   Nor indeed were the storms which beset us such as to escape notice from
   their insignificance.  Our persecutions are but of yesterday.  The
   sound of them still rings in the ears alike of those who suffered them
   and of those whose love made the sufferers' pain their own.  It was but
   a day or two ago, so to speak, that some released from chains in
   foreign lands returned to their own churches through manifold
   afflictions; of others who had died in exile the relics were brought
   home; others again, even after their return from exile, found the
   passion of the heretics still at the boiling heat, and, slain by them
   with stones as was the blessed Stephen, met with a sadder fate in their
   own than in a stranger's land.  Others, worn away with various
   cruelties, still bear in their bodies the scars of their wounds and the
   marks of Christ.  Who could tell the tale of fines, of
   disfranchisements, of individual confiscations, of intrigues, of
   outrages, of prisons?  In truth all kinds of tribulation were wrought
   out beyond number in us, perhaps because we were paying the penalty of
   sins, perhaps because the merciful God was trying us by means of the
   multitude of our sufferings.  For these all thanks to God, who by means
   of such afflictions trained his servants and, according to the
   multitude of his mercies, brought us again to refreshment.  We indeed
   needed long leisure, time, and toil to restore the church once more,
   that so, like physicians healing the body after long sickness and
   expelling its disease by gradual treatment, we might bring her back to
   her ancient health of true religion.  It is true that on the whole we
   seem to have been delivered from the violence of our persecutions and
   to be just now recovering the churches which have for a long time been
   the prey of the heretics.  But wolves are troublesome to us who, though
   they have been driven from the fold, yet harry the flock up and down
   the glades, daring to hold rival assemblies, stirring seditious among
   the people, and shrinking from nothing which can do damage to the
   churches.  So, as we have already said, we needs must labour all the
   longer.  Since, however, you showed your brotherly love to us by
   inviting us (as though we were your own members) by the letters of our
   most religious emperor to the synod which you are gathering by divine
   permission at Rome, to the end that since we alone were then condemned
   to suffer persecution, you should not now, when our emperors are at one
   with us as to true religion, reign apart from us, but that we, to use
   the Apostle's phrase, should reign with you, our prayer was, if it were
   possible, all in company to leave our churches, and rather gratify our
   longing to see you than consult their needs.  For who will give us
   wings as of a dove, and we will fly and be at rest?  But this course
   seemed likely to leave the churches who were just recovering quite
   undefended, and the undertaking was to most of us impossible, for, in
   accordance witch the letters sent a year ago from your holiness after
   the synod at Aquileia to the most pious emperor Theodosius, we had
   journeyed to Constantinople, equipped only for travelling so far as
   Constantinople, and bringing the consent of the bishops remaining in
   the provinces of this synod alone.  We had been in no expectation of
   any longer journey nor had heard a word about it, before our arrival at
   Constantinople.  In addition to all this, and on account of the narrow
   limits of the appointed time which allowed of no preparation for a
   longer journey, nor of communicating with the bishops of our communion
   in the provinces and of obtaining their consent, the journey to Rome
   was for the majority impossible.  We have therefore adopted the next
   best course open to us under the circumstances, both for the better
   administration of the church, and for manifesting our love towards you,
   by strongly urging our most venerated, and honoured colleagues and
   brother bishops Cyriacus, Eusebius and Priscianus, to consent to travel
   to you.

   Through them we wish to make it plain that our disposition is all for
   peace with unity for its sole object, and that we are full of zeal for
   the right faith.  For we, whether we suffered persecutions, or
   afflictions, or the threats of emperors, or the cruelties of princes,
   or any other trial at the hands of heretics, have undergone all for the
   sake of the evangelic faith, ratified by the three hundred and eighteen
   fathers at Nicæa in Bithynia.  This is the faith which ought to be
   sufficient for you, for us, for all who wrest not the word of the true
   faith; for it is the ancient faith; it is the faith of our baptism; it
   is the faith that teaches us to believe in the name of the Father, of
   the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  According to this faith there is one
   Godhead, Power and Substance of the Father and of the Son and of the
   Holy Ghost; the dignity being equal, and the majesty being equal in
   three perfect hypostases, i.e. three perfect persons.  Thus there is no
   room for the heresy of Sabellius by the confusion of the hypostases,
   i.e. the destruction of the personalities; thus the blasphemy of the
   Eunomians, of the Arians, and of the Pneumatomachi is nullified, which
   divides the substance, the nature, and the godhead, and super-induces
   on the uncreated consubstantial and co-eternal Trinity a nature
   posterior, created and of a different substance.  We moreover preserve
   unperverted the doctrine of the incarnation of the Lord, holding the
   tradition that the dispensation of the flesh is neither soulless nor
   mindless nor imperfect; and knowing full well that God's Word was
   perfect before the ages, and became perfect man in the last days for
   our salvation.

   Let this suffice for a summary of the doctrine which is fearlessly and
   frankly preached by us, and concerning which you will be able to be
   still further satisfied if you will deign to read the tome of the synod
   of Antioch, and also that tome issued last year by the Ecumenical
   Council held at Constantinople, in which we have set forth our
   confession of the faith at greater length, and have appended an
   anathema against the heresies which innovators have recently inscribed.

   Now as to the particular administration of individual churches, an
   ancient custom, as you know, has obtained, confirmed by the enactment
   of the holy fathers of Nicæa, that in every province, the bishops of
   the province, and, with their consent, the neighbouring bishops with
   them, should perform ordinations as expediency may require.  In
   conforming with these customs note that other churches have been
   administered by us and the priests of the most famous churches publicly
   appointed.  Accordingly over the new made (if the expression be
   allowable) church at Constantinople, which, as through from a lion's
   mouth, we have lately snatched by God's mercy from the blasphemy of the
   heretics, we have ordained bishop the right reverend and most religious
   Nectarius, in the presence of the Ecumenical Council, with common
   consent, before the most religious emperor Theodosius, and with the
   assent of all the clergy and of the whole city.  And over the most
   ancient and truly apostolic church in Syria, where first the noble name
   of Christians was given them, the bishops of the province and of the
   eastern diocese have met together and canonically ordained bishop the
   right reverend and most religious Flavianus, with the consent of all
   the church, who as though with one voice joined in expressing their
   respect for him.  This rightful ordination also received the sanction
   of the General Council.  Of the church at Jerusalem, mother of all the
   churches, we make known that the right reverend and most religious
   Cyril is bishop, who was some time ago canonically ordained by the
   bishops of the province, and has in several places fought a good fight
   against the Arians.  We beseech your reverence to rejoice at what has
   thus been rightly and canonically settled by us, by the intervention of
   spiritual love and by the influence of the fear of the Lord, compelling
   the feelings of men, and making the edification of churches of more
   importance than individual grace or favour.  Thus since among us there
   is agreement in the faith and Christian charity has been established,
   we shall cease to use the phrase condemned by the apostles, I am of
   Paul and I of Apollos and I of Cephas, and all appearing as Christ's,
   who in us is not divided, by God's grace we will keep the body of the
   church unrent, and will boldly stand at the judgment seat of the Lord.

   Historical Introduction.

   (Bossuet, Def. Cler. Gall., Lib. vij., Cap. ix. et seqq.  Abridged.
   Translation by Allies.)

   The innovation of Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, is known; how he
   divided into two the person of Christ.  Pope St. Celestine, watchful,
   according to his office, over the affairs of the Church, had charged
   the blessed Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria, to send him a certain report
   of the doctrine of Nestorius, already in bad repute.  Cyril declares
   this in his letter to Nestorius; and so he writes to Celestine a
   complete account, and sets forth the doctrines of Nestorius and his
   own; he sends him two letters from himself to Nestorius, who likewise,
   by his own letters and explanations, endeavoured to draw Celestine to
   his side.  Thus the holy Pontiff, having been most fully informed by
   letters from both sides, is thus inquired of by Cyril.  "We have not
   confidently abstained from Communion with him (Nestorius) before
   informing you of this; condescend, therefore, to unfold your judgment,
   that we may clearly know whether we ought to communicate with him who
   cherishes such erroneous doctrine."  And he adds, that his judgment
   should be written to the other Bishops also, "that all with one mind
   may hold firm in one sentence."  Here is the Apostolic See manifestly
   consulted by so great a man, presiding over the second, or at least the
   third, Patriarchal See, and its judgment awaited; and nothing remained
   but that Celestine, being duly consulted, should perform his Apostolic
   office.  But how he did this, the Acts have shewn.  In those Acts he
   not only approves the letters and doctrine of Cyril, but disapproves,
   too, the perverse dogma of Nestorius, and that distinctly, because he
   was unwilling to call the blessed Virgin Mother of God:  and he decrees
   that he should be deprived of the Episcopate and Communion unless,
   within ten days from the date of the announcing of the sentence, he
   openly rejects this faithless innovation, which endeavours to separate
   what Scripture joineth together--that is, the Person of Christ.  Here
   is the doctrine of Nestorius expressly disapproved, and a sentence of
   the Roman Pontiff on a matter of Faith most clearly pronounced under
   threat of deposition and excommunication:  then, that nothing be
   wanting, the holy Pope commits his authority to Cyril to carry into
   execution that sentence "associating," he saith to Cyril, "the
   authority of our See, and using our person, and place, with power."  So
   to Cyril; so to Nestorius himself; so to the clergy of Constantinople;
   so to John of Antioch, then the Bishop of the third or fourth
   Patriarchal See; so to Juvenal, Bishop of the Holy City, whom the
   Council of Nice had ordered to be especially honoured:  so he writes to
   the other Bishops also, that the sentence given may be duly and in
   order made known to all.  Cyril proceeds to execute his office, and
   performs all that he had been commanded.  He promulgates and executes
   the decrees of Celestine; declares to Nestorius, that after the ten
   days prescribed and set forth by Celestine, he would have no portion,
   intercourse, or place with the priesthood.  Nothing evidently is
   wanting to the Apostolical authority being most fully exercised.

   But Nestorius, bishop of the royal city, possessed such influence, had
   deceived men's minds with such an appearance of piety, had gained so
   many bishops and enjoyed such favour with the younger Theodosius and
   the great men, that he could easily throw everything into commotion;
   and thus there was need of an Ecumenical Council, the question being
   most important, and the person of the highest dignity; because many
   bishops, amongst these almost all of the East--that is, of the
   Patriarchate of Antioch, and the Patriarch John himself--were ill
   disposed to Cyril, and seemed to favour Nestorius:  because men's
   feelings were divided, and the whole empire of the East seemed to
   fluctuate between Cyril and Nestorius.  Such was the need of an
   Ecumenical Council.

   The Emperor, moved by these and other reasons, wrote to Cyril,--"It is
   our will that the holy doctrine be discussed and examined in a sacred
   Synod, and that be ratified which appeareth agreeable to the right
   faith, whether the wrong party be pardoned by the Fathers or no."

   Here we see three things:  First, after the judgment of St. Celestine,
   another is still required, that of the Council; secondly, that these
   two things would rest with the Fathers, to judge of doctrine and of
   persons; thirdly, that the judgment of the Council would be decisive
   and final.  He adds, "those who everywhere preside over the Priesthood,
   and through whom we ourselves are and shall be professing the truth,
   must be judges of this matter."  See on whose faith we rest.  See in
   whose judgment is the final and irreversible authority.

   Both the Emperor affirmed, and the bishops confessed, that this was
   done according to the Ecclesiastical Canons.  And so all, and Celestine
   himself, prepared themselves for the Council.  Cyril does no more,
   though named by Celestine to execute the pontifical decree, Nestorius
   remained in his original rank; the sentence of the universal Council is
   awaited; and the Emperor had expressly decreed, "that before the
   assembling and common sentence of the most holy Council, no change
   should be made in any matter at all, on any private authority."
   Rightly, and in order; for this was demanded by the majesty of an
   universal Council.  Wherefore, both Cyril obeyed and the bishops
   rested.  And it was established, that although the sentence of the
   Roman Pontiff on matters of Faith, and on persons judged for violation
   of the Faith, had been passed and promulged, all was suspended, while
   the authority of the universal Council was awaited.

   Having gone over what preceded the Council, we review the acts of the
   Council itself, and begin with the first course of proceeding.  After,
   therefore, the bishops and Nestorius himself were come to Ephesus, the
   universal Council began, Cyril being president, and representing
   Celestine, as being appointed by the Pontiff himself to execute his
   sentence.  In the first course of proceeding this was done.  First, the
   above-mentioned letter of the Emperor was read, that an Ecumenical
   Council should be held, and all proceedings in the mean time be
   suspended; this letter, I say, was read, and placed on the Acts, and it
   was approved by the Fathers, that all the decrees of Celestine in the
   matter of Nestorius had been suspended until the holy Council should
   give its sentence.  You will ask if it was the will of the Council
   merely that the Emperor should be allowed to prohibit, in the interim,
   effect being given to the sentence of the Apostolic See.  Not so,
   according to the Acts; but rather, by the intervention of a General
   Council's authority (the convocation of which, according to the
   discipline of those times, was left to the Emperor), the Council itself
   understood that all proceedings were of course suspended, and depended
   on the sentence of the Council.  Wherefore, though the decree of the
   Pontiff had been promulged and notified, and the ten days had long been
   past, Nestorius was held by the Council itself to be a bishop, and
   called by the name of most religious bishop, and by that name, too,
   thrice cited and summoned to take his seat with the other bishops in
   the holy Council; for this expression, "to take his seat," is
   distinctly written; and it is added, "in order to answer to what was
   charged against him."  For it was their full purpose that he should
   recognise in whatever way, the Ecumenical Council, as he would then
   afterwards be, beyond doubt, answerable to it; but he refused to come,
   and chose to have his doors besieged with an armed force, that no one
   might approach him.

   Thereupon, as the Emperor commanded, and the Canons required, the rule
   of Faith was set forth, and the Nicene Creed read, as the standard to
   which all should be referred, and then the letters of Cyril and
   Nestorius were examined in order.  The letter of Cyril was first
   brought before the judgment of the Council.  That letter, I mean,
   concerning the Faith, to Nestorius, so expressly approved by Pope
   Celestine, of which he had declared to Cyril, "We see that you hold and
   maintain all that we hold and maintain"; which, by the decree against
   Nestorius, published to all Churches, he had approved, and wishes to be
   considered as a canonical monition against Nestorius:  that letter, I
   repeat, was examined, at the proposition of Cyril himself, in these
   words:  "I am persuaded that I have in nothing departed from the
   orthodox Faith, or the Nicene Creed; wherefore I beseech your Holiness
   to set forth openly whether I have written this correctly, blamelessly,
   and in accordance with that holy Council."

   And are there those who say that questions concerning the Faith, once
   judged by the Roman Pontiff on his Apostolical authority, are examined
   in general Councils, in order to understand their contents, but not to
   decide on their substance, as being still a matter of question?  Let
   them hear Cyril, the President of the Council; let them attend to what
   he proposes for the inquiry of the Council; and though he were
   conscious of no error in himself yet, not to trust himself, he asked
   for the sentence of the Council in these words "whether I have written
   correctly and blamelessly, or not."  This Cyril, the chief of the
   Council, proposes for their consideration.  Who ever even heard it
   whispered that, after a final and irreversible judgment of the Church
   on a matter of Faith, any such inquiry or question was made?  It was
   never done, for that would be to doubt about the Faith itself, when
   declared and discussed.  But this was done after the judgment of Pope
   Celestine; neither Cyril, nor anyone else, thought of any other
   course:  that, therefore, was not a final and irreversible judgment.

   In answer to this question the Fathers in order give their
   judgment--"that the Nicene Creed, and the letter of Cyril, in all
   things agree and harmonise."  Here is inquiry and examination, and then
   judgment.  The Acts speak for themselves--we say not here a word.

   Next that letter of Nestorius was produced, which Celestine had
   pronounced blasphemous and impious.  It is read:  then at the instance
   of Cyril it is examined, "whether this, too, be agreeable to the Faith
   set forth by the holy Council of the Nicene Fathers, or not."  It is
   precisely the same form according to which Cyril's letter was
   examined.  The Fathers, in order, give judgment that it disagreed from
   the Nicene Creed, and was, therefore, censurable.  The letter of
   Nestorius is disapproved in the same manner, by the same rule, by which
   that of Cyril was approved.  Here, twice in the same proceeding of the
   Council of Ephesus, a judgment of the Roman Pontiff concerning the
   Catholic Faith, uttered and published, is reconsidered.  What he had
   approved, and what he had disapproved, is equally examined, and, only
   after examination, confirmed.

   In the mean time, the bishops Arcadius and Projectus, and the presbyter
   Philip, had been chosen by Celestine to be present at the Council of
   Ephesus, with a special commission from the Apostolic See, and the
   whole Council of the West.  So they come from Rome to Ephesus, and
   appear at the holy Council, and here the second procedure commences.

   After reading the letter of Celestine, the Legates, in pursuance, say
   to the bishops:  "Let your Holiness consider the form of the letters of
   the holy and venerable Pope Celestine the Bishop, who hath exhorted
   your Holiness, not as instructing those who are ignorant, but as
   reminding those who are aware:  in order that you may command to be
   completely and finally settled according to the Canon of our common
   Faith, and the utility of the Catholic Church, what he has before
   determined, and has now the goodness to remind you of."  This is the
   advantage of a Council; after whose sentence there is no new
   discussion, or new judgment, but merely execution.  And this the
   Legates request to be commanded by the Council, in which they recognise
   that supreme authority.

   It behoved, also, that the Legates, sent to the Council on a special
   mission, should understand whether the proceedings against Nestorius
   had been pursued according to the requisition of the Canons, and due
   respect to the Apostolic See.  This we have already often said.
   Wherefore, with reason, they require the Acts to be communicated, "that
   we, too," say they, "may confirm them."  The proceedings themselves
   will declare what that confirmation means.  After that, at the request
   of the Legates, the Acts against Nestorius were given them, they thus
   report about them at the third procedure:  "We have found all things
   judged canonically, and according to the Church's discipline."
   Therefore judgments of the Apostolic See are canonically and, according
   to the Church's discipline, reconsidered, after deliberation, in a
   General Council, and judgment passed upon them.  After the Legates had
   approved the Acts against Nestorius communicated to them, they request
   that all which had been read and done at Ephesus from the beginning,
   should be read afresh in public Session, "in order," they say, "that
   obeying the form of the most holy Pope Celestine, who hath committed
   this care to us, we may be enabled to confirm the judgment also of your
   Holiness."  After these all had been read afresh, and the Legates
   agreed to them, Cyril proposes to the holy Council, "That the Legates,
   by their signature, as was customary, should make plain and manifest
   their canonical agreement with the Council."  To this question of Cyril
   the Council thus answers, and decrees that the Legates, by their
   subscription, confirm the Acts; by which place this confirmation,
   spoken of by the Council, is clearly nothing else but to make their
   assent plain and manifest, as Cyril proposed.

   Finally, Celestine himself, after the conclusion of the whole matter,
   sends a letter to the holy Council of Ephesus, which he thus begins:
   "At length we must rejoice at the conclusion of evils."  The learned
   reader understands where he recognizes the conclusion; that is, after
   the condemnation of Nestorius by the infallible authority of an
   Ecumenical Council, viz., of the whole Catholic Church.  He proceeds:
   "We see, that you, with us, have executed this matter so faithfully
   transacted."  All decree, and all execute, that is, by giving a common
   judgment.  Whence Celestine adds, "We have been informed of a just
   deposition, and a still juster exaltation:"  the deposition of
   Nestorius, begun, indeed, by the Roman See, but brought to a conclusion
   by the sentence of the Council; to a full and complete settlement, as
   we have seen above:  the exaltation of Maximianus, who was substituted
   in place of Nestorius immediately after the Ephesine decrees; this is
   the conclusion of the question.  Even Celestine himself recognises this
   conclusion to lie not in his own examination and judgment, but in that
   of an Ecumenical Council.  And this was done in that Council in which
   it is admitted that the authority of the Apostolic See was most clearly
   set forth, not only by words, but by deeds, of any since the birth of
   Christ.  At least the Holy Council gives credence to Philip uttering
   these true and magnificent encomiums, concerning the dignity of the
   Apostolic See, and "Peter the head and pillar of the Faith, and
   foundation of the Catholic Church, and by Christ's authority
   administering the keys, who to this very time lives ever, and exercises
   judgment, in his successors."  This, he says, after having seen all the
   Acts of the Council itself, which we have mentioned, so that we may
   indeed understand, that all these privileges of Peter and the Apostolic
   See entirely agree with the decrees of the Council, and the judgment
   entered into afresh, and deliberation upon matters of Faith held after
   the Apostolic See.

   Note on the Emperor's Edict to the Synod.

   Neither of the Emperors could personally attend the Council of Ephesus
   and accordingly Theodosius II. appointed the Count Candidian, Captain
   of the imperial bodyguard, the protector of the council, to sit in the
   room of the Emperors.  In making this appointment he addressed an edict
   to the synod which will be found in the Concilia and of which Hefele
   gives the following synopsis.

   (Hefele, Hist. of the Councils, Vol. III., p. 43.)

   Candidian is to take no immediate part in the discussions on contested
   points of faith, for it is not becoming that one who does not belong to
   the number of the bishops should mix himself up in the examination and
   decision of theological controversies.  On the contrary, Candidian was
   to remove from the city the monks and laymen who had come or should
   afterwards come to Ephesus out of curiosity, so that disorder and
   confusion should not be caused by those who were in no way needed for
   the examination of the sacred doctrines.  He was, besides, to watch
   lest the discussions among the members of the Synod themselves should
   degenerate into violent disputes and hinder the more exact
   investigation of truth; and, on the contrary, see that every statement
   should be heard with attention, and that every one put forward in view,
   or his objections, without let or hindrance, so that at last an
   unanimous decision might be arrived at in peace by the holy Synod.  But
   above all, Candidian was to take care that no member of the Synod
   should attempt, before the close of the transactions, to go home, or to
   the court, or elsewhere.  Moreover, he was not to allow that any other
   matter of controversy should be taken into consideration before the
   settlement of the principal point of doctrine before the Council.

   Session I.

   [Before the arrival of the Papal Legates.]

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia Tom. III., col. 459 et seqq.)

   The Nicene Synod set forth this faith:

   We believe in one God, etc.

   When this creed had been recited, Peter the Presbyter of Alexandria,
   and primicerius of the notaries said:

   We have in our hands the letter of the most holy and most reverend
   archbishop Cyril, which he wrote to the most reverend Nestorius, filled
   with counsel and advice, on account of his aberration from the right
   faith.  I will read this if your holiness [i.e., the holy Synod] so
   orders....The letter began as follows:

   Kataphluarousi men, hos akouo, k.t.l.

   Intelligo quosdam meæ, etc.

   The Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 315; Migne, Patr. Græc.,
   Tom. LXXVII. [Cyril., Opera, Tom. X.]; Epist. iv., col. 43.)

   To the most religious and beloved of God, fellow minister Nestorius,
   Cyril sends greeting in the Lord.

   I hear that some are rashly talking of the estimation in which I hold
   your holiness, and that this is frequently the case especially at the
   times that meetings are held of those in authority.  And perchance they
   think in so doing to say something agreeable to you, but they speak
   senselessly, for they have suffered no injustice at my hands, but have
   been exposed by me only to their profit; this man as an oppressor of
   the blind and needy, and that as one who wounded his mother with a
   sword.  Another because he stole, in collusion with his waiting maid,
   another's money, and had always laboured under the imputation of such
   like crimes as no one would wish even one of his bitterest enemies to
   be laden with. [239]   I take little reckoning of the words of such
   people, for the disciple is not above his Master, nor would I stretch
   the measure of my narrow brain above the Fathers, for no matter what
   path of life one pursues it is hardly possible to escape the smirching
   of the wicked, whose mouths are full of cursing and bitterness, and who
   at the last must give an account to the Judge of all.

   But I return to the point which especially I had in mind.  And now I
   urge you, as a brother in the Lord, to propose the word of teaching and
   the doctrine of the faith with all accuracy to the people, and to
   consider that the giving of scandal to one even of the least of those
   who believe in Christ, exposes a body to the unbearable indignation of
   God.  And of how great diligence and skill there is need when the
   multitude of those grieved is so great, so that we may administer the
   healing word of truth to them that seek it.  But this we shall
   accomplish most excellently if we shall turn over the words of the holy
   Fathers, and are zealous to obey their commands, proving ourselves,
   whether we be in the faith according to that which is written, and
   conform our thoughts to their upright and irreprehensible teaching.

   The holy and great Synod therefore says, that the only begotten Son,
   born according to nature of God the Father, very God of very God, Light
   of Light, by whom the Father made all things, came down, and was
   incarnate, and was made man, suffered, and rose again the third day,
   and ascended into heaven.  These words and these decrees we ought to
   follow, considering what is meant by the Word of God being incarnate
   and made man.  For we do not say that the nature of the Word was
   changed and became flesh, or that it was converted into a whole man
   consisting of soul and body; but rather that the Word having personally
   united to himself flesh animated by a rational soul, did in an
   ineffable and inconceivable manner become man, and was called the Son
   of Man, not merely as willing or being pleased to be so called, neither
   on account of taking to himself a person, but because the two natures
   being brought together in a true union, there is of both one Christ and
   one Son; for the difference of the natures is not taken away by the
   union, but rather the divinity and the humanity make perfect for us the
   one Lord Jesus Christ by their ineffable and inexpressible union.  So
   then he who had an existence before all ages and was born of the
   Father, is said to have been born according to the flesh of a woman,
   not as though his divine nature received its beginning of existence in
   the holy Virgin, for it needed not any second generation after that of
   the Father (for it would be absurd and foolish to say that he who
   existed before all ages, coeternal with the Father, needed any second
   beginning of existence), but since, for us and for our salvation, he
   personally united to himself an human body, and came forth of a woman,
   he is in this way said to be born after the flesh; for he was not first
   born a common man of the holy Virgin, and then the Word came down and
   entered into him, but the union being made in the womb itself, he is
   said to endure a birth after the flesh, ascribing to himself the birth
   of his own flesh.  On this account we say that he suffered and rose
   again; not as if God the Word suffered in his own nature stripes, or
   the piercing of the nails, or any other wounds, for the Divine nature
   is incapable of suffering, inasmuch as it is incorporeal, but since
   that which had become his own body suffered in this way, he is also
   said to suffer for us; for he who is in himself incapable of suffering
   was in a suffering body.  In the same manner also we conceive
   respecting his dying; for the Word of God is by nature immortal and
   incorruptible, and life and life-giving; since, however, his own body
   did, as Paul says, by the grace of God taste death for every man, he
   himself is said to have suffered death for us, not as if he had any
   experience of death in his own nature (for it would be madness to say
   or think this), but because, as I have just said, his flesh tasted
   death.  In like manner his flesh being raised again, it is spoken of as
   his resurrection, not as if he had fallen into corruption (God forbid),
   but because his own body was raised again.  We, therefore, confess one
   Christ and Lord, not as worshipping. a man with the Word (lest this
   expression "with the Word" should suggest to the mind the idea of
   division), but worshipping him as one and the same, forasmuch as the
   body of the Word, with which he sits with the Father, is not separated
   from the Word himself, not as if two sons were sitting with him, but
   one by the union with the flesh.  If, however, we reject the personal
   union as impossible or unbecoming, we fall into the error of speaking
   of two sons, for it will be necessary to distinguish, and to say, that
   he who was properly man was honoured with the appellation of Son, and
   that he who is properly the Word of God, has by nature both the name
   and the reality of Sonship.  We must not, therefore, divide the one
   Lord Jesus Christ into two Sons.  Neither will it at all avail to a
   sound faith to hold, as some do, an union of persons; for the Scripture
   has not said that the Word united to himself the person of man, but
   that he was made flesh.  This expression, however, "the Word was made
   flesh," can mean nothing else but that he partook of flesh and blood
   like to us; he made our body his own, and came forth man from a woman,
   not casting off his existence as God, or his generation of God the
   Father, but even in taking to himself flesh remaining what he was.
   This the declaration of the correct faith proclaims everywhere.  This
   was the sentiment of the holy Fathers; therefore they ventured to call
   the holy Virgin, the Mother of God, not as if the nature of the Word or
   his divinity had its beginning from the holy Virgin, but because of her
   was born that holy body with a rational soul, to which the Word being
   personally united is said to be born according to the flesh.  These
   things, therefore, I now write unto you for the love of Christ,
   beseeching you as a brother, and testifying to you before Christ and
   the elect angels, that you would both think and teach these things with
   us, that the peace of the Churches may be preserved and the bond of
   concord and love continue unbroken amongst the Priests of God.

   Extracts from the Acts.

   Session I.  (Continued).

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 462.)

   And after the letter was read, Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria, said:
   This holy and great Synod has heard what I wrote to the most religious
   Nestorius, defending the right faith.  I think that I have in no
   respect departed from the true statement of the faith, that is from the
   creed set forth by the holy and great synod formerly assembled at
   Nice.  Wherefore I desire your holiness [i.e. the Council] to say
   whether rightly and blamelessly and in accordance with that holy synod
   I have written these things or no.

   [A number of bishops then gave their opinion, all favourable to Cyril;
   after these individual opinions the Acts continue (col. 491):]

   And all the rest of the bishops in the order of their rank deposed to
   the same things, and so believed, according as the Fathers had set
   forth, and as the Epistle of the most holy Archbishop Cyril to
   Nestorius the bishop declared.

   Palladius, the bishop of Amasea, said, The next thing to be done is to
   read the letter of the most reverend Nestorius, of which the most
   religious presbyter Peter made mention; so that we may understand
   whether or no it agrees with the exposition of the Nicene fathers....

   And after this letter was read, Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria, said,
   What seems good to this holy and great synod with regard to the letter
   just read?  Does it also seem to be consonant to the faith set forth by
   the holy Synod assembled in the city of Nice?

   [The bishops, then as before, individually express their opinion, and
   at last the Acts continue (col. 502):]

   All the bishops cried out together:  Whoever does not anathematize
   Nestorius let him be anathema.  Such an one the right faith
   anathematizes; such an one the holy Synod anathematizes.  Whoever
   communicates with Nestorius let him be anathema!  We anathematize all
   the apostles of Nestorius:  we all anathematize Nestorius as a
   heretic:  let all such as communicate with Nestorius be anathema, etc.,
   etc.

   Juvenal, the bishop of Jerusalem said:  Let the letter of the most holy
   and reverend Cælestine, archbishop of the Church of Rome, be read,
   which he wrote concerning the faith.

   [The letter of Cælestine was read and no opinion expressed.]

   Peter the presbyter of Alexandria, and primicerius of the notaries
   said:  Altogether in agreement with the things just read are those
   which his holiness Cyril our most pious bishop wrote, which I now have
   at hand, and will read if your piety so shall order.

   [The letter was read which begins thus:]

   Tou Soteros hemon legontos enargos, k.t.l.

   Cum Salvator noster, etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Historical Introduction to St. Cyril's Anathematisms.

   There has been some difference of opinion among the learned as to
   whether St. Cyril's Synodal letter which has at its end the anathemas
   against Nestorius, which hereafter follow, was formally approved at the
   Council of Ephesus.  The matter is one only of archeological and
   historical interest, for from a theological point of view the question
   is entirely uninteresting, since there is no possible doubt that the
   synod endorsed St. Cyril's teaching and for that express reason
   proceeded at their first session to excommunicate Nestorius.  Further
   there is no one that disputes that the anathematisms were received at
   the next General Council. i.e., of Chalcedon, only twenty years later,
   and that Theodoret was condemned by the Fifth Ecumenical Council
   because he wrote against these very Anathemas.  This being the case, to
   those who value the decrees of Ecumenical Councils because of their
   ecumenical character, it is quite immaterial whether these
   anathematisms were received and approved by the third Council or no,
   provided, which is indisputably the case, they have been approved by
   some one council of ecumenical authority, so as to become thereby part
   and parcel of the ecumenical faith of the Church.

   But the historical question is one of some interest, and I shall very
   briefly consider it.  We have indeed the "Acta" of this council, but I
   cannot but agree with the very learned Jesuit Petavius and the Gallican
   Tillemont in thinking them in a very unsatisfactory condition.  I am
   fully aware of the temerity of making such a suggestion, but I cannot
   help feeling that in the remarks of the Roman representatives,
   especially in those of the presbyter-legate, there is some
   anachronism.  Be this as it may, it is a fact that the Acts do not
   recite that this letter of Cyril's was read, nor do they state that the
   Anathemas were received.  I would suggest, however, that for those who
   defend John of Antioch, and criticise the action of St. Cyril, it is
   the height of inconsistency to deny that the Council adopted the
   Anathemas.  If it was the bitterly partisan assembly that they would
   have us believe, absolutely under the control of Cyril, there is
   nothing that, a priori, they would have been more sure to do than adopt
   the Anathemas which were universally looked upon as the very fulcrum on
   which the whole matter turned.

   Bishop Hefele was at first of opinion that the letter was merely read,
   being led to this conclusion by the silence of the Acts with regard to
   any acceptance of it, and indeed at first wrote on that side, but he
   afterwards saw grounds to change his mind and expresses them with his
   usual clearness, in the following words:

   (Hefele, Hist. of Councils. Vol. III., p. 48, note 2.)

   We were formerly of opinion that these anathematisms were read at
   Ephesus, but not expressly confirmed, as there is hardly anything on
   the subject in the Acts.  But in the Fifth Ecumenical Council (collatio
   vj.) it is said:  "The holy Council at Chalcedon approved this teaching
   of Cyril of blessed memory, and received his Synodical letters, to one
   of which are appended the xij. anathemas" (Mansi, t. ix., p. 341;
   Hardouin, t. iij., p. 167).  If, however, the anathematisms of Cyril
   were expressly confirmed at Chalcedon, there was even more reason for
   doing so at Ephesus.  And Ibas, in his well-known letter to Maris, says
   expressly that the Synod of Ephesus confirmed the anathematisms of
   Cyril, and the same was asserted even by the bishops of Antioch at
   Ephesus in a letter to the Emperor.

   From all these considerations it would seem that Tillemont's [240]
   conclusion is well founded that the Synod certainly discussed the
   anathemas of Cyril in detail, but that here, as in many other places,
   there are parts of the Acts lacking.  I shall add the opinion of
   Petavius.

   (Petavius, De Incarnatione, Lib. VI., cap. xvij.)

   The Acts do not tell us what judgment the Synod of Ephesus gave with
   respect to the third letter of Cyril, and with regard to the anathemas
   attached to it.  But the Acts in other respects also have not come down
   to us in their integrity.  That that third letter was received and
   approved by the Ephesine Council there can be no doubt, and this the
   Catholics shewed in their dispute with the Acephali in the Collation
   held at Constantinople under the Emperor Justinian in the year of
   Christ 811.  For at that memorable meeting something was shewn forth
   concerning this letter and its anathemas, which has a connexion with
   the matter in hand, and therefore must not be omitted.  At that meeting
   the Opposers, that is the Acephali, the enemies of the Council of
   Chalcedon, made this objection against that Council:  "The [letter] of
   the Twelve Anathemas which is inserted in the holy Council of Ephesus,
   and which you cannot deny to be synodical, why did not Chalcedon
   receive it?" etc., etc.

   From this it is evident that the prevailing opinion, then as now, was
   that the Twelve Anathemas were defined as part of the faith by the
   Council of Ephesus.  Perhaps I may close this treatment of the subject
   in the words of Denziger, being the caption he gives the xij.
   Anathematisms in his Enchiridion, under "Decrees of the Third
   Ecumenical Council, that of Ephesus."  "The Third Synod received these
   anathematisms; the Fourth Synod placed them in its Acts and styled the
   Epistles of Cyril Canonical'; the Fifth Synod defended them."

   The Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius with the XII. Anathematisms.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 395; Migne, Patr. Græc.,
   Tom. LXXVII. [Cyril, Opera, Tom. X.], col. 105 et seqq.)

   To the most reverend and God-loving fellow-minister Nestorius, Cyril
   and the synod assembled in Alexandria, of the Egyptian Province,
   Greeting in the Lord.

   When our Saviour says clearly:  "He that loveth father or mother more
   than me is not worthy of me:  and he that loveth son or daughter more
   than me is not worthy of me," what is to become of us, from whom your
   Holiness requires that we love you more than Christ the Saviour of us
   all?  Who can help us in the day of judgment, or what kind of excuse
   shall we find for thus keeping silence so long, with regard to the
   blasphemies made by you against him?  If you injured yourself alone, by
   teaching and holding such things, perhaps it would be less matter; but
   you have greatly scandalized the whole Church, and have cast among the
   people the leaven of a strange and new heresy.  And not to those there
   [i.e. at Constantinople] only; but also to those everywhere [the books
   of your explanation were sent].  How can we any longer, under these
   circumstances, make a defence for our silence, or how shall we not be
   forced to remember that Christ said:  "Think not that I am come to send
   peace on earth:  I came not to send peace, but a sword.  For I am come
   to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against
   her mother."  For if faith be injured, let there be lost the honour due
   to parents, as stale and tottering, let even the law of tender love
   towards children and brothers be silenced, let death be better to the
   pious than living; "that they might obtain a better resurrection," as
   it is written.

   Behold, therefore, how we, together with the holy synod which met in
   great Rome, presided over by the most holy and most reverend brother
   and fellow-minister, Celestine the Bishop, also testify by this third
   letter to you, and counsel you to abstain from these mischievous and
   distorted dogmas, which you hold and teach, and to receive the right
   faith, handed down to the churches from the beginning through the holy
   Apostles and Evangelists, who "were eye-witnesses, and ministers of the
   Word."  And if your holiness have not a mind to this according to the
   limits defined in the writings of our brother of blessed memory and
   most reverend fellow-minister Celestine, Bishop of the Church of Rome,
   be well assured then that you have no lot with us, nor place or
   standing (logon) among the priests and bishops of God.  For it is not
   possible for us to overlook the churches thus troubled, and the people
   scandalized, and the right faith set aside, and the sheep scattered by
   you, who ought to save them, if indeed we are ourselves adherents of
   the right faith, and followers of the devotion of the holy fathers.
   And we are in communion with all those laymen and clergymen cast out or
   deposed by your holiness on account of the faith; for it is not right
   that those, who resolved to believe rightly, should suffer by your
   choice; for they do well in opposing you.  This very thing you have
   mentioned in your epistle written to our most holy and fellow-bishop
   Celestine of great Rome.

   But it would not be sufficient for your reverence to confess with us
   only the symbol of the faith set out some time ago by the Holy Ghost at
   the great and holy synod convened in Nice:  for you have not held and
   interpreted it rightly, but rather perversely; even though you confess
   with your voice the form of words.  But in addition, in writing and by
   oath, you must confess that you also anathematize those polluted and
   unholy dogmas of yours, and that you will hold and teach that which we
   all, bishops, teachers, and leaders of the people both East and West,
   hold.  The holy synod of Rome and we all agreed on the epistle written
   to your Holiness from the Alexandrian Church as being right and
   blameless.  We have added to these our own letters and that which it is
   necessary for you to hold and teach, and what you should be careful to
   avoid.  Now this is the Faith of the Catholic and Apostolic Church to
   which all Orthodox Bishops, both East and West, agree:

   "We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things
   visible and invisible, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten
   Son of God, begotten of his Father, that is, of the substance of the
   Father; God of God, Light of Light, Very God of very God, begotten, not
   made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were
   made, both those in heaven and those in the earth.  Who for us men and
   for our salvation, came down, and was incarnate, and was made man.  He
   suffered, and rose again the third day.  He ascended into the heavens,
   from thence he shall come to judge both the quick and the dead.  And in
   the Holy Ghost:  But those that say, There was a time when he was not,
   and, before he was begotten he was not, and that he was made of that
   which previously was not, or that he was of some other substance or
   essence; and that the Son of God was capable of change or alteration;
   those the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes."

   Following in all points the confessions of the Holy Fathers which they
   made (the Holy Ghost speaking in them), and following the scope of
   their opinions, and going, as it were, in the royal way, we confess
   that the Only begotten Word of God, begotten of the same substance of
   the Father, True God from True God, Light from Light, through Whom all
   things were made, the things in heaven and the things in the earth,
   coming down for our salvation, making himself of no reputation (katheis
   heauton eis kenosin), was incarnate and made man; that is, taking flesh
   of the holy Virgin, and having made it his own from the womb, he
   subjected himself to birth for us, and came forth man from a woman,
   without casting off that which he was; but although he assumed flesh
   and blood, he remained what he was, God in essence and in truth.
   Neither do we say that his flesh was changed into the nature of
   divinity, nor that the ineffable nature of the Word of God was laid
   aside for the nature of flesh; for he is unchanged and absolutely
   unchangeable, being the same always, according to the Scriptures.  For
   although visible and a child in swaddling clothes, and even in the
   bosom of his Virgin Mother, he filled all creation as God, and was a
   fellow-ruler with him who begat him, for the Godhead is without
   quantity and dimension, and cannot have limits.

   Confessing the Word to be made one with the flesh according to
   substance, we adore one Son and Lord Jesus Christ:  we do not divide
   the God from the man, nor separate him into parts, as though the two
   natures were mutually united in him only through a sharing of dignity
   and authority (for that is a novelty and nothing else), neither do we
   give separately to the Word of God the name Christ and the same name
   separately to a different one born of a woman; but we know only one
   Christ, the Word from God the Father with his own Flesh.  For as man he
   was anointed with us, although it is he himself who gives the Spirit to
   those who are worthy and not in measure, according to the saying of the
   blessed Evangelist John.

   But we do not say that the Word of God dwelt in him as in a common man
   born of the holy Virgin, lest Christ be thought of as a God-bearing
   man; for although the Word tabernacled among us, it is also said that
   in Christ "dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily"; but we
   understand that he became flesh, not just as he is said to dwell in the
   saints, but we define that that tabernacling in him was according to
   equality (kata ton ison en auto tropon).  But being made one kata
   phusin, [241] and not converted into flesh, he made his indwelling in
   such a way, as we may say that the soul of man does in his own body.

   One therefore is Christ both Son and Lord, not as if a man had attained
   only such a conjunction with God as consists in a unity [242] of
   dignity alone or of authority.  For it is not equality of honour which
   unites natures; for then Peter and John, who were of equal honour with
   each other, being both Apostles and holy disciples [would have been
   one, and], yet the two are not one.  Neither do we understand the
   manner of conjunction to be apposition, for this does not suffice for
   natural oneness (pros henoson phusiken).  Nor yet according to relative
   participation, as we are also joined to the Lord, as it is written "we
   are one Spirit in him."  Rather we deprecate the term of "junction"
   (sunapheias) as not having sufficiently signified the oneness.  But we
   do not call the Word of God the Father, the God nor the Lord of Christ,
   lest we openly cut in two the one Christ, the Son and Lord, and fall
   under the charge of blasphemy, making him the God and Lord of himself.
   For the Word of God, as we have said already, was made hypostatically
   one in flesh, yet he is God of all and he rules all; but he is not the
   slave of himself, nor his own Lord.  For it is foolish, or rather
   impious, to think or teach thus.  For he said that God was his Father,
   although he was God by nature, and of his substance.  Yet we are not
   ignorant that while he remained God, he also became man and subject to
   God, according to the law suitable to the nature of the manhood.  But
   how could he become the God or Lord of himself?  Consequently as man,
   and with regard to the measure of his humiliation, it is said that he
   is equally with us subject to God; thus he became under the Law,
   although as God he spake the Law and was the Law-giver.

   We are careful also how we say about Christ:  "I worship the One
   clothed on account of the One clothing him, and on account of the
   Unseen, I worship the Seen."  It is horrible to say in this connexion
   as follows:  "The assumed as well as the assuming have the name of
   God."  For the saying of this divides again Christ into two, and puts
   the man separately by himself and God also by himself.  For this saying
   denies openly the Unity according to which one is not worshipped in the
   other, nor does God exist together with the other; but Jesus Christ is
   considered as One, the Only-begotten Son, to be honoured with one
   adoration together with his own flesh.

   We confess that he is the Son, begotten of God the Father, and
   Only-begotten God; and although according to his own nature he was not
   subject to suffering, yet he suffered for us in the flesh according to
   the Scriptures, and although impassible, yet in his Crucified Body he
   made his own the sufferings of his own flesh; and by the grace of God
   he tasted death for all:  he gave his own Body thereto, although he was
   by nature himself the life and the resurrection, in order that, having
   trodden down death by his unspeakable power, first in his own flesh, he
   might become the first born from the dead, and the first-fruits of them
   that slept.  And that he might make a way for the nature of man to
   attain incorruption, by the grace of God (as we just now said), he
   tasted death for every man, and after three days rose again, having
   despoiled hell.  So although it is said that the resurrection of the
   dead was through man, yet we understand that man to have been the Word
   of God, and the power of death was loosed through him, and he shall
   come in the fulness of time as the One Son and Lord, in the glory of
   the Father, in order to judge the world in righteousness, as it is
   written.

   We will necessarily add this also.  Proclaiming the death, according to
   the flesh, of the Only-begotten Son of God, that is Jesus Christ,
   confessing his resurrection from the dead, and his ascension into
   heaven, we offer the Unbloody Sacrifice in the churches, and so go on
   to the mystical thanksgivings, and are sanctified, having received his
   Holy Flesh and the Precious Blood of Christ the Saviour of us all.  And
   not as common flesh do we receive it; God forbid:  nor as of a man
   sanctified and associated with the Word according to the unity of
   worth, or as having a divine indwelling, but as truly the Life-giving
   and very flesh of the Word himself.  For he is the Life according to
   his nature as God, and when he became united to his Flesh, he made it
   also to be Life-giving, as also he said to us:  Verily, verily, I say
   unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his
   Blood.  For we must not think that it is flesh of a man like us (for
   how can the flesh of man be life-giving by its own nature?) but as
   having become truly the very own of him who for us both became and was
   called Son of Man.  Besides, what the Gospels say our Saviour said of
   himself, we do not divide between two hypostases or persons.  For
   neither is he, the one and only Christ, to be thought of as double,
   although of two (ek duo) and they diverse, yet he has joined them in an
   indivisible union, just as everyone knows a man is not double although
   made up of soul and body, but is one of both.  Wherefore when thinking
   rightly, we transfer the human and the divine to the same person (par'
   henos eiresthai).

   For when as God he speaks about himself:  "He who hath seen me hath
   seen the Father," and "I and my Father are one," we consider his
   ineffable divine nature according to which he is One with his Father
   through the identity of essence--"The image and impress and brightness
   of his glory."  But when not scorning the measure of his humanity, he
   said to the Jews:  "But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told
   you the truth."  Again no less than before we recognize that he is the
   Word of God from his identity and likeness to the Father and from the
   circumstances of his humanity.  For if it is necessary to believe that
   being by nature God, he became flesh, that is, a man endowed with a
   reasonable soul, what reason can certain ones have to be ashamed of
   this language about him, which is suitable to him as man?  For if he
   should reject the words suitable to him as man, who compelled him to
   become man like us?  And as he humbled himself to a voluntary abasement
   (kenosin) for us, for what cause can any one reject the words suitable
   to such abasement?  Therefore all the words which are read in the
   Gospels are to be applied to One Person, to One hypostasis of the Word
   Incarnate.  For the Lord Jesus Christ is One, according to the
   Scriptures, although he is called "the Apostle and High Priest of our
   profession," as offering to God and the Father the confession of faith
   which we make to him, and through him to God even the Father and also
   to the Holy Spirit; yet we say he is, according to nature, the
   Only-begotten of God.  And not to any man different from him do we
   assign the name of priesthood, and the thing, for he became "the
   Mediator between God and men," and a Reconciler unto peace, having
   offered himself as a sweet smelling savour to God and the Father.
   Therefore also he said:  "Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not; but
   a body hast thou prepared me:  In burnt offerings and sacrifices for
   sin thou hast had no pleasure.  Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume
   of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God."  For on
   account of us he offered his body as a sweet smelling savour, and not
   for himself; for what offering or sacrifice was needed for himself, who
   as God existed above all sins?  For "all have sinned and come short of
   the glory of God," so that we became prone to fall, and the nature of
   man has fallen into sin, yet not so he (and therefore we fall short of
   his glory).  How then can there be further doubt that the true Lamb
   died for us and on our account?  And to say that he offered himself for
   himself and us, could in no way escape the charge of impiety.  For he
   never committed a fault at all, neither did he sin.  What offering then
   did he need, not having sin for which sacrifices are rightly offered?
   But when he spoke about the Spirit, he said:  "He shall glorify me."
   If we think rightly, we do not say that the One Christ and Son as
   needing glory from another received glory from the Holy Spirit; for
   neither greater than he nor above him is his Spirit, but because he
   used the Holy Spirit to show forth his own divinity in his mighty
   works, therefore he is said to have been glorified by him just as if
   any one of us should say concerning his inherent strength for example,
   or his knowledge of anything, "They glorified me."  For although the
   Spirit is the same essence, yet we think of him by himself, as he is
   the Spirit and not the Son; but he is not different from him; for he is
   called the Spirit of truth and Christ is the Truth, and he is sent by
   him, just as, moreover, he is from God and the Father.  When then the
   Spirit worked miracles through the hands of the holy apostles after the
   Ascension of Our Lord Jesus Christ into heaven, he glorified him.  For
   it is believed that he who works through his own Spirit is God
   according to nature.  Therefore he said:  "He shall receive of mine,
   and shall shew it unto you."  But we do not say this as if the Spirit
   is wise and powerful through some sharing with another; for he is all
   perfect and in need of no good thing.  Since, therefore, he is the
   Spirit of the Power and Wisdom of the Father (that is, of the Son), he
   is evidently Wisdom and Power.

   And since the holy Virgin brought forth corporally God made one with
   flesh according to nature, for this reason we also call her Mother of
   God, not as if the nature of the Word had the beginning of its
   existence from the flesh.

   For "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word
   was with God," and he is the Maker of the ages, coeternal with the
   Father, and Creator of all; but, as we have already said, since he
   united to himself hypostatically human nature from her womb, also he
   subjected himself to birth as man, not as needing necessarily in his
   own nature birth in time and in these last times of the world, but in
   order that he might bless the beginning of our existence, and that that
   which sent the earthly bodies of our whole race to death, might lose
   its power for the future by his being born of a woman in the flesh.
   And this:  "In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children," being removed
   through him, he showed the truth of that spoken by the prophet, "Strong
   death swallowed them up, and again God hath wiped away every tear from
   off all faces." [243]   For this cause also we say that he attended,
   having been called, and also blessed, the marriage in Cana of Galilee,
   with his holy Apostles in accordance with the economy.  We have been
   taught to hold these things by the holy Apostles and Evangelists, and
   all the God-inspired Scriptures, and in the true confessions of the
   blessed Fathers.

   To all these your reverence also should agree, and give heed, without
   any guile.  And what it is necessary your reverence should anathematize
   we have subjoined to our epistle. [244]

   [241] Vide notes on this expression.

   [242] This passage is very difficult and I have followed the Latin in
   omitting one Theon.

   [243] There is a most curious blunder in the editing of this Epistle in
   Migne, where this passage, which is but one text, viz.:  Isaiah xxv. 8
   is made into two, the first few words being assigned in the margin to
   Hosea xiii. 14.  As a matter of fact the whole sentence is turned into
   nonsense by making the words kai palin as a connective supplied by St.
   Cyril.  What the text really says is that Death prevailed indeed, but
   God wiped away again the tears death had caused.  The same error is
   found in the letter as it occurs in Labbe and Cossart, and it should be
   remarked that it is both in the Greek and Latin.  I rather suspect that
   St. Cyril had a purer text of the LXX. than ours which read--"And he
   hath swallowed death up and hath wiped away, etc.," as the Vulgate and
   A.V. read.  This is the reading the context certainly seems to call
   for.

   The XII. Anathematisms of St. Cyril Against Nestorius.

   (Found in St. Cyril's Opera.  Migne, Pat. Græc, Tom. LXXVII., Col. 119;
   and the Concilia.)

   I.

   If anyone will not confess that the Emmanuel is very God, and that
   therefore the Holy Virgin is the Mother of God (Theotokos), inasmuch as
   in the flesh she bore the Word of God made flesh [as it is written,
   "The Word was made flesh"] let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   The Anathematisms of the Heretic Nestorius Against Cyril.

   (Found best in Migne's edition of Marius Mercator.)

   I.

   If anyone says that the Emmanuel is true God, and not rather God with
   us, that is, that he has united himself to a like nature with ours,
   which he assumed from the Virgin Mary, and dwelt in it; and if anyone
   calls Mary the mother of God the Word, and not rather mother of him who
   is Emmanuel; and if he maintains that God the Word has changed himself
   into the flesh, which he only assumed in order to make his Godhead
   visible, and to be found in form as a man, let him be anathema.

   Petavius. [245]

   (De Incarnatione, Lib. vj. cap. xvij.)

   In this anathematism certain words are found in the Greek copy of
   Dionysius which are lacking in the ordinary copies, viz. "according as
   it is written, And the Word was made flesh';" unless forsooth Dionysius
   supplied them of his own authority.  For in the Lateran Synod in the
   time of Martin I. this anathematism was quoted without the appended
   words.

   This anathematism breaks to pieces the chief strength of the Nestorian
   impiety.  For it sets forth two facts.  The one that the Emmanuel, that
   is he who was born of a woman and dwelt with us, is God:  the other,
   that Mary who bare such an one is Mother of God.  That Christ is God is
   clearly proved from the Nicene Creed, and he shews that the same that
   was in the beginning the Son of God, afterwards took flesh and was born
   of Mary, without any change or confusion of natures.

   St. Cyril explains that by sarkikos, carnaliter, he meant nothing else
   than kata sarka, secundum carnem, "according to the flesh."  And it was
   necessary to use this expression to overthrow the perfidy of Nestorius;
   so that we may understand that the most holy Virgin was the parent not
   of a simple and bare man, but of God the Word, not in that he was God,
   but in that he had taken flesh.  For God the Father was the parent of
   the same Son theikos [246] (divinely) as his mother was sarkikos (after
   the flesh).  And the word (sarkikos) in no degree lessens the dignity
   of his begetting and bringing forth; for it shews that his flesh was
   not simulated or shadowed forth; but true and like to ours.
   Amphilochius distinctly uses the word, saying "Except he had been born
   carnally (sarkikos), never wouldest thou have been born spiritually
   (pneumatikos )."  Cf. St. Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. 51).

   Theodoret misunderstood St. Cyril to teach in this first anathematism
   that the Word was changed into the flesh he assumed.  But Cyril rightly
   treated this whole accusation as a foolish calumny.

   the Orientals' objections and of Theodoret's criticisms, with answers.

   sense.

   Excursus on the Word Theotokos .

   There have been some who have tried to reduce all the great theological
   controversies on the Trinity and on the Incarnation to mere
   logomachies, and have jeered at those who could waste their time and
   energies over such trivialities.  For example, it has been said that
   the real difference between Arius and Athanasius was nothing more nor
   less than an iota, and that even Athanasius himself, in his more
   placid, and therefore presumably more rational moods, was willing to
   hold communion with those who differed from him and who still rejected
   the homousion.  But however catching and brilliant such remarks may be,
   they lack all solid foundation in truth.  It is perfectly manifest that
   a person so entirely lacking in discrimination as not to see the
   enormous difference between identity and likeness is not one whose
   opinion on such a point can be of much value.  A brilliant historian is
   not necessarily an accurate historian, far less need he be a safe guide
   in matters of theological definition. [247]

   A similar attempt to reduce to a logomachy the difference between the
   Catholic faith and Nestorianism has been made by some writers of
   undoubted learning among Protestants, notably by Fuchs and Schröckh.
   But as in the case of the homousios so, too, in the case of the
   theotocos the word expresses a great, necessary, and fundamental
   doctrine of the Catholic faith.  It is not a matter of words, but of
   things, and the mind most unskilled in theology cannot fail to grasp
   the enormous difference there is between affirming, as does
   Nestorianism, that a God indwelt a man with a human personality of his
   own distinct from the personality of the indwelling god; and that God
   assumed to himself human nature, that is a human body and a human soul,
   but without human personality.

   (Wm. Bright, St. Leo on the Incarnation, pp. 160, 161.)

   It is, then, clear that the question raised by the wide circulation of
   the discourses of Nestorius as archbishop of Constantinople was not
   verbal, but vital.  Much of his language was irrelevant, and indicated
   some confusedness of thought:  much would, of itself, admit of an
   orthodox construction; in one of the latest of his sermons, which
   Garnier dates on Sunday, December 14, 430, he grants that "Theotocos"
   might be used as signifying that "the temple which was formed in Mary
   by the Holy Spirit was united to the Godhead;" but it was impossible
   not to ask whether by "the temple" he meant the body of Jesus, or Jesus
   himself regarded as a human individual existing idia, idikos, ana
   meros--as Cyril represents his theory--and whether by "union" he meant
   more than a close alliance, ejusdem generis, in the last analysis, with
   the relation between God and every saint, or, indeed, every Christian
   in true moral fellowship with him--an alliance which would amount, in
   Cyril's phrase, to no more than a "relative union," and would reduce
   the Saviour to a "Theophoros," the title claimed of old by one of his
   chief martyrs.  And the real identity of Nestorius's view with that of
   Theodore [of Mopsuestia] was but too plainly exhibited by such
   statements as occur in some of the extracts preserved in Cyril's
   treatise Against Nestorius--to the effect that Christ was one with the
   Word by participation in dignity; that "the man" was partaker of Divine
   power, and in that sense not mere man; that he was adored together with
   the Word; and that "My Lord and my God" was a doxology to the Father;
   and above all, by the words spoken at Ephesus, "I can never allow that
   a child of three months old was God."

   It is no part of my duty to defend the truth of either the Catholic or
   Nestorian proposition--each has found many adherents in most ages since
   it was first started, and probably what is virtually Nestorianism is
   to-day far more widely held among persons deemed to be orthodox than is
   commonly supposed.  Be this as it may, Nestorianism is clearly
   subversive of the whole Catholic Doctrine of the Incarnation, and
   therefore the importance of the word Theotokos cannot be exaggerated.

   I shall treat the word Theotocos under two heads; (1) Its history (2)
   its meaning, first however quoting Bp. Pearson's words on its Conciliar
   authority.  (Pearson, Exp. of the Creed, Art. III., n. 37). "It is
   plain that the Council of Ephesus which condemned Nestorius confirmed
   this title Theotokos; I say confirmed it; for it is evident that it was
   before used in the Church, by the tumult which arose at the first
   denial of it by Anastasius [Nestorius's presbyter]; and so confirmed it
   as received before, because they approved the Epistles of St. Cyril,
   who proved it by the usage of those Fathers which preceded him."

   (1)  History of Word Theotokos.

   It has not been unfrequently assumed that the word Theotocos was coined
   to express the peculiar view of the Incarnation held by St. Cyril.
   Such however, is an entire mistake.  It was an old term of Catholic
   Theology, and the very word was used by bishop Alexander in a letter
   from the synod held at Alexandria in a.d. 320, [248] to condemn the
   Arian heresy (more than a hundred years before the meeting of the
   Council of Ephesus); "After this, we receive the doctrine of the
   resurrection from the dead, of which Jesus Christ our Lord became the
   first-fruits; who bore a body in truth, not in semblance, which he
   derived from Mary the Mother of God (ek tes Theotokou Marias)." [249]
   The same word had been used by many church writers among whom may be
   mentioned St. Athanasius, who says, "As the flesh was born of Mary, the
   Mother of God, so we say that he, the Word, was himself born of Mary"
   (Orat. c. Arian., iij., 14, 29, 33; also iv., 32).  See also Eusebius
   (Vit. Const., iij., 43); St. Cyril of Jerusalem (Cat., x., 9); and
   especially Origen, who (says Bp. Pearson) "did not only use, but
   expound at large the meaning of that title Theotokos in his first tome
   on the Epistle to the Romans, as Socrates and Liberatus testify." [250]
     (Cf. Origen in Deut. xxii., 23; vol. ij., p. 391. A; in Luc. apud
   Galland, Bib. Patr., vol. xiv., append., p. 87, D).  A list is given by
   Dr. Routh, in his Reliquiæ Sacræ. Vol. ij., p. 215 (1st Ed.), 332 (2d
   Ed.).

   In fact Theodore of Mopsuestia was the first to object to it, so far as
   we know, writing as follows:  "Mary bare Jesus, not the Word, for the
   Word was and remained omnipresent, although from the beginning he dwelt
   in Jesus in a peculiar manner.  Thus Mary is properly the Mother of
   Christ (Christotocos) but not the mother of God (Theotocos).  Only
   figuratively, per anaphoram, can she be called Theotocos also, because
   God was in Christ in a remarkable manner.  Properly she bare a man, in
   whom the union with the Word was begun, but was still so little
   completed, that he was not yet called the Son of God."  And in another
   place he says:  "It is madness to say that God is born of the
   Virgin....Not God, but the temple in which God dwelt, is born of Mary."
   [251]   How far Theodore had departed from the teaching of the
   Apostolic days may be seen by the following quotations from St.
   Ignatius.  "There is one only physician, of flesh and spirit, generate
   and ingenerate, God in man, true Life in death, Son of Mary and of God,
   first passible and then impassible, Jesus Christ our Lord." [252]
   Further on in the same epistle he says:  "For our God, Jesus the
   Christ, was borne in the womb by Mary etc." [253]   With the first of
   these passages Bp. Lightfoot very aptly compares the following from
   Melito.  "Since he was incorporeal, he fashioned a body for himself of
   our likeness...he was carried by Mary and clothed by his Father, he
   trod the earth and he filled the heavens." [254]

   Theodore was forced by the exigencies of his position to deny the
   doctrine of the communicatio idiomatum which had already at that early
   date come to be well understood, at least so far as practice is
   concerned.

   (Hefele, Hist. of the Councils, Vol. iii., p. 8.)

   This doctrine, as is well known is predicating the same properties of
   the two natures in Christ, not in abstracto (Godhead and manhood), but
   in concreto (God and man).  Christ himself had declared in St. John
   iii., 16:  "God...gave his only begotten Son" (namely, to death), and
   similarly St. Peter declared (Acts iii., 15):  "ye...killed the Prince
   of Life," when in fact the being given up and being killed is a
   property (idioma = predicate) of man, not of God (the only begotten,
   the Prince of Life).  In the same way Clement of Rome, for example,
   spoke of "the sufferings of God" (pathemata Theou) (1 Ad Cor. 2),
   Ignatius of Antioch (Ad Ephes., c. 1, and Ad Rom., 6) of an haima and
   pathos Theou, Tatian of a Theos peponthos (Ad Græcos, c. 13); Barnabas
   teaches (c. 7) that "the Son of God could not suffer except on our
   behalf...and on our behalf he has brought the vessel of his Spirit as a
   sacrifice."  Similarly Irenæus (iii., 16, 6) says, "The Only-begotten
   impassible Word (unigenitus impassibilis) has become passible"
   (passibilis); and Athanasius, estauromenon einai Theon (Ep. ad
   Epictet., n. 10, t. j., p. 726. ed. Patav.)

   It is, however, to be remarked that the properties of the one nature
   were never transferred to the other nature in itself, but always to the
   Person who is at the same time both man and God.  Human attributes were
   not ascribed to the Godhead, but to God, and vice versâ.

   For a full treatment of the figure of speech called the communicatio
   idiomatum the reader is referred to the great works on Theology where
   it will be found set forth at large, with its restrictions specified
   and with examples of its use.  A brief but interesting note on it will
   be found in St. John Damascene's famous treatise De Fide Orthodoxa,
   Book III., iij. (Migne's Pat. Græc., col. 994).

   (2)  Meaning of the Word Theotokos.

   We pass now to the meaning of the word, having sufficiently traced the
   history of its use.  Bishop Pearson says:  "This name was first in use
   in the Greek Church, who, delighting in the happy compositions of that
   language, called the blessed Virgin Theotocos.  From whence the Latins
   in imitation styled her Virginem Deiparam et Deigenitricem." [255]   In
   the passage to which the words just quoted are a portion of a footnote,
   he says:  "Wherefore from these three, a true conception, nutrition,
   and parturition, we must acknowledge that the blessed Virgin was truly
   and properly the Mother of our Saviour.  And so is she frequently
   styled the Mother of Jesus in the language of the Evangelists, and by
   Elizabeth particularly the Mother of her Lord,' as also by the general
   consent of the Church (because he which was so born of her was God,)
   the Deipara; which being a compound title begun in the Greek Church,
   was resolved into its parts by the Latins and so the Virgin was plainly
   named the Mother of God."

   Pearson is mistaken in supposing that the resolution of the compound
   Theotocos into meter tou Theou was unknown to the early Greek writers.
   Dionysius expressly calls Mary he meter tou Theou mou (Contr. Paul.
   Samos., Quæst. viij.); and among the Latins Mater Dei and Dei Genetrix
   were (as Pearson himself confesses in note 37) used before the time of
   St. Leo I.  It is not an open question whether Mater Dei, Dei Genetrix,
   Deipara, meter tou Theou are proper equivalents for Theotokos.  This
   point has been settled by the unvarying use of the whole Church of God
   throughout all the ages from that day to this, but there is, or at
   least some persons have thought that there was, some question as to how
   Theotocos should be translated into English.

   Throughout this volume I have translated it "Mother of God," and I
   propose giving my reasons for considering this the only accurate
   translation of the word, both from a lexico-graphical and from a
   theological point of view.

   (a)  It is evident that the word is a composite formed of Theos = God,
   and tiktein = to be the mother of a child.  Now I have translated the
   verbal part "to be the mother of a child" because "to bear" in English
   does not necessarily carry the full meaning of the Greek word, which
   (as Bp. Pearson has well remarked in the passage cited above) includes
   "conception, nutrition, and parturition."  It has been suggested that
   "God-bearer" is an exact translation.  To this I object, that in the
   first place it is not English; and in the second that it would be an
   equally and, to my mind, more accurate translation of Theophoros than
   of Theotokos.

   Another suggestion is that it be rendered "the bringer forth of God."
   Again I object that, from a rhetorical standpoint, the expression is
   very open to criticism; and from a lexicographical point of view it is
   entirely inadequate, for while indeed the parturition does necessarily
   involve in the course of nature the previous conception and nutrition,
   it certainly does not express it.

   Now the word Mother does necessarily express all three of these when
   used in relation to her child.  The reader will remember that the
   question I am discussing is not whether Mary can properly be called the
   Mother of God; this Nestorius denied and many in ancient and modern
   times have been found to agree with him.  The question I am considering
   is what the Greek word Theotocos means in English.  I do not think
   anyone would hesitate to translate Nestorius's Christotocos by "Mother
   of Christ" and surely the expressions are identical from a
   lexicographical point of view.

   Liddell and Scott in their Lexicon insert the word theotokos as an
   adjective and translate "bearing God" and add:  "especially he
   Theotokos, Mother of God, of the Virgin, Eccl."

   (b)  It only remains to consider whether there is from a theological
   point of view any objection to the translation, "Mother of God."  It is
   true that some persons have thought that such a rendering implied that
   the Godhead has its origin in Mary, but this was the very objection
   which Nestorius and his followers urged against the word Theotocos, and
   this being the case, it constitutes a strong argument in favour of the
   accuracy of the rendering.  Of course the answer to the objection in
   each case is the same, it is not of the Godhead that Mary is the
   Mother, but of the Incarnate Son, who is God.  "Mother" expresses
   exactly the relation to the incarnate Son which St. Cyril, the Council
   of Ephesus, and all succeeding, not to say also preceding, ages of
   Catholics, rightly or wrongly, ascribe to Mary.  All that every child
   derives from its Mother that God the Son derived from Mary, and this
   without the co-operation of any man, but by the direct operation of the
   Holy Ghost, so that in a fuller, truer, and more perfect sense, Mary is
   the Mother of God the Son in his incarnation, than any other earthly
   mother is of her son.

   I therefore consider it certain that no scholar who can and will divest
   himself of theological bias, can doubt that "Mother of God" is the most
   accurate translation of the term Theotocos.

   II.

   If anyone shall not confess that the Word of God the Father is united
   hypostatically to flesh, and that with that flesh of his own, he is one
   only Christ both God and man at the same time:  let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   II.

   If any one asserts that, at the union of the Logos with the flesh, the
   divine Essence moved from one place to another; or says that the flesh
   is capable of receiving the divine nature, and that it has been
   partially united with the flesh; or ascribes to the flesh, by reason of
   its reception of God, an extension to the infinite and boundless, and
   says that God and man are one and the same in nature; let him be
   anathema.
     __________________________________________________________________

   III.

   If anyone shall after the [hypostatic] union divide the hypostases in
   the one Christ, joining them by that connexion alone, which happens
   according to worthiness, or even authority and power, and not rather by
   a coming together (sunodo), which is made by natural union (henosin
   phusiken):  let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   III.

   If any one says that Christ, who is also Emmanuel, is One, not [merely]
   in consequence of connection, but [also] in nature, and does not
   acknowledge the connection (sunapheia) of the two natures, that of the
   Logos and of the assumed manhood, in one Son, as still continuing
   without mingling; let him be anathema.

   Hefele.

   (Hist. of the Counc., Vol. III., p. 7.)

   Theodore [of Mopsuestia, and in this he was followed by Nestorius,]
   (and here is his fundamental error,) not merely maintained the
   existence of two natures in Christ, but of two persons, as, he says
   himself, no subsistence can be thought of as perfect without
   personality.  As however, he did not ignore the fact that the
   consciousness of the Church rejected such a double personality in
   Christ, he endeavoured to get rid of the difficulty, and he repeatedly
   says expressly:  "The two natures united together make only one Person,
   as man and wife are only one flesh....If we consider the natures in
   their distinction, we should define the nature of the Logos as perfect
   and complete, and so also his Person, and again the nature and the
   person of the man as perfect and complete.  If, on the other hand, we
   have regard to the union (sunapheia), we say it is one Person."  The
   very illustration of the union of man and wife shows that Theodore did
   not suppose a true union of the two natures in Christ, but that his
   notion was rather that of an external connection of the two.  The
   expression sunapheia, moreover, which he selected here instead of the
   term henosin, which he elsewhere employs, being derived from sunapto
   [to join together], expresses only an external connection, a fixing
   together, and is therefore expressly rejected in later times by the
   doctors of the Church.  And again, Theodore designates a merely
   external connection also in the phrase already quoted, to the effect
   that "the Logos dwells in the man assumed as in a temple."  As a temple
   and the statue set up within it are one whole merely in outward
   appearance, so the Godhead and manhood in Christ appear only from
   without in their actuality as one Person, while they remain essentially
   two Persons.
     __________________________________________________________________

   IV.

   If anyone shall divide between two persons or subsistences those
   expressions (phonas) which are contained in the Evangelical and
   Apostolical writings, or which have been said concerning Christ by the
   Saints, or by himself, and shall apply some to him as to a man separate
   from the Word of God, and shall apply others to the only Word of God
   the Father, on the ground that they are fit to be applied to God:  let
   him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   IV.

   If any one assigns the expressions of the Gospels and Apostolic
   letters, which refer to the two natures of Christ, to one only of those
   natures, and even ascribes suffering to the divine Word, both in the
   flesh and in the Godhead; let him be anathema.

   St. Cyril.

   (Apol. contra Orientales.)

   For we neither teach the division of the hypostases after the union,
   nor do we say that the nature of the Deity needs increase and growth;
   but this rather we hold, that by way of an economical appropriation
   (kat' oikeiosin oikonomiken), he made his own the properties of the
   flesh, as having become flesh.

   (Quod unus est Christus.)

   For the wise Evangelist, introducing the Word as become flesh, shows
   him economically submitting himself to his own flesh and going through
   the laws of his own nature.  But it belongs to humanity to increase in
   stature and in wisdom, and, I might add, in grace, intelligence keeping
   pace with the measure of the body, and differing according to age.  For
   it was not impossible for the Word born of the Father to have raised
   the body united to himself to its full height from the very
   swaddling-clothes.  I would say also, that in the babe a wonderful
   wisdom might easily have appeared.  But that would have approached the
   thaumaturgical, and would have been incongruous to the laws of the
   economy.  For the mystery was accomplished noiselessly.  Therefore he
   economically allowed the measures of humanity to have power over
   himself.

   A. B. Bruce.

   (The Humiliation of Christ.  Appendix to Lect. II.)

   The accommodation to the laws of the economy, according to this
   passage, consisted in this--in stature, real growth; in wisdom,
   apparent growth.  The wonderful wisdom was there from the first, but it
   was not allowed to appear (ekphenai), to avoid an aspect of
   monstrosity.

   St. Cyril.

   (Adversus Nestorium.)

   Therefore there would have been shown to all an unwonted and strange
   thing, if, being yet an infant, he had made a demonstration of his
   wisdom worthy of God; but expanding it gradually and in proportion to
   the age of the body, and (in this gradual manner) making it manifest to
   all, he might be said to increase (in wisdom) very appropriately.

   (Ad Reginas de recta fide, Orat. II., cap. xvi.)

   "But the boy increased and waxed strong in spirit, being filled with
   wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him."  And again:  "Jesus
   increased in stature and wisdom, and in favour with God and men."  In
   affirming our Lord Jesus Christ to be one, and assigning to him both
   divine and human properties, we truly assert that it was congruous to
   the measures of the kenosis, on the one hand, that he should receive
   bodily increase and grow strong, the parts of the body gradually
   attaining their full development; and, on the other hand, that he
   should seem to be filled with wisdom, in so far as the manifestation of
   the wisdom dwelling within him proceeded, as by addition, most
   congruously to the stature of the body; and this, as I said, agreed
   with the economy of the Incarnation, and the measures of the state of
   humiliation.

   (Apol. contra Theod., ad Anath. iv.)

   And if he is one and the same in virtue of the true unity of natures,
   and is not one and another (two persons) disjunctively and partitively,
   to him will belong both to know and to seem not to know.  Therefore he
   knows on the divine side as the Wisdom of the Father.  But since he
   subjected himself to the measure of humanity, he economically
   appropriates this also with the rest, although, as I said a little ago,
   being ignorant of nothing, but knowing all things with the Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

   V.

   If anyone shall dare to say that the Christ is a Theophorus [that is,
   God-bearing] man and not rather that he is very God, as an only Son
   through nature, because "the Word was made flesh," and "hath a share in
   flesh and blood as we do:"  let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   V.

   If any one ventures to say that, even after the assumption of human
   nature, there is only one Son of God, namely, he who is so in nature
   (naturaliter filius = Logos), while he (since the assumption of the
   flesh) is certainly Emmanuel; let him be anathema.

   Petavius.

   It is manifest that this anathematism is directed against the blasphemy
   of Nestorius, by which he said that Christ was in this sense Emmanuel,
   that a man was united and associated with God, just as God had been
   said to have been with the Prophets and other holy men, and to have had
   his abode in them; so that they were properly styled Theophoroi,
   because, as it were, they carried God about with them; but there was no
   one made of the two.  But he held that our Lord as man was bound and
   united with God only by a communion of dignity.

   Nestorius [in his Counter Anathematism] displays the hidden meaning of
   his heresy, when he says, that the Son of God is not one after the
   assumption of the humanity; for he who denied that he was one, no doubt
   thought that he was two.

   Theodoret in his criticism of this Anathematism remarks that many of
   the Ancients, including St. Basil had used this very word, Theophoros,
   for the Lord; but the objection has no real foundation, for the
   orthodoxy or heterodoxy of such a word must be determined by the
   context in which it is used, and also by the known opinions of him that
   uses it.  Expressions which are in a loose sense orthodox and quite
   excusable before a heresy arises, may become afterwards the very
   distinctive marks and shibboleths of error.  Petavius has pointed out
   how far from orthodox many of the earliest Christian writers were, at
   least verbally, and Bp. Bull defended them by the same line of argument
   I have just used and which Petavius himself employs in this very
   connection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   VI.

   If anyone shall dare say that the Word of God the Father is the God of
   Christ or the Lord of Christ, and shall not rather confess him as at
   the same time both God and Man, since according to the Scriptures, "The
   Word was made flesh":  let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   VI.

   If anyone, after the Incarnation calls another than Christ the Word,
   and ventures to say that the form of a servant is equally with the Word
   of God, without beginning and uncreated, and not rather that it is made
   by him as its natural Lord and Creator and God, and that he has
   promised to raise it again in the words:  "Destroy this temple, and in
   three days I will build it up again"; let him be anathema.

   Hefele.

   This [statement of Nestorius's that any should call "another than
   Christ the Word"] has no reference to Cyril; but is a
   hyper-Nestorianism, which Nestorius here rejects.  This [that "the form
   of a servant is without beginning and uncreated"] was asserted by some
   Apollinarists; and Nestorius accused St. Cyril of Apollinarianism.

   Petavius.

   As Nestorius believed that in Christ there were two distinct entities
   (re ipsa duos) that is to say two persons joined together; it was
   natural that he should hold that the Word was the God and Lord of the
   other, that is of the man.  Cyril contradicts this, and since he taught
   that there was, not two, but one of two natures, that is one person or
   suppositum, therefore he denied that the Word was the God or Lord of
   the man; since no one should be called the Lord of himself.

   Theodoret in his answer shuffles as usual, and points out that Christ
   is styled a servant by the Prophet Isaiah, because of the form of a
   servant which he had received.  But to this Cyril answers; that
   although Christ, inasmuch as he was man, is called the servant of the
   Father, as of a person distinct from himself; yet he denies that the
   same person can be his own lord or servant, lest a separation of the
   person be introduced.

   VII.

   If anyone shall say that Jesus as man is only energized by the Word of
   God, and that the glory of the Only-begotten is attributed to him as
   something not properly his:  let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   VII.

   If any one says that the man who was formed of the Virgin is the
   Only-begotten, who was born from the bosom of the Father, before the
   morning star was (Ps. cix., 3) [256] , and does not rather confess that
   he has obtained the designation of Only-begotten on account of his
   connection with him who in nature is the Only-begotten of the Father;
   and besides, if any one calls another than the Emmanuel Christ let him
   be anathema.

   St. Cyril.

   (Declaratio Septima.)

   When the blessed Gabriel announced to the holy Virgin the generation of
   the only-begotten Son of God according to the flesh, he said, "Thou
   shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save
   his people from their sins."  But he was named also Christ, because
   that according to his human nature he was anointed with us, according
   to the words of the Psalmist:  "Thou hast loved righteousness and hated
   iniquity:  therefore God, even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil
   of gladness above thy fellows."  For although he was the giver of the
   Holy Spirit, neither did he give it by measure to them that were worthy
   (for he was full of the Holy Ghost, and of his fulness have we all
   received, as it is written), nevertheless as he is man he was called
   anointed economically, the Holy Spirit resting upon him spiritually
   (noetos) and not after the manner of men, in order that he might abide
   in us, although he had been driven forth from us in the beginning by
   Adam's fall.  He therefore the only begotten Word of God made flesh was
   called Christ.  And since he possessed as his own the power proper to
   God, he wrought his wonders.  Whosoever therefore shall say that the
   glory of the Only-begotten was added to the power of Christ, as though
   the Only-begotten was different from Christ, they are thinking of two
   sons; the one truly working and the other impelled (by the strength of
   another, Lat.) as a man like to us; and all such fall under the penalty
   of this anathematism.

   If anyone shall dare to say that the assumed man (analephthenta ) ought
   to be worshipped together with God the Word, and glorified together
   with him, and recognised together with him as God, and yet as two
   different things, the one with the other (for this "Together with" is
   added [i.e., by the Nestorians] to convey this meaning); and shall not
   rather with one adoration worship the Emmanuel and pay to him one
   glorification, as [it is written] "The Word was made flesh":  let him
   be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   VIII.

   If any one says that the form of a servant should, for its own sake,
   that is, in reference to its own nature, be reverenced, and that it is
   the ruler of all things, and not rather, that [merely] on account of
   its connection with the holy and in itself universally-ruling nature of
   the Only-begotten, it is to be reverenced; let him be anathema.

   Hefele.

   On this point [made by Nestorius, that "the form of a servant is the
   ruler of all things"] Marius Mercator has already remarked with
   justice, that no Catholic had ever asserted anything of the kind.

   Petavius notes that the version of Dionysius Exiguus is defective.

   Petavius.

   Nestorius captiously and maliciously interpreted this as if the "form
   of a servant" according to its very nature (ratio) was to be adored,
   that is should receive divine worship.  But this is nefarious and far
   removed from the mind of Cyril.  Since to such an extent only the human
   nature of Christ is one suppositum with the divine, that he declares
   that each is the object of one and an undivided adoration; lest if a
   double and dissimilar cultus be attributed to each one, the divine
   person should be divided into two adorable Sons and Christs, as we have
   heard Cyril often complaining.

   IX.

   If any man shall say that the one Lord Jesus Christ was glorified by
   the Holy Ghost, so that he used through him a power not his own and
   from him received power against unclean spirits and power to work
   miracles before men and shall not rather confess that it was his own
   Spirit through which he worked these divine signs; let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   IX.

   If anyone says that the form of a servant is of like nature with the
   Holy Ghost, and not rather that it owes its union with the Word which
   has existed since the conception, to his mediation, by which it works
   miraculous healings among men, and possesses the power of expelling
   demons; let him be anathema.

   Petavius.

   The scope of this anathematism is to shew that the Word of God, when he
   assumed flesh remaining what he was, and lacking nothing which the
   Father possessed except only paternity, had as his own the Holy Spirit
   which is from him and substantially abides in him.  From this it
   follows that through him, as through a power and strength which was his
   own, and not one alien or adventitious, he wrought his wonders and cast
   forth devils, but he did not receive that Holy Spirit and his power as
   formerly the Prophets had done, or as afterwards his disciples did, as
   a kind of gift (beneficii loco).

   The Orientals objected that St. Cyril here contradicts himself, for
   here he says that Christ did not work his wonders by the Holy Ghost and
   in another place he frankly confesses that he did so work them.  But
   the whole point is what is intended by working through the Holy Ghost.
   For the Apostles worked miracles through the Holy Ghost but as by a
   power external to themselves, but not so Christ.  When Christ worked
   wonders through the Holy Ghost, he was working through a power which
   was his own, viz.:  the Third Person of the Holy Trinity; from whom he
   never was and never could be separated, ever abiding with him and the
   Eternal Father in the Divine Unity.

   The Westerns have always pointed to this anathematism as shewing that
   St. Cyril recognized the eternal relation of the Holy Spirit as being
   from the Son.

   Excursus on How Our Lord Worked Miracles.

   In view of the fact that many are now presenting as if something newly
   discovered, and as the latest results of biblical study, the
   interpretations of the early heretics with regard to our Lord's powers
   and to his relation to the Holy Ghost, I have here set down in full
   Theodoret's Counter-statement to the faith accepted by the Ecumenical
   Councils of the Church.

   Theodoret.

   (Counter Statement to Anath. IX. of Cyril.)

   Here he has plainly had the hardihood to anathematize not only those
   who at the present time hold pious opinions, but also those who were in
   former days heralds of truth; aye even the writers of the divine
   Gospels, the band of the holy Apostles, and, in addition to these,
   Gabriel the archangel.  For he indeed it was who first, even before the
   conception, announced the birth of the Christ according to the flesh;
   saying in reply to Mary when she asked, How shall this be, seeing I
   know not a man? "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of
   the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing that
   shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."  And to Joseph
   he said, "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is
   conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost."  And the Evangelist says, "When
   as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph...she was found with child of
   the Holy Ghost."  And the Lord himself when he had come into the
   synagogue of the Jews and had taken the prophet Isaiah, after reading
   the passage in which he says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
   because he hath anointed me" and so on, added, "This day is this
   scripture fulfilled in your ears."  And the blessed Peter in his sermon
   to the Jews said, "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
   Ghost."  And Isaiah many ages before had predicted "There shall come
   forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of
   his roots; and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit
   of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
   spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord"; and again, "Behold my
   servant whom I uphold, my beloved in whom my soul delighteth.  I will
   put my Spirit upon him:  he shall bring forth judgment to the
   Gentiles."  This testimony the Evangelist too has inserted in his own
   writings.  And the Lord himself in the Gospels says to the Jews, "If I
   with the Spirit of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is
   come upon you."  And John says, "He that sent me to baptize with water,
   the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending
   and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy
   Ghost."  So this exact examiner of the divine decrees has not only
   anathematized prophets, apostles, and even the archangel Gabriel, but
   has suffered his blasphemy to reach even the Saviour of the world
   himself.  For we have shewn that the Lord himself after reading the
   passage "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me,"
   said to the Jews, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
   And to those who said that he was casting out devils by Beelzebub he
   replied that he was casting them out by the Spirit of God.  But we
   maintain that it was not God the Word, of one substance and co-eternal
   with the Father, that was formed by the Holy Ghost and anointed, but
   the human nature which was assumed by him at the end of days.  We shall
   confess that the Spirit of the Son was his own if he spoke of it as of
   the same nature and proceeding from the Father, and shall accept the
   expression as consistent with true piety.  But if he speaks of the
   Spirit as being of the Son, or as having its origin through the Son we
   shall reject this statement as blasphemous and impious.  For we believe
   the Lord when he says, "The spirit which proceedeth from the Father";
   and likewise the very divine Paul saying, "We have received not the
   spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God."

   In the foregoing will be found the very same arguments used and the
   same texts cited against the Catholic faith as are urged and cited by
   the Rev. A. J. Mason, The Conditions of Our Lord's Life on Earth, and
   by several other recent writers.

   X.

   Whosoever shall say that it is not the divine Word himself, when he was
   made flesh and had become man as we are, but another than he, a man
   born of a woman, yet different from him (idikos anthropon), who is
   become our Great High Priest and Apostle; or if any man shall say that
   he offered himself in sacrifice for himself and not rather for us,
   whereas, being without sin, he had no need of offering or sacrifice:
   let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   X.

   If any one maintains that the Word, who is from the beginning, has
   become the high priest and apostle of our confession, and has offered
   himself for us, and does not rather say that it is the work of Emmanuel
   to be an apostle; and if any one in such a manner divides the sacrifice
   between him who united [the Word] and him who was united [the manhood]
   referring it to a common sonship, that is, not giving to God that which
   is God's, and to man that which is man's; let him be anathema.

   St. Cyril.

   (Declaratio decima.)

   But I do not know how those who think otherwise contend that the very
   Word of God made man, was not the apostle and high-priest of our
   profession, but a man different from him; who was born of the holy
   Virgin, was called our apostle and high-priest, and came to this
   gradually; and that not only for us did he offer himself a sacrifice to
   God and the Father, but also for himself.  A statement which is wholly
   contrary to the right and undefiled faith, for he did no sin, but was
   superior to fault and altogether free from sin, and needed no sacrifice
   for himself.  Since those who think differently were again unreasonably
   thinking of two sons, this anathematism became necessary that their
   impiety might appear.
     __________________________________________________________________

   XI.

   Whosoever shall not confess that the flesh of the Lord giveth life and
   that it pertains to the Word of God the Father as his very own, but
   shall pretend that it belongs to another person who is united to him
   [i.e., the Word] only according to honour, and who has served as a
   dwelling for the divinity; and shall not rather confess, as we say,
   that that flesh giveth life because it is that of the Word who giveth
   life to all:  let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   XI.

   If any one maintains that the flesh which is united with God the Word
   is by the power of its own nature life-giving, whereas the Lord himself
   says, "It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing"
   (St. John vi. 61), let him be anathema.  [He adds, "God is a Spirit"
   (St. John iv. 24).  If, then, any one maintains that God the Logos has
   in a carnal manner, in his substance, become flesh, and persists in
   this with reference to the Lord Christ; who himself after his
   resurrection said to his disciples, "Handle me and see; for a spirit
   hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having" (St. Luke xxiv. 39);
   let him be anathema.]

   Hefele.

   The part enclosed in brackets is certainly a spurious addition and is
   wanting in many manuscripts.  Cf. Marius Mercator [ed. Migne], p. 919.

   St. Cyril.

   (Declaratio undecima.)

   We perform in the churches the holy, lifegiving, and unbloody
   sacrifice; the body, as also the precious blood, which is exhibited we
   believe not to be that of a common man and of any one like unto us, but
   receiving it rather as his own body and as the blood of the Word which
   gives all things life.  For common flesh cannot give life.  And this
   our Saviour himself testified when he said:  "The flesh profiteth
   nothing, it is the Spirit that giveth life."  For since the flesh
   became the very own of the Word, therefore we understand that it is
   lifegiving, as the Saviour himself said:  "As the living Father hath
   sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me shall live by
   me."  Since therefore Nestorius and those who think with him rashly
   dissolve the power of this mystery; therefore it was convenient that
   this anathematism should be put forth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   XII.

   Whosoever shall not recognize that the Word of God suffered in the
   flesh, that he was crucified in the flesh, and that likewise in that
   same flesh he tasted death and that he is become the first-begotten of
   the dead, for, as he is God, he is the life and it is he that giveth
   life:  let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Nestorius.

   XII.

   If any one, in confessing the sufferings of the flesh, ascribes these
   also to the Word of God as to the flesh in which he appeared, and thus
   does not distinguish the dignity of the natures; let him be anathema.

   St. Cyril.

   (Adv. Orientales, ad XII. Quoting Athanasius.)

   For if the body is of another, to him also must the sufferings be
   ascribed.  But if the flesh is the Word's (for "The Word was made
   flesh") it is necessary that the sufferings of the flesh be called his
   also whose is the flesh.  But whose are the sufferings, such especially
   as condemnation, flagellation, thirst, the cross, death, and other such
   like infirmities of the body, his also is the merit and the grace.
   Therefore rightly and properly to none other are these sufferings
   attributed than to the Lord, as also the grace is from him; and we
   shall not be guilty of idolatry, but be the true worshippers of God,
   for we invoke him who is no creature nor any common man, but the
   natural and true Son of God, made man, and yet the same Lord and God
   and Saviour.

   As I think, these quotations will suffice to the learned for the proof
   of the propositions advanced, the Divine Law plainly saying that "In
   the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established."
   But if after this any one would still seem to be contentious, we would
   say to him:  "Go thine own way.  We however shall follow the divine
   Scriptures and the faith of the Holy Fathers."

   The student should read at full length all Cyril's defence of his
   anathematisms, also his answers to the criticisms of Theodoret, and to
   those of the Orientals, all of which will be found in his works, and in
   Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., 811 et seqq.

   Extracts from the Acts.

   Session I.  (Continued).

   (L. and C., Conc., Tom. III., Col. 503.)

   [No action is recorded in the Acts as having been taken.  A verbal
   report was made by certain who had seen Nestorius during the past three
   days, that they were hopeless of any repentance on his part.  On the
   motion of Flavian, bishop of Philippi, a number of passages from the
   Fathers were read; and after that some selections from the writings of
   Nestorius.  A letter from Capreolus, Archbishop of Carthage, was next
   read, excusing his absence; after the reading of the letter, which
   makes no direct reference to Nestorius whatever, but prays the Synod to
   see to it that no novelties be tolerated, the Acts proceed.  (Col.
   534).]

   Cyril, the bishop of the Church of Alexandria, said:  As this letter of
   the most reverend and pious Capreolus, bishop of Carthage, which has
   been read, contains a most lucid expression of opinion, let it be
   inserted in the Acts.  For it wishes that the ancient dogmas of the
   faith should be confirmed, and that novelties, absurdly conceived and
   impiously brought forth, should be reprobated and proscribed.

   All the bishops at the same time cried out:  These are the sentiments
   (phonai) of all of us, these are the things we all say--the
   accomplishment of this is the desire of us all.

   [Immediately follows the sentence of deposition and the subscriptions.
   It seems almost certain that something has dropped out here, most
   probably the whole discussion of Cyril's XII. Anathematisms.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Decree of the Council Against Nestorius.

   (Found in all the Concilia in Greek with Latin Versions.)

   As, in addition to other things, the impious Nestorius has not obeyed
   our citation, and did not receive the holy bishops who were sent by us
   to him, we were compelled to examine his ungodly doctrines.  We
   discovered that he had held and published impious doctrines in his
   letters and treatises, as well as in discourses which he delivered in
   this city, and which have been testified to.  Compelled thereto by the
   canons and by the letter (anankaios katepeichthentes apo te ton
   kanonon, kai ek tes epistoles, k.t.l.) of our most holy father and
   fellow-servant Coelestine, the Roman bishop, we have come, with many
   tears, to this sorrowful sentence against him, namely, that our Lord
   Jesus Christ, whom he has blasphemed, decrees by the holy Synod that
   Nestorius be excluded from the episcopal dignity, and from all priestly
   communion.

   Notes.

   The words for which I have given the original Greek, are not mentioned
   by Canon Bright in his Article on St. Cyril in Smith and Wace's
   Dictionary of Christian Biography; nor by Ffoulkes in his article on
   the Council of Ephesus in Smith and Cheetham's Dictionary of Christian
   Antiquities.  They do not appear in Canon Robertson's History of the
   Church.  And strangest of all, Dean Milman cites the sentence in
   English in the text and in Greek in a note but in each case omits all
   mention of the letter of the Pope, marking however in the Greek that
   there is an omission.  (Lat. Chr., Bk. II., Chap. III.) [257]   I also
   note that the translation in the English edition of Hefele's History of
   the Councils (Vol. III., p. 51) is misleading and inaccurate, "Urged by
   the canons, and in accordance with the letter etc."  The participle by
   itself might mean nothing more than "urged" (vide Liddell and Scott on
   this verb and also epeigo) but the adverb which precedes it, anankaios
   , certainly is sufficient to necessitate the coacti of the old Latin
   version which I have followed, translating "compelled thereto."  It
   will also be noticed that while the prepositions used with regard to
   the "canons" and the "letter" are different, yet that their grammatical
   relation to the verb is identical is shewn by the te--kai, which proves
   the translation cited above to be utterly incorrect.

   Hefele for the "canons" refers to canon number lxxiv. of the Apostolic
   Canons; which orders an absent bishop to be summoned thrice before
   sentence be given against him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [257] Complaint of all this has very justly been made recently by the
   Rev. Luke Rivington, a Roman Catholic writer, in his work The Primitive
   Church and the See of Peter, p. 336.

   Extracts from the Acts.

   Session II.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 609.)

   The most pious and God-beloved bishops, Arcadius and Projectus, as also
   the most beloved-of-God Philip, a presbyter and legate of the Apostolic
   See, then entered and took their seats. [258]

   Philip the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See said:  We bless
   the holy and adorable Trinity that our lowliness has been deemed worthy
   to attend your holy Synod.  For a long time ago (palai) our most holy
   and blessed pope Coelestine, bishop of the Apostolic See, through his
   letters to that holy and most pious man Cyril, bishop of Alexandria,
   gave judgment concerning the present cause and affair (horisen) which
   letters have been shown to your holy assembly.  And now again for the
   corroboration of the Catholic (katholikes) faith, he has sent through
   us letters to all your holinesses, which you will bid (kelousate) to be
   read with becoming reverence (prepontos) and to be entered on the
   ecclesiastical minutes.

   Arcadius, a bishop and legate of the Roman Church said:  May it please
   your blessedness to give order that the letters of the holy and
   ever-to-be-mentioned-with-veneration Pope Coelestine, bishop of the
   Apostolic See, which have been brought by us, be read, from which your
   reverence will be able to see what care he has for all the Churches.

   Projectus, a bishop and legate of the Roman Church said, May it please,
   etc.  [The same as Arcadius had said verbatim!]

   And afterwards the most holy and beloved-of-God Cyril, bishop of the
   Church of Alexandria, spoke as is next in order contained; Siricius,
   notary of the holy Catholic (katholikes) Church of Rome read it.

   Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria said:  Let the letter received from the
   most holy and altogether most blessed Coelestine, bishop of the
   Apostolic See of Rome be read to the holy Synod with fitting honour.

   Siricius, notary of the holy Catholic (katholikes) Church of the city
   of Rome read it.

   And after it was read in Latin, Juvenal, the bishop of Jerusalem said:
   Let the writings of the most holy and blessed bishop of great Rome
   which have just been read, be entered on the minutes.

   And all the most reverend bishops prayed that the letter might be
   translated and read.

   Philip, the presbyter of the Apostolic See and Legate said:  The custom
   has been sufficiently complied with, that the writings of the Apostolic
   See should first be read in Latin. [259]   But now since your holiness
   has demanded that they be read in Greek also, it is necessary that your
   holiness's desire should be satisfied; We have taken care that this be
   done, and that the Latin be turned into Greek.  Give order therefore
   that it be received and read in your holy hearing.

   Arcadius and Projectus, bishops and legates said, As your blessedness
   ordered that the writings which we brought should be brought to the
   knowledge of all, for of our holy brethren bishops there are not a few
   who do not understand Latin, therefore the letter has been translated
   into Greek and if you so command let it be read.

   Flavian, the bishop of Philippi said:  Let the translation of the
   letter of the most holy and beloved of God, bishop of the Roman Church
   be received and read.

   Peter, the presbyter of Alexandria and primicerius of the notaries read
   as follows:
     __________________________________________________________________

   [258] It should be noted that in the Acts Cyril is described as having
   "the place of the most holy and sacred Archbishop of the Roman Church
   Coelestine."  Hefele says "that Cyril presided as Pope's vicar is
   asserted also by Mennas of Constantinople and other Greek bishops in
   their letter to Pope Vigilius, in Mansi, t. ix., p. 62; Hardouin, t.
   iii., p. 10."  (Hef., Hist. of the Councils, Vol. III., p. 46, n. 4.)

   [259] This seems to me to be the climax of improbable statements.
   There are many other things which will induce the curious reader to
   suspect that the Acts are not in good shape.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Letter of Pope Coelestine to the Synod of Ephesus.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 613.  Also Migne, Pat.
   Lat., Tom. L, col. 505. [260] )

   Coelestine the bishop to the holy Synod assembled at Ephesus, brethren
   beloved and most longed for, greeting in the Lord.

   A Synod of priests gives witness to the presence of the Holy Spirit.
   For true is that which we read, since the Truth cannot lie, to wit, the
   promise of the Gospel; "Where two or three are gathered together in my
   name, there am I in the midst of them."  And since this is so, if the
   Holy Spirit is not absent from so small a number how much more may we
   believe he is present when so great a multitude of holy ones are
   assembled together!  Every council is holy on account of a peculiar
   veneration which is its due; for in every such council the reverence
   which should be paid to that most famous council of the Apostles of
   which we read is to be had regard to.  Never was the Master, whom they
   had received to preach, lacking to this, but ever was present as Lord
   and Master; and never were those who taught deserted by their teacher.
   For he that had sent them was their teacher; he who had commanded what
   was to be taught, was their teacher; he who affirms that he himself is
   heard in his Apostles, was their teacher.  This duty of preaching has
   been entrusted to all the Lord's priests in common, for by right of
   inheritance we are bound to undertake this solicitude, whoever of us
   preach the name of the Lord in divers lands in their stead for he said
   to them, "Go, teach all nations."  You, dear brethren, should observe
   that we have received a general command:  for he wills that all of us
   should perform that office, which he thus entrusted in common to all
   the Apostles.  We must needs follow our predecessors.  Let us all,
   then, undertake their labours, since we are the successors in their
   honour.  And we shew forth our diligence in preaching the same
   doctrines that they taught, beside which, according to the admonition
   of the Apostle, we are forbidden to add aught.  For the office of
   keeping what is committed to our trust is no less dignified than that
   of handing it down.

   They sowed the seed of the faith.  This shall be our care that the
   coming of our great father of the family, to whom alone assuredly this
   fulness of the Apostles is assigned, may find fruit uncorrupt and many
   fold.  For the vase of election tells us that it is not sufficient to
   plant and to water unless God gives the increase.  We must strive
   therefore in common to keep the faith which has come down to us to-day,
   through the Apostolic Succession.  For we are expected to walk
   according to the Apostle.  For now not our appearance (species) but our
   faith is called in question.  Spiritual weapons are those we must take,
   because the war is one of minds, and the weapons are words; so shall we
   be strong in the faith of our King.  Now the Blessed Apostle Paul
   admonishes that all should remain in that place in which he bid Timothy
   remain.  The same place therefore, the same cause, lays upon us the
   same duty.  Let us now also do and study that which he then commanded
   him to do.  And let no one think otherwise, and let no one pay heed to
   over strange fables, as he himself ordered.  Let us be unanimous,
   thinking the same thing, for this is expedient:  let us do nothing out
   of contention, nothing out of vain glory:  let us be in all things of
   one mind, of one heart, when the faith which is one, is attacked.  Let
   the whole body grieve and mourn in common with us.  He who is to judge
   the world is called into judgment; he who is to criticise all, is
   himself made the object of criticism, he who redeemed us is made to
   suffer calumny.  Dear Brethren, gird ye with the armour of God.  Ye
   know what helmet must protect our head, what breast-plate our breast.
   For this is not the first time the ecclesiastical camps have received
   you as their rulers.  Let no one doubt that by the favour of the Lord
   who maketh twain to be one, there will be peace, and that arms will be
   laid aside since the very cause defends itself.

   Let us look once again at these words of our Doctor, which he uses with
   express reference to bishops, saying, "Take heed to yourselves and to
   the whole flock, over which the Holy Ghost has placed you as bishop,
   that ye rule the church of God, which he hath purchased with his
   blood."

   We read that they who heard this at Ephesus, the same place at which
   your holiness is come together, were called thence.  To them therefore
   to whom this preaching of the faith was known, to them also let your
   defence of the same faith also be known.  Let us shew them the
   constancy of our mind with that reverence which is due to matters of
   great importance; which things peace has guarded for a long time with
   pious understanding.

   Let there be announced by you what things have been preserved intact
   from the Apostles; for the words of tyrannical opposition are never
   admitted against the King of Kings, nor can the business of truth be
   oppressed by falsehood.

   I exhort you, most blessed brethren, that love alone be regarded in
   which we ought to remain, according to the voice of John the Apostle
   whose reliques we venerate in this city.  Let common prayer be offered
   to the Lord.  For we can form some idea of what will be the power of
   the divine presence at the united intercession of such a multitude of
   priests, by considering how the very place was moved where, as we read,
   the Twelve made together their supplication.  And what was the purport
   of that prayer of the Apostles?  It was that they might receive grace
   to speak the word of God with confidence, and to act through its power,
   both of which they received by the favour of Christ our God.  And now
   what else is to be asked for by your holy council, except that ye may
   speak the Word of the Lord with confidence?  What else than that he
   would give you grace to preserve that which he has given you to preach?
   that being filled with the Holy Ghost, as it is written, ye may set
   forth that one truth which the Spirit himself has taught you, although
   with divers voices.

   Animated, in brief, by all these considerations (for, as the Apostle
   says:  "I speak to them that know the law, and I speak wisdom among
   them that are perfect"), stand fast by the Catholic faith, and defend
   the peace of the Churches, for so it is said, both to those past,
   present, and future, asking and preserving "those things which belong
   to the peace of Jerusalem."

   Out of our solicitude, we have sent our holy brethren and fellow
   priests, who are at one with us and are most approved men, Arcedius,
   and Projectus, the bishops, and our presbyter, Philip, that they may be
   present at what is done and may carry out what things have been already
   decreed be us (quæ a nobis antea statuta sunt, exequantur).

   To the performing of which we have no doubt that your holiness will
   assent when it is seen that what has been decreed is for the security
   of the whole church.  Given the viij of the Ides of May, in the
   consulate of Bassus and Antiochus.

   [260] This letter we know was originally written in Latin, and that it
   was translated into Greek and then read afterwards in that language to
   the Council.  There would seem to be no doubt that the Greek text we
   now find in the Acts is that first translation, but whether the Latin
   is the original or whether it is a translation back again from the
   Greek is not known, so far as I am aware.  Certainly the Latin is of
   the most extraordinary character, and suggests that it was the work of
   one not skilled in that tongue.  The text in several places is
   manifestly corrupt and the Greek and Latin do not always agree.  If I
   may venture to express an opinion I should say that the Greek was more
   lucid.  Although in nineteen places Labbe considers the true reading
   uncertain.

   Session II.  (Continued.)

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 617.)

   And all the most reverend bishops at the same time cried out.  This is
   a just judgment.  To Coelestine, a new Paul!  To Cyril a new Paul!  To
   Coelestine the guardian of the faith!  To Coelestine of one mind with
   the synod!  To Coelestine the whole Synod offers its thanks!  One
   Coelestine!  One Cyril!  One faith of the Synod!  One faith of the
   world!

   Projectus, the most reverend bishop and legate, said:  Let your
   holiness consider the form (tupon) of the writings of the holy and
   venerable pope Coelestine, the bishop, who has exhorted your holiness
   (not as if teaching the ignorant, but as reminding them that know) that
   those things which he had long ago defined, and now thought it right to
   remind you of, ye might give command to be carried out to the
   uttermost, according to the canon of the common faith, and according to
   the use of the Catholic Church.

   Firmus, the bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia said:  The Apostolic and
   holy see of the most holy bishop Coelestine, hath previously given a
   decision and type (tupon) in this matter, through the writings which
   were sent to the most God beloved bishops, to wit to Cyril of
   Alexandria, and to Juvenal of Jerusalem, and to Rufus of Thessalonica,
   and to the holy churches, both of Constantinople and of Antioch.  This
   we have also followed and (since the limit set for Nestorius's
   emendation was long gone by, and much time has passed since our arrival
   at the city of Ephesus in accordance with the decree of the most pious
   emperor, and thereupon having delayed no little time so that the day
   fixed by the emperor was past; and since Nestorius although cited had
   not appeared) we carried into effect the type (tupon) having pronounced
   against him a canonical and apostolical judgment.

   Arcadius the most reverend bishop and legate, said:  Although our
   sailing was slow, and contrary winds hindered us especially, so that we
   did not know whether we should arrive at the destined place, as we had
   hoped, nevertheless by God's good providence...Wherefore we desire to
   ask your blessedness, that you command that we be taught what has been
   already decreed by your holiness.

   Philip, presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See said:  We offer our
   thanks to the holy and venerable Synod, that when the writings of our
   holy and blessed pope had been read to you, the holy members by our [or
   your] holy voices, [261] ye joined yourselves to the holy head also by
   your holy acclamations.  For your blessedness is not ignorant that the
   head of the whole faith, the head of the Apostles, is blessed Peter the
   Apostle.  And since now our mediocrity, after having been
   tempest-tossed and much vexed, has arrived, we ask that ye give order
   that there be laid before us what things were done in this holy Synod
   before our arrival; in order that according to the opinion of our
   blessed pope and of this present holy assembly, we likewise may ratify
   their determination.

   Theodotus, the bishop of Ancyra said:  The God of the whole world has
   made manifest the justice of the judgment pronounced by the holy Synod
   by the writings of the most religious bishop Coelestine, and by the
   coming of your holiness.  For ye have made manifest the zeal of the
   most holy and reverend bishop Coelestine, and his care for the pious
   faith.  And since very reasonably your reverence is desirous of
   learning what has been done from the minutes of the acts concerning the
   deposition of Nestorius your reverence will be fully convinced of the
   justice of the sentence, and of the zeal of the holy Synod, and the
   symphony of the faith which the most pious and holy bishop Coelestine
   has proclaimed with a great voice, of course after your full
   conviction, the rest shall be added to the present action.

   [In the Acts follow two short letters from Coelestine, one to the
   Emperor and the other to Cyril, but nothing is said about them, or how
   they got there, and thus abruptly ends the account of this session.]

   Session III.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 621.)

   Juvenal the bishop of Jerusalem said to Arcadius and Projectus the most
   reverend bishops, and to Philip the most reverend presbyter; Yesterday
   while this holy and great synod was in session, when your holiness was
   present, you demanded after the reading of the letter of the most holy
   and blessed bishop of Great Rome, Coelestine, that the minutes made in
   the Acts with regard to the deposition of Nestorius the heretic should
   be read.  And thereupon the Synod ordered this to be done.  Your
   holiness will be good enough to inform us whether you have read them
   and understand their power.

   Philip the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See said:  From
   reading the Acts we have found what things have been done in your holy
   synod with regard to Nestorius.  We have found from the minutes that
   all things have been decided in accordance with the canons and with
   ecclesiastical discipline.  And now also we seek from your honour,
   although it may be useless, that what things have been read in your
   synod, the same should now again be read to us also; so that we may
   follow the formula (tupo) of the most holy pope Coelestine (who
   committed this same care to us), and of your holiness also, and may be
   able to confirm (bebaiosai) the judgment.

   [Arcadius having seconded Philip's motion, Memnon directed the acts to
   be read which was done by the primicerius of the notaries.]

   Philip the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See said:  There is no
   doubt, and in fact it has been known in all ages, that the holy and
   most blessed Peter, prince (exarchos) and head of the Apostles, pillar
   of the faith, and foundation (themelios) of the Catholic Church,
   received the keys of the kingdom from our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   Saviour and Redeemer of the human race, and that to him was given the
   power of loosing and binding sins:  who down even to to-day and forever
   both lives and judges in his successors.  The holy and most blessed
   pope Coelestine, according to due order, is his successor and holds his
   place, and us he sent to supply his place in this holy synod, which the
   most humane and Christian Emperors have commanded to assemble, bearing
   in mind and continually watching over the Catholic faith.  For they
   both have kept and are now keeping intact the apostolic doctrine handed
   down to them from their most pious and humane grandfathers and fathers
   of holy memory down to the present time, etc.

   [There is no further reference in the speech to the papal
   prerogatives.]

   Arcadius the most reverend bishop and legate of the Apostolic See
   said:  Nestorius hath brought us great sorrow....And since of his own
   accord he hath made himself an alien and an exile from us, we following
   the sanctions handed down from the beginning by the holy Apostles, and
   by the Catholic Church (for they taught what they had received from our
   Lord Jesus Christ), also following the types (tupois) of Coelestine,
   most holy pope of the Apostolic See, who has condescended to send us as
   his executors of this business, and also following the decrees of the
   holy Synod [we give this as our conclusion]:  Let Nestorius know that
   he is deprived of all episcopal dignity, and is an alien from the whole
   Church and from the communion of all its priests.

   Projectus, bishop and legate of the Roman Church said:  Most clearly
   from the reading, etc....Moreover I also, by my authority as legate of
   the holy Apostolic See, define, being with my brethren an executor
   (ekbibastes) of the aforesaid sentence, that the beforenamed Nestorius
   is an enemy of the truth, a corrupter of the faith, and as guilty of
   the things of which he was accused, has been removed from the grade of
   Episcopal honour, and moreover from the communion of all orthodox
   priests.

   Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria said:  The professions which have been
   made by Arcadius and Projectus, the most holy and pious bishops, as
   also by Philip, the most religious presbyter of the Roman Church, stand
   manifest to the holy Synod.  For they have made their profession in the
   place of the Apostolic See, and of the whole of the holy synod of the
   God-beloved and most holy bishops of the West.  Wherefore let those
   things which were defined by the most holy Coelestine, the God-beloved
   bishop, be carried into effect, and the vote cast against Nestorius the
   heretic, by the holy Synod, which met in the metropolis of Ephesus be
   agreed to universally; for this purpose let there be added to the
   already prepared acts the proceedings of yesterday and today, and let
   them be shewn to their holiness, so that by their subscription
   according to custom, their canonical agreement with all of us may be
   manifest.

   Arcadius the most reverend bishop and legate of the Roman Church,
   said:  According to the acts of this holy Synod, we necessarily confirm
   with our subscriptions their doctrines.

   The Holy Synod said:  Since Arcadius and Projectus the most reverend
   and most religious bishops and legates and Philip, the presbyter and
   legate of the Apostolic See, have said that they are of the same mind
   with us, it only remains, that they redeem their promises and confirm
   the acts with their signatures, and then let the minutes of the acts be
   shewn to them.

   [The three then signed.]

   (Critical Annotations on the text will be found in Dr. Routh's
   Scriptorum Eccl. Opusc. Tom. II. [Ed. III.] p. 85.)

   The holy and ecumenical Synod, gathered together in Ephesus by the
   decree of our most religious Emperors, to the bishops, presbyters,
   deacons, and all the people in every province and city:

   When we had assembled, according to the religious decree [of the
   Emperors], in the Metropolis of Ephesus, certain persons, a little more
   than thirty in number, withdrew from amongst us, having for the leader
   of their schism John, Bishop of Antioch.  Their names are as follows:
   first, the said John of Antioch in Syria, John of Damascus, Alexander
   of Apamea, Alexander of Hierapolis, Himerius of Nicomedia, Fritilas of
   Heraclea, Helladius of Tarsus, Maximin of Anazarbus, Theodore of
   Marcianopolis, Peter of Trajanopolis, Paul of Emissa, Polychronius of
   Heracleopolis, Euthyrius of Tyana, Meletius of Neocæsarea, Theodoret of
   Cyrus, Apringius of Chalcedon, Macarius of Laodicea Magna, Zosys of
   Esbus, Sallust of Corycus in Cilicia, Hesychius of Castabala in
   Cilicia, Valentine of Mutloblaca, Eustathius of Parnassus, Philip of
   Theodosia, and Daniel, and Dexianus, and Julian, and Cyril, and
   Olympius, and Diogenes, Polius, Theophanes of Philadelphia, Trajan of
   Augusta, Aurelius of Irenopolis, Mysæus of Aradus, Helladius of
   Ptolemais.  These men, having no privilege of ecclesiastical communion
   on the ground of a priestly authority, by which they could injure or
   benefit any persons; since some of them had already been deposed; and
   since from their refusing to join in our decree against Nestorius, it
   was manifestly evident to all men that they were all promoting the
   opinions of Nestorius and Celestius; the Holy Synod, by one common
   decree, deposed them from all ecclesiastical communion, and deprived
   them of all their priestly power by which they might injure or profit
   any persons.

   Canon I.

   Whereas it is needful that they who were detained from the holy Synod
   and remained in their own district or city, for any reason,
   ecclesiastical or personal, should not be ignorant of the matters which
   were thereby decreed; we, therefore, notify your holiness and charity
   that if any Metropolitan of a Province, forsaking the holy and
   Ecumenical Synod, has joined the assembly of the apostates, or shall
   join the same hereafter; or, if he has adopted, or shall hereafter
   adopt, the doctrines of Celestius, he has no power in any way to do
   anything in opposition to the bishops of the province, since he is
   already cast forth from all ecclesiastical communion and made incapable
   of exercising his ministry; but he shall himself be subject in all
   things to those very bishops of the province and to the neighbouring
   orthodox metropolitans, and shall be degraded from his episcopal rank.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   If a metropolitan, having deserted his synod, adheres or shall adhere
   to Celestine, let him be cast out.

   Nicholas Hydruntinus.

   Scholion concerning Celestine and Celestius.  Whose finds at the end of
   the fourth canon of the Holy Synod of Ephesus [and the same is true of
   this first canon.  Ed.] "Clerics who shall have consented to Celestine
   or Nestorius, should be deposed," let him not read "Celestine" with an
   "n," but "Celestius" without the "n."  For Celestine was the holy and
   orthodox Pope of Rome, Celestius was the heretic.

   It is perfectly certain that this was no accident on the part of
   Aristenus, for in his commentary on Canon V., he expressly says that
   "Celestine was Bishop of Rome" and goes on to affirm that, "The Holy
   Synod decreed that they who embraced the opinions of Nestorius and
   Celestine," etc.  What perhaps is equally astonishing is that Nicholas
   Hydruntinus, while correcting the name, still is of opinion that
   Celestius was a pope of Rome and begins his scholion with the title,
   peri Kelestinou kai Kelestiou Papon Romes.  Beveridge well points out
   that this confusion is all the more remarkable as in the Kalendar of
   the Saints observed at that very time by the Greeks, on the eighth day
   of April was kept the memory of "Celestine, Pope of Rome, as a Saint
   and Champion against the Nestorian heretics."  (Bev., Annot, in C. v.).

   Simeon the Logothete adds to this epitome the words, kai to exes
   adioiketos which are necessary to make the sense complete.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Excursus on the Conciliabulum of John of Antioch.

   The assembly referred to in this canon is one held by John of Antioch
   who had delayed his coming so as to hamper the meeting of the synod.
   John was a friend of Nestorius and made many fruitless attempts to
   induce him to accept the orthodox faith.  It will be noticed that the
   conciliabulum was absolutely silent with respect to Nestorius and his
   doctrine and contented itself with attacking St. Cyril and the orthodox
   Memnon, the bishop of Ephesus.  St. Cyril and his friends did indeed
   accuse the Antiochenes of being adherents of Nestorius, and in a
   negative way they certainly were so, and were in open opposition to the
   defenders of the orthodox faith; but, as Tillemont [263] has well
   pointed out, they did not theologically agree with the heresy of
   Nestorius, gladly accepted the orthodox watchword "Mother of God," and
   subsequently agreed to his deposition.

   The first session of the Council of Ephesus had already taken place on
   June 22, and it was only on June 26th or 27th, that John of Antioch
   arrived at last at Ephesus.

   (Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. III., p. 55 et seqq.)

   The Synod immediately sent a deputation to meet him, consisting of
   several bishops and clerics, to show him proper respect, and at the
   same time to make him acquainted with the deposition of Nestorius, so
   that he might not be drawn into any intercourse with him.  The soldiers
   who surrounded Archbishop John prevented the deputation from speaking
   to him in the street; consequently they accompanied him to his abode,
   but were compelled to wait here for several hours, exposed to the
   insults of the soldiers, and at last, when they had discharged their
   commission, were driven home, ill-treated and beaten.  Count Irenæus,
   the friend of Nestorius, had suggested this treatment, and approved of
   it.  The envoys immediately informed the Synod of what had happened,
   and showed the wounds which they had received, which called forth great
   indignation against John of Antioch.  According to the representation
   of Memnon, excommunication was for this reason pronounced against him;
   but we shall see further on that this did not take place until
   afterwards, and it is clear that Memnon, in his brief narrative, has
   passed over an intermediate portion--the threefold invitation of John.
   In the meantime, Candidian had gone still further in his opposition to
   the members of the synod, causing them to be annoyed and insulted by
   his soldiers, and even cutting off their supply of food, while he
   provided Nestorius with a regular body-guard of armed peasants.  John
   of Antioch, immediately after his arrival, while still dusty from the
   journey, and at the time when he was allowing the envoys of the synod
   to wait, held at his town residence a Conciliabulum with his adherents,
   at which, first of all Count Candidian related how Cyril and his
   friends, in spite of all warnings, and in opposition to the imperial
   decrees, had held a session five days before, had contested his (the
   count's) right to be present, had dismissed the bishops sent by
   Nestorius, and had paid no attention to the letters of others.  Before
   he proceeded further, John of Antioch requested that the Emperor's
   edict of convocation should be read, whereupon Candidian went on with
   his account of what had taken place, and in answer to a fresh question
   of John's declared that Nestorius had been condemned unheard.  John
   found this quite in keeping with the disposition of the synod since,
   instead of receiving him and his companions in a friendly manner, they
   had rushed upon them tumultuously (it was thus that he described what
   had happened).  But the holy Synod, which was now assembled, would
   decide what was proper with respect to them.  And this synod, of which
   John speaks in such grandiloquent terms, numbered only forty-three
   members, including himself, while on the other side there were more
   than two hundred.

   John then proposed the question [as to] what was to be decided
   respecting Cyril and his adherents; and several who were not
   particularly pronounced Nestorian bishops came forward to relate how
   Cyril and Memnon of Ephesus had, from the beginning, maltreated the
   Nestorians, had allowed them no church, and even on the festival of
   Pentecost had permitted them to hold no service.  Besides Memnon had
   sent his clerics into the residences of the bishops, and had ordered
   them with threats to take part in his council.  And in this way he and
   Cyril had confused everything, so that their own heresies might not be
   examined.  Heresies, such as the Arian, the Apollinarian, and the
   Eunomian, were certainly contained in the last letter of Cyril [to
   Nestorius, along with the anathematisms].  It was therefore John's duty
   to see to it that the heads of these heresies (Cyril and Memnon) should
   be suitably punished for such grave offences, and that the bishops who
   had been misguided by them should be subjected to ecclesiastical
   penalties.

   To these impudent and false accusations John replied with hypocritical
   meekness "that he had certainly wished that he should not be compelled
   to exclude from the Church any one who had been received into the
   sacred priesthood, but diseased members must certainly be cut off in
   order to save the whole body; and for this reason Cyril and Memnon
   deserved to be deposed, because they had given occasion to disorders,
   and had acted in opposition to the commands of the Emperors, and
   besides, were in the chapters mentioned [the anathematisms] guilty of
   heresy.  All who had been misled by them were to be excommunicated
   until they confessed their error, anathematized the heretical
   propositions of Cyril, adhered strictly to the creed of Nice, without
   any foreign addition, and joined the synod of John."

   The assembly approved of this proposal, and John then announced the
   sentence in the following manner:--

   "The holy Synod, assembled in Ephesus, by the grace of God and the
   command of the pious Emperors, declares:  We should indeed have wished
   to be able to hold a Synod in peace, but because you held a separate
   assembly from a heretical, insolent, and obstinate disposition,
   although we were already in the neighbourhood, and have filled both the
   city and the holy Synod with confusion, in order to prevent the
   examination of your Apollinarian, Arian, and Eunomian heresies, and
   have not waited for the arrival of the holy bishops of all regions, and
   have also disregarded the warnings and admonitions of Candidian,
   therefore shall you, Cyril of Alexandria, and you Memnon of this place,
   know that you are deposed and dismissed from all sacerdotal functions,
   as the originators of the whole disorder, etc.  You others, who gave
   your consent, are excommunicated, until you acknowledge your fault and
   reform, accept anew the Nicene faith [as if they had surrendered it!]
   without foreign addition, anathematize the heretical propositions of
   Cyril, and in all things comply with the command of the Emperors, who
   require a peaceful and more accurate consideration of the dogma."

   This decree was subscribed by all the forty-three members of the
   Conciliabulum:

   The Conciliabulum then, in very one-sided letters informed the Emperor,
   the imperial ladies (the wife and sister of the Emperor Theodosius
   II.), the clergy, the senate, and the people of Constantinople, of all
   that had taken place, and a little later once more required the members
   of the genuine Synod, in writing, no longer to delay the time for
   repentance and conversion, and to separate themselves from Cyril and
   Memnon, etc., otherwise they would very soon be forced to lament their
   own folly.

   On Saturday evening the Conciliabulum asked Count Candidian to take
   care that neither Cyril nor Memnon, nor any one of their
   (excommunicated) adherents should hold divine service on Sunday.
   Candidian now wished that no member of either synodal party should
   officiate, but only the ordinary clergy of the city; but Memnon
   declared that he would in no way submit to John and his synod, and
   Cyril and his adherents held divine service.  All the efforts of John
   to appoint by force another bishop of Ephesus in the place of Memnon
   were frustrated by the opposition of the orthodox inhabitants.

   Canon II.

   If any provincial bishops were not present at the holy Synod and have
   joined or attempted to join the apostacy; or if, after subscribing the
   deposition of Nestorius, they went back into the assembly of apostates;
   these men, according to the decree of the holy Synod, are to be deposed
   from the priesthood and degraded from their rank.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   If any bishop assents to or favours Nestorius, let him be discharged.

   It was not unnatural that when it was seen that the Imperial authority
   was in favour of the Antiochene party that some of the clergy should
   have been weak enough to vacillate in their course, the more so as the
   Conciliabulum was not either avowedly, nor really, a Nestorian
   assembly, but one made up of those not sympathizing with Nestorius's
   heresy, yet friendly to the heretic himself, and disapproving of what
   they looked upon as the uncalled-for harshness and precipitancy of
   Cyril's course.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon III.

   If any of the city or country clergy have been inhibited by Nestorius
   or his followers from the exercise of the priesthood, on account of
   their orthodoxy, we have declared it just that these should be restored
   to their proper rank.  And in general we forbid all the clergy who
   adhere to the Orthodox and Ecumenical Synod in any way to submit to the
   bishops who have already apostatized or shall hereafter apostatize.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   To whom Nestorius forbids the priesthood, he is most worthy; but whom
   he approves is profane.

   It would seem from this canon that any bishop who had become a member
   of the Conciliabulum of John, was considered as eo ipso having lost all
   jurisdiction.  Also it would seem that the clergy were to disregard the
   inhibition of Nestorian prelates or at least these inhibitions were by
   some one to be removed.  This principle, if generally applied, would
   seem to be somewhat revolutionary.

   (Apos. Fath. Ign. Ad Rom. i., Vol. II., Sec. I., p. 191.)

   The words choros ("place"), chora ("country"), and chorion
   ("district"), may be distinguished as implying locality, extension, and
   limitation, respectively.  The last word commonly denotes either "an
   estate, a farm," or "a fastness, a stronghold," or (as a mathematical
   term) "an area."  Here, as not unfrequently in later writers, it is "a
   region, a district," but the same fundamental idea is presumed.  The
   relation of choros to chorion is the same as that of arguros, chrusos
   to argurion, chrusion, the former being the metals themselves, the
   latter the metals worked up into bullion or coins or plate or trinkets
   or images, e.g. Macar. Magn. Apocr. iii. 42 (p. 147).

   If any of the clergy should fall away, and publicly or privately
   presume to maintain the doctrines of Nestorius or Celestius, it is
   declared just by the holy Synod that these also should be deposed.

   Excursus on Pelagianism.

   The only point which is material to the main object of this volume is
   that Pelagius and his fellow heretic Celestius were condemned by the
   Ecumenical Council of Ephesus for their heresy.  On this point there
   can be no possible doubt.  And further than this the Seventh Council by
   ratifying the Canons of Trullo received the Canons of the African Code
   which include those of the Carthaginian conciliar condemnations of the
   Pelagian heresy to which the attention of the reader is particularly
   drawn.  The condemnation of these heretics at Ephesus is said to have
   been due chiefly to the energy of St. Augustine, assisted very
   materially by a layman living in Constantinople by the name of Marius
   Mercator.

   Pelagius and his heresy have a sad interest to us as he is said to have
   been born in Britain.  He was a monk and preached at Rome with great
   applause in the early years of the fifth century.  But in his extreme
   horror of Manichæism and Gnosticism he fell into the opposite extreme;
   and from the hatred of the doctrine of the inherent evilness of
   humanity he fell into the error of denying the necessity of grace.

   Pelagius's doctrines may be briefly stated thus.  Adam's sin injured
   only himself, so that there is no such thing as original sin.  Infants
   therefore are not born in sin and the children of wrath, but are born
   innocent, and only need baptism so as to be knit into Christ, not "for
   the remission of sins" as is declared in the creed.  Further he taught
   that man could live without committing any sin at all.  And for this
   there was no need of grace; indeed grace was not possible, according to
   his teaching.  The only "grace," which he would admit the existence of,
   was what we may call external grace, e.g. the example of Christ, the
   teaching of his ministers, and the like.  Petavius [265] indeed thinks
   that he allowed the activity of internal grace to illumine the
   intellect, but this seems quite doubtful.

   Pelagius's writings have come down to us in a more or less--generally
   the latter--pure form.  There are fourteen books on the Epistles of St.
   Paul, also a letter to Demetrius and his Libellus fidei ad
   Innocentium.  In the writings of St. Augustine are found fragments of
   Pelagius's writings on free will.

   It would be absurd to attempt in the limits possible to this volume to
   give any, even the most sketchy, treatment of the doctrine involved in
   the Pelagian controversy:  the reader must be referred to the great
   theologians for this and to aid him I append a bibliographical table on
   the subject.

   The English works on the subject are so well known to the English
   reader as to need no mention.

   As it is impossible to treat the theological question here, so too is
   it impossible to treat the historical question.  However I may remind
   the reader that Nestorius and his heresy were defended by Theodore of
   Mopsuestia, and that he and Celestius were declared by Pope Zosimus to
   be innocent in the year 417, a decision which was entirely disregarded
   by the rest of the world, a Carthaginian Synod subsequently
   anathematizing him.  Finally the Pope retracted his former decision,
   and in 418 anathematized him and his fellow, and gave notice of this in
   his "epistola tractoria" to the bishops.  Eighteen Italian bishops, who
   had followed the Pope in his former decision of a twelve month before,
   refused to change their minds at his bidding now, and were accordingly
   deposed, among them Julian of Eclanum.  After this Pelagius and
   Celestius found a fitting harbour of refuge with Nestorius of
   Constantinople, and so all three were condemned together by the council
   of Ephesus, he that denied the incarnation of the Word, and they twain
   that denied the necessity of that incarnation and of the grace
   purchased thereby.

   Canon V.

   If any have been condemned for evil practices by the holy Synod, or by
   their own bishops; and if, with his usual lack of discrimination,
   Nestorius (or his followers) has attempted, or shall hereafter attempt,
   uncanonically to restore such persons to communion and to their former
   rank, we have declared that they shall not be profited thereby, but
   shall remain deposed nevertheless.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   If one condemned by his bishop is received by Nestorius it shall profit
   him nothing.

   This canon is interesting as shewing that thus early in the history of
   the Church, it was not unusual for those disciplined for their faults
   in one communion to go to another and there be welcomed and restored,
   to the overthrow of discipline and to the lowering of the moral sense
   of the people to whom they minister.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   Likewise, if any should in any way attempt to set aside the orders in
   each case made by the holy Synod at Ephesus, the holy Synod decrees
   that, if they be bishops or clergymen, they shall absolutely forfeit
   their office; and, if laymen, that they shall be excommunicated.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   If any layman shall resist the Synod, let him be excommunicated.  But
   if it be a cleric let him be discharged.

   How courageous the passing of this canon was can only be justly
   appreciated by those who are familiar with the weight of the imperial
   authority at that day in ecclesiastical matters and who will remember
   that at the very time this canon was passed it was extremely difficult
   to say whether the Emperor would support Cyril's or John's synod.

   Observation of the Roman Editors (Ed: 1608).

   In the Vatican books and in some others only these six canons are
   found; but in certain texts there is added, under the name of Canon
   VII., the definition of the same holy Synod put forth after the
   Presbyter Charisius had stated his case, and for Canon VIII. another
   decree of the synod concerning the bishops of Cyprus.

   Observation of Philip Labbe, S.J.P.

   In the Collections of John Zonaras and of Theodore Balsamon, also in
   the "Code of the Universal Church" which has John Tilius, Bishop of St.
   Brieuc and Christopher Justellus for its editors, are found eight
   canons of the Ephesine council, to wit the six which are appended to
   the foregoing epistle and two others:  but it is altogether a subject
   of wonder that in the Codex of Canons, made for the Roman Church by
   Dionysius Exiguus, none of these canons are found at all.  I suppose
   that the reason of this is that the Latins saw that they were not
   decrees affecting the Universal Church, but that the Canons set forth
   by the Ephesine fathers dealt merely with the peculiar and private
   matters of Nestorius and of his followers.

   The Decree of the same holy Synod, pronounced after hearing the
   Exposition [of the Faith] by the Three hundred and eighteen holy and
   blessed Fathers in the city of Nice, and the impious formula composed
   by Theodore of Mopsuestia, and given to the same holy Synod at Ephesus
   by the Presbyter Charisius, of Philadelphia:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VII.

   When these things had been read, the holy Synod decreed that it is
   unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a
   different (heteran) Faith as a rival to that established by the holy
   Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicæa.

   But those who shall dare to compose a different faith, or to introduce
   or offer it to persons desiring to turn to the acknowledgment of the
   truth, whether from Heathenism or from Judaism, or from any heresy
   whatsoever, shall be deposed, if they be bishops or clergymen; bishops
   from the episcopate and clergymen from the clergy; and if they be
   laymen, they shall be anathematized.

   And in like manner, if any, whether bishops, clergymen, or laymen,
   should be discovered to hold or teach the doctrines contained in the
   Exposition introduced by the Presbyter Charisius concerning the
   Incarnation of the Only-Begotten Son of God, or the abominable and
   profane doctrines of Nestorius, which are subjoined, they shall be
   subjected to the sentence of this holy and ecumenical Synod.  So that,
   if it be a bishop, he shall be removed from his bishopric and degraded;
   if it be a clergyman, he shall likewise be stricken from the clergy;
   and if it be a layman, he shall be anathematized, as has been afore
   said.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   Any bishop who sets forth a faith other than that of Nice shall be an
   alien from the Church:  if a layman do so let him be cast out.

   The heading is that found in the ordinary Greek texts.  The canon
   itself is found verbatim in the Acts--Actio VI. (Labbe and Cossart,
   Concilia, Tom. III., col. 689.)

   Beveridge.

   "When these things had been read."  Balsamon here makes an egregious
   mistake, for it was not after the reading of the decree of this council
   and of the Nicene Creed, that this canon was set forth, as Balsamon
   affirms; but after the reading of the libellum of Charisius, and of the
   Nestorian Creed, as is abundantly evident from what we read in the Acts
   of the council.  From this it is clear that Balsamon had never seen the
   Acts of this council, or at least had never carefully studied them,
   else he could not have written such a comment.

   [With regard to Charisius, Balsamon] makes another mistake.  For not
   only did this presbyter not follow the evil opinions of Nestorius, but
   as a matter of fact exhibited to the synod his libellum written against
   Nestorius; in which so far from asserting that Nestorius was orthodox,
   he distinctly calls him kakodoxos.

   Photius has included this canon in his Nomocanons, Title I., cap. j.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Excursus on the Words pistin heperan

   It has been held by some and was urged by the Greeks at the Council of
   Florence, [267] and often before and since, as well as by Pope Leo
   III., in answer to the ambassadors of Charlemagne, that the prohibition
   of the Council of Ephesus to make, hold, or teach any other faith than
   that of Nice forbade anyone, even a subsequent General Council, to add
   anything to the creed.  This interpretation seems to be shewn to be
   incorrect from the following circumstances.

   1.  That the prohibition was passed by the Council immediately after it
   had heard Charisius read his creed, which it had approved, and on the
   strength of which it had received its author, and after the reading of
   a Nestorian creed which it condemned.  From this it seems clear that
   heteran must mean "different," "contradictory," and not "another" in
   the sense of mere explanatory additions to the already existing creed.

   (E. B. Pusey, On the Clause "and the Son," p. 81.)

   St. Cyril ought to understand the canon, which he probably himself
   framed, as presiding over the Council of Ephesus, as Archbishop of
   Alexandria and representative of Celestine, Bishop of Rome.  His
   signature immediately succeeds the Canon.  We can hardly think that we
   understand it better than he who probably framed it, nay who presided
   over the Council which passed it.  He, however, explained that what was
   not against the Creed was not beside it.  The Orientals had proposed to
   him, as terms of communion, that he should "do away with all he had
   written in epistles, tomes, or books, and agree with that only faith
   which had been defined by our holy Fathers at Nice."  But, St. Cyril
   wrote back:  "We all follow that exposition of faith which was defined
   by the holy fathers in the city of Nice, sapping absolutely nothing of
   the things contained in it.  For they are all right and
   unexceptionable; and anything curious, after it, is not safe.  But what
   I have rightly written against the blasphemies of Nestorius no words
   will persuade me to say that they were not done well:"  and against the
   imputation that he "had received an exposition of faith or new Creed,
   as dishonouring that old and venerable Creed," he says:

   "Neither have we demanded of any an exposition of faith, nor have we
   received one newly framed by others.  For Divine Scripture suffices us,
   and the prudence of the holy fathers, and the symbol of faith, framed
   perfectly as to all right doctrine.  But since the most holy Eastern
   Bishops differed from us as to that of Ephesus and were somehow
   suspected of being entangled in the meshes of Nestorius, therefore they
   very wisely made a defence, to free themselves from blame, and eager to
   satisfy the lovers of the blameless faith that they were minded to have
   no share in his impiety; and the thing is far from all note of blame.
   If Nestorius himself, when we all held out to him that he ought to
   condemn his own dogmas and choose the truth instead thereof, had made a
   written confession thereon, who would say that he framed for us a new
   exposition of faith?  Why then do they calumniate the assent of the
   most holy Bishops of Phoenicia, calling it a new setting forth of the
   Creed, whereas they made it for a good and necessary end, to defend
   themselves and soothe those who thought that they followed the
   innovations of Nestorius?  For the holy Ecumenical Synod gathered at
   Ephesus provided, of necessity, that no other exposition of faith
   besides that which existed, which the most blessed fathers, speaking in
   the Holy Ghost, defined, should be brought into the Churches of God.
   But they who at one time, I know not how, differed from it, and were
   suspected of not being right-minded, following the Apostolic and
   Evangelic doctrines, how should they free themselves from this
   ill-report? by silence? or rather by self-defence, and by manifesting
   the power of the faith which was in them?  The divine disciple wrote,
   be ready always to give an answer to every one who asketh you an
   account of the hope which is in you.'  But he who willeth to do this,
   innovates in nothing, nor doth he frame any new exposition of faith,
   but rather maketh plain to those who ask him, what faith he hath
   concerning Christ." [268]

   2.  The fathers of the Council of Chalcedon, by their practice, are
   authoritative exponents of the Canon of Ephesus.  For they renewed the
   prohibition of the Council of Ephesus to "adduce any other faith," but,
   in "the faith" which is not to be set aside, they included not only the
   Creeds of Nice and Constantinople, but the definitions at Ephesus and
   Chalcedon itself.  The statements of the faith were expanded, because
   fresh contradictions of the faith had emerged.  After directing that
   both Creeds should be read, the Council says, "This wise and saving
   Symbol of Divine grace would have sufficed to the full knowledge and
   confirmation of the faith; for it teaches thoroughly the perfect truth
   of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and presents to those who receive
   it faithfully the Incarnation of the Lord."  Then, having in detail
   shewn how both heresies were confuted by it, and having set forth the
   true doctrine, they sum up.

   "These things being framed by us with all accuracy and care on every
   side, the holy and ecumenical Synod defines, that it shall be lawful
   for no one to produce or compose, or put together, or hold, or teach
   others another faith, and those who venture, etc." (as in the Council
   of Ephesus).

   The Council of Chalcedon enlarged greatly the terms although not the
   substance of the faith contained in the Nicene Creed; and that, in view
   of the heresies, which had since arisen; and yet renewed in terms the
   prohibition of the Canon of Ephesus and the penalties annexed to its
   infringement.  It shewed, then, in practice, that it did not hold the
   enlargement of the things proposed as de fide to be prohibited, but
   only the producing of things contradictory to the faith once delivered
   to the saints.  Its prohibition, moreover, to "hold" another faith
   shews the more that they meant only to prohibit any contradictory
   statement of faith.  For if they had prohibited any additional
   statement not being a contradiction of its truth, then (as Cardinal
   Julian acutely argued in the Council of Florence), any one would fall
   under its anathema, who held (as all must) anything not expressed in
   set terms in the Nicene Creed; such as that God is eternal or
   incomprehensible.

   It may not be amiss to remember that the argument that pistin heteran
   forbids any addition to the Creed or any further definition of the
   faith, was that urged by the heretics at the Latrocinium, and the
   orthodox were there condemned on the ground that they had added to the
   faith and laid themselves under the Anathema of Ephesus.  How far this
   interpretation was from being that of the Council of Chalcedon is
   evinced by the fact that it immediately declared that St. Flavian and
   Bishop Eusebius had been unjustly deposed, and proceeded to depose
   those who had deposed them.  After stating these facts Dr. Pusey
   remarks, "Protestants may reject consistently the authority of all
   councils; but on what grounds any who accept their authority can insist
   on their own private interpretation of a canon of one council against
   the authority of another General Council which rejected that
   interpretation, I see not." [269]

   4.  The Fifth Ecumenical Council, the Second of Constantinople,
   received both the creeds of Nice and that of Constantinople, as well of
   the definitions of Ephesus and Chalcedon, and yet at the end of the
   fourth Session we find in the acts that the fathers cried out, with
   respect to the creed of Theodore of Mopsuestia:  "This creed Satan
   composed.  Anathema to him that composed this creed!  The First Council
   of Ephesus anathematized this creed and its author.  We know only one
   symbol of faith, that which the holy fathers of Nice set forth and
   handed down.  This also the three holy Synods handed down.  Into this
   we were baptized, and into this we baptize, etc., etc." [270]  From
   this it is clearer than day that these fathers looked upon the creed of
   Constantinople, with its additions, to be yet the same creed as that of
   Nice.

   (Le Quien, Diss. Dam., n. 37.)

   In the Sixth Council also, no one objecting, Peter of Nicomedia,
   Theodore, and other bishops, clerks, and monks, who had embraced the
   Monothelite heresy, openly recited a Creed longer and fuller than the
   Nicene.

   In the Seventh Synod also, another was read written by Theodore of
   Jerusalem: and again, Basil of Ancyra, and the other Bishops, who had
   embraced the errors of the Iconoclasts, again offered another, although
   the Canon of Ephesus pronounced, that "it should not be lawful to offer
   to heretics, who wished to be converted to the Church, any other creed
   than the Nicene."  In this same Synod, was read another profession of
   faith, which Tarasius had sent to the Patriarchs of the Eastern sees.
   It contains the Nicene, or Constantinopolitan Creed, variously enlarged
   and interpolated.  But of the Holy Spirit it has specifically this:
   "And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, which proceedeth
   from the Father through the Son."  But since the Greeks at the Council
   of Florence said, that these were individual, not common, formulæ of
   faith, here are others, which are plainly common and solemn, which are
   contained in their own rituals.  They do not baptize a Hebrew or a Jew,
   until he have pronounced a profession of Christian Faith, altogether
   different from the Creed of Constantinople, as may be seen in the
   Euchologion.  In the consecration of a Bishop, the Bishop elect is
   first bidden to recite the Creed of Constantinople; and then, as if
   this did not suffice, a second and a third are demanded of him; of
   which the last contains that aforesaid symbol, intermingled with
   various declarations.  Nay, Photius himself is pointed out to be the
   author of this interpolated symbol. [271]   I pass by other formulæ,
   which the Greeks have framed for those who return to the Church from
   divers heresies or sects, although the terms of the Canon of Ephesus
   are, that "it is unlawful to propose any other faith to those who wish
   to be converted to the Church, from heathenism, or Judaism, or any
   heresy whatever."

   Canon VIII.

   Our brother bishop Rheginus, the beloved of God, and his fellow beloved
   of God bishops, Zeno and Evagrius, of the Province of Cyprus, have
   reported to us an innovation which has been introduced contrary to the
   ecclesiastical constitutions and the Canons of the Holy Apostles, and
   which touches the liberties of all.  Wherefore, since injuries
   affecting all require the more attention, as they cause the greater
   damage, and particularly when they are transgressions of an ancient
   custom; and since those excellent men, who have petitioned the Synod,
   have told us in writing and by word of mouth that the Bishop of Antioch
   has in this way held ordinations in Cyprus; therefore the Rulers of the
   holy churches in Cyprus shall enjoy, without dispute or injury,
   according to the Canons of the blessed Fathers and ancient custom, the
   right of performing for themselves the ordination of their excellent
   Bishops.  The same rule shall be observed in the other dioceses and
   provinces everywhere, so that none of the God beloved Bishops shall
   assume control of any province which has not heretofore, from the very
   beginning, been under his own hand or that of his predecessors.  But if
   any one has violently taken and subjected [a Province], he shall give
   it up; lest the Canons of the Fathers be transgressed; or the vanities
   of worldly honour be brought in under pretext of sacred office; or we
   lose, without knowing it, little by little, the liberty which Our Lord
   Jesus Christ, the Deliverer of all men, hath given us by his own Blood.

   Wherefore, this holy and ecumenical Synod has decreed that in every
   province the rights which heretofore, from the beginning, have belonged
   to it, shall be preserved to it, according to the old prevailing
   custom, unchanged and uninjured:  every Metropolitan having permission
   to take, for his own security, a copy of these acts.  And if any one
   shall bring forward a rule contrary to what is here determined, this
   holy and ecumenical Synod unanimously decrees that it shall be of no
   effect.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   Let the rights of each province be preserved pure and inviolate.  No
   attempt to introduce any form contrary to these shall be of any avail.

   The caption is the one given in the ordinary Greek texts.  The canon is
   found word for word in the VII Session of the Council, with the
   heading, "A decree of the same holy Synod."  (Labbe and Cossart,
   Concilia, Tom. III., col. 802.)

   I have followed in reading "the Canons of the Holy Apostles" the
   reading in Balsamon and Zonaras, and that of Elias Ehingerus Augustanus
   (so says Beveridge) in his edition of the Greek canons, a.d. 1614.  But
   the Bodleian ms., and John of Antioch in his collection of the Canons,
   and the Codex edited by Christopher Justellus read "of the Holy
   Fathers" instead of "of the Holy Apostles."  Beveridge is of opinion
   that this is the truer reading, for while no doubt the Ephesine Fathers
   had in mind the Apostolic Canons, yet they seem to have more
   particularly referred in this place to the canons of Nice.  And this
   seems to be intimated in the libellum of the Bishops of Cyprus, who
   gave rise to this very decree, in which the condemned practice is said
   to be "contrary to the Apostolic Canons and to the definitions of the
   most holy Council of Nice."

   This canon Photius does not recognize, for in the Preface to his
   Nomocanon he distinctly writes that there were but seven canons adopted
   by the Ephesine Synod, and in the first chapter of the first title he
   cites the preceding canon as the seventh, that is the last.  John of
   Antioch likewise says that there are but seven canons of Ephesus, but
   reckons this present canon as the seventh, from which Beveridge
   concludes that he rejects the Canon concerning Charisius (vii).

   Beveridge.

   Concerning the present canon, of rather decree, the Bishop of Antioch,
   who had given occasion to the six former canons, gave also occasion for
   the enacting of this, by arrogating to himself the right of ordaining
   in the Island of Cyprus, in violation of former usage.  After the
   bishops of that island, who are mentioned in the canon, had presented
   their statements (libellum) to the Synod, the present decree was set
   forth, in which warning was given that no innovation should be
   tolerated in Ecclesiastical administration, whether in Cyprus or
   elsewhere; but that in all Dioceses and Provinces their ancient rights
   and privileges should be preserved.

   The Letter of the Same Holy Synod of Ephesus, to the Sacred Synod in
   Pamphylia Concerning Eustathius Who Had Been Their Metropolitan.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tome III., col. 806.)

   Forasmuch as the divinely inspired Scripture says, "Do all things with
   advice," [272] it is especially their duty who have had the priestly
   ministry allotted to them to examine with all diligence whatever
   matters are to be transacted.  For to those who will so spend their
   lives, it comes to pass both that they are established in [the
   enjoyment of] an honest hope concerning what belongs to them, and that
   they are borne along, as by a favouring breeze, in things that they
   desire:  so that, in truth, the saying [of the Scripture] has much
   reason [to commend it].  But there are times when bitter and
   intolerable grief swoops down upon the mind, and has the effect of
   cruelly beclouding it, so as to carry it away from the pursuit of what
   is needful, and persuade it to consider that to be of service which is
   in its [very] nature mischievous.  Something of this kind we have seen
   endured by that most excellent and most religious Bishop Eustathius.
   For it is in evidence that he has been ordained canonically; but having
   been much disturbed, as he declares, by certain parties, and having
   entered upon circumstances he had not foreseen, therefore, though fully
   able to repel the slanders of his persecutors, he nevertheless, through
   an extraordinary inexperience of affairs, declined to battle with the
   difficulties which beset him, and in some way that we know not set
   forth an act of resignation.  Yet it behooved him, when he had been
   once entrusted with the priestly care, to cling to it with spiritual
   energy, and, as it were, to strip himself to strive against the
   troubles and gladly to endure the sweat for which he had bargained.
   But inasmuch as he proved himself to be deficient in practical
   capacity, having met with this misfortune rather from inexperience than
   from cowardice and sloth, your holiness has of necessity ordained our
   most excellent and most religious brother and fellow-bishop, Theodore,
   as the overseer of the Church; for it was not reasonable that it should
   remain in widowhood, and that the Saviour's sheep should pass their
   time without a shepherd.  But when he came to us weeping, not
   contending with the aforenamed most religious Bishop Theodore for his
   See or Church, but in the meantime seeking only for his rank and title
   as a bishop, we all suffered with the old man in his grief, and
   considering his weeping as our own, we hastened to discover whether the
   aforenamed [Eustathius] had been subjected to a legal deposition, or
   whether, forsooth, he had been convicted on any of the absurd charges
   alleged by certain parties who had poured forth idle gossip against his
   reputation.  And indeed we learned that nothing of such a kind had
   taken place, but rather that his resignation had been counted against
   the said Eustathius instead of a [regular] indictment.  Wherefore, we
   did by no means blame your holiness for being compelled to ordain into
   his place the aforenamed most excellent Bishop Theodore.  But forasmuch
   as it was not seemly to contend much against the unpractical character
   of the man, while it was rather necessary to have pity on the elder
   who, at so advanced an age, was now so far away from the city which had
   given him birth, and from the dwelling-places of his fathers, we have
   judicially pronounced and decreed without any opposition, that he shall
   have both the name, and the rank, and the communion of the episcopate.
   On this condition, however, only, that he shall not ordain, and that he
   shall not take and minister to a Church of his own individual
   authority; but that [he shall do so only] if taken as an assistant, or
   when appointed, if it should so chance, by a brother and fellow-bishop,
   in accordance with the ordinance and the love which is in Christ.  If,
   however, ye shall determine anything more favourable towards him,
   either now or hereafter, this also will be pleasing to the Holy Synod.

   The Letter of the Synod to Pope Celestine.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 659; also in Migne, Pat.
   Lat. [reprinted from Galland., Vett. Patr., Tom. ix.], Tom. L., Ep.
   xx., col. 511.)

   The relation which the holy council of Ephesus sent to Pope Celestine;
   in which are explained what things were done in that Holy and Great
   Council.

   The Holy Synod which by the grace of God was assembled at Ephesus the
   Metropolis to the most holy and our fellow-minister Coelestine, health
   in the Lord.

   The zeal of your holiness for piety, and your care for the right faith,
   so grateful and highly pleasing to God the Saviour of us all, are
   worthy of all admiration.  For it is your custom in such great matters
   to make trial of all things, and the confirmation of the Churches you
   have made your own care.  But since it is right that all things which
   have taken place should be brought to the knowledge of your holiness,
   we are writing of necessity [to inform you] that, by the will of Christ
   the Saviour of us all, and in accordance with the orders of the most
   pious and Christ-loving Emperors, we assembled together in the
   Metropolis of the Ephesians from many and far scattered regions, being
   in all over two hundred bishops.  Then, in accordance with the decrees
   of the Christ-loving Emperors by whom we were assembled, we fixed the
   date of the meeting of the holy Synod as the Feast of the Holy
   Pentecost, all agreeing thereto, especially as it was contained in the
   letters of the Emperors that if anyone did not arrive at the appointed
   time, he was absent with no good conscience, and was inexcusable both
   before God and man.  The most reverend John bishop of Antioch stopped
   behind; not in singleness of heart, nor because the length of the
   journey made the impediment, but hiding in his mind his plan and his
   thought (which was so displeasing to God,) [a plan and thought] which
   he made clear when not long afterwards he arrived at Ephesus.

   Therefore we put off the assembling [of the council] after the
   appointed day of the Holy Pentecost for sixteen whole days; in the
   meanwhile many of the bishops and clerics were overtaken with illness,
   and much burdened by the expense, and some even died.  A great injury
   was thus being done to the great Synod, as your holiness easily
   perceives.  For he used perversely such long delay that many from much
   greater distances arrived before him.

   Nevertheless after sixteen days had passed, certain of the bishops who
   were with him, to wit, two Metropolitans, the one Alexander of Apamea,
   and the other Alexander of Hierapolis, arrived before him.  And when we
   complained of the tardy coming of the most reverend bishop John, not
   once, but often, we were told, "He gave us command to announce to your
   reverence, that if anything should happen to delay him, not to put off
   the Synod, but to do what was right."  After having received this
   message,--and as it was manifest, as well from his delay as from the
   announcements just made to us, that he refused to attend the Council,
   whether out of friendship to Nestorius, or because he had been a cleric
   of a church under his sway, or out of regard to petitions made by some
   in his favour,--the Holy Council sat in the great church of Ephesus,
   which bears the name of Mary.

   But when all with zeal had come together, Nestorius alone was found
   missing from the council, thereupon the holy Synod sent him admonition
   in accordance with the canons by bishops, a first, second, and third
   time.  But he surrounding his house with soldiers, set himself up
   against the ecclesiastical laws, neither did he shew himself, nor give
   any satisfaction for his iniquitous blasphemies.

   After this the letters were read which were written to him by the most
   holy and most reverend bishop of the Church of Alexandria, Cyril, which
   the Holy Synod approved as being orthodox and without fault (orthos kai
   aleptos echein), and in no point out of agreement either with the
   divinely inspired Scriptures, or with the faith handed down and set
   forth in the great synod of holy Fathers, which assembled sometime ago
   at Nice in Bithynia, as your holiness also rightly having examined this
   has given witness.

   On the other hand there was read the letter of Nestorius, which was
   written to the already mentioned most holy and reverend brother of ours
   and fellow-minister, Cyril, and the Holy Synod was of opinion that
   those things which were taught in it were wholly alien from the
   Apostolic and Evangelical faith, sick with many and strange
   blasphemies.

   His most impious expositions were likewise read, and also the letter
   written to him by your holiness, in which he was properly condemned as
   one who had written blasphemy and had inserted irreligious views
   (phonas) in his private exegesis, and after this a just sentence of
   deposition was pronounced against him; especially is this sentence
   just, because he is so far removed from being penitent, or from a
   confession of the matters in which he blasphemed, while yet he had the
   Church of Constantinople, that even in the very metropolis of the
   Ephesians, he delivered a sermon to certain of the Metropolitical
   bishops, men who were not ignorant, but learned and God-fearing, in
   which he was bold enough to say, "I do not confess a two or three
   months old God," and he said other things more outrageous than this.

   Therefore as an impious and most pestilent heresy, which perverts our
   most pure religion (threskeian) and which overthrows from the
   foundation the whole economy of the mystery [i.e. the Incarnation], we
   cast it down, as we have said above.  But it was not possible, as it
   seemed, that those who had the sincere love of Christ, and were zealous
   in the Lord should not experience many trials.  For we had hoped that
   the most reverend John, bishop of Antioch would have praised the
   sedulous care and piety of the Synod, and that perchance he would have
   blamed the slowness of Nestorius's deposition.  But all things turned
   out contrary to our hope.  For he was found to be an enemy, and a most
   warlike one, to the holy Synod, and even to the orthodox faith of the
   churches, as these things indicate.

   For as soon as he was come to Ephesus, before he had even shaken off
   the dust of the journey, or changed his travelling dress, he assembled
   those who had sided with Nestorius and who had uttered blasphemies
   against their head, and only not derided the glory of Christ, and
   gathering as a college to himself, I suppose, thirty men, having the
   name of bishops (some of whom were without sees, wandering about and
   having no dioceses, others again had for many years been deposed for
   serious causes from their metropolises, and with these were Pelagians
   and the followers of Celestius, and some of those who were turned out
   of Thessaly), he had the presumption to commit a piece of iniquity no
   man had ever done before.  For all by himself he drew up a paper which
   he called a deposition, and reviled and reproached the most holy and
   reverend Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, and the most reverend Memnon,
   bishop of Ephesus, our brother, and fellow-minister, none of us knowing
   anything about it, and not even those who were thus reviling knew what
   was being done, nor for what reason they had presumed to do this.  But
   ignoring the anger of God for such behaviour, and unheeding the
   ecclesiastical canons, and forgetting that they were hastening to
   destruction by such a course of action, under the name of an
   excommunication, they then reviled the whole Synod.  And placing these
   acts of theirs on the public bulletin boards, they exposed them to be
   read by such as chose to do so, having posted them on the outside of
   the theatres, that they might make a spectacle of their impiety.  But
   not even was this the limit of their audacity; but as if they had done
   something in accordance with the canons, they dared to bring what they
   had done to the ears of the most pious and Christ-loving Emperors.
   Things being in this condition, the most holy and reverend Cyril,
   bishop of Alexandria and the most reverend Memnon bishop of the city of
   Ephesus, offered some books composed by themselves and accusing the
   most reverend Bishop John and those who with him had done this thing,
   and conjuring our holy Synod that John and those with him should be
   summoned according to the canons, so that they might apologize for
   their daring acts, and if they had any complaints to make they might
   speak and prove them, for in their written deposition, or rather sheet
   of abuse, they made this statement as a pretext, "They are
   Apollinarians, and Arians, and Eunomians, and therefore they have been
   deposed by us."  When, therefore, those who had endured their reviling
   were present, we again necessarily assembled in the great church, being
   more than two hundred bishops, and by a first, second, and third call
   on two days, we summoned John and his companions to the Synod, in order
   that they might examine those who had been reviled, and might make
   explanations, and tell the causes which led them to draw up the
   sentence of deposition; but he [273] did not dare to come.

   But it was right that he, if he could truly prove the before-mentioned
   holy men to be heretics, both should come and prove the truth of that
   which, accepted as a true and indubitable crime, induced the
   temerarious sentence against them.  But being condemned by his own
   conscience he did not come.  Now what he had planned was this.  For he
   thought that when that foundation-less and most unjust reviling was
   done away, the just vote of the Synod which it cast against the heretic
   Nestorius would likewise be dissolved.  Being justly vexed, therefore,
   we determined to inflict according to law the same penalty upon him and
   those who were with him, which he contrary to law had pronounced
   against those who had been convicted of no fault.  But although most
   justly and in accordance with law he would have suffered this
   punishment yet in the hope that by our patience his temerity might be
   conquered, we have reserved this to the decision of your holiness.  In
   the meanwhile, we have deprived them of communion and have taken from
   them all priestly power, so that they may not be able to do any harm by
   their opinions.  For those who thus ferociously, and cruelly, and
   uncanonically are wont to rush to such frightful and most wicked
   things, how was it not necessary that they should be stripped of the
   powers which [as a matter of fact] they did not possess, [274] of being
   able to do harm.

   With our brethren and fellow-ministers, both Cyril the bishop and
   Memnon, who had endured reproval at their hands, we are all in
   communion, and after the rashness [of their accusers] we both have and
   do perform the liturgy in common, all together celebrating the Synaxis,
   having made of none effect their play in writing, and having thus shewn
   that it lacked all validity and effect.  For it was mere reviling and
   nothing else.  For what kind of a synod could thirty men hold, some of
   whom were marked with the stamp of heresy, and some without sees and
   ejected [from their dioceses]?  Or what strength could it have in
   opposition to a synod gathered from all the whole world?  For there
   were sitting with us the most reverend bishops Arcadius and Projectus,
   and with them the most holy presbyter Philip, all of whom were sent by
   your holiness, who gave to us your presence and filled the place of the
   Apostolic See (tes apostolikes kathedras).  Let then your holiness be
   angered at what took place.  But if license were granted to such as
   wished to pour reproval upon the greater sees, and thus unlawfully and
   uncanonically to give sentence or rather to utter revilings against
   those over whom they have no power, against those who for religion have
   endured such great conflicts, by reason of which now also piety shines
   forth through the prayers of your holiness [if, I say, all this should
   be tolerated], the affairs of the Church would fall into the greatest
   confusion.  But when those who dare to do such things shall have been
   chastised aright, all disturbance will cease, and the reverence due to
   the canons will be observed by all.

   When there had been read in the holy Synod what had been done touching
   the deposition of the most irreligious Pelagians and Coelestines, of
   Coelestius, and Pelagius, and Julian, and Præsidius, and Florus, and
   Marcellian, and Orontius, and those inclined to like errors, we also
   deemed it right (edikaiosamen ) that the determinations of your
   holiness concerning them should stand strong and firm.  And we all were
   of the same mind, holding them deposed.  And that you may know in full
   all things that have been done, we have sent you a copy of the Acts,
   and of the subscriptions of the Synod.  We pray that you, dearly
   beloved and most longed for, may be strong and mindful of us in the
   Lord. [275]

   The Definition of the Holy and Ecumenical Synod of Ephesus Against the
   Impious Messalians Who are Also Called Euchetæ and Enthusiasts.

   (Found in Latin only.  Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col.
   809.)

   When the most pious and religious bishops, Valerian and Amphilochius
   had come to us, they proposed that we should consider in common the
   case of the Messalians, that is the Euchetes or Enthusiasts, who were
   flourishing in Pamphylia, or by what other name this most contaminating
   heresy is called.  And when we were considering the question, the most
   pious and religious bishop Valerian, presented to us a synodical
   schedule which had been drawn up concerning them in the great city of
   Constantinople, under Sisinnius of blessed memory:  What we read
   therein was approved by all, as well composed and as a due presentation
   of the case.  And it seemed good to us all, and to the most pious
   bishops Valerian and Amphilochius and to all the most pious bishops of
   the provinces of Pamphylia and Lycaonia, that all things contained in
   that Synodical chart should be confirmed and in no way rescinded; also
   that the action taken at Alexandria might also be made firm, so that
   all those who throughout the whole province are of the Messalian or
   Enthusiastic heresy, or suspected of being tainted with that heresy,
   whether clerics or laymen, may come together; and if they shall
   anathematize in writing, according to the decrees pronounced in the
   aforesaid synod [their errors], if they are clergymen they may remain
   such; and if laymen they may be admitted to communion.  But if they
   refuse to anathematize, if they were presbyters or deacons or in any
   other ecclesiastical grade, let them be cast out of the clergy and from
   their grade, and also from communion; if they be lay-men let them be
   anathematized.

   Furthermore those convicted of this heresy are no more to be permitted
   to have the rule of our monasteries, lest tares be sown and increase.
   And we give command that the most pious bishops Valerian and
   Amphilochius, and the rest of the most reverend bishops of the whole
   province shall pay attention that this decree be carried into effect.
   In addition to this it seemed good that the filthy book of this heresy,
   which is called the "Asceticon," should be anathematized, as composed
   by heretics, a copy of which the most religious and pious Valerian
   brought with him.  Likewise anything savouring of their impiety which
   may be found among the people, let it be anathema.

   Moreover when they come together, let there be commended by them in
   writing such things as are useful and necessary for concord, and
   communion, and arrangement (dispositionem vel dispensationem).  But
   should any question arise in connexion with the present business, and
   if it should prove to be difficult and ambiguous, what is not approved
   by the most pious bishops Valerian and Amphilochius, and the other
   bishops throughout the province, they ought to discuss all things by
   reference to what is written.  And if the most pious bishops of the
   Lycians or of the Lycaonians shall have been passed over; nevertheless
   let not a Metropolitan be left out of whatever province he may be.  And
   let these things be inserted in the Acts so that if any have need of
   them they would find how also to expound these things more diligently
   to others.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Note on the Messalians or Massalians.

   (Tillemont, Mémoires, Tom. VIII., Seconde Partie.  Condensed.)

   St. Epiphanius distinguishes two sorts of persons who were called by
   the name of Messalians, the one and the more ancient were heathen, the
   other were Christian in name.

   The Messalians who bore the Christian name had no beginning, nor end,
   nor chief, nor fixed faith.  Their first writers were Dadoes, Sabas,
   Adelphus, Hermes, Simeon and some others.  Adelphus was neither monk
   nor clerk, but a layman.  Sabas had taken the habit of an anchorite and
   was surnamed "the Eunuch," because he had mutilated himself.  Adelphus
   was of Mesopotamia and was considered their leader, so that they are
   sometimes called "Adelphians."  They are also called "Eustathians."
   "Euchites" is the Greek equivalent of "Messalians" in Hebrew.  They
   were also called "Enthusiasts" or "Corentes" because of the agitation
   the devils caused them, which they attributed to the Holy Spirit.

   St. Epiphanius thought that these heretics sprang up in the time of
   Constance, although Theodoret does not put them down until the days of
   Valentinian.  They came from Mesopotamia, but spread as far as Antioch
   by the year 376.

   They pretended to renounce the world, and to give up their possessions,
   and under the habit of monks they taught Manichæan impieties, and
   others still more detestable.

   Their principal tenet was that everyone inherited from his ancestors a
   demon, who had possession of his soul from the moment of his birth, and
   always led it to evil.  That baptism cut away the outside branches of
   sin, but could not free the soul of this demon, and that therefore its
   reception was useless.  That only constant prayer could drive out this
   demon.  That when it was expelled, the Holy Spirit descended and gave
   visible and sensible marks of his presence, and delivered the body from
   all the uprisings of passion, and the soul from the inclination to
   evil, so that afterwards there was no need of fasting, nor of
   controlling lust by the precepts of the Gospel.

   Besides this chief dogma, gross errors, contrary to the first
   principles of religion, were attributed to them.  That the divinity
   changed itself in different manners to unite itself to their souls.
   They held that the body of Christ was infinite like his divine nature;
   they did not hesitate to say that his body was at first full of devils
   which were driven out when the Word took it upon him. [276]   They
   claimed that they possessed clear knowledge of the state of souls after
   death, read the hearts and desires of man, the secrets of the future
   and saw the Holy Trinity with their bodily eyes.  They affirmed that
   man could not only attain perfection but equal the deity in virtue and
   knowledge.

   They never fasted, slept men and women together, in warm weather in the
   open streets.  But certain say that before attaining to this liberty of
   license three years of mortification were required.

   The most well-known point of their discipline is that they forbade all
   manual labour as evil, and unworthy of the spiritual.

   Harmenopulus in his Basilicæ (Tom. I. Lib. ix.) says that they held the
   Cross in horror, that they refused to honour the Holy Virgin, or St.
   John the Baptist, or any of the Saints unless they were Martyrs; that
   they mutilated themselves at will, that they dissolved marriages, that
   they foreswore and perjured themselves without scruple, that women were
   appointed as mistresses of the sect to instruct and govern men, even
   priests.

   Although so opposed to the faith of the Church, yet for all this the
   Messalians did not separate themselves from her communion.  They did
   not believe in the Communion as a mystery which sanctifies us, which
   must be approached with fear and faith, but only came to the holy Table
   to hide themselves and to pass for Catholics, for this was one of their
   artifices.  When asked, they had no hesitation in denying all that they
   believed, and were willing to anathematize those who thought with
   them.  And all this they did without fear, because they were taught
   they had attained perfection, that is impassibility.

   Vide Theodoret, H. E., Lib. iv., cap. xi.

   Photius tells us that John of Antioch wrote against these heretics.

   St. Maximus the Abbot speaks of this heresy as still existing in the
   VII^th Century, and as practising the most abominable infamies.
   Photius bears witness of its resuscitation in his days in Cappadocia
   with its wonted corruptions.  Harmenopulus remarks that a certain
   Eleutherius of Paphlagonia had added to it new crimes, and that in part
   it became the source of the sect of the Bogomiles, so well known in the
   decadence of the Greek empire.

   Decree of the Synod in the Matter of Euprepius and Cyril.

   (Found in Latin only.  Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col.
   810.)

   The petition of the most pious bishops Euprepius and Cyril, which is
   set forth in the papers they offered, is honest.  Therefore from the
   holy canons and the external laws, which have from ancient custom the
   force of law, [277] let no innovation be made in the cities of Europa,
   but according to the ancient custom they shall be governed by the
   bishops by whom they have been formerly governed.  For since there
   never was a metropolitan who had power otherwise, so neither hereafter
   shall there be any departure from the ancient custom.

   Note.

   (Hist. of the Councils, Vol. III., p. 77.)

   Two Thracian bishops, Euprepius of Biza (Bizya) and Cyril of Coele,
   gave occasion for a decree, praying for protection against their
   Metropolitan, Fritilas of Heraclea, who had gone over to the party of
   John of Antioch, and at the same time for the confirmation of the
   previous practice of holding two bishoprics at the same time.  The
   Synod granted both.

   General Introduction.

   I should consider it a piece of impertinence were I to attempt to add
   anything to what has been already said with regard to the Council of
   Chalcedon.  The literature upon the subject is so great and so bitterly
   polemical that I think I shall do well in laying before my readers the
   Acts, practically complete on all disputed points, and to leave them to
   draw their own conclusions.  I shall not, however, be liable to the
   charge of unfairness if I quote at some length the deductions of the
   Eagle of Meaux, the famous Bossuet, from these acts; and since his
   somewhat isolated position as a Gallican gives him a singular fitness
   to serve in this and similar questions as a mediator between Catholics
   and Protestants, his remarks upon this Council will, I think, be read
   with great interest and respect.

   (Bossuet.  Defensio Dec. Cleri Gallic. Lib. VII., cap. xvij.
   [Translation by Allies].)

   An important point treated in the Council of Chalcedon, that is, the
   establishing of the faith, and the approval of Leo's letter, is as
   follows:  Already almost the whole West, and most of the Easterns, with
   Anatolius himself, Bishop of Constantinople, had gone so far as to
   confirm by subscription that letter, before the council took place; and
   in the council itself the Fathers had often cried out, "We believe, as
   Leo:  Peter hath spoken by Leo:  we have all subscribed the letter:
   what has been set forth is sufficient for the Faith:  no other
   exposition may be made."  Things went so far, that they would hardly
   permit a definition to be made by the council.  But neither
   subscriptions privately made before the council, nor these vehement
   cries of the Fathers in the council, were thought sufficient to
   tranquillize minds in so unsettled a state of the Church, for fear that
   a matter so important might seem determined rather by outcries than by
   fair and legitimate discussion.  And the clergy of Constantinople
   exclaimed, "It is a few who cry out, not the whole council which
   speaks."  So it was determined, that the letter of Leo should be
   lawfully examined by the council, and a definition of faith be written
   by the synod itself.  So the acts of foregoing councils being
   previously read, the magistrates proposed concerning Leo's letter, "As
   we see the divine Gospels laid before your Piety, let each one of the
   assembled bishops declare, whether the exposition of the 318 Fathers at
   Nice, and of the 150 who afterwards assembled in the imperial city,
   agrees with the letter of the most reverend Archbishop Leo."

   After the question as to examining the letter of Leo was put in this
   form, it will be worth while to weigh the sentences and, as they are
   called, the votes of the Fathers, in order to understand from the
   beginning why they approved of the letter; why they afterwards defended
   it with so much zeal; why, finally, it was ratified after so exact an
   examination of the council.  Anatolius first gives his sentence.  "The
   letter of the most holy and religious Archbishop Leo agrees with the
   creed of our 318 Fathers at Nice, and of the 150 who afterwards
   assembled at Constantinople, and confirmed the same faith, and with the
   proceedings at Ephesus under the most blessed Cyril, who is among the
   saints, by the Ecumenical and holy Council, when it condemned
   Nestorius.  I therefore agree to it, and willingly subscribe to it."
   These are the words of one plainly deliberating, not blindly
   subscribing out of obedience.  The rest say to the same effect:  "It
   agrees, and I subscribe."  Many plainly and expressly, "It agrees, and
   I therefore subscribe."  Some add, "It agrees, and I subscribe, as it
   is correct."  Others, "I am sure that it agrees."  Others, "As it is
   concordant, and has the same aim, we embrace it, and subscribe."
   Others, "This is the faith we have long held:  this we hold:  in this
   we were baptized:  in this we baptize."  Others, and a great part, "As
   I see, as I feel, as I have proved, as I find that it agrees, I
   subscribe."  Others, "As I am persuaded, instructed, informed, that all
   agrees, I subscribe."  Many set forth their difficulties, mostly
   arising from a foreign language; others from the subject matter,
   saying, that they had heard the letter, "and in very many points were
   assured it was right; some few words stood in their way, which seemed
   to point at a certain division in the person of Christ."  They add,
   that they had been informed by Paschasinus and the Legates "that there
   is no division, but one Christ; therefore," they say, "we agree and
   subscribe."  Others after mentioning what Paschasinus and Lucentius had
   said, thus conclude:  "By this we have been satisfied and, considering
   that it agrees in all things with the holy Fathers, we agree and
   subscribe."  Where the Illyrian bishops, and others who before that
   examination had expressed their acclamations to the letter, again cry
   out, "We all say the same thing, and agree with this."  So that,
   indeed, it is evident that, in the council itself, and before it their
   agreement is based on this that, after weighing the matter, they
   considered, they judged, they were persuaded, that all agreed with the
   Fathers, and perceived that the common faith of all and each had been
   set forth by Leo.  This is that examination of Leo's letter,
   synodically made at Chalcedon, and placed among the acts.

   (Gallia Orthod., LIX.)

   Nor did Anatolius and the other bishops receive it, until they had
   deliberated, and found that Leo's letter agreed with the preceding
   councils.

   (Gallia Orthod., LX.)

   But here a singular discussion arises between the eminent Cardinals
   Bellarmine and Baronius.  The latter, and with him a large number of
   our theologians, recognize the letter of Leo as the Type and Rule of
   faith, by which all Churches were bound:  but Bellarmine, alarmed at
   the examination which he could not deny, answers thus:  "Leo had sent
   his letter to the council, not as containing his final and definitive
   sentence, but as an instruction, assisted by which the bishops might
   form a better judgment."  But, most eminent man, allow me to say that
   Leo, upon the appeal of Eutyches, and at the demand of Flavian,
   composed this letter for a summary of the faith, and sent it to every
   Church in all parts, when as yet no one thought about a council.
   Therefore it was not an instruction to the council which he provided,
   but an Apostolic sentence which he put forth.  The fact is that out of
   this strait there was no other escape:  Baronius will not allow that a
   letter, confirmed by so great an authority of the Apostolic See, should
   be attributed to any other power but that which is supreme and
   indefectible:  Bellarmine will not take that to emanate from the
   supreme and indefectible authority, which was subjected to synodical
   inquiry, and deliberation.  What, then, is the issue of this conflict,
   unless that it is equally evident that the letter was written with the
   whole authority of the Apostolic See, and yet subjected, as usual, to
   the examination of an Universal Council.

   (Ib. LXI.)

   And in this we follow no other authority than Leo himself, who speaks
   thus in his letter to Theodoret:  "What God had before decreed by our
   ministry, he confirmed by the irreversible assent of the whole
   brotherhood, to shew that what was first put forth in form by the First
   See of all, and then received by the judgment of the whole Christian
   world, really proceeded from himself."  Here is a decree, as Baronius
   says, but not as Bellarmine says, an instruction:  here is a judgment
   of the whole world upon a decree of the Apostolic See.  He proceeds:
   "For in order that the consent of other sees to that which the Lord of
   all appointed to preside over the rest might not appear flattery, nor
   any other adverse suspicion creep in, persons were at first found who
   doubted concerning our judgments."  And not only heretics, but even the
   Fathers of the council themselves, as the acts bear witness.  Here the
   First See shews a fear of flattery, if doubt about its judgments were
   forbidden.  Moreover, "The truth itself likewise is both more clearly
   conspicuous, and more strongly maintained, when after examination
   confirms what previous faith had taught."  Here in plain words he
   speaks of an examination by the council, de fide, not by himself, as
   they wretchedly object, but of that faith which the decretal letter set
   forth.  And at length that same letter is issued as the Rule, but
   confirmed by the assent of the universal holy Council, or as he had
   before said, after that it is confirmed by the irreversible assent of
   the whole Brotherhood.  Out of this expression of that great Pontiff,
   the Gallican clergy drew theirs, that in questions of faith the
   judgment is, what Tertullian calls, "not to be altered;" what Leo
   calls, "not to be reconsidered," only when the assent of the Church is
   added.

   (Defens. Dec. Cleri Gall. VII. xvij.)

   This certainly no one can be blamed for holding with him and with the
   Fathers of Chalcedon.  The forma is set forth by the Apostolic See, yet
   it is to be received with a judgment, and that free, and each bishop
   individually is inferior to the First, yet so that all together pass
   judgment even on his decree.

   They conceived no other way of removing all doubt; for, after the
   conclusion of the synod, the Emperor thus proclaims:  "Let then all
   profane contentions cease, for he is indeed impious and sacrilegious,
   who, after the sentence of so many priests, leaves anything for his own
   opinion to consider."  He then prohibits all discussion concerning
   religion; for, says he, "he does an injury to the judgment of the most
   religious council, who endeavours to open afresh, and publicly discuss,
   what has been once judged, and rightly ordered."  Here in the
   condemnation of Eutyches is the order of Ecclesiastical judgments in
   questions of faith.  He is judged by his proper Bishop, Flavian:  the
   cause is reheard, reconsidered by the Pope St. Leo; it is decided by a
   declaration of the Apostolic See:  after that declaration follows the
   examination, inquiry, judgment of the Fathers or bishops, in a General
   Council:  after the declaration has been approved by the judgment of
   the Fathers no place is any longer left for doubt or discussion.

   Session I.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 93.)

   Paschasinus, the most reverend bishop and legate of the Apostolic See,
   stood up in the midst with his most reverend colleagues and said:  We
   received directions at the hands of the most blessed and apostolic
   bishop of the Roman city, which is the head of all the churches, which
   directions say that Dioscorus is not to be allowed a seat in this
   assembly, but that if he should attempt to take his seat he is to be
   cast out.  This instruction we must carry out; if now your holiness so
   commands let him be expelled or else we leave. [278]

   The most glorious judges and the full senate said:  What special charge
   do you prefer against the most reverend bishop Dioscorus?

   Paschasinus, the most reverend bishop and legate of the Apostolic See,
   said:  Since he has come, it is necessary that objection be made to
   him.

   The most glorious judges and the whole senate said:  In accordance with
   what has been said, let the charge under which he lies, be specifically
   made.

   Lucentius, the most reverend bishop having the place of the Apostolic
   See, said:  Let him give a reason for his judgment.  For he undertook
   to give sentence against one over whom he had no jurisdiction.  And he
   dared to hold a synod without the authority of the Apostolic See, a
   thing which had never taken place nor can take place. [279]

   Paschasinus the most reverend bishop, holding the place of the
   Apostolic See, said:  We cannot go counter to the decrees of the most
   blessed and apostolic bishop ["Pope" for "bishop" in the Latin], who
   governs the Apostolic See, nor against the ecclesiastical canons nor
   the patristic traditions.

   The most glorious judges and the full senate, said:  It is proper that
   you should set forth specifically in what he hath gone astray.

   Lucentius, the venerable bishop and holding the place of the Apostolic
   See, said:  We will not suffer so great a wrong to be done us and you,
   as that he who is come to be judged should sit down [as one to give
   judgment].

   The glorious judges and the whole senate said:  If you hold the office
   of judge, you ought not to defend yourself as if you were to be judged.

   And when Dioscorus the most religious bishop of Alexandria at the
   bidding of the most glorious judges and of the sacred assembly (tes
   hieras sunkletou [280] ) had sat down in the midst, and the most
   reverend Roman bishops also had sat down in their proper places, and
   kept silence, Eusebius, the most reverend bishop of the city of
   Dorylæum, stepping into the midst, said:

   [He then presented a petition, and the Acts of the Latrocinium were
   read.  Also the Acts of the council of Constantinople under Flavian
   against Eutyches (col. 175).]

   And when they were read, the most glorious judges and immense assembly
   (huperphues sunkletos) said:  What do the most reverend bishops of the
   present holy synod say?  When he thus expounded the faith did Flavian,
   of holy memory, preserve the orthodox and catholic religion, or did he
   in any respect err concerning it?

   Paschasinus the most reverend bishop, representing the Apostolic See,
   said; Flavian of blessed memory hath most holily and perfectly
   expounded the faith.  His faith and exposition agrees with the epistle
   of the most blessed and apostolic man, the bishop of Rome.

   Anatolius the most reverend archbishop of Constantinople said; The
   blessed Flavian hath beautifully and orthodoxly set forth the faith of
   our fathers.

   Lucentius, the most reverend bishop, and legate of the Apostolic See,
   said; Since the faith of Flavian of blessed memory agrees with the
   Apostolic See and the tradition of the fathers it is just that the
   sentence by which he was condemned by the heretics should be turned
   back upon them by this most holy synod.

   Maximus the most reverend bishop of Antioch in Syria, said:  Archbishop
   Flavian of blessed memory hath set forth the faith orthodoxly and in
   accordance with the most beloved-of-God and most holy Archbishop Leo.
   And this we all receive with zeal.

   Thalassius, the most reverend bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia said;
   Flavian of blessed memory hath spoken in accordance with Cyril of
   blessed memory.

   [And so, one after another, the bishops expressed their opinions.  The
   reading of the acts of the Council of Constantinople was then
   continued.]

   And at this point of the reading, Dioscorus, the most reverend
   Archbishop of Alexandria said, I receive "the of two;" "the two" I do
   not receive (to ek duo dechomai; to duo, ou dechomai).  I am forced to
   be impudent, but the matter is one which touches my soul.

   [After a few remarks the reading was continued and the rest of the acts
   of the Latrocinium of Ephesus completed.  The judges then postponed to
   the morrow the setting forth a decree on the faith but intimated that
   Dioscorus and his associates should suffer the punishment to which they
   unjustly sentenced Flavian.  This met with the approval of all the
   bishops except those of Illyrica who said:  "We all have erred, let us
   all be pardoned."  (col. 323.) ]

   The most glorious judges and the whole senate said; Let each one of the
   most reverend bishops of the present synod, hasten to set forth how he
   believes, writing without any fear, but placing the fear of God before
   his eyes; knowing that our most divine and pious lord believes
   according to the ecthesis of the three hundred and eighteen holy
   fathers at Nice, and according to the ecthesis of the one hundred and
   fifty after them, and according to the Canonical epistles and ectheses
   of the holy fathers Gregory, Basil, Athanasius, Hilary, Ambrose, and
   according to the two canonical epistles of Cyril, which were confirmed
   and published in the first Council of Ephesus, nor does he in any point
   depart from the faith of the same.  For the most reverend archbishop of
   Old Rome, Leo, appears to have sent a letter to Flavian of blessed
   memory, with reference to Eutyches's unbelieving doubt which was
   springing up against the Catholic Church.

   End of the first Actio.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [278] This whole paragraph reads with material differences in the
   Latin.  Moreover while the Greek text is clear and grammatical, the
   Latin is most incorrect and halting.  Leo is described as "Pope of the
   city of Rome," instead of "bishop of Rome."

   [279] This statement, so absolutely contrary to fact, has been a sore
   difficulty to the commentators.  Arendt (Leo the Great and his Times, §
   270) says that this meant only that "he had, without permission of the
   Pope, taken the presidency there, and conducted the proceedings, for
   Leo himself had acknowledged the synod by the fact that he allowed his
   legates to be present at it."  Almost the same is the explanation of
   the Ballerini (Leo M. Opera, Tom. ii. 460, n. 15.)

   [280] The Latin here has the usual form "amplissimus senatus," for
   which the Greek is periphanestatoi sunkletikoi.

   Extracts from the Acts.

   Session II.

   (L. and C., Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 338.)

   When all were seated before the rails of the most holy altar, the most
   superb and glorious judges and the great (huperphues) senate said; At a
   former meeting the question was examined of the condemnation of the
   most reverend bishop Flavian of blessed memory and Eusebius, and it was
   patent to you all with what justice and accuracy the examination was
   conducted:  and it was proved that they had been cruelly and improperly
   condemned.  What course we should pursue in this matter became clear
   after your deliberations.  Now however the question to be enquired
   into, studied, and decided, is how the true faith is to be established,
   which is the chief end for which this Council has been assembled.  As
   we know that ye are to render to God a strict account not only for your
   own souls in particular, but as well for the souls of all of us who
   desire rightly to be taught all things that pertain to religion, and
   that all ambiguity be taken away, by the agreement and consent of all
   the holy fathers, and by their united exposition and doctrine; hasten
   therefore without any fear of pleasing or displeasing, to set forth
   (ekthesthai) the pure faith, so that they who do not seem to believe
   with all the rest, may be brought to unity through the acknowledging of
   the truth.  For we wish you to know that the most divine and pious lord
   of the whole world and ourselves hold the orthodox faith set forth by
   the 318 and by the 150 holy fathers, and what also has been taught by
   the rest of the most holy and glorious fathers, and in accordance with
   this is our belief.

   The most reverend bishops cried; Any other setting forth (ekthesin
   allen) no one makes, neither will we attempt it, neither will we dare
   to set forth [anything new] (ekthesthai).  For the fathers taught, and
   in their writings are preserved, what things were set forth by them,
   and further than this we can say nothing.

   Cecropius, the most reverend bishop of Sebastopol said:  The matters
   concerning Eutyches have been examined, and the most holy archbishop of
   Rome has given a form (tupon) which we follow and to his letter we all
   [i.e. those in his neighbourhood] have subscribed.

   The most reverend bishops cried:  These are the opinions of all of us.
   The expositions (ektethenta) already made are quite sufficient:  it is
   not lawful to make any other.

   The most glorious judges and great senate said, If it pleases your
   reverence, let the most holy patriarch of each province, choosing one
   or two of his own province and going into the midst, and together
   considering the faith, make known to all what is agreed upon.  So that
   if, as we desire, all be of one mind, all ambiguity may be removed:
   But if some entertain contrary opinions (which we do not believe to be
   the case) we may know what their opinions are.

   The most reverend bishops cried out, we make no new exposition in
   writing.  This is the law, [i.e. of the Third Synod] which teaches that
   what has been set forth is sufficient.  The law wills that no other
   exposition should be made.  Let the sayings of the Fathers remain fast.

   Florentius, the most reverend bishop of Sardis, said, since it is not
   possible for those who follow the teaching of the holy Synod of Nice,
   which was confirmed rightly and piously at Ephesus, to draw up suddenly
   a declaration of faith in accordance with the faith of the holy fathers
   Cyril and Celestine, and of the letter of the most holy Leo, we
   therefore pray your magnificence to give us time, so that we may be
   able to arrive at the truth of the matter with a fitting document,
   although so far as we are concerned, who have subscribed the letter of
   the most holy Leo, nothing further is needed.

   Cecropius, the most reverend bishop of Sebastopol, said, The faith has
   been well defined by the 318 holy fathers and confirmed by the holy
   fathers Athanasius, Cyril, Celestine, Hilary, Basil, Gregory, and now
   once again by the most holy Leo:  and we pray that those things which
   were decreed by the 318 holy fathers, and by the most holy Leo be read.

   The most glorious judges and great Senate said:  Let there be read the
   expositions (ektethenta) of the 318 fathers gathered together at Nice.

   Eunomius, the most reverend bishop of Nicomedia read from a book [the
   Exposition of faith of the 318 fathers. [281] ]

   The Exposition of faith of the Council held at Nice.

   "In the consulate of Paul and Julian" etc.

   "We believe in one God," etc.

   "But those who say," etc.

   The most reverend bishops cried out; This is the orthodox faith; this
   we all believe:  into this we were baptized; into this we baptize:
   Blessed Cyril so taught:  this is the true faith:  this is the holy
   faith:  this is the everlasting faith:  into this we were baptized:
   into this we baptize:  we all so believe:  so believes Leo, the Pope
   (ho papas):  Cyril thus believed:  Pope Leo so interpreted it.

   The most glorious judges and great senate said, Let there be read what
   was set forth by the 150 holy fathers.

   Aëtius, the reverend deacon of Constantinople read from a book [the
   creed of the 150 fathers. [282] ]

   The holy faith which the 150 fathers set forth as consonant to the holy
   and great Synod of Nice.

   "We believe in one God," etc.

   All the most reverend bishops cried out:  This is the faith of all of
   us:  we all so believe.

   The reverend archdeacon Aëtius said, There remains the letter of Cyril
   of holy and blessed memory, sometime bishop of the great city
   Alexandria, which he wrote to Nestorius, which was approved by all the
   most holy bishops assembled in the first Council at Ephesus, called to
   condemn the same Nestorius, and which was confirmed by the subscription
   of all.  There is also another letter of the same Cyril, of blessed
   memory, which he wrote to John, of blessed memory, sometime bishop of
   the great city of Antioch, which likewise was confirmed.  If it be so
   ordered, I shall read these.

   The most glorious judges and great senate said, Let the letters of
   Cyril of blessed memory be read.

   Aëtius, the Archdeacon of the imperial city Constantinople read.

   To the most reverend and most religious fellow-priest Nestorius, Cyril
   sends greeting in the Lord.

   [Kataphluarousi men k.t.l.  Lat. Obloquuntur quidem, etc.  This letter
   is found among the acts of the Council of Ephesus.]

   Likewise the same Archdeacon Aëtius read [the letter of the same holy
   Cyril of blessed memory to John of Antioch, on the peace].

   [This letter begins, Euphrainethosan hoi ouranoi k.t.l.; and in the
   Latin Lætentur cæli.]

   The Letter of Cyril to John of Antioch.

   (Found in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 343 and col. 164;
   and in Migne, Pat. Græc., Tom. LXXVII.  [Cyrilli Opera, Tom. X.], col.
   173.  This is the letter which is often styled "the Ephesine Creed.")

   Cyril to my lord, beloved brother, and fellow minister John, greeting
   in the Lord.

   "Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad" for the middle
   wall of partition has been taken away, and grief has been silenced, and
   all kind of difference of opinion has been removed; Christ the Saviour
   of us all having awarded peace to his churches, through our being
   called to this by our most devout and beloved of God kings, who are the
   best imitators of the piety of their ancestors in keeping the right
   faith in their souls firm and immovable, for they chiefly give their
   mind to the affairs of the holy Churches, in order that they may have
   the noted glory forever and show forth their most renowned kingdom, to
   whom also Christ himself the Lord of powers distributes good things
   with plenteous hand and gives to prevail over their enemies and grants
   them victory.  For he does not lie in saying:  "As I live saith the
   Lord, them that honour me, I will honour."  For when my lord, my
   most-beloved-of-God, fellow-minister and brother Paul, had arrived in
   Alexandria, we were filled with gladness, and most naturally at the
   coming of such a man as a mediator, who was ready to work beyond
   measure that he might overcome the envy of the devil and heal our
   divisions, and who by removing the offences scattered between us, would
   crown your Church and ours with harmony and peace.

   Of the reason of the disagreement it is superfluous to speak.  I deem
   it more useful both to think and speak of things suitable to the time
   of peace.  We were therefore delighted at meeting with that
   distinguished and most pious man, who expected perhaps to have no small
   struggle, persuading us that it is necessary to form an alliance for
   the peace of the Church, and to drive away the laughter of the
   heterodox, and for this end to blunt the goads of the stubbornness of
   the devil.  He found us ready for this, so as absolutely to need no
   labour to be bestowed upon us.  For we remembered the Saviour's saying;
   "My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave with you."  We have been
   taught also to say in prayers:  "O Lord our God give us peace, for thou
   hast given us all things."  So that if anyone should be in the
   participation of the peace furnished from God, he is not lacking in any
   good.  That as a matter of fact, the disagreement of the Churches
   happened altogether unnecessarily and inopportunely, we now have been
   fully satisfied by the document brought by my lord, the most pious
   bishop Paul, which contains an unimpeachable confession of faith, and
   this he asserted to have been prepared, by your holiness and by the
   God-beloved Bishops there.  The document is as follows, and is set down
   verbatim in this our epistle.

   Concerning the Virgin Mother of God, we thus think and speak; and of
   the manner of the Incarnation of the Only Begotten Son of God,
   necessarily, not by way of addition but for the sake of certainty, as
   we have received from the beginning from the divine Scriptures and from
   the tradition of the holy fathers, we will speak briefly, adding
   nothing whatever to the Faith set forth by the holy Fathers in Nice.
   For, as we said before, it suffices for all knowledge of piety and the
   refutation of all false doctrine of heretics.  But we speak, not
   presuming on the impossible; but with the confession of our own
   weakness, excluding those who wish us to cling to those things which
   transcend human consideration.

   We confess, therefore, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of
   God, perfect God, and perfect Man of a reasonable soul and flesh
   consisting; begotten before the ages of the Father according to his
   Divinity, and in the last days, for us and for our salvation, of Mary
   the Virgin according to his humanity, of the same substance with his
   Father according to his Divinity, and of the same substance with us
   according to his humanity; for there became a union of two natures.
   Wherefore we confess one Christ, one Son, one Lord.

   According to this understanding of this unmixed union, we confess the
   holy Virgin to be Mother of God; because God the Word was incarnate and
   became Man, and from this conception he united the temple taken from
   her with himself.

   For we know the theologians make some things of the Evangelical and
   Apostolic teaching about the Lord common as pertaining to the one
   person, and other things they divide as to the two natures, and
   attribute the worthy ones to God on account of the Divinity of Christ,
   and the lowly ones on account of his humanity [to his humanity].

   These being your holy voices, and finding ourselves thinking the same
   with them ("One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism,") we glorified God the
   Saviour of all, congratulating one another that our churches and yours
   have the Faith which agrees with the God-inspired Scriptures and the
   traditions of our holy Fathers.

   Since I learned that certain of those accustomed to find fault were
   humming around like vicious wasps, and vomiting out wretched words
   against me, as that I say the holy Body of Christ was brought from
   heaven, and not of the holy Virgin, I thought it necessary to say a few
   words concerning this to them:

   O fools, and only knowing how to misrepresent, how have ye been led to
   such a judgment, how have ye fallen into so foolish a sickness?  For it
   is necessary, it is undoubtedly necessary, to understand that almost
   all the opposition to us concerning the faith, arose from our affirming
   that the holy Virgin is Mother of God.  But if from heaven and not from
   her the holy Body of the Saviour of all was born, how then is she
   understood to be Mother of God?  What then did she bring forth except
   it be true that she brought forth the Emmanuel according to the flesh?
   They are to be laughed at who babble such things about me.  For the
   blessed prophet Isaiah does not lie in saying "Behold the Virgin shall
   conceive and bear a Son, and shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
   interpreted is God with us."  Truly also the holy Gabriel said to the
   Blessed Virgin:  "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.
   And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son,
   and shall call his name Jesus.  He shall save his people from their
   sins."

   For when we say our Lord Jesus Christ descended from heaven, and from
   above, we do not so say this as if from above and from heaven was his
   Holy Flesh taken, but rather by way of following the divine Paul, who
   distinctly declares:  "the first man is of the earth, earthy; the
   Second Man is the Lord from heaven."

   We remember too, the Saviour himself saying, "And no man hath ascended
   up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man."
   Although he was born according to his flesh, as just said, of the holy
   Virgin, yet God the Word came down from above and from heaven.  He
   "made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
   servant," and was called the Son of Man, yet remaining what he was,
   that is to say God.  For he is unchanging and unchangeable according to
   nature; considered already as one with his own Flesh, he is said to
   have come down from heaven.

   He is also called the Man from heaven, being perfect in his Divinity
   and perfect in his Humanity, and considered as in one Person.  For one
   is the Lord Jesus Christ, although the difference of his natures is not
   unknown, from which we say the ineffable union was made.

   Will your holiness vouchsafe to silence those who say that a crasis, or
   mingling or mixture took place between the Word of God and flesh.  For
   it is likely that certain also gossip about me as having thought or
   said such things.

   But I am far from any such thought as that, and I also consider them
   wholly to rave who think a shadow of change could occur concerning the
   Nature of the Word of God.  For he remains that which he always was,
   and has not been changed, nor can he ever be changed, nor is he capable
   of change.  For we all confess in addition to this, that the Word of
   God is impassible, even though when he dispenses most wisely this
   mystery, he appears to ascribe to himself the sufferings endured in his
   own flesh.  To the same purpose the all-wise Peter also said when he
   wrote of Christ as having "suffered in the flesh," and not in the
   nature of his ineffable godhead.  In order that he should be believed
   to be the Saviour of all, by an economic appropriation to himself, as
   just said, he assumed the sufferings of his own Flesh.

   Like to this is the prophecy through the voice of the prophet, as from
   him, "I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked
   off the hair:  I hid not my face from shame and spitting."  Let your
   holiness be convinced nor let anyone else be doubtful that we
   altogether follow the teachings of the holy fathers, especially of our
   blessed and celebrated Father Athanasius, deprecating the least
   departure from it.

   I might have added many quotations from them also establishing my
   words, but that it would have added to the length of my letter and it
   might become wearisome.  And we will allow the defined Faith, the
   symbol of the Faith set forth by our holy Fathers who assembled some
   time ago at Nice, to be shaken by no one.  Nor would we permit
   ourselves or others, to alter a single word of those set forth, or to
   add one syllable, remembering the saying:  "Remove not the ancient
   landmark which thy fathers have set," for it was not they who spoke but
   the Spirit himself of God and the Father, who proceedeth also from him,
   and is not alien from the Son, according to his essence.  And this the
   words of the holy initiators into mysteries confirm to us.  For in the
   Acts of the Apostles it is written:  "And after they were come to
   Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit of Jesus
   suffered them not."  And the divine Paul wrote:  "So then they that are
   in the flesh cannot please God.  But ye are not in the flesh, but in
   the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.  Now if any
   man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."

   When some of those who are accustomed to turn from the right, twist my
   speech to their views, I pray your holiness not to wonder; but be well
   assured that the followers of every heresy gather the occasions of
   their error from the God-inspired Scriptures, corrupting in their evil
   minds the things rightly said through the Holy Spirit, and drawing down
   upon their own heads the unquenchable flame.

   Since we have learned that certain, after having corrupted it, have set
   forth the orthodox epistle of our most distinguished Father Athanasius
   to the Blessed Epictetus, so as thereby to injure many; therefore it
   appeared to the brethren to be useful and necessary that we should send
   to your holiness a copy of it from some correct ancient transcripts
   which exist among us.  Farewell.

   Session II.  (Continued).

   (L. and C., Conc., Tom. IV., col. 343.)

   And when these letters [i.e. Cyril's letter to Nestorius Kataphluarousi
   and his letter to John of Antioch Euphrainesthosan] had been read, the
   most reverend bishops cried out:  We all so believe:  Pope Leo thus
   believes:  anathema to him who divides and to him who confounds:  this
   is the faith of Archbishop Leo:  Leo thus believes:  Leo and Anatolius
   so believe:  we all thus believe.  As Cyril so believe we, all of us:
   eternal be the memory of Cyril:  as the epistles of Cyril teach such is
   our mind, such has been our faith:  such is our faith:  this is the
   mind of Archbishop Leo, so he believes, so he has written.

   The most glorious judges and the great senate said:  Let there be read
   also the epistle of the most worthy Leo, Archbishop of Old Rome, the
   Imperial City.

   Beronician, the most devout clerk of the sacred consistory, read from a
   book handed him by Aëtius, Archdeacon of the holy Church of
   Constantinople, the encyclical or synodical letter of the most holy
   Leo, the Archbishop, written to Flavian, Archbishop of Constantinople.

   The Tome of St. Leo.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 343; also Migne, Pat.
   Lat., Tom. LIV. [Leo. M. Opera, Tom. I.] col. 756.) [283]

   Leo [the bishop] to his [most] dear brother Flavian.

   Having read your Affection's letter, the late arrival of which is
   matter of surprise to us, and having gone through the record of the
   proceedings of the bishops, we have now, at last, gained a clear view
   of the scandal which has risen up among you, against the integrity of
   the faith; and what at first seemed obscure has now been elucidated and
   explained.  By this means Eutyches, who seemed to be deserving of
   honour under the title of Presbyter, is now shown to be exceedingly
   thoughtless and sadly inexperienced, so that to him also we may apply
   the prophet's words, "He refused to understand in order to act well:
   he meditated unrighteousness on his bed."  What, indeed, is more
   unrighteous than to entertain ungodly thoughts, and not to yield to
   persons wiser and more learned?  But into this folly do they fall who,
   when hindered by some obscurity from apprehending the truth, have
   recourse, not to the words of the Prophets, not to the letters of the
   Apostles, nor to the authority of the Gospels, but to themselves; and
   become teachers of error, just because they have not been disciples of
   the truth.  For what learning has he received from the sacred pages of
   the New and the Old Testament, who does not so much as understand the
   very beginning of the Creed?  And that which, all the world over, is
   uttered by the voices of all applicants for regeneration, is still not
   grasped by the mind of this aged man.  If, then, he knew not what he
   ought to think about the Incarnation of the Word of God, and was not
   willing, for the sake of obtaining the light of intelligence, to make
   laborious search through the whole extent of the Holy Scriptures, he
   should at least have received with heedful attention that general
   Confession common to all, whereby the whole body of the faithful
   profess that they "believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jesus
   Christ his only Son our Lord, who was born of the Holy Ghost and the
   Virgin Mary."  By which three clauses the engines of almost all
   heretics are shattered.  For when God is believed to be both "Almighty"
   and "Father," it is proved that the Son is everlasting together with
   himself, differing in nothing from the Father, because he was born as
   "God from God," Almighty from Almighty, Coeternal from Eternal; not
   later in time, not inferior in power, not unlike him in glory, not
   divided from him in essence, but the same Only-begotten and Everlasting
   Son of an Everlasting Parent was "born of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin
   Mary."  This birth in time in no way detracted from, in no way added
   to, that divine and everlasting birth; but expended itself wholly in
   the work of restoring man, who had been deceived; so that it might both
   overcome death, and by its power "destroy the devil who had the power
   of death."  For we could not have overcome the author of sin and of
   death, unless he who could neither be contaminated by sin, nor detained
   by death, had taken upon himself our nature, and made it his own.  For,
   in fact, he was "conceived of the Holy Ghost" within the womb of a
   Virgin Mother, who bore him as she had conceived him, without loss of
   virginity. [284]  But if he (Eutyches) was not able to obtain a true
   conception from this pure fountain of Christian faith because by his
   own blindness he had darkened for himself the brightness of a truth so
   clear, he should have submitted himself to the Evangelist's teaching;
   and after reading what Matthew says, "The book of the generation of
   Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham," he should also
   have sought instruction from the Apostle's preaching; and after reading
   in the Epistle to the Romans, "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called
   an Apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, which he had promised
   before by the prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who
   was made unto him of the seed of David according to the flesh," he
   should have bestowed some devout study on the pages of the Prophets;
   and finding that God's promise said to Abraham, "in thy seed shall all
   nations be blessed," in order to avoid all doubt as to the proper
   meaning of this "seed," he should have attended to the Apostle's words,
   "To Abraham and to his seed were the promises made.  He saith not, and
   to seeds,' as in the case of many, but as in the case of one, and to
   thy seed,' which is Christ."  He should also have apprehended with his
   inward ear the declaration of Isaiah, "Behold, a Virgin shall conceive
   and bear a Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being
   interpreted, God with us;" and should have read with faith the words of
   the same prophet, "Unto us a Child has been born, unto us a Son has
   been given, whose power is on his shoulder; and they shall call his
   name Angel of great counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, Strong God, Prince
   of Peace, Father of the age to come."  And he should not have spoken
   idly to the effect that the Word was in such a sense made flesh, that
   the Christ who was brought forth from the Virgin's womb had the form of
   a man, and had not a body really derived from his Mother's body.
   Possibly his reason for thinking that our Lord Jesus Christ was not of
   our nature was this--that the Angel who was sent to the blessed and
   ever Virgin Mary said, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
   power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, and therefore also that
   holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God;"
   as if, because the Virgin's conception was caused by a divine act,
   therefore the flesh of him whom she conceived was not of the nature of
   her who conceived him.  But we are not to understand that "generation,"
   peerlessly wonderful, and wonderfully peerless, in such a sense as that
   the newness of the mode of production did away with the proper
   character of the kind.  For it was the Holy Ghost who gave fecundity to
   the Virgin, but it was from a body that a real body was derived; and
   "when Wisdom was building herself a house," the "Word was made flesh,
   and dwelt among us," that is, in that flesh which he assumed from a
   human being, and which he animated with the spirit of rational life.

   Accordingly while the distinctness of both natures and substances was
   preserved, and both met in one Person, lowliness was assumed by
   majesty, weakness by power, mortality by eternity; and, in order to pay
   the debt of our condition, the inviolable nature was united to the
   passible, so that as the appropriate remedy for our ills, one and the
   same "Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus," might from
   one element be capable of dying and also from the other be incapable.
   Therefore in the entire and perfect nature of very man was born very
   God, whole in what was his, whole in what was ours.  By "ours" we mean
   what the Creator formed in us at the beginning and what he assumed in
   order to restore; for of that which the deceiver brought in, and man,
   thus deceived, admitted, there was not a trace in the Saviour; and the
   fact that he took on himself a share in our infirmities did not make
   him a partaker in our transgressions.  He assumed "the form of a
   servant" without the defilement of sin, enriching what was human, not
   impairing what was divine:  because that "emptying of himself," whereby
   the Invisible made himself visible, and the Creator and Lord of all
   things willed to be one among mortals, was a stooping down in
   compassion, not a failure of power.  Accordingly, the same who,
   remaining in the form of God, made man, was made man in the form of a
   servant.  For each of the natures retains its proper character without
   defect; and as the form of God does not take away the form of a
   servant, so the form of a servant does not impair the form of God.  For
   since the devil was glorying in the fact that man, deceived by his
   craft, was bereft of divine gifts and, being stripped of his endowment
   of immortality, had come under the grievous sentence of death, and that
   he himself, amid his miseries, had found a sort of consolation in
   having a transgressor as his companion, and that God, according to the
   requirements of the principle of justice, had changed his own
   resolution in regard to man, whom he had created in so high a position
   of honour; there was need of a dispensation of secret counsel, in order
   that the unchangeable God, whose will could not be deprived of its own
   benignity, should fulfil by a more secret mystery his original plan of
   loving kindness toward us, and that man, who had been led into fault by
   the wicked subtlety of the devil, should not perish contrary to God's
   purpose.  Accordingly, the Son of God, descending from his seat in
   heaven, and not departing from the glory of the Father, enters this
   lower world, born after a new order, by a new mode of birth.  After a
   new order; because he who in his own sphere is invisible, became
   visible in ours; He who could not be enclosed in space, willed to be
   enclosed; continuing to be before times, he began to exist in time; the
   Lord of the universe allowed his infinite majesty to be overshadowed,
   and took upon him the form of a servant; the impassible God did not
   disdain to be passible Man and the immortal One to be subjected to the
   laws of death.  And born by a new mode of birth; because inviolate
   virginity, while ignorant of concupiscence, supplied the matter of his
   flesh.  What was assumed from the Lord's mother was nature, not fault;
   nor does the wondrousness of the nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, as
   born of a Virgin's womb, imply that his nature is unlike ours.  For the
   selfsame who is very God, is also very man; and there is no illusion in
   this union, while the lowliness of man and the loftiness of Godhead
   meet together.  For as "God" is not changed by the compassion
   [exhibited], so "Man" is not consumed by the dignity [bestowed].  For
   each "form" does the acts which belong to it, in communion with the
   other; the Word, that is, performing what belongs to the Word, and the
   flesh carrying out what belongs to the flesh; the one of these shines
   out in miracles, the other succumbs to injuries.  And as the Word does
   not withdraw from equality with the Father in glory, so the flesh does
   not abandon the nature of our kind.  For, as we must often be saying,
   he is one and the same, truly Son of God, and truly Son of Man.  God,
   inasmuch as "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
   and the Word was God."  Man, inasmuch as "the Word was made flesh, and
   dwelt among us."  God, inasmuch as "all things were made by him, and
   without him nothing was made."  Man, inasmuch as he was "made of a
   woman, made under the law."  The nativity of the flesh is a
   manifestation of human nature; the Virgin's child-bearing is an
   indication of Divine power.  The infancy of the Babe is exhibited by
   the humiliation of swaddling clothes:  the greatness of the Highest is
   declared by the voices of angels.  He whom Herod impiously designs to
   slay is like humanity in its beginnings; but he whom the Magi rejoice
   to adore on their knees is Lord of all.  Now when he came to the
   baptism of John his forerunner, lest the fact that the Godhead was
   covered with a veil of flesh should be concealed, the voice of the
   Father spake in thunder from heaven, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I
   am well pleased."  Accordingly, he who, as man, is tempted by the
   devil's subtlety, is the same to whom, as God, angels pay duteous
   service.  To hunger, to thirst, to be weary, and to sleep, is evidently
   human.  But to satisfy five thousand men with five loaves, and give to
   the Samaritan woman that living water, to draw which can secure him
   that drinks of it from ever thirsting again; to walk on the surface of
   the sea with feet that sink not, and by rebuking the storm to bring
   down the "uplifted waves," is unquestionably Divine.  As then--to pass
   by many points --it does not belong to the same nature to weep with
   feelings of pity over a dead friend and, after the mass of stone had
   been removed from the grave where he had lain four days, by a voice of
   command to raise him up to life again; or to hang on the wood, and to
   make all the elements tremble after daylight had been turned into
   night; or to be transfixed with nails, and to open the gates of
   paradise to the faith of the robber; so it does not belong to the same
   nature to say, "I and the Father are one," and to say, "the Father is
   greater than I."  For although in the Lord Jesus Christ there is one
   Person of God and man, yet that whereby contumely attaches to both is
   one thing, and that whereby glory attaches to both is another; for from
   what belongs to us he has that manhood which is inferior to the Father;
   while from the Father he has equal Godhead with the Father.
   Accordingly, on account of this unity of Person which is to be
   understood as existing in both the natures, we read, on the one hand,
   that "the Son of Man came down from heaven," inasmuch as the Son of God
   took flesh from that Virgin of whom he was born; and on the other hand,
   the Son of God is said to have been crucified and buried, inasmuch as
   he underwent this, not in his actual Godhead; wherein the Only-begotten
   is coeternal and consubstantial with the Father, but in the weakness of
   human nature.  Wherefore we all, in the very Creed, confess that "the
   only-begotten Son of God was crucified and buried," according to that
   saying of the Apostle, "for if they had known it, they would not have
   crucified the Lord of Majesty."

   But when our Lord and Saviour himself was by his questions instructing
   the faith of the disciples, he said, "Whom do men say that I the Son of
   Man am?"  And when they had mentioned various opinions held by others,
   he said, "But whom say ye that I am?" that is, "I who am Son of Man,
   and whom you see in the form of a servant, and in reality of flesh,
   whom say ye that I am?"  Whereupon the blessed Peter, as inspired by
   God, and about to benefit all nations by his confession, said, "Thou
   art the Christ, the Son of the living God."  Not undeservedly,
   therefore, was he pronounced blessed by the Lord, and derived from the
   original Rock that solidity which belonged both to his virtue and to
   his name, who through revelation from the Father confessed the selfsame
   to be both the Son of God and the Christ; because one of these truths,
   accepted without the other, would not profit unto salvation, and it was
   equally dangerous to believe the Lord Jesus Christ to be merely God and
   not man, or merely man and not God.  But after the resurrection of the
   Lord--which was in truth the resurrection of a real body, for no other
   person was raised again than he who had been crucified and had
   died--what else was accomplished during that interval of forty days
   than to make our faith entire and clear of all darkness?  For while he
   conversed with his disciples, and dwelt with them, and ate with them,
   and allowed himself to be handled with careful and inquisitive touch by
   those who were under the influence of doubt, for this end he came in to
   the disciples when the doors were shut, and by his breath gave them the
   Holy Ghost, and opened the secrets of Holy Scripture after bestowing on
   them the light of intelligence, and again in his selfsame person showed
   to them the wound in the side, the prints of the nails, and all the
   flesh tokens of the Passion, saying, "Behold my hands and my feet, that
   it is I myself; handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and
   bones, as ye see me have:"  that the properties of the Divine and the
   human nature might be acknowledged to remain in him without causing a
   division, and that we might in such sort know that the Word is not what
   the flesh is, as to confess that the one Son of God is both Word and
   flesh.  On which mystery of the faith this Eutyches must be regarded as
   unhappily having no hold, who does not recognise our nature to exist in
   the Only-begotten Son of God, either by way of the lowliness of
   mortality, or of the glory of resurrection.  Nor has he been overawed
   by the declaration of the blessed Apostle and Evangelist John, saying,
   "Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
   is of God; and every spirit which dissolveth Jesus is not of God, and
   this is Antichrist."  Now what is to dissolve Jesus, but to separate
   the human nature from him, and to make void by shameless inventions
   that mystery by which alone we have been saved?  Moreover, being in the
   dark as to the nature of Christ's body, he must needs be involved in
   the like senseless blindness with regard to his Passion also.  For if
   he does not think the Lord's crucifixion to be unreal, and does not
   doubt that he really accepted suffering, even unto death, for the sake
   of the world's salvation; as he believes in his death, let him
   acknowledge his flesh also, and not doubt that he whom he recognises as
   having been capable of suffering is also Man with a body like ours;
   since to deny his true flesh is also to deny his bodily sufferings.  If
   then he accepts the Christian faith, and does not turn away his ear
   from the preaching of the Gospel, let him see what nature it was that
   was transfixed with nails and hung on the wood of the cross; and let
   him understand whence it was that, after the side of the Crucified had
   been pierced by the soldier's spear, blood and water flowed out, that
   the Church of God might be refreshed both with a Laver and with a Cup.
   Let him listen also to the blessed Apostle Peter when he declares, that
   "sanctification by the Spirit" takes place through the "sprinkling of
   the blood of Christ," and let him not give a mere cursory reading to
   the words of the same Apostle, "Knowing that ye were not redeemed with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain way of life
   received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of
   Jesus Christ as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot."  Let him
   also not resist the testimony of Blessed John the Apostle, "And the
   blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanseth us from all sin."  And again,
   "This is the victory which overcometh the world, even our faith;" and,
   "who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus
   is the Son of God?  This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus
   Christ; not in water only, but in water and blood; and it is the Spirit
   that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.  For there are three
   that bear witness--the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three
   are one."  That is, the Spirit of sanctification, and the blood of
   redemption, and the water of baptism; which three things are one, and
   remain undivided, and not one of them is disjoined from connection with
   the others; because the Catholic Church lives and advances by this
   faith, that Christ Jesus we should believe neither manhood to exist
   without true Godhead, nor Godhead without true manhood.  But when
   Eutyches, on being questioned in your examination of him, answered, "I
   confess that our Lord was of two natures before the union, but after
   the union I confess one nature;" I am astonished that so absurd and
   perverse a profession as this of his was not rebuked by a censure on
   the part of any of his judges, and that an utterance extremely foolish
   and extremely blasphemous was passed over, just as if nothing had been
   heard which could give offence:  seeing that it is as impious to say
   that the Only-begotten Son of God was of two natures before the
   Incarnation as it is shocking to affirm that, since the Word became
   flesh, there has been in him one nature only.  But lest Eutyches should
   think that what he said was correct, or was tolerable, because it was
   not confuted by any assertion of yours, we exhort your earnest
   solicitude, dearly beloved brother, to see that, if by God's merciful
   inspiration the case is brought to a satisfactory issue, the
   inconsiderate and inexperienced man be cleansed also from this
   pestilent notion of his; seeing that, as the record of the proceedings
   has clearly shown, he had fairly begun to abandon his own opinion when
   on being driven into a corner by authoritative words of yours, he
   professed himself ready to say what he had not said before, and to give
   his adhesion to that faith from which he had previously stood aloof.
   But when he would not consent to anathematize the impious dogma you
   understood, brother, that he continued in his own misbelief, and
   deserved to receive sentence of condemnation.  For which if he grieves
   sincerely and to good purpose, and understands, even though too late,
   how properly the Episcopal authority has been put in motion, or if, in
   order to make full satisfaction, he shall condemn viva voce, and under
   his own hand, all that he has held amiss, no compassion, to whatever
   extent, which can be shown him when he has been set right, will be
   worthy of blame, for our Lord, the true and good Shepherd, who laid
   down his life for his sheep, and who came to save men's souls and not
   to destroy them, wills us to imitate his own loving kindness; so that
   justice should indeed constrain those who sin, but mercy should not
   reject those who are converted.  For then indeed is the true faith
   defended with the best results, when a false opinion is condemned even
   by those who have followed it.  But in order that the whole matter may
   be piously and faithfully carried out, we have appointed our brethren,
   Julius, Bishop, and Reatus, Presbyter (of the title of St. Clement) and
   also my son Hilarus, Deacon, to represent us; and with them we have
   associated Dulcitius, our Notary, of whose fidelity we have had good
   proof:  trusting that the Divine assistance will be with you, so that
   he who has gone astray may be saved by condemning his own unsound
   opinion.  May God keep you in good health, dearly beloved brother.

   Session II.  (continued).

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 368.)

   After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops
   cried out:  This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the
   Apostles.  So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe.  Anathema to
   him who does not thus believe.  Peter has spoken thus through Leo.  So
   taught the Apostles.  Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught
   Cyril.  Everlasting be the memory of Cyril.  Leo and Cyril taught the
   same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe.  This is the true
   faith.  Those of us who are orthodox thus believe.  This is the faith
   of the fathers.  Why were not these things read at Ephesus [i.e. at the
   heretical synod held there]?  These are the things Dioscorus hid away.

   [Some explanations were asked by the Illyrian bishops and the answers
   were found satisfactory, but yet a delay of a few days was asked for,
   and some bishops petitioned for a general pardon of all who had been
   kept out.  This proposition made great confusion, in the midst of which
   the session was dissolved by the judges.  (Col. 371.)]

   Paschasinus the bishop of Lilybæum, in the province of Silicia, and
   holding the place of the most holy Leo, archbishop of the Apostolic see
   of old Rome, said in Latin what being interpreted is as follows:  It is
   well known to this beloved of God synod, that divine [285] letters were
   sent to the blessed and apostolic pope Leo, inviting him to deign to be
   present at the holy synod.  But since ancient custom did not sanction
   this, nor the general necessity of the time seemed to permit it, our
   littleness in the place of himself he ta tes hagias sunodou epetrepse,
   and therefore it is necessary that whatever things are brought into
   discussion should be examined by our interference (dialalias).  [The
   Latin reads where I have placed the Greek of the ordinary text, thus,
   "commanded our littleness to preside in his place over this holy
   council."]  Therefore let the book presented by our most beloved-of-God
   brother, and fellow-bishop Eusebius be received, and read by the
   beloved of God archdeacon and primicerius of the notaries, Aëtius.

   And Aëtius, the archdeacon and primicerius of the notaries, took the
   book and read as follows.

   [Next follows the petition of Eusebius et post nonnulla four petitions
   each addressed to "The most holy and beloved-of-God ecumenical
   archbishop and patriarch of great Rome Leo, and to the holy and
   ecumenical Synod assembled at Chalcedon, etc., etc.;"  The first two by
   deacons of Alexandria, the third by a quondam presbyter of the diocese,
   and the fourth by a layman also of Alexandria.  After this Dioscorus
   was again summoned and, as he did not come, sentence was given against
   him, which was communicated to him in a letter contained in the acts.
   (L. and C., Conc., Tom. IV., col. 418.)  The Bishops expressed their
   opinions for the most part one by one, but the Roman Legates spoke
   together, and in their speech occurs the following (Col. 426:)]

   Wherefore the most holy and blessed Leo, archbishop of the great and
   elder Rome, through us, and through this present most holy synod
   together with [286] the thrice blessed and all-glorious Peter the
   Apostle, who is the rock and foundation of the Catholic Church, and the
   foundation of the orthodox faith, hath stripped him of the episcopate,
   and hath alienated from him all hieratic worthiness.  Therefore let
   this most holy and great synod sentence the before mentioned Dioscorus
   to the canonical penalties.

   [The bishops then, one by one, spoke in favour of the deposition of
   Dioscorus, but usually on the ground of his refusal to appear when
   thrice summoned.]

   And when all the most holy bishops had spoken on the subject, they
   signed this which follows.

   The holy and great and ecumenical Synod, which by the grace of God
   according to the constitution of our most pious and beloved of God
   emperors assembled together at Chalcedon the city of Bithynia, in the
   martyry of the most holy and victorious Martyr Euphemia to Dioscorus.

   We do you to wit that on the thirteenth day of the month of October you
   were deposed from the episcopate and made a stranger to all
   ecclesiastical order (thesmou ) by the holy and ecumenical synod, on
   account of your disregard of the divine canons, and of your
   disobedience to this holy and ecumenical synod and on account of the
   other crimes of which you have been found guilty, for even when called
   to answer your accusers three times by this holy and great synod
   according to the divine canons you did not come.

   Session IV.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 469.)

   The most magnificent and glorious judges and the great Senate said:

   Let the reverend council now declare what seems good concerning the
   faith, since those things which have already been disposed of have been
   made manifest.  Paschasinus and Lucentius, the most reverend bishops,
   and Boniface the most reverend presbyter, legates of the Apostolic See
   through that most reverend man, bishop Paschasinus said:  As the holy
   and blessed and Ecumenical Synod holds fast and follows the rule of
   faith (fidei regulam in the Latin Acts) which was set forth by the
   fathers at Nice, it also confirms the faith set forth by the Synod of
   150 fathers gathered at Constantinople at the bidding of the great
   Theodosius of blessed memory.  Moreover the exposition of their faith,
   of the illustrious Cyril of blessed memory set forth at the Council of
   Ephesus (in which Nestorius was condemned) is received.  And in the
   third place the writings of that blessed man, Leo, Archbishop of all
   the churches, who condemned the heresy of Nestorius and Eutyches, shew
   what the true faith is.  Likewise the holy Synod holds this faith, this
   it follows--nothing further can it add nor can it take aught away.

   When this had been translated into Greek by Beronician, the devout
   secretary of the divine consistory, the most reverend bishops cried
   out:  So we all believe, so we were baptized, so we baptize, so we have
   believed, so we now believe.

   The most glorious judges and the great senate said:  Since we see that
   the Holy Gospels have been placed alongside of your holiness, let each
   one of the bishops here assembled declare whether the epistle of most
   blessed archbishop Leo is in accordance with the exposition of the 318
   fathers assembled at Nice and with the decrees of the 150 fathers
   afterwards assembled in the royal city.

   [To this question the bishops answered one by one, until 161 separate
   opinions had been given, when the rest of the bishops were asked by the
   imperial judges to give their votes in a body (col. 508).]

   All the most reverend bishops cried out:  We all acquiesce, we all
   believe thus; we are all of the same mind.  So are we minded, so we
   believe, etc., etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Session V.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 555.)

   Paschasinus and Lucentius the most reverend bishops and Boniface a
   presbyter, vicars of the Apostolic See of Rome, said:  If they do not
   agree to the letter of that apostolic and blessed man, Pope Leo, give
   directions that we be given our letters of dismission, and let a synod
   be held there [i.e. in the West].

   [A long debate then followed as to whether the decree drawn up and
   presented should be accepted.  This seems to have been the mind of most
   of the bishops.  At last the commissioners proposed a committee of
   twenty-two to meet with them and report to the council, and the Emperor
   imposed this with the threat that otherwise they all should be sent
   home and a new council called in the West.  Even this did not make them
   yield (col. 560.)]

   The most reverend bishops cried out:  Many years to the Emperor!
   Either let the definition [i.e. the one presented at this session]
   stand or we go.  Many years to the Emperor!

   Cecropius, the most reverend bishop of Sebastopol, said:  We ask that
   the definition be read again and that those who dissent from it, and
   will not sign, may go about their business; for we give our consent to
   these things which have been so beautifully drafted, and make no
   criticisms.

   The most blessed bishops of Illyria said:  Let those who contradict be
   made manifest.  Those who contradict are Nestorians.  Those who
   contradict, let them go to Rome.

   The most magnificent and most glorious judges said:  Dioscorus
   acknowledged that he accepted the expression "of two natures," but not
   that there were two natures.  But the most holy archbishop Leo says
   that there are two natures in Christ unchangeably, inseparably,
   unconfusedly united in the one only-begotten Son our Saviour.  Which
   would you follow, the most holy Leo or Dioscorus?

   The most reverend bishops cried out:  We believe as Leo.  Those who
   contradict are Eutychians.  Leo hath rightly expounded the faith.

   The most magnificent and glorious judges said:  Add then to the
   definition, according to the judgment of our most holy father Leo, that
   there are two natures in Christ united unchangeably, inseparably,
   unconfusedly.

   [The Committee then sat in the oratory of the most holy martyr Euphemis
   and afterwards reported a definition of faith which while teaching the
   same doctrine was not the Tome of Leo (col. 562).]
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Definition of Faith of the Council of Chalcedon.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 562.)

   The holy, great, and ecumenical synod, assembled by the grace of God
   and the command of our most religious and Christian Emperors, Marcian
   and Valentinian, Augusti, at Chalcedon, the metropolis of the Bithynian
   Province, in the martyry of the holy and victorious martyr Euphemia,
   has decreed as follows:

   Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, when strengthening the knowledge of
   the Faith in his disciples, to the end that no one might disagree with
   his neighbour concerning the doctrines of religion, and that the
   proclamation of the truth might be set forth equally to all men, said,
   "My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you."  But, since the
   evil one does not desist from sowing tares among the seeds of
   godliness, but ever invents some new device against the truth;
   therefore the Lord, providing, as he ever does, for the human race, has
   raised up this pious, faithful, and zealous Sovereign, and has called
   together unto him from all parts the chief rulers of the priesthood; so
   that, the grace of Christ our common Lord inspiring us, we may cast off
   every plague of falsehood from the sheep of Christ, and feed them with
   the tender leaves of truth.  And this have we done with one unanimous
   consent, driving away erroneous doctrines and renewing the unerring
   faith of the Fathers, publishing to all men the Creed of the Three
   Hundred and Eighteen, and to their number adding, as their peers, the
   Fathers who have received the same summary of religion.  Such are the
   One Hundred and Fifty holy Fathers who afterwards assembled in the
   great Constantinople and ratified the same faith.  Moreover, observing
   the order and every form relating to the faith, which was observed by
   the holy synod formerly held in Ephesus, of which Celestine of Rome and
   Cyril of Alexandria, of holy memory, were the leaders, we do declare
   that the exposition of the right and blameless faith made by the Three
   Hundred and Eighteen holy and blessed Fathers, assembled at Nice in the
   reign of Constantine of pious memory, shall be pre-eminent:  and that
   those things shall be of force also, which were decreed by the One
   Hundred and Fifty holy Fathers at Constantinople, for the uprooting of
   the heresies which had then sprung up, and for the confirmation of the
   same Catholic and Apostolic Faith of ours.

   The Creed of the three hundred and eighteen Fathers at Nice.

   We believe in one God, etc.

   Item, the Creed of the one hundred and fifty holy Fathers who were
   assembled at Constantinople.

   We believe in one God, etc.

   This wise and salutary formula of divine grace sufficed for the perfect
   knowledge and confirmation of religion; for it teaches the perfect
   [doctrine] concerning Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and sets forth the
   Incarnation of the Lord to them that faithfully receive it.  But,
   forasmuch as persons undertaking to make void the preaching of the
   truth have through their individual heresies given rise to empty
   babblings; some of them daring to corrupt the mystery of the Lord's
   incarnation for us and refusing [to use] the name Mother of God
   (Theotokos) in reference to the Virgin, while others, bringing in a
   confusion and mixture, and idly conceiving that the nature of the flesh
   and of the Godhead is all one, maintaining that the divine Nature of
   the Only Begotten is, by mixture, capable of suffering; therefore this
   present holy, great, and ecumenical synod, desiring to exclude every
   device against the Truth, and teaching that which is unchanged from the
   beginning, has at the very outset decreed that the faith of the Three
   Hundred and Eighteen Fathers shall be preserved inviolate.  And on
   account of them that contend against the Holy Ghost, it confirms the
   doctrine afterwards delivered concerning the substance of the Spirit by
   the One Hundred and Fifty holy Fathers who assembled in the imperial
   City; which doctrine they declared unto all men, not as though they
   were introducing anything that had been lacking in their predecessors,
   but in order to explain through written documents their faith
   concerning the Holy Ghost against those who were seeking to destroy his
   sovereignty.  And, on account of those who have taken in hand to
   corrupt the mystery of the dispensation [i.e. the Incarnation] and who
   shamelessly pretend that he who was born of the holy Virgin Mary was a
   mere man, it receives the synodical letters of the Blessed Cyril,
   Pastor of the Church of Alexandria, addressed to Nestorius and the
   Easterns, judging them suitable, for the refutation of the frenzied
   folly of Nestorius, and for the instruction of those who long with holy
   ardour for a knowledge of the saving symbol.  And, for the confirmation
   of the orthodox doctrines, it has rightly added to these the letter of
   the President of the great and old Rome, the most blessed and holy
   Archbishop Leo, which was addressed to Archbishop Flavian of blessed
   memory, for the removal of the false doctrines of Eutyches, judging
   them to be agreeable to the confession of the great Peter, and as it
   were a common pillar against misbelievers.  For it opposes those who
   would rend the mystery of the dispensation into a Duad of Sons; it
   repels from the sacred assembly those who dare to say that the Godhead
   of the Only Begotten is capable of suffering; it resists those who
   imagine a mixture or confusion of the two natures of Christ; it drives
   away those who fancy his form of a servant is of an heavenly or some
   substance other than that which was taken of us, and it anathematizes
   those who foolishly talk of two natures of our Lord before the union,
   conceiving that after the union there was only one.

   Following the holy Fathers we teach with one voice that the Son [of
   God] and our Lord Jesus Christ is to be confessed as one and the same
   [Person], that he is perfect in Godhead and perfect in manhood, very
   God and very man, of a reasonable soul and [human] body consisting,
   consubstantial with the Father as touching his Godhead, and
   consubstantial with us as touching his manhood; made in all things like
   unto us, sin only excepted; begotten of his Father before the worlds
   according to his Godhead; but in these last days for us men and for our
   salvation born [into the world] of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God
   according to his manhood.  This one and the same Jesus Christ, the
   only-begotten Son [of God] must be confessed to be in two natures,
   [287] unconfusedly, immutably, indivisibly, inseparably [united], and
   that without the distinction of natures being taken away by such union,
   but rather the peculiar property of each nature being preserved and
   being united in one Person and subsistence, not separated or divided
   into two persons, but one and the same Son and only-begotten, God the
   Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, as the Prophets of old time have spoken
   concerning him, and as the Lord Jesus Christ hath taught us, and as the
   Creed of the Fathers hath delivered to us.

   These things, therefore, having been expressed by us with the greatest
   accuracy and attention, the holy Ecumenical Synod defines that no one
   shall be suffered to bring forward a different faith (heteran pistin),
   nor to write, nor to put together, nor to excogitate, nor to teach it
   to others.  But such as dare either to put together another faith, or
   to bring forward or to teach or to deliver a different Creed (heteron
   sumbolon) to as wish to be converted to the knowledge of the truth,
   from the Gentiles, or Jews or any heresy whatever, if they be Bishops
   or clerics let them be deposed, the Bishops from the Episcopate, and
   the clerics from the clergy; but if they be monks or laics:  let them
   be anathematized.

   After the reading of the definition, all the most religious Bishops
   cried out:  This is the faith of the fathers:  let the metropolitans
   forthwith subscribe it:  let them forthwith, in the presence of the
   judges, subscribe it:  let that which has been well defined have no
   delay:  this is the faith of the Apostles:  by this we all stand:  thus
   we all believe.

   Notes.

   Anatolius of Constantinople.

   (Ep. to St. Leo.  Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. LIV. [Leo. M., Opera, Tom. I.]
   col. 978.)

   Since after judgment had been delivered concerning him, there was need
   that all should agree in the right faith (for which purpose the most
   pious emperor had with the greatest pains assembled the holy Synod)
   with prayer and tears, your holiness being present with us in spirit
   and co-operating with us through those most God-beloved men whom you
   had sent to us, having as our protector the most holy and most comely
   Martyr Euphemia, we gave ourselves up entirely to this salutary work,
   all other matters being laid aside.  And when the crisis demanded that
   all the most holy bishops gathered together should set forth an
   unanimous definition (sumphonon horon) for the explanation and clearer
   understanding of our confession of our Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord God
   was found appearing to them that sought him not, and even to them that
   asked not for him.  And although some from the beginning contentiously
   made opposition, he shewed forth nevertheless his truth and so disposed
   things that an unanimous and uncontradicted writing was published by us
   all, which confirmed the souls of the stable, and inviting to the way
   of truth all who had declined therefrom.  And when we had subscribed
   with unanimous consent the chart, we all with one consent, that is our
   whole synod, entered the martyry of the most holy and triumphant martyr
   Euphemia, and when at the prayer of our most pious and beloved of
   Christ Emperor Marcian, and of our most pious and in all respects
   faithful Empress, our daughter and Augusta Pulcheria, with joy, and
   hilarity we placed upon the holy altar the decision which we had
   written for the confirmation of the faith of our fathers in accordance
   with that holy letter you sent us; and then handed it to their piety,
   that they might receive it as they had asked for it.  And when they had
   received it they gave glory with us to Christ the Lord, who had driven
   away the darkness of wicked opinion, and had illustrated with the
   greatest unanimity the word of truth, etc.

   From this passage can easily be understood the very obscure passage in
   the letter of the Council to Leo, where it says that the definition was
   delivered by St. Euphemia as her own confession of faith.  Vide note of
   the Ballerini on this epistle of Anatolius.

   Hefele.

   (Hist. of the Councils. Vol. III., p. 348.)

   The present Greek text has ek duo phuseon while the old Latin
   translation has, in duabus naturis.  After what had been repeatedly
   said in this session on the difference between "in two natures" and "of
   two natures," and in opposition to the latter formula, there can be no
   doubt whatever that the old Latin translator had the more accurate text
   before him, and that it was originally en duo phusesin.  This, however,
   is not mere supposition, but is expressly testified by antiquity:  (1)
   by the famous Abbot Euthymius of Palestine, a contemporary of the
   Council of Chalcedon, of whose disciples several were present as
   bishops at our Council (cf. Baron. ad. ann. 451, n. 152 sq.).  We still
   have a judgment of his which he gave respecting the decree of Chalcedon
   concerning the faith, and in which he repeats the leading doctrine in
   the words of the Synod itself.  At our passage he remarks:  en duo
   phusesi gnorizesthai homologei ton hena Christon k.t.l.  The fragment
   of his writings on the subject is found in the Vita S. Euthymii
   Abbatis, written by his pupil Cyril in the Analecta Græca of the monks
   of St. Maur, t. i., p. 57, printed in Mansi, t. vii., p. 774 sq.  (2)
   The second ancient witness is Severus, from a.d. 513 Monophysite
   patriarch of Antioch, who represents it as a great reproach and an
   unpardonable offence in the fathers of Chalcedon that they had
   declared:  en duo phusesin adiairetois gnorizesthai ton Christon (see
   the Sententiæ Severi in Mansi, t. vii., p. 839).  (3) Somewhat more
   than a hundred years after the Council of Chalcedon, Evagrius copied
   its decree concerning the faith in extenso into his Church History
   (lib. ii., 4), and, in fact, with the words:  en duo phusesin
   asunchutos k.t.l. (ed. Mog., p. 294).  (4) In the conference on
   religion held between the Severians and the orthodox at Constantinople,
   a.d. 553, the former reproached the Synod of Chalcedon with having put
   in duabus naturis, instead of ex duabus naturis, as Cyril and the old
   fathers had taught (Mansi, t. viii., p. 892; Hardouin, t. ii., p.
   1162).  (5) Leontius of Byzantium maintains quite distinctly, in the
   year 610, in his work De Sectis, that the Synod taught hena Christon en
   duo phutesin asunchutos k.t.l.

   It is clear that if any doubt had then existed as to the correct
   reading, Leontius could not have opposed the Monophysites with such
   certainty.  The passage adduced by him is Actio iv., c. 7., in
   Galland.  Bibliotheca PP., t. xii., p. 633.  Gieseler (Kirchengesch.
   i., S. 465), and after him Hahn (Biblioth. der Symbole, S. 118, note
   6), cites incorrectly the fourth instead of the fifth Actio.  Perhaps
   neither of them had consulted the passage itself.  (6) No less weight
   is to be attached to the fact that all the Latin translations, that of
   Rusticus and those before him, have in duabus naturis; and (7) that the
   Lateran Synod, a.d. 649, had the same reading in their Acts (Hardouin,
   t. iii., p. 835).  (8) Pope Agatho, also, in his letter to the Emperor
   Constans II., which was read in the sixth Ecumenical Synod, adduced the
   creed of Chalcedon with the words in duabus naturis (in the Acts of the
   sixth Ecumenical Council, Actio iv.; in Mansi, t. xi., p. 256;
   Hardouin, t. iii., p. 1091).  In consequence of this, most scholars of
   recent times, e.g., Tillemont, Walch (Bibloth. symbol veter., p. 106),
   Hahn (l. c.), Gieseler (l. c.), Neander (Abthl. ii., 2 of Bd. iv., S.
   988), have declared en duo phusesin to be the original and correct
   reading.  Neander adds:  "The whole process of the transactions of the
   Council shows this (that en duo is the correct reading).  Evidently the
   earlier creed, which was more favourable to the Egyptian doctrine,
   contained the ek duo phuseon and the favour shown to the other party
   came out chiefly in the change of the ek into en.  The expression ek
   duo phuseon besides, does not fit the place, the verb gnorizomenon
   points rather to the original en.  The en duo phusesin or ek duo
   phuseon was the turning-point of the whole controversy between
   Monophysitism and Dyophysitism."  Cf., on the other side, Baur,
   Trinitätslehre, Bd. i., S. 820, and Dorner (Lehre v. der Person
   Christi, Thl. ii., S. 129), where it is maintained that ek is the
   correct and original reading, but that it was from the beginning
   purposely altered by the Westerns into in; moreover, that ek fits
   better than en with gnorizomenon, and therefore that it had been
   allowed as a concession to the Monophysites.  The meaning, moreover,
   they say, of ek and en is essentially the same, and the one and the
   other alike excluded Monophysitism.

   [The Emperor was present in person and addressed the Council and
   afterwards suggested legislation under three heads, the drafts for
   which were read.]

   After this reading, the capitulas were handed by our most sacred and
   pious prince to the most beloved of God Anatolius, archbishop of royal
   Constantinople, which is New Rome, and all the most God-beloved bishops
   cried out:  Many years to our Emperor and Empress, the pious, the
   Christian.  May Christ whom thou servest keep thee.  These things are
   worthy of the faith.  To the Priest, the Emperor.  Thou hast
   straightened out the churches, victor of thine enemies, teacher of the
   faith.  Many years to the pious Empress, the lover of Christ.  Many
   years to her that is orthodox.  May God save your kingdom.  Ye have put
   down the heretics, ye have kept the faith.  May hatred be far removed
   from your empire, and may your kingdom endure for ever!

   Our most sacred and pious prince said to the holy synod:  To the honour
   of the holy martyr Euphemia, and of your holiness, we decree that the
   city of Chalcedon, in which the synod of the holy faith has been held,
   shall have the honours of a metropolis, in name only giving it this
   honour, the proper dignity of the city of Nicomedia being preserved.

   The most magnificent and glorious judges said:...The arrangement
   arrived at through the agreement of the most holy Maximus, the bishop
   of the city of Antioch, and of the most holy Juvenal, the bishop of
   Jerusalem, as the attestation of each of them declares, shall remain
   firm for ever, through our decree and the sentence of the holy synod;
   to wit, that the most holy bishop Maximus, or rather the most holy
   church of Antioch, shall have under its own jurisdiction the two
   Phoenicias and Arabia; but the most holy Juvenal, bishop of Jerusalem,
   or rather the most holy Church which is under him, shall have under his
   own power the three Palestines, all imperial pragmatics and letters and
   penalties being done away according to the bidding of our most sacred
   and pious prince.

   Note.

   The Ballerini, in their notes to the Works of St. Leo (Migne, Pat.
   Lat., LV., col. 733 et seqq.), cite fragments of the Acts of this
   council, which if they can be trusted, shew that this matter of the
   rights of Antioch and Jerusalem was treated of again at a subsequent
   session (on Oct. 31) and determined in the same fashion.  These
   fragments have generally been received as genuine, and have been
   inserted by Mansi (Tom. vii., 722 C.) in his Concilia.

   The notes of the Ballerini may also be read with profit, in the same
   volume of Migne's Latin Patrology, col. 737 et seq.

   The Decree with Regard to the Bishop of Ephesus.

   Session XII.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 706.)

   The most glorious judges said:  Since the proposition of the
   God-beloved archbishop of royal Constantinople, Anatolius, and of the
   most reverend bishop Paschasinus, holding the place of Leo, the most
   God-beloved archbishop of old Rome, which orders that because both of
   them [i.e., Bassianus and Stephen] acted uncanonically, neither of them
   should rule, nor be called bishop of the most holy church of Ephesus,
   and since the whole holy synod taught that uncanonically they had
   performed these ordinations, and had agreed with the speeches of the
   most reverend bishops; the most reverend Bassianus and the most
   reverend Stephen will be removed from the holy church of Ephesus; but
   they shall enjoy the episcopal dignity, and from the revenues of the
   before-mentioned most holy church, for their nourishment and
   consolation, they shall receive each year two hundred gold pieces; and
   another bishop shall be ordained according to the canons for the most
   holy church. [288]

   And the whole holy synod cried out:  This is a just sentence.  This is
   a pious scheme.  These things are fair to look upon.

   The most reverend bishop Bassianus said:  Pray give order that what was
   stolen from me be restored.

   The most glorious judges said:  If anything belonging to the most
   reverend bishop Bassianus personally has been taken from him, either by
   the most reverend bishop Stephen, or by any other persons whatsoever,
   this shall be restored, after judicial proof, by them who took it away
   or caused it to be taken.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [288] The English translation of Hefele asserts twice (Hist. of the
   Councils, Vol. III., pp. 173 and 376), that Bassianus was "deposed."
   This is entirely a mistake, he was deprived of his diocese, but
   retained his episcopal rank.

   Decree with Regard to Nicomedia.

   Session XIII.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 715.)

   The most glorious judges said [after the reading of the imperial
   letters was finished]:  These divine letters say nothing whatever with
   regard to the episcopate, but both refer to honour belonging to
   metropolitan cities.  But the sacred letters of Valentinian and Valens
   of divine memory, which then bestowed metropolitan rights upon the city
   of Nice, carefully provided that nothing should be taken away from
   other cities.  And the canon of the holy fathers decreed that there
   should be one metropolis in each province.  What therefore is the
   pleasure of the holy synod in this matter?

   The holy synod cried out:  Let the canons be kept.  Let the canons be
   sufficient.

   Atticus the most reverend bishop of old Nicopolis in Epirus said:  The
   canon thus defines, that a metropolitan should have jurisdiction in
   each province, and he should constitute all the bishops who are in that
   province.  And this is the meaning of the canon.  Now the bishop of
   Nicomedia, since from the beginning this was a metropolis, ought to
   ordain all the bishops who are in that province.

   The holy synod said:  This is what we all wish, this we all pray for,
   let this everywhere be observed, this is pleasing to all of us.

   John, Constantine, Patrick [Peter] and the rest of the most reverend
   bishops of the Pontic diocese [through John who was one of them] said:
   The canons recognize the one more ancient as the metropolitan.  And it
   is manifest that the most religious bishop of Nicomedia has the right
   of the ordination, and since the laws (as your magnificence has seen)
   have honoured Nice with the name only of metropolis, and so made its
   bishop superior to the rest of the bishops of the province in honour
   only.

   The holy synod said:  They have taught in accordance with the canons,
   beautifully have they taught.  We all say the same things.

   [Aëtius, Archdeacon of Constantinople, then put in a plea to save the
   rights of the throne of the royal city.]

   The most glorious judges said:  The most reverend the bishop of
   Nicomedia shall have the authority of metropolitan over the churches of
   the province of Bithynia, and Nice shall have the honour only of
   Metropolitical rank, submitting itself according to the example of the
   other bishops of the province of Nicomedia.  For such is the pleasure
   of the Holy Synod.

   The XXX Canons of the Holy and Fourth Synods, of Chalcedon.

   Canon I.

   We have judged it right that the canons of the Holy Fathers made in
   every synod even until now, should remain in force.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   The canons of every Synod of the holy Fathers shall be observed.

   Hefele.

   Before the holding of the Council of Chalcedon, in the Greek Church,
   the canons of several synods, which were held previously, were gathered
   into one collection and provided with continuous numbers, and such a
   collection of canons, as we have seen, lay before the Synod of
   Chalcedon.  As, however, most of the synods whose canons were received
   into the collection, e.g. those of Neocæsarea, Ancyra, Gangra, Antioch,
   were certainly not Ecumenical Councils, and were even to some extent of
   doubtful authority, such as the Antiochene Synod of 341, the
   confirmation of the Ecumenical Synod was now given to them, in order to
   raise them to the position of universally and unconditionally valid
   ecclesiastical rules.  It is admirably remarked by the Emperor
   Justinian, in his 131st Novel, cap. j.; "We honour the doctrinal
   decrees of the first four Councils as we do Holy Scripture, but the
   canons given or approved by them as we do the laws."

   It seems quite impossible to determine just what councils are included
   in this list, the Council in Trullo has entirely removed this ambiguity
   in its second canon.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa XXV., Quæst. 1, can. xiv.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon II.

   If any Bishop should ordain for money, and put to sale a grace which
   cannot be sold, and for money ordain a bishop, or chorepiscopus, or
   presbyters, or deacons, or any other of those who are counted among the
   clergy; or if through lust of gain he should nominate for money a
   steward, or advocate, or prosmonarius, or any one whatever who is on
   the roll of the Church, let him who is convicted of this forfeit his
   own rank; and let him who is ordained be nothing profited by the
   purchased ordination or promotion; but let him be removed from the
   dignity or charge he has obtained for money.  And if any one should be
   found negotiating such shameful and unlawful transactions, let him
   also, if he is a clergyman, be deposed from his rank, and if he is a
   layman or monk, let him be anathematized.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.

   Whoso buys or sells an ordination, down to a Prosmonarius, shall be in
   danger of losing his grade.  Such shall also be the case with
   go-betweens, if they be clerics they shall be cut off from their rank,
   if laymen or monks, they shall be anathematized.

   Bright.

   A great scandal in the "Asian diocese" had led to St. Chrysostom's
   intervention.  Antoninus, bishop of Ephesus, was charged, with "making
   it a rule to sell ordinations of bishops at rates proportionate to the
   value of their sees" (Palladius, Dial. de vita Chrysost., p. 50).
   Chrysostom held a synod at Ephesus, at which six bishops were deposed
   for having obtained their sees in this manner.  Isidore of Pelasium
   repeatedly remonstrated with his bishop Eusebius on the heinousness of
   "selling the gift" of ordinations (Epist. I., 26, 30, 37); and names
   Zosimus, a priest, and Maron, a deacon, as thus ordained (ib. 111,
   119).  A few years before the council, a court of three bishops sat at
   Berytus to hear charges brought against Ibas, bishop of Edessa, by
   clerics of his diocese.  The third charge was thus curtly worded:
   "Moreover he receives for laying on hands" (Mansi, vii. 224).  The
   xxvij^th Trullan canon repeated this canon of Chalcedon against persons
   ordained for money, doubtless in view of such a state of things as
   Gregory the Great had heard of nearly a century earlier, "that in the
   Eastern Churches no one comes to holy order except by the payment of
   premiums" (Epist. xi. 46, to the bishop of Jerusalem; compare
   Evagrius's assertion that Justin II. openly sold bishoprics, V. 1).  It
   is easy to understand how the scruples of ecclesiastics could be abated
   by the courtly fashion of calling bribes "eulogiæ" (Fleury, XXVI, 20),
   just as the six prelates above referred to had regarded their payments
   as an equivalent for that "making over of property to the Curia," which
   was required by a law of 399 (Cod. Theod., xii. 1, 163, see notes in
   Transl. of Fleury, i. 163, ij. 16).

   The ekdikos, "defensor," was an official Advocate or counsel for the
   Church.  The legal force of the term "defensor" is indicated by a law
   of Valentinian I. "Nec idem in eodem negotio defensor sit et quæsitor"
   (Cod. Theod., ii. 10, 2).  In the East the office was held by
   ecclesiastics; thus, John, presbyter and "advocate" was employed, at
   the Council of Constantinople in 448, to summon Eutyches (Mansi, vii.
   697).  About 496, Paul the "Advocate" of Constantinople saved his
   archbishop from the sword of a murderer at the cost of his own life
   (Theodor., Lect. ii. 11).  In the list of the functionaries of St.
   Sophia, given by Goar in his Euchologion (p. 270), the Protecdicos is
   discribed as adjudicating, with twelve assessors, in smaller causes, on
   which he afterwards reports to the bishop.  In Africa, on the other
   hand, from a.d. 407 (see Cod. Theod., xvi. 2, 38), the office was held
   by barristers, in accordance with a request of the African bishops
   (Cod. Afric., 97; Mansi, iii., 802), who, six years earlier, had asked
   for "defensores," with special reference to the oppression of the poor
   by the rich (Cod. Afric., 75; Mansi, iii. 778, 970).  The "defensores"
   mentioned by Gregory the Great had primarily to take care of the poor
   (Epist., v. 29), and of the church property (ib., i. 36), but also to
   be advocates of injured clerics (ib., ix. 64) and act as assessors
   (ib., x. 1), etc.

   The next office is that of the Prosmonarius or, according to a various
   reading adopted by many (e.g. Justellus, Hervetus, Beveridge, Bingham),
   the Paramonarius.  Opinions differ as to the functions intended.
   Isidore gives simply "paramonarius:"  Dionysius (see Justellus,
   Biblioth., i., 134) omits the word; but in the "interpretatio
   Dionysii," as given in the Concilia, freedom has been taken to insert
   "vel mansionarium" in a parenthesis (vii. 373; see Beveridge, in
   loc.).  Mansionarius is a literal rendering; but what was the function
   of a mansionarius?  In Gregory the Great's time he was a sacristan who
   had the duty of lighting the church (Dial., i. 5); and "ostiarium" in
   the Prisca implies the same idea.  Tillemont, without deciding between
   the two Greek readings, thinks that the person intended had "some
   charge of what pertained to the church itself, perhaps like our present
   bedells" (xv. 694).  So Fleury renders, "concièrge" (xxviij. 29); and
   Newman, reading "paramonarion," takes a like view (note in Transl. of
   Fleury, vol. iii., p. 392).  But Justellus (i. 91) derives
   "paramonarius" from mone "mansio," a halting-place, so that the sense
   would be a manager of one of the church's farms, a "villicus," or, as
   Bingham expresses it, "a bailiff" (iii. 3, 1).  Beveridge agrees with
   Justellus, except in giving to mone the sense of "monastery" (compare
   the use of mone in Athan., Apol. c. Arian, 67, where Valesius
   understands it as "a station" on a road, but others as "a monastery,"
   see Historical Writings of St. Athanasius, Introd., p. xliv.).  Bingham
   also prefers this interpretation.  Suicer takes it as required by
   "paramonarios" which he treats as the true reading:  "prosmonarios" he
   thinks would have the sense of "sacristan."

   Hefele.

   According to Van Espen, however, who here supports himself upon Du
   Cange, by "prosmonarios" or "mansionarius," in the same way as by
   "oiconomos," a steward of church property was to be understood.

   The canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa I., Quæst. i., can. viij.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon III.

   It has come to [the knowledge of] the holy Synod that certain of those
   who are enrolled among the clergy have, through lust of gain, become
   hirers of other men's possessions, and make contracts pertaining to
   secular affairs, lightly esteeming the service of God, and slip into
   the houses of secular persons, whose property they undertake through
   covetousness to manage.  Wherefore the great and holy Synod decrees
   that henceforth no bishop, clergyman, nor monk shall hire possessions,
   or engage in business, or occupy himself in worldly engagements, unless
   he shall be called by the law to the guardianship of minors, from which
   there is no escape; or unless the bishop of the city shall commit to
   him the care of ecclesiastical business, or of unprovided orphans or
   widows and of persons who stand especially in need of the Church's
   help, through the fear of God.  And if any one shall hereafter
   transgress these decrees, he shall be subjected to ecclesiastical
   penalties.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   Those who assume the care of secular houses should be corrected, unless
   perchance the law called them to the administration of those not yet
   come of age, from which there is no exemption.  Unless further their
   Bishop permits them to take care of orphans and widows.

   Bright.

   These two cases excepted, the undertaking of secular business was made
   ecclesiastically penal.  Yet this is not to be construed as forbidding
   clerics to work at trades either (1) when the church-funds were
   insufficient to maintain them, or (2) in order to have more to bestow
   in alms, or (3) as an example of industry or humility.  Thus, most of
   the clergy of Cæsarea in Cappadocia practised sedentary trades for a
   livelihood (Basil, Epist., cxcviii., 1); and some African canons allow,
   or even direct, a cleric to live by a trade, provided that his clerical
   duties are not neglected (Mansi, iii., 955).  At an earlier time
   Spyridion, the famous Cypriot bishop, still one of the most popular
   saints in the Levant (Stanley's East. Church, p. 126), retained, out of
   humility (atuphian pollen, Soc. i. 12), his occupation as a shepherd;
   and in the latter part of the fourth century Zeno, bishop of Maiuma,
   wove linen, partly to supply his own wants, and partly to obtain means
   of helping the poor (Soz., vii. 28).  Sidonius mentions a "reader" who
   maintained himself by commercial transactions (Epist., vi. 8), and in
   the Anglo-Saxon Church, although presbyters were forbidden to become
   "negotiorum sæcularium dispositores" (Cl. of Clovesho in 747, c. 8), or
   to be "mongers and covetous merchants" (Elfric's canons, xxx.), yet the
   canons of King Edgar's reign ordered every priest "diligently to learn
   a handicraft" (No. 11; Wilkins, i. 225).  In short, it was not the mere
   fact of secular employment, but secularity of motive and of tone that
   was condemned.

   This canon was the second of these proposed by the Emperor, and is
   found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum, Pars I. Dist.
   lxxxvi., C. xxvj.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IV.

   Let those who truly and sincerely lead the monastic life be counted
   worthy of becoming honour; but, forasmuch as certain persons using the
   pretext of monasticism bring confusion both upon the churches and into
   political affairs by going about promiscuously in the cities, and at
   the same time seeking to establish Monasteries for themselves; it is
   decreed that no one anywhere build or found a monastery or oratory
   contrary to the will of the bishop of the city; and that the monks in
   every city and district shall be subject to the bishop, and embrace a
   quiet course of life, and give themselves only to fasting and prayer,
   remaining permanently in the places in which they were set apart; and
   they shall meddle neither in ecclesiastical nor in secular affairs, nor
   leave their own monasteries to take part in such; unless, indeed, they
   should at any time through urgent necessity be appointed thereto by the
   bishop of the city.  And no slave shall be received into any monastery
   to become a monk against the will of his master.  And if any one shall
   transgress this our judgment, we have decreed that he shall be
   excommunicated, that the name of God be not blasphemed.  But the bishop
   of the city must make the needful provision for the monasteries.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   Domestic oratories and monasteries are not to be erected contrary to
   the judgment of the bishop.  Every monk must be subject to his bishop,
   and must not leave his house except at his suggestion.  A slave,
   however, can not enter the monastic life without the consent of his
   master.

   Hefele.

   Like the previous canon, this one was brought forward by the Emperor
   Marcian in the sixth session, and then as number one, and the synod
   accepted the Emperor's proposed canon almost verbally.  Occasion for
   this canon seems to have been given by monks of Eutychian tendencies,
   and especially by the Syrian Barsumas, as appears from the fourth
   session.  He and his monks had, as Eutychians, withdrawn themselves
   from the jurisdiction of their bishops, whom they suspected of
   Nestorianism.

   Bright.

   Here observe (1) the definite assertion of episcopal authority over
   monks, as it is repeated for greater clearness in the last words of the
   canon, which are not found in Marcian's draft, "It is the duty of the
   bishop of the city to make due provision for the monasteries," and
   compare canons 8, 24.  Isidore says that the bishop must "keep an eye
   on the negligences of monks" (Epist., i. 149).  The Western Church
   followed in this track (see Council of Agde, canon xxvii., that "no new
   monastery is to be founded without the bishop's approval," and Ist of
   Orleans, canon xix., "Let abbots be under the bishop's power," and also
   Vth of Paris, canon xij., Mansi, viii., 329, 354, 542, etc.), until a
   reaction set in against the oppressiveness of bishops, was encouraged
   by Gregory the Great (Epist., i. 12; ii. 41), the IV^th Council of
   Toledo (canon li.), and the English Council of Hertford (canon iij.,
   Bede, iv. 5, and Bright's Chapters of Early Engl. Ch. Hist., p. 244),
   and culminated in the system of monastic exemptions, of which Monte
   Cassino, St. Martin's of Tours, Fulda, Westminster, Battle (see
   Freeman, Norm. Conquest, iv. 409), and St. Alban's were eminent
   instances.

   This canon, cut up and mutilated, is found in the Corpus Juris
   Canonici, Gratian's Decretum, Pars II., Causa XVI., Quæst. L, can.
   xij., and Causa XVIII., Quæst. II., Canon X.

   I have followed the reading of the Prisca, and of Dionysius, of Routh,
   and of Balsamon, "they were set apart," i.e. (as Balsamon explains)
   where they received the monastic tonsure.  This reading substitutes
   apetaxanto for epetaxanto , which would mean "over which they had been
   put in authority," or possibly (as Johnson) "where they are appointed,"
   or as Hammond, "in which they have been settled."  Isidore reads
   "ordinati sunt."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   Concerning bishops or clergymen who go about from city to city, it is
   decreed that the canons enacted by the Holy Fathers shall still retain
   their force.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   Those who go from city to city shall be subject to the canon law on the
   subject.

   Clerical adventurers and brief pastorates are not the peculiar
   characteristics of any one century.

   Bright.

   It is supposed by Hefele that the bishops were thinking of the case of
   Bassian, who, in the eleventh session (Oct. 29), pleaded that he had
   been violently ejected from the see of Ephesus.  Stephen the actual
   bishop, answered that Bassian had not been "ordained" for that see, but
   had invaded it and been justly expelled.  Bassian rejoined that his
   original consecration for the see of Evasa had been forcible even to
   brutality; that he had never even visited Evasa, that therefore his
   appointment to Ephesus was not a translation.  Ultimately, the Council
   cut the knot by ordering that a new bishop should be elected, Basalan
   and Stephen retaining the episcopal title and receiving allowances from
   the revenues of the see (Mansi, vii. 273 et seqq.)

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa VII., Quæst. I., can. xxij. [289]

   Canon VI.

   Neither presbyter, deacon, nor any of the ecclesiastical order shall be
   ordained at large, nor unless the person ordained is particularly
   appointed to a church in a city or village, or to a martyry, or to a
   monastery.  And if any have been ordained without a charge, the holy
   Synod decrees, to the reproach of the ordainer, that such an ordination
   shall be inoperative, and that such shall nowhere be suffered to
   officiate.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   In Martyries and Monasteries ordinations are strictly forbidden.
   Should any one be ordained therein, his ordination shall be reputed of
   no effect.

   Van Espen.

   The wording of the canon seems to intimate that the synod of Chalcedon
   held ordinations of this sort to be not only illicit but also invalid,
   irritis and cassis.  Nor is this to be wondered at, if we take into
   account the pristine and ancient discipline of the church and the
   opinion of many of the Scholastics (Morinus, De SS. Ordinat., Parte
   III., Exercit. V., cap. ix.).

   Hefele.

   It is clear that our canon forbids the so-called absolute ordinations,
   and requires that every cleric must at the time of his ordination be
   designated to a definite church.  The only titulus which is here
   recognized is that which was later known as titulus beneficii.  As
   various kinds of this title we find here (a) the appointment to a
   church in the city; (b) to a village church; (c) that to the chapel of
   a martyr; (d) the appointment as chaplain of a monastery.  For the
   right understanding of the last point, it must be remembered that the
   earliest monks were in no wise clerics, but that soon the custom was
   introduced in every larger convent, of having at least one monk
   ordained presbyter, that he might provide for divine service in the
   monastery.

   Similar prohibitions of ordinationes absolutæ were also put forth in
   after times.

   According to existing law, absolute ordinations, as is well known, are
   still illicitæ, but yet validæ, and even the Council of Chalcedon has
   not declared them to be properly invalidæ, but only as without effect
   (by permanent suspension).  Cf. Kober, Suspension, S. 220, and
   Hergenröther, Photius, etc., Bd. ii., S. 324.

   Bright.

   By the word marturio ("martyry") is meant a church or chapel raised
   over a martyr's grave.  So the Laodicene Council forbids Churchmen to
   visit the "martyries of heretics" (can. ix.).  So Gregory of Nyssa
   speaks of "the martyry" of the Holy Martyrs (Op. ii., 212); Chrysostom
   of a "martyry," and Palladius of "martyries" near Antioch (In Act.
   Apost. Hom., xxxviii. 5; Dial., p. 17), and Palladius of "the martyry
   of St. John" at Constantinople (Dial., p. 25).  See Socrates, iv. 18,
   23, on the "martyry" of St. Thomas at Edessa, and that of SS. Peter and
   Paul at Rome; and vi. 6, on the "martyry" of St. Euphenia at Chalcedon
   in which the Council actually met.  In the distinct sense of a visible
   testimony, the word was applied to the church of the Resurrection at
   Jerusalem (Eusebius, Vit. Con., iii. 40, iv. 40; Mansi, vi. 564; Cyril,
   Catech., xiv. 3), and to the Holy Sepulchre itself (Vit. Con., iii.
   28).  Churches raised over martyrs' tombs were called in the West
   "memoriæ martyrum," see Cod. Afric., lxxxiii. (compare Augustine, De
   Cura pro Mortuis, VI.).

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. lxx., can. j.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VII.

   We have decreed that those who have once been enrolled among the
   clergy, or have been made monks, shall accept neither a military charge
   nor any secular dignity; and if they shall presume to do so and not
   repent in such wise as to turn again to that which they had first
   chosen for the love of God, they shall be anathematized.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   If any cleric or monk arrogantly affects the military or any other
   dignity, let him be cursed.

   Hefele.

   Something similar was ordered by the lxxxiii. (lxxxii.) Apostolic
   Canon, only that it threatens the cleric who takes military service
   merely with deposition from his clerical office, while our canon
   subjects him to excommunication....The Greek commentators, Balsamon and
   Zonaras, think that our canon selects a more severe punishment, that of
   excommunication, because it has in view those clerics who have not
   merely taken military service, etc., but at the same time have laid
   aside their clerical dress and put on secular clothing.

   Bright.

   By strateian [which I have translated (or, as Canon Bright thinks,
   mistranslated) "military charge"], "militiam," is here meant, not
   military employment as such, but the public service in general.  This
   use of the term is a relic and token of the military basis of the Roman
   monarchy.  The court of the Imperator was called his camp, stratopedon
   (Cod. Theod., tom. ii., p. 22), as in Constantine's letter's to John
   Archaph and the Council of Tyre (Athan., Apol. c. Ari., lxx. 86), and
   in the VII^th canon of Sardica, so Athanasius speaks of the "camp" of
   Constans (Apol. ad Constant, iv. ), and of that of Constantius at Milan
   (Hist. Ari., xxxvij.); so Hosius uses the same phrase in his letter to
   Constantius (ib. xliv.); so the Semi-Arian bishops, when addressing
   Jovian (Soz., vi. 4); so Chrysostom in the reign of Theodosius I. (Hom.
   ad Pop. Antioch, vi. 2).  Similarly, there were officers of the palace
   called Castrensians (Tertull., De Cor., 12), as being "milites alius
   generis--de imperatoria familia" (Gothofred, Cod. Theod., tom. ii., p.
   526).  So strateusthai is used for holding a place at court, as in
   Soc., iv. 9; Soz., vi. 9, on Marcian's case, and a very clear passage
   in Soc., v. 25, where the verb is applied to an imperial secretary.  It
   occurs in combination with strateia in a petition of an Alexandrian
   deacon named Theodore, which was read in the third session of
   Chalcedon:  he says, "'Estrateusamen for about twenty-two years in the
   Schola of the magistrians" (under the Magister officionum, or chief
   magistrate of the palace), "but I disregarded strateias tosouton
   chronau in order to enter the ministry" (Mansi, vi. 1008).  See also
   Theodoret, Relig. Hist., xij., on the emperor's letter-carriers.  In
   the same sense Honorius, by a law of 408, forbids non-Catholics "intra
   palatium militare" (Cod Theod., xvi., 5, 42); and the Vandal king
   Hunneric speaks of "domus nostræ militiæ" (Victor Vitens, iv. 2).

   Canon VIII.

   Let the clergy of the poor-houses, monasteries, and martyries remain
   under the authority of the bishops in every city according to the
   tradition of the holy Fathers; and let no one arrogantly cast off the
   rule of his own bishop; and if any shall contravene this canon in any
   way whatever, and will not be subject to their own bishop, if they be
   clergy, let them be subjected to canonical censure, and if they be
   monks or laymen, let them be excommunicated.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   Any clergyman in an almshouse or monastery must submit himself to the
   authority of the bishop of the city.  But he who rebels against this
   let him pay the penalty.

   Van Espen.

   From this canon we learn that the synod of Chalcedon willed that all
   who were in charge of such pious institutions should be subject to the
   bishop, and in making this decree the synod only followed the tradition
   of the Fathers and Canons.  Although in its first part the canon only
   mentions "clergymen," yet in the second part monks are named, and, as
   Balsamon and Zonoras point out, both are included.

   Bright.

   What a ptocheion was may be seen from what Gibbon calls the "noble and
   charitable foundation, almost a new city" (iii. 252), established by
   St. Basil at a little distance from Cæsarea, and called in consequence
   the Basiliad.  Gregory Nazianzen describes it as a large set of
   buildings with rooms for the sick, especially for lepers, and also for
   house-less travellers; "a storehouse of piety, where disease was borne
   philosophically, and sympathy was tested" (Orat., xliii., 63, compare
   Basil himself, Epist., xciv., on its staff of nurses and physicians and
   cl., 3).  Sozomen calls it "a most celebrated resting-place for the
   poor," and names Prapidius as having been its warden while acting as
   "bishop over many villages" (vi. 34, see on Nic., viij.).  Another
   ptochotropheion is mentioned by Basil (Epist., cxliij.) as governed by
   a chorepiscopus.

   St. Chrysostom, on coming to the see of Constantinople, ordered the
   excess of episcopal expenditure to be transferred to the hospital for
   the sick (nosokomeion ), and "founded other such hospitals, setting
   over them two pious presbyters, with physicians and cooks....so that
   foreigners arriving in the city, on being attacked by disease, might
   receive aid, both because it was a good work in itself, and for the
   glory of the Saviour" (Palladius, Dial., p. 19).  At Ephesus Bassian
   founded a ptocheiton with seventy pallets for the sick (Mansi, vii.,
   277), and there were several such houses in Egypt (ib., vi., 1013; in
   the next century there was a hospital for the sick at Daphne near
   Antioch (Evagr., iv., 35).  "The tradition of the holy fathers" is here
   cited as barring any claim on the part of clerics officiating in these
   institutions, or in monasteries or martyries, to be exempt from the
   jurisdiction of the ordinary.  They are to "abide under it," and not to
   indulge selfwill by "turning restive" against their bishop's authority"
   (apheniazo is literally to get the bit between the teeth, and is used
   by Aëtius for "not choosing to obey," Mansi, vii., 72).  Those who dare
   to violate this clearly defined rule (diatuosin, comp. tupos in Nic.,
   xix.), and to refuse subjection to their own bishop, are, if clerics,
   to incur canonical censure, if monks or laics, to be excommunicated.
   The allusion to laics points to laymen as founders or benefactors of
   such institutions.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa XVIII., Q. II., canon x., § 3.

   Canon IX.

   If any Clergyman have a matter against another clergyman, he shall not
   forsake his bishop and run to secular courts; but let him first lay
   open the matter before his own Bishop, or let the matter be submitted
   to any person whom each of the parties may, with the Bishop's consent,
   select.  And if any one shall contravene these decrees, let him be
   subjected to canonical penalties.  And if a clergyman have a complaint
   against his own or any other bishop, let it be decided by the synod of
   the province.  And if a bishop or clergyman should have a difference
   with the metropolitan of the province, let him have recourse to the
   Exarch of the Diocese, or to the throne of the Imperial City of
   Constantinople, and there let it be tried.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   Litigious clerics shall be punished according to canon, if they despise
   the episcopal and resort to the secular tribunal.  When a cleric has a
   contention with a bishop let him wait till the synod sits, and if a
   bishop have a contention with his metropolitan let him carry the case
   to Constantinople.

   Johnson.

   Let the reader observe that here is a greater privilege given by a
   General Council to the see of Constantinople than ever was given by any
   council, even that of Sardica, to the bishop of Rome, viz., that any
   bishop or clergyman might at the first instance bring his cause before
   the bishop of Constantinople if the defendant were a metropolitan.

   Hefele.

   That our canon would refer not merely the ecclesiastical, but the civil
   differences of the clergy, in the first case, to the bishop, is beyond
   a doubt.  And it comes out as clearly from the word proteron (= at
   first) that it does not absolutely exclude a reference to the secular
   judges, but regards it as allowable only when the first attempt at an
   adjustment of the controversy by the bishop has miscarried.  This was
   quite clearly recognized by Justinian in his 123d Novel, c. 21:  "If
   any one has a case against a cleric, or a monk, or a deaconess, or a
   nun, or an ascetic, he shall first make application to the bishop of
   his opponent, and he shall decide.  If both parties are satisfied with
   his decision, it shall then be carried into effect by the imperial
   judge of the locality.  If, however, one of the contending parties
   lodges an appeal against the bishop's judgment within ten days, then
   the imperial judge of the locality shall decide the matter.  There is
   no doubt that the expression "Exarch" employed in our canon, and also
   in canon 17, means, in the first place, those superior metropolitans
   who have several ecclesiastical provinces under them.  Whether,
   however, the great patriarchs, properly so called, are to be included
   under it, may be doubted.  The Emperor Justinian, in c. 22 of his Novel
   just quoted (l. c.) in our text has, without further explanation,
   substituted the expression Patriarch for Exarch, and in the same way
   the commentator Aristenus has declared both terms to be identical,
   adding that only the Patriarch of Constantinople has the privilege of
   having a metropolitan tried before him who does not belong to his
   patriarchate, but is subject to another patriarch.  In the same way our
   canon was understood by Beveridge.  Van Espen, on the contrary, thinks
   that the Synod had here in view only the exarchs in the narrower sense
   (of Ephesus, Cæsarea), but not the Patriarchs, properly so called, of
   Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, as it would be too great a
   violation of the ancient canons, particularly of the 6th of Nicæa, to
   have set aside the proper patriarch and have allowed an appeal to the
   Bishop of Constantinople (with this Zonaras also agrees in his
   explanation of canon 17).  Least of all, however, would the Synod have
   made such a rule for the West, i.e., have allowed that any one should
   set aside the Patriarch of Rome and appeal to the Patriarch of
   Constantinople, since they themselves, in canon 28, assigned the first
   place in rank to Rome.

   It appears to me that neither Beveridge, etc., nor Van Espen are fully
   in the right, while each is partially so.  With Van Espen we must
   assume that our Synod, in drawing up this canon, had in view only the
   Greek Church, and not the Latin as well, particularly as neither the
   papal legates nor any Latin bishop whatever was present at the drawing
   up of these canons.  On the other hand, Beveridge is also right in
   maintaining that the Synod made no distinction between the patriarchs
   proper and the exarchs (such a distinction must otherwise have been
   indicated in the text), and allowed that quarrels which should arise
   among the bishops of other patriarchates might be tried at
   Constantinople.  Only that Beveridge ought to have excepted the West
   and Rome.

   The strange part of our canon may be explained in the following
   manner.  There were always many bishops at Constantinople from the most
   different places, who came there to lay their contentions and the like
   before the Emperor.  The latter frequently referred the decision to the
   bishop of Constantinople, who then, in union with the then present
   bishops from the most different provinces, held a "Home Synod" and gave
   the sentence required at this.  Thus gradually the practice was formed
   of controversies being decided by bishops of other patriarchates or
   exarchates at Constantinople, to the setting aside of the proper
   superior metropolitan, an example of which we have seen in that famous
   Synod of Constantinople, a.d. 448, at which the case of Eutyches was
   the first time brought forward.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa XI., Q.I., canon xlvj.

   Canon X.

   It shall not be lawful for a clergyman to be at the same time enrolled
   in the churches of two cities, that is, in the church in which he was
   at first ordained, and in another to which, because it is greater, he
   has removed from lust of empty honour.  And those who do so shall be
   returned to their own church in which they were originally ordained,
   and there only shall they minister.  But if any one has heretofore been
   removed from one church to another, he shall not intermeddle with the
   affairs of his former church, nor with the martyries, almshouses, and
   hostels belonging to it.  And if, after the decree of this great and
   ecumenical Synod, any shall dare to do any of these things now
   forbidden, the synod decrees that he shall be degraded from his rank.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   No cleric shall be recorded on the clergy-list of the churches of two
   cities.  But if he shall have strayed forth, let him be returned to his
   former place.  But if he has been transferred, let him have no share in
   the affairs of his former church.

   Van Espen, following Christian Lupus, remarks that this canon is
   opposed to pluralities.  For if a clergyman has by presentation and
   institution obtained two churches, he is enrolled in two churches at
   the same time, contrary to this canon; but surely that this be the
   case, the two churches must needs be in two cities, and that, in the
   days of Chalcedon, meant in two dioceses.

   Bright.

   Here a new institution comes into view, of which there were many
   instances.  Julian had directed Pagan hospices (xenodocheia ) to be
   established on the Christian model (Epist. xlix.).  The Basiliad at
   Cæsarea was a xenodocheion as well as a ptocheion; it contained
   katagogia tois xenois, as well as for wayfayers, and those who needed
   assistance on account of illness, and Basil distinguished various
   classes of persons engaged in charitable ministrations, including those
   who escorted the traveller on his way (tous parapempontas , Epist.
   xciv.).  Jerome writes to Pammachius:  "I hear that you have made a
   xenodochion' in the port of Rome," and adds that he himself had built a
   "diversorium" for pilgrims to Bethlehem (Epist. xvi., 11, 14).
   Chrysostom reminds his auditors at Constantinople that "there is a
   common dwelling set apart by the Church," and "called a xenon" (in Act.
   Hom., xlv. 4).  His friend Olympias was munificent to "xenotrophia"
   (Hist. Lausiac, 144).  There was a xenodochion near the church of the
   monastic settlement at Nitria (ib., 7).  Ischyrion, in his memorial
   read in the 3d session of Chalcedon, complains of his patriarch
   Dioscorus for having misapplied funds bequeathed by a charitable lady
   tois xeneosi kai ptocheiois in Egypt, and says that he himself had been
   confined by Dioscorus in a "xenon" for lepers (Mansi, vi. 1013, 1017).
   Justinian mentions xenodochia in Cod., i. 3, 49, and their wardens in
   Novell., 134, 16.  Gregory the Great orders that the accounts of
   xenodochia should be audited by the bishop (Epist. iv., 27).  Charles
   the Great provides for the restoration of decayed "senodochia"
   (Capitul. of 803; Pertz, Leg., i. 110); and Alcuin exhorts his pupil,
   archbishop Eanbald, to think where in the diocese of York he could
   establish "xenodochia, id est, hospitalia" (Epist. L.).

   Canon XI.

   We have decreed that the poor and those needing assistance shall
   travel, after examination, with letters merely pacifical from the
   church, and not with letters commendatory, inasmuch as letters
   commendatory ought to be given only to persons who are open to
   suspicion.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XL.

   Let the poor who stand in need of help make their journey with letters
   pacificatory and not commendatory:  For letters commendatory should
   only be given to those who are open to suspicion.

   Aristenus.

   ...The poor who need help should journey with letters pacificatory from
   the bishop, so that those who have the ability to help them may be
   moved with pity.  These need no letters commendatory, such letters
   should be shown, however, by presbyters and deacons, and by the rest of
   the clergy.

   See notes on canons vij., viij., and xj. of Antioch; and on canon xlij.
   of Laodicea.

   Hefele.

   The mediaeval commentators, Balsamon, Zonaras, and Aristenus,
   understand this canon to mean that letters of commendation, sustatikai
   , commendatitiæ litteræ were given to those laymen and clerics who were
   previously subject to ecclesiastical censure, and therefore were
   suspected by other bishops, and for this reason needed a special
   recommendation, in order to be received in another church into the
   number of the faithful.  The letters of peace (eirenikai) on the
   contrary, were given to those who were in undisturbed communion with
   their bishop, and had not the least evil reputation abroad.

   Our canon was understood quite differently by the old Latin writers,
   Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore, who translate the words en hupolepsei by
   personæ honoratiores and clariores, and the learned Bishop Gabriel
   Aubespine of Orleans has endeavored to prove, in his notes to our
   canon, that the litteræ pacificæ were given to ordinary believers, and
   the commendatitiæ (sustatikai) on the contrary, only to clerics and to
   distinguished laymen; and in favour of this view is the xiii. canon of
   Chalcedon.

   With regard to this much-vexed point, authorities are so divided that
   no absolute judgment can be arrived at.  The interpretation I have
   followed is that of the Greeks and of Hervetus, which seems to be
   supported by Apostolic Canon XIII., and was that adopted by Johnson and
   Hammond.  On the other hand are the Prisca, Dionysius, Isidore,
   Tillemont, Routh, and to these Bright seems to unite himself by saying
   that this "sense is the more natural."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XII.

   It has come to our knowledge that certain persons, contrary to the laws
   of the Church, having had recourse to secular powers, have by means of
   imperial rescripts divided one Province into two, so that there are
   consequently two metropolitans in one province; therefore the holy
   Synod has decreed that for the future no such thing shall be attempted
   by a bishop, since he who shall undertake it shall be degraded from his
   rank.  But the cities which have already been honoured by means of
   imperial letters with the name of metropolis, and the bishops in charge
   of them, shall take the bare title, all metropolitan rights being
   preserved to the true Metropolis.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   One province shall not be cut into two.  Whoever shall do this shall be
   cast out of the episcopate.  Such cities as are cut off by imperial
   rescript shall enjoy only the honour of having a bishop settled in
   them:  but all the rights pertaining to the true metropolis shall be
   preserved.

   Bright.

   We learn from this canon, there were cases in which an ambitious
   prelate, "by making application to the government" ("secular powers")
   had obtained what are called "pragmatic letters," and employed them for
   the purpose of "dividing one province into two," and exalting himself
   as a metropolitan.  The name of a "pragmatic sanction" is more familiar
   in regard to medieval and modern history; it recalls the name of St.
   Louis, and, still more, that of the Emperor Charles VI. the father of
   Maria Theresa.  Properly a "pragmatic" was a deliberate order
   promulgated by the Emperor after full hearing of advice, on some public
   affair.  We find "pragmatici nostri statuta" in a law of a.d. 431.
   (Cod. Theod., xi. 1, 36); and "pragmatici prioris," "sub hac pragmatica
   jussione," in ordinances in Append. to Cod. Theod., pp. 95, 162; and
   the empress Pulcheria, about a year before the Council, had informed
   Leo that her husband Marcian had recalled some exiled orthodox bishops
   "robore pragmatici sui" (Leon., Epist. lxxvij.).  Justinian speaks of
   "pragmaticas nostras formas" and "pragmaticum typum" (Novel., 7, 9,
   etc.).  The phrase was adopted from his legislation by Louis the Pious
   and his colleague-son Lothar (compare Novel. 7, 2 with Pertz, Mon.
   Germ, Hist. Leg., i., 254), and hence it came to be used both by later
   German emperors (see, e.g., Bryce's Holy Roman Empire, p. 212), and by
   the French kings (Kitchin, Hist. France, i. 343, 544).  Augustine
   explains it by "præceptum imperatoris" (Brev. Collat. cum Donatist.
   iii., 2), and Balsamon in his comment uses an equivalent phrase; and so
   in the record of the fourth session of Chalcedon we have theia grammata
   ("divine" being practically equivalent to "imperial") explained by
   pragmatikous tupous (Mansi, vii., 89).  We must observe that the
   imperial order, in the cases contemplated by the canon, had only
   conferred the title of "metropolis" on the city, and had not professed
   to divide the province for civil, much less for ecclesiastical,
   purposes. Valens, indeed, had divided the province of Cappadocia, when
   in 371 he made Tyana a metropolis:  and therefore Anthimus, bishop of
   Tyana, when he claimed the position of a metropolitan, with authority
   over suffragans, was making a not unnatural inference in regard to
   ecclesiastical limits from political rearrangements of territory, as
   Gregory of Nazianzus says (Orat. xliii., 58), whereas Basil "held to
   the old custom," i.e., to the traditional unity of his provincial
   church, although after a while he submitted to what he could not hinder
   (see Tillemont, ix., 175, 182, 670).  But in the case of Eustathius of
   Berytus, which was clearly in the Council's mind, the Phoenician
   province had not been divided; it was in reliance on a mere title
   bestowed upon his city, and also on an alleged synodical ordinance
   which issued in fact from the so-called "Home Synod" that he declared
   himself independent of his metropolitan, Photius of Tyre, and brought
   six bishoprics under his assumed jurisdiction.  Thus while the province
   remained politically one, he had de facto divided it ecclesiastically
   into two.  Photius petitioned Marcian, who referred the case to the
   Council of Chalcedon, and it was taken up in the fourth session.  The
   imperial commissioners announced that it was to be settled not
   according to "pragmatic forms," but according to those which had been
   enacted by the Fathers (Mansi, vii., 89).  This encouraged the Council
   to say, "A pragmatic can have no force against the canons."  The
   commissioners asked whether it was lawful for bishops, on the ground of
   a pragmatic, to steal away the rights of other churches?  The answer
   was explicit:  "No, it is against the canon."  The Council proceeded to
   cancel the resolution of the Home Synod in favour of the elevation of
   Berytus, ordered the 4th Nicene canon to be read, and upheld the
   metropolitical rights of Tyre.  The commissioners also pronounced
   against Eustathius.  Cecropius, bishop of Sebastopolis, requested them
   to put an end to the issue of pragmatics made to the detriment of the
   canons; the Council echoed this request; and the commissioners granted
   it by declaring that the canons should everywhere stand good (Mansi,
   vii., 89-97).  We may connect with this incident a law of Marcian dated
   in 454, by which "all pragmatic sanctions, obtained by means of favour
   or ambition in opposition to the canon of the Church, are declared to
   be deprived of effect" (Cod. Justin, i., 2, 12).

   To this decision the present canon looks back, when it forbids any
   bishop, on pain of deposition, to presume to do as Eustathius had done,
   since it decrees that "he who attempts to do so shall fall from his own
   rank (bathmou) in the Church.  And cities which have already obtained
   the honorary title of a metropolis from the emperor are to enjoy the
   honour only, and their bishops to be but honorary metropolitans, so
   that all the rights of the real metropolis are to be reserved to it."
   So, at the end of the 6th session the emperor had announced that
   Chalcedon was to be a titular metropolis, saving all the rights of
   Nicomedia; and the Council had expressed its assent (Mansi, xii., 177;
   cf. Le Quien, i., 602).  Another case was discussed in the 13th session
   of the Council.  Anastasius of Nicæa had claimed to be independent of
   his metropolitan Eunomius of Nicomedia, on the ground of an ordinance
   of Valens, recognising the city of Nicæa as by old custom a
   "metropolis."  Eunomius, who complained of Anastasius's encroachments,
   appealed to a later ordinance, guaranteeing to the capital of Bithynia
   its rights as unaffected by the honour conferred on Nicæa:  the Council
   expressed its mind in favour of Eunomius, and the dispute was settled
   by a decision "that the bishop of Nicomedia should have metropolitical
   authority over the Bithynian churches, while the bishop of Nicæa should
   have merely the honour of a metropolitan, being subjected, like the
   other comprovincials, to the bishop of Nicomedia (Mansi, vii., 313).
   Zonaras says that this canon was in his time no longer observed; and
   Balsamon says that when the primates of Heraclea and Ancyra cited it as
   upholding their claim to perform the consecration of two "honorary
   metropolitans," they were overruled by a decree of Alexius Comnenus,
   "in presence and with consent" of a synod (on Trullan, canon xxxviij.).

   The first part of this canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici,
   Gratian's Decretum, Pars I., Dist. ci., canon j.

   Canon XIII.

   Strange and unknown clergymen without letters commendatory from their
   own Bishop, are absolutely prohibited from officiating in another city.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   No cleric shall be received to communion in another city without a
   letter commendatory.

   "Unknown clergymen."  I have here followed the reading of the Greek
   commentators.  But the translators of the Prisca, and Dionysius, and
   Isidore must have all read anagnostas (i.e., Readers) instead of
   agnostous.  Justellus, Hervetus, and Beveridge, as also Johnson and
   Hammond, follow the reading of the text.  Hefele suggests that if
   "Readers" is the correct reading perhaps it means, "all clergymen even
   readers."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIV.

   Since in certain provinces it is permitted to the readers and singers
   to marry, the holy Synod has decreed that it shall not be lawful for
   any of them to take a wife that is heterodox.  But those who have
   already begotten children of such a marriage, if they have already had
   their children baptized among the heretics, must bring them into the
   communion of the Catholic Church; but if they have not had them
   baptized, they may not hereafter baptize them among heretics, nor give
   them in marriage to a heretic, or a Jew, or a heathen, unless the
   person marrying the orthodox child shall promise to come over to the
   orthodox faith.  And if any one shall transgress this decree of the
   holy synod, let him be subjected to canonical censure.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   A Cantor or Lector alien to the sound faith, if being then married, he
   shall have begotten children let him bring them to communion, if they
   had there been baptized.  But if they had not yet been baptized they
   shall not be baptized afterwards by the heretics.

   Aristenus.

   The tenth and thirty-first canons of the Synod of Laodicea and the
   second of the Sixth Synod in Trullo, and this present canon forbid one
   of the orthodox to be joined in marriage with a woman who is a heretic,
   or vice versa.  But if any of the Cantors or Lectors had taken a wife
   of another sect before these canons were set forth, and had had
   children by her, and had had them baptized while yet he remained among
   the heretics, these he should bring to the communion of the Catholic
   Church.  But if they had not yet been baptized, he must not turn back
   and have them baptized among heretics.  But departing thence let him
   lead them to the Catholic Church and enrich them with divine baptism.

   Hefele.

   According to the Latin translation of Dionysius Exiguus, who speaks
   only of the daughters of the lectors, etc., the meaning may be
   understood, with Christian Lupus, as being that only their daughters
   must not be married to heretics or Jews or heathen, but that the sons
   of readers may take wives who are heretics, etc., because that men are
   less easily led to fall away from the faith than women.  But the Greek
   text makes here no distinction between sons and daughters.

   Bright.

   It is to Victor that we owe the most striking of all anecdotes about
   readers.  During the former persecution under Genseric (or Gaiseric),
   the Arians attacked a Catholic congregation on Easter Sunday; and while
   a reader was standing alone in the pulpit, and chanting the "Alleluia
   melody" (cf. Hammond, Liturgies, p. 95), an arrow pierced his throat,
   the "codex" dropped from his hands, and he fell down dead (De Persec.
   Vand., i., 13).  Five years before the Council, a boy of eight named
   Epiphanius was made a reader in the church of Pavia, and in process of
   time became famous as its bishop.  Justinian forbade readers to be
   appointed under eighteen (Novel., 134, 13).  The office is described in
   the Greek Euchologion as "the first step to the priesthood," and is
   conferred with delivery of the book containing the Epistles.  Isidore
   of Seville, in the seventh century, tells us that the bishop ordained a
   reader by delivering to him "coram plebe," the "codex" of Scripture:
   and after giving precise directions as to pronunciation and
   accentuation, says that the readers were of old called "heralds" (De
   Eccl. Offic., ii., 11).  (b) The Singers are placed by the xliij^rd.
   Apostolic canon between subdeacons and readers, but they rank below
   readers in Laodic., c. 23, in the Liturgy of St. Mark (Hammond, p.
   173), and in the canons wrongly ascribed to a IV^th Council of
   Carthage, which permit a presbyter to appoint a "psalmist" without the
   bishop's knowledge, and rank him even below the doorkeepers (Mansi,

   Canon XV.

   A woman shall not receive the laying on of hands as a deaconess under
   forty years of age, and then only after searching examination.  And if,
   after she has had hands laid on her and has continued for a time to
   minister, she shall despise the grace of God and give herself in
   marriage, she shall be anathematized and the man united to her.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   No person shall be ordained deaconess except she be forty years of
   age.  If she shall dishonour her ministry by contracting a marriage,

   the Excursus on deaconesses to canon xix. of Nice.

   Canon XVI.

   It is not lawful for a virgin who has dedicated herself to the Lord
   God, nor for monks, to marry; and if they are found to have done this,
   let them be excommunicated.  But we decree that in every place the
   bishop shall have the power of indulgence towards them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.

   Monks or nuns shall not contract marriage, and if they do so let them
   be excommunicated.

   Van Espen.

   Since this canon says nothing at all of separation in connexion with a
   marriage made contrary to a vow, but only orders separation from
   communion, it seems very likely that vows of this kind at the time of
   the synod were not considered diriment but only impedient impediments
   from which the bishop of the diocese could dispense at least as far as
   the canonical punishment was concerned.

   Hefele.

   The last part of the canon gives the bishop authority in certain
   circumstances not to inflict the excommunication which is threatened in
   the first part, or again to remove it.  Thus all the old Latin
   translators understood our text; but Dionysius Exiguus and the Prisca
   added confitentibus, meaning, "if such a virgin or monk confess and
   repent their fault, then the bishop may be kind to them."  That the
   marriage of a monk is invalid, as was ruled by later ecclesiastical
   law, our canon does not say; on the contrary, it assumes its validity,
   as also the marriages contracted by priests until the beginning of the
   twelfth century were regarded as valid.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa xxvii., Quæst. I., canon xxii., from Isidore's version;
   it is also found in Dionysius's version as canon xij. of the same
   Quæstio, Causa, and Part, where it is said to be taken "ex Concilio
   Triburiensi."

   Canon XVII.

   Outlying or rural parishes shall in every province remain subject to
   the bishops who now have jurisdiction over them, particularly if the
   bishops have peaceably and continuously governed them for the space of
   thirty years.  But if within thirty years there has been, or is, any
   dispute concerning them, it is lawful for those who hold themselves
   aggrieved to bring their cause before the synod of the province.  And
   if any one be wronged by his metropolitan, let the matter be decided by
   the exarch of the diocese or by the throne of Constantinople, as
   aforesaid.  And if any city has been, or shall hereafter be newly
   erected by imperial authority, let the order of the ecclesiastical
   parishes follow the political and municipal example.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.

   Village and rural parishes if they have been possessed for thirty
   years, they shall so continue.  But if within that time, the matter
   shall be subject to adjudication.  But if by the command of the Emperor
   a city be renewed, the order of ecclesiastical parishes shall follow
   the civil and public forms.

   The adjective enchorious is probably synonymous with agroikikas
   ("rusticas," Prisca), although Dionysius and Isidorian take in as
   "situated on estates," cf. Routh, Scr. Opusc., ii., 109.  It was
   conceivable that some such outlying districts might form,
   ecclesiastically, a border-land, it might not be easy to assign them
   definitively to this or that bishopric.  In such a case, says the
   Council, if the bishop who is now in possession of these rural churches
   can show a prescription of thirty years in favour of his see, let them
   remain undisturbed in his obedience.  (Here abiastos may be illustrated
   from biasamenos in Eph. viij. and for the use of oikonomein see I.
   Const., ij.)  But the border-land might be the "debate-able" land:  the
   two neighbour bishops might dispute as to the right to tend these
   "sheep in the wilderness;" as we read in Cod. Afric., 117, "multæ
   controversiæ postea inter episcopos de dioecesibus ortæ sunt, et
   oriuntur" (see on I. Const., ij.); as archbishop Thomas of York, and
   Remigius of Dorchester, were at issue for years "with reference to
   Lindsey" (Raine, Fasti Eborac., i. 150).  Accordingly, the canon
   provides that if such a contest had arisen within the thirty years, or
   should thereafter arise, the prelate who considered himself wronged
   might appeal to the provincial synod.  If he should be aggrieved at the
   decision of his metropolitan in synod, he might apply for redress to
   the eparch (or prefect, a substitute for exarch) of the "diocese," or
   to the see of Constantinople (in the manner provided by canon ix.).  It
   is curious "that in Russia all the sees are divided into eparchies of
   the first, second, and third class" (Neale, Essays on Liturgiology, p.
   302).

   Canon XVIII.

   The crime of conspiracy or banding together is utterly prohibited even
   by the secular law, and much more ought it to be forbidden in the
   Church of God.  Therefore, if any, whether clergymen or monks, should
   be detected in conspiring or banding together, or hatching plots
   against their bishops or fellow-clergy, they shall by all means be
   deposed from their own rank.

   In order to appreciate this canon, we must consider the case of Ibas
   bishop of Edessa.  He had been attached to the Nestorians, but after
   the reunion between Cyril and John of Antioch had re-entered into
   communion with Cyril on the ground that Cyril had explained his
   anathemas (Mansi, vii., 240), or, as he wrote to Maris (in a letter
   famous as one of the "Three Chapters") that God had "softened the
   Egyptian's heart" (ib., 248).  Four of his priests (Samuel, Cyrus,
   Maras, and Eulegius), stimulated, says Fleury (xxvij. 19) by Uranius
   bishop of Himeria, accused Ibas of Nestorianism before his patriarch
   Domnus of Antioch, who held a synod, but, as Samuel and Cyrus failed to
   appear, pronounced them defaulters and set aside the case (Mansi, vii.
   217).  They went up to Constantinople, and persuaded Theodosius and
   archbishop Flavian to appoint a commission for inquiring into the
   matter.  Two sessions, so to speak, were held by the three prelates
   thus appointed, one at Berytus the other at Tyre.  At Berytus,
   according to the extant minutes (Mansi, vii., 212 ff.), five new
   accusers joined the original four, and charges were brought which
   affected the moral character of Ibas as well as his orthodoxy.  The
   charge of having used a "blasphemous" speech implying that Christ was
   but a man deified, was rebutted by a statement signed by some sixty
   clerics of Edessa, who according to the accusers, had been present when
   Ibas uttered it.  At Tyre the episcopal judges succeeded in making
   peace, and accusers and accused partook of the communion together (ib.,
   vii., 209).  The sequence of these proceedings cannot be thoroughly
   ascertained, but Hefele (sect. 169) agrees with Tillemont (xv., 474 et
   seqq.) in dating the trial at Berytus slightly earlier than that at
   Tyre, and assigning both to the February of 448 or 449.  Fleury inverts
   this order, and thinks that, "notwithstanding the reconciliation" at
   Tyre, the four accusers renewed their prosecution of Ibas (xxvij. 20);
   but he has to suppose two applications on their part to Theodosius and
   Flavian, which seems improbable.  "The Council is believed," says
   Tillemont (xv., 698), "to have had this case in mind when drawing up
   the present canon:"  and one can hardly help thinking that, on a spot
   within sight of Constantinople, they must have recalled the protracted
   sufferings which malignant plotters had inflicted on St. Chrysostom.

   Canon XIX.

   Whereas it has come to our ears that in the provinces the Canonical
   Synods of Bishops are not held, and that on this account many
   ecclesiastical matters which need reformation are neglected; therefore,
   according to the canons of the holy Fathers, the holy Synod decrees
   that the bishops of every province shall twice in the year assemble
   together where the bishop of the Metropolis shall approve, and shall
   then settle whatever matters may have arisen.  And bishops, who do not
   attend, but remain in their own cities, though they are in good health
   and free from any unavoidable and necessary business, shall receive a
   brotherly admonition.

   Notes.

   Twice each year the Synod shall be held whereever the bishop of the

   Hilary of Arles and his suffragans, assembled at Riez, had already, in
   439 qualified the provision for two by adding significantly "if the
   times are quiet" (Mansi, v., 1194).  The words were written at the
   close of ten years' war, during which the Visigoths of Septimania "were
   endeavouring to take Arles and Narbonne" (Hodgkin, Italy and her
   Invaders, ii., 121).

   Canon XX.

   It shall not be lawful, as we have already decreed, for clergymen
   officiating in one church to be appointed to the church of another
   city, but they shall cleave to that in which they were first thought
   worthy to minister; those, however, being excepted, who have been
   driven by necessity from their own country, and have therefore removed
   to another church.  And if, after this decree, any bishop shall receive
   a clergyman belonging to another bishop, it is decreed that both the
   received and the receiver shall be excommunicated until such time as
   the clergyman who has removed shall have returned to his own church.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.

   A clergyman of one city shall not be given a cure in another.  But if
   he has been driven from his native place and shall go into another he
   shall be without blame.  If any bishop receives clergymen from without
   his diocese he shall be excommunicated as well as the cleric he
   receives.

   It is quite doubtful as to what "excommunication" means in this canon,
   probably not anathematism (so think the commentators) but separation
   from the communion of the other bishops, and suspension from the
   performance of clerical functions.

   Bright.

   This canon is the third of those which were originally proposed by
   Marcian in the end of the sixth session, as certain articles for which
   synodical sanction was desirable (see above Canons iij. and iv.).  It
   was after they had been delivered by the Emperor's own hand to
   Anatolius of Constantinople that the Council broke out into plaudits,
   one of which is sufficiently startling, to hierei, to basilei (Mansi,
   vii., 177).  The imperial draft is in this case very slightly altered.
   A reference is made to a previous determination (i.e., canon x.)
   against clerical pluralities, and it is ordered that "clerics
   registered as belonging to one church shall not be ranked as belonging
   to the church of another city, but must be content with the one in
   which they were originally admitted to minister, excepting those who,
   having lost their own country, have been compelled to migrate to
   another church,"--an exception intelligible enough at such a period.
   Eleven years before, the Vandal Gaiseric had expelled the Catholic
   bishops and priests of Western Africa from their churches:
   Quodvultdeus, bishop of Carthage with many of his clergy, had been
   "placed on board some unseaworthy vessels," and yet, "by the Divine
   mercy, had been carried safe to Naples" (Vict. Vitens., De Persec.
   Vandal., i., 5:  he mentions other bishops as driven into exile).
   Somewhat later, the surge of the Hunnish invasion had frightened the
   bishop of Sirmium into sending his church vessels to Attila's Gaulish
   secretary and had swept onward in 447 to within a short distance of the
   "New Rome" (Hodgkin, Italy and her Invaders, ii., 54-56).  And the very
   year of the Council was the most momentous in the whole history of the
   "Barbaric" movement.  The bishops who assembled in October at Chalcedon
   must have heard by that time of the massacre of the Metz clergy on
   Easter Eve, of a bishop of Rheims slain at his own altar, of the
   deliverance of Orleans at the prayer of St. Anianus, of "the supreme
   battle" in the plain of Chalons, which turned back Attila and rescued
   Christian Gaul (Hodgkin, ii., 129-152; Kitchin, Hist. France, i. 61).

   It is curious that the Greek text which Zonaras and Balsamon produce,

   paralambanousin .  Van Espen thinks that the Greek commentators have
   tried without success to attach any meaning to these words, accepting
   the arguments of Bp. Beveridge (which see).  The reading adopted in the
   text does not lack ms. authority, and is the one printed by Justellus
   in his "Codex of the Canons of the Universal Church."

   It has come to the hearing of the holy Synod that certain clergymen and
   monks, having no authority from their own bishop, and sometimes,
   indeed, while under sentence of excommunication by him, betake
   themselves to the imperial Constantinople, and remain there for a long
   time, raising disturbances and troubling the ecclesiastical state, and
   turning men's houses upside down.  Therefore the holy Synod has
   determined that such persons be first notified by the Advocate of the
   most holy Church of Constantinople to depart from the imperial city;
   and if they shall shamelessly continue in the same practices, that they
   shall be expelled by the same Advocate even against their will, and
   return to their own places.

   Monasteries, which have once been consecrated with the consent of the
   bishop, shall remain monasteries for ever, and the property belonging
   to them shall be preserved, and they shall never again become secular
   dwellings.  And they who shall permit this to be done shall be liable
   to ecclesiastical penalties.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIV.

   A monastery erected with the consent of the bishop shall be immovable.
   And whatever pertains to it shall not be alienated.  Whoever shall take
   upon him to do otherwise, shall not be held guiltless.

   Joseph Ægyptius, in turning this into Arabic, reads:  "And whoever
   shall turn any monastery into a dwelling house for himself...let him be
   cursed and anathema."  The curious reader is referred on this whole
   subject to Sir Henry Spelman's History and Fate of Sacrilege, or to the
   more handy book on the subject by James Wayland Joyce, The Doom of
   Sacrilege. [292]

   Bright.

   The secularization of monasteries was an evil which grew with their
   wealth and influence.  At a Council held by the patriarch Photius in
   the Apostles' church at Constantinople, it is complained that some
   persons attach the name of "monastery" to property of their own, and
   while professing to dedicate it to God, write themselves down as lords
   of what has been thus consecrated, and are not ashamed to claim after
   such consecration the same power over it which they had before.  In the
   West, we find this abuse attracting the attention of Gregory the Great,
   who writes to a bishop that "rationalis ordo" would not allow a layman
   to pervert a monastic foundation at will to his own uses (Epist. viii.,
   31).  In ancient Scotland, the occasional dispersion of religious
   communities, and, still more, the clan-principle which assigned
   chieftain-rights over monasteries to the descendants of the founder,
   left at Dunkeld, Brechin, Abernethy, and elsewhere, "nothing but the
   mere name of abbacy applied to the lands, and of abbot borne by the
   secular lord for the time" (Skene's Celtic Scotland, ii., 365; cf.
   Anderson's Scotland in Early Christian Times, p. 235).  So, after the
   great Irish monastery of Bangor in Down was destroyed by the Northmen,
   "non defuit," says St. Bernard, "qui illud teneret cure possessionibus
   suis; nam et constituebantur per electionem etiam, et abbates
   appellabantur, servantes nomine, etsi non re, quod olim exstiterat" (De
   Vita S. Malachiæ, vj.).  So in 1188 Giraldus Cambrensis found a lay
   abbot in possession of the venerable church of Llanbadarn Vawr; a "bad
   custom," he says, "had grown up, whereby powerful laymen, at first
   chosen by the clergy to be "oeconomi" or "patroni et defensores," had
   usurped "totum jus," appropriated the lands, and left to the clergy
   nothing but the altars, with tithes and offerings (Itin. Camb. ii.,
   4).  This abuse must be distinguished from the corrupt device whereby,
   in Bede's later years, Northumbrian nobles contrived to gain for their
   estates the immunities of abbey-lands by professing to found
   monasteries, which they filled with disorderly monks, who lived there
   in contempt of all rule (Bede, Ep. to Egbert, vij.).  In the year of
   his birth, the first English synod had forbidden bishops to despoil
   consecrated monasteries (Bede, iv., 5).

   [292] The reader may like to see the vow on this subject taken by King
   Charles I. of England, and which was made public by Archbishop Sheldon
   after the Restoration.  The vow is as follows: "I do here promise and
   solemnly vow, in the presence and service of Almighty God, that if it
   shall please the Divine Majesty of his infinite goodness to restore me
   to my just Kingly rights, and to re-establish me in my throne, I will
   wholly give back to his Church all those impropriations which are now
   held by the Crown; and what lands soever I do now or should enjoy,
   which have been taken away either from any episcopal see or any
   cathedral or collegiate church, from any abbey or other religious
   house, I likewise promise for hereafter to hold them from the Church
   under such reasonable fines and rents as shall be set down by some
   conscientious persons, whom I propose to choose with all uprightness of
   heart to direct me in this particular.  And I humbly beseech God to
   accept of this my vow, and to bless me in the design I have now in hand
   through Jesus Christ our Lord." "Charles R. "Oxford, April 13, 1646."

   Canon XXV.

   Forasmuch as certain of the metropolitans, as we have heard, neglect
   the flocks committed to them, and delay the ordinations of bishops the
   holy Synod has decided that the ordinations of bishops shall take place
   within three months, unless an inevitable necessity should some time
   require the term of delay to be prolonged.  And if he shall not do
   this, he shall be liable to ecclesiastical penalties, and the income of
   the widowed church shall be kept safe by the steward of the same
   Church.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXV.

   Let the ordination of bishops be within three months:  necessity
   however may make the time longer.  But if anyone shall ordain counter
   to this decree, he shall be liable to punishment.  The revenue shall
   remain with the oeconomus.

   Bright.

   The "Steward of the Church" was to "take care of the revenues of the
   church widowed" by the death of its bishop, who was regarded as
   representing Him to whom the whole Church was espoused (see Eph. v. 23
   ff.).  So in the "order of the holy and great church" of St. Sophia,
   the "Great Steward" is described as "taking the oversight of the
   widowed church" (Goar, Eucholog., p. 269); so Hincmar says:  "Si fuerit
   defunctus episcopus, ego...visitatorem ipsi viduatæ designabo ecclesiæ;
   "and the phrase, "viduata per mortem N. nuper episcopi" became common
   in the West (F. G. Lee, Validity of English Orders, p. 373).  The
   episcopal ring was a symbol of the same idea.  So at St. Chrysostom's
   restoration Eudoxia claimed to have "given back the bridegroom" (Serm.
   post redit., iv.).  So Bishop Wilson told Queen Caroline that he "would
   not leave his wife in his old age because she was poor" (Keble's Life
   of Wilson, ii., 767); and Peter Mongus, having invaded the Alexandrian
   see while its legitimate occupant, Timothy Salophaciolus, was alive,
   was expelled as an "adulterer" (Liberatus, Breviar., xviij.).

   Canon XXVI.

   Forasmuch as we have heard that in certain churches the bishops managed
   the church-business without stewards, it has seemed good that every
   church having a bishop shall have also a steward from among its own
   clergy, who shall manage the church business under the sanction of his
   own bishop; that so the administration of the church may not be without
   a witness; and that thus the goods of the church may not be squandered,
   nor reproach be brought upon the priesthood; and if he [i.e., the
   Bishop] will not do this, he shall be subjected to the divine canons.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVI.

   The OEconomus in all churches must be chosen from the clergy.  And the
   bishop who neglects to do this is not without blame.

   Bright.

   As the stream of offerings became fuller, the work of dispensing them
   became more complex, until the archdeacons could no longer find time
   for it, and it was committed to a special officer called "oeconomus" or
   steward (Bingham, iii, 12, 1; Transl. of Fleury, iii., 120).  So the
   Council of Gangra, in the middle of the fourth century, forbids the
   church offerings to be disposed of without consent of the bishop or of
   the person appointed, eis oikonomian eupoiias (canon viij.); and St.
   Basil mentions the oeconomi of his own church (Epist., xxiij. 1), and
   the "tamiai of the sacred goods" of his brother's at Nyssa (ib., 225).
   And although Gregory Nazianzen took credit to himself for declining to
   appoint a "stranger" to make an estimate of the property which of right
   belonged to the church of Constantinople, and in fact, with a strange
   confusion between personal and official obligations, gave the go-by to
   the whole question (Carm. de Vita sua, 1479 ff.), his successor,
   Nectarius, being a man of business, took care to appoint a
   "church-steward"; and Chrysostom, on coming to the see, examined his
   accounts, and found much superfluous expenditure (Palladius, Dial, p.
   19).  Theophilus of Alexandria compelled two of the Tall Brothers to
   undertake the oikonomia of the Alexandrian church (Soc., vi. 7); and in
   one of his extant directions observes that the clergy of Lyco wish for
   another "oeconomus," and that the bishop has consented, in order that
   the church-funds may be properly spent (Mansi, iii., 1257).  At Hippo
   St. Augustine had a "præpositus domus" who acted as Church-steward
   (Possidius, Vit. August., xxiv.).  Isidore of Pelusium denounces
   Martinianus as a fraudulent "oeconomus," and requests Cyril to appoint
   an upright one (Epist. ii., 127), and in another letter urges him to
   put a stop to the dishonest greed of those who acted as stewards of the
   same church (ib., v. 79).  The records of the Council of Ephesus
   mention the "oeconomus" of Constantinople, the "oeconomus" of Ephesus
   (Mansi, iv., 1228-1398), and, the "oeconomus" of Philadelphia.
   According to an extant letter of Cyril, the "oeconomi" of Perrha in
   Syria were mistrusted by the clergy, who wished to get rid of them "and
   appoint others by their own authority" (ib., vii., 321).  Ibas of
   Edessa had been complained of for his administration of church
   property; he was accused, e.g., of secreting a jewelled chalice, and
   bestowing the church revenues, and gold and silver crosses, on his
   brother and cousins; he ultimately undertook to appoint "oeconomi"
   after the model of Antioch (Mansi, vii., 201).  Proterius, afterwards
   patriarch of Alexandria and a martyr for Chalcedonian orthodoxy, was
   "oeconomus" under Dioscorus (ib., iv., 1017), as was John Talaia, a man
   accused of bribery, under his successor (Evag., iii., 12).  There may
   have been many cases in which there was no "oeconomus," or in which the
   management was in the hands of private agents of the bishop, in whom
   the Church could put no confidence; and the Council, having alluded to
   the office of "oeconomus" in canons ij. and xxv., now observes that
   some bishops had been managing their church property without
   "oeconomi," and thereupon resolves "that every church which has a
   bishop shall also have an oeconomus" from among its own clergy, to
   administer the property of the church under the direction of its own
   bishop; so that the administration of the church property may not be
   unattested, and thereby waste ensue, and the episcopate incur
   reproach."  Any bishop who should neglect to appoint such an officer
   should be punishable under "the divine" (or sacred) "canons."

   Nearly three years after the Council, Leo saw reason for requesting
   Marcian not to allow civil judges, "novo exemplo," to audit the
   accounts of "the oeconomi of the church of Constantinople," which
   ought, "secundum traditum morem," to be examined by the bishop alone
   (Epist. cxxxvij. 2).  In after days the "great steward" of St. Sophia
   was always a deacon; he was a conspicuous figure at the Patriarch's
   celebrations, standing on the right of the altar, vested in alb and
   stole, and holding the sacred fan (rhipidion); his duty was to enter
   all incomings and outgoings of the church's revenue in a charterlary,
   and exhibit it quarterly, or half yearly, to the patriarchs; and he
   governed the church during a vacancy of the see (Eucholog., pp. 268,
   275).  In the West, Isidore of Seville describes the duties of the
   "oeconomus"; he has to see to the repair and building of churches, the
   care of church lands, the cultivation of vineyards, the payment of
   clerical stipends, of doles to the widows and the poor, and of food and
   clothing to church servants, and even the carrying on of church law
   suits,--all "cum jussu et arbitrio sui episcopi" (Ep. to Leudefred, Op.
   ii., 520); and before Isidore's death the IV^th Council of Toledo
   refers to this canon, and orders the bishops to appoint "from their own
   clergy those whom the Greeks call oeconomi, hoc est, qui vici
   episcoporum res ecclesiasticas tractant (canon xlviij., Mansi, x, 631).
    There was an officer named "oeconomus" in the old Irish monasteries;
   see Reeves' edition of Adamnan, p. 47.

   This Canon is found twice in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's
   Decretum, Pars II., Causa XVI., Q. VII, Canon xxi., and again in Pars
   I., Dist. LXXXIX., c. iv. [294]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Hefele give this reference incorrectly, and each makes the error,
   giving Dist. lxxix. instead of lxxxix.

   Canon XXVII.

   The holy Synod has decreed that those who forcibly carry off women
   under pretence of marriage, and the aiders or abettors of such
   ravishers, shall be degraded if clergymen, and if laymen be
   anathematized.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVII.

   If a clergyman elope with a woman, let him be expelled from the
   Church.  If a layman, let him be anathema.  The same shall be the lot
   of any that assist him.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa XXXVI., Q. II., canon j.

   In many old collections this is the last canon of this Council, e.g.,
   Dionysius Exiguus, Isidore, the Prisca, the Greek by John of Antioch,
   and the Arabic by Joseph Ægyptius.  The reader familiar with the
   subject will have but little difficulty in explaining to his own
   satisfaction the omission of canon xxviij. in these instances.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXVIII.

   Following in all things the decisions of the holy Fathers, and
   acknowledging the canon, which has been just read, of the One Hundred
   and Fifty Bishops beloved-of-God (who assembled in the imperial city of
   Constantinople, which is New Rome, in the time of the Emperor
   Theodosius of happy memory), we also do enact and decree the same
   things concerning the privileges of the most holy Church of
   Constantinople, which is New Rome.  For the Fathers rightly granted
   privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal city.
   And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by the
   same consideration, gave equal privileges (isa presbeia) to the most
   holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured
   with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with
   the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be
   magnified as she is, and rank next after her; so that, in the Pontic,
   the Asian, and the Thracian dioceses, the metropolitans only and such
   bishops also of the Dioceses aforesaid as are among the barbarians,
   should be ordained by the aforesaid most holy throne of the most holy
   Church of Constantinople; every metropolitan of the aforesaid dioceses,
   together with the bishops of his province, ordaining his own provincial
   bishops, as has been declared by the divine canons; but that, as has
   been above said, the metropolitans of the aforesaid Dioceses should be
   ordained by the archbishop of Constantinople, after the proper
   elections have been held according to custom and have been reported to
   him.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVIII.

   The bishop of New Rome shall enjoy the same honour as the bishop of Old
   Rome, on account of the removal of the Empire.  For this reason the
   [metropolitans] of Pontus, of Asia, and of Thrace, as well as the
   Barbarian bishops shall be ordained by the bishop of Constantinople.

   Van Espen.

   It is certain that this canon was expressly renewed by canon xxxvi. of
   the Council of Trullo and from that time has been numbered by the
   Greeks among the canons; and at last it was acknowledged by some Latin
   collectors also, and was placed by Gratian in his Decretum, although
   clearly with a different sense.  (Pars I., Dist. xxii., C. vj.)

   Bright.

   Here is a great addition to the canon of 381, so ingeniously linked on
   to it as to seem at first sight a part of it.  The words kai hoste are
   meant to suggest that what follows is in fact involved in what has
   preceded:  whereas a new point of departure is here taken, and instead
   of a mere "honorary pre-eminence" the bishop of Constantinople acquires
   a vast jurisdiction, the independent authority of three exarchs being
   annulled in order to make him patriarch.  Previously he had proedria
   now he gains prostasia.  As we have seen, a series of aggrandizements
   in fact had prepared for this aggrandizement in law; and various
   metropolitans of Asia Minor expressed their contentment at seeing it
   effected.  "It is, indeed, more than probable that the self-assertion
   of Rome excited the jealousy of her rival of the East," and thus
   "Eastern bishops secretly felt that the cause of Constantinople was
   theirs" (Gore's Leo the Great, p. 120); but the gratification of
   Constantinople ambition was not the less, in a canonical sense, a
   novelty, and the attempt to enfold it in the authority of the Council
   of 381 was rather astute than candid.  The true plea, whatever might be
   its value, was that the Council had to deal with a fait accompli, which
   it was wise at once to legalize and to regulate; that the "boundaries
   of the respective exarchates...were ecclesiastical arrangements made
   with a view to the general good and peace of the Church, and liable to
   vary with the dispensations to which the Church was providentially
   subjected," so that "by confirming the ek pollou kratesan ethos in
   regard to the ordination of certain metropolitans (see Ep. of Council
   to Leo, Leon. Epist. xcviij., 4), "they were acting in the spirit,
   while violating the letter, of the ever-famous rule of Nicæa, ta
   archeia ethe krateito (cp. Newman, Transl. of Fleury, iii., 407).  It
   is observable that Aristenus [295] and Symeon, Logothetes reckon this
   decree as a XXIX^th canon (Justellus, ii., 694, 720).

   After the renewal of this canon by the Council of Trullo, Gratian adds
   "The VIII^th Synod held under Pope Hadrian II., canon xxj."  (Decretum
   Pars I., Dist. xxij., C. vij.)  "We define that no secular power shall
   hereafter dishonour anyone of these who rule our patriarchal sees, or
   attempt to move them from their proper throne, but shall judge them
   worthy of all reverence and honour; chiefly the most holy Pope of Old
   Rome, and then the Patriarch of Constantinople, and then those of
   Alexandria, and Antioch, and Jerusalem."

   Some Greek codices have the following heading to this canon.

   "Decree of the same holy Synod published on account of the privileges
   of the throne of the most holy Church of Constantinople."

   Tillemont.

   This canon seems to recognise no particular authority in the Church of
   Rome, save what the Fathers had granted it, as the seat of the empire.
   And it attributes in plain words as much to Constantinople as to Rome,
   with the exception of the first place.  Nevertheless I do not observe
   that the Popes took up a thing so injurious to their dignity, and of so
   dangerous a consequence to the whole Church.  For what Lupus quotes of
   St. Leo's lxxviij. (civ.) letter, refers rather to Alexandria and to
   Antioch, than to Rome.  St. Leo is contented to destroy the foundation
   on which they built the elevation of Constantinople, maintaining that a
   thing so entirely ecclesiastical as the episcopate ought not to be
   regulated by the temporal dignity of cities, which, nevertheless, has
   been almost always followed in the establishment of the metropolis,
   according to the Council of Nicea.

   St. Leo also complains that the Council of Chalcedon broke the decrees
   of the Council of Nice, the practice of antiquity, and the rights of
   Metropolitans.  Certainly it was an odious innovation to see a Bishop
   made the chief, not of one department but of three; for which no
   example could be found save in the authority which the Popes took over
   Illyricum, where, however, they did not claim the power to ordain any
   Bishop.

   Excursus on the Later History of Canon XXVIII.

   Among the bishops who gave their answers at the last session to the
   question whether their subscription to the canons was voluntary or
   forced was Eusebius, bishop of Dorylæum, an Asiatic bishop who said
   that he had read the Constantinopolitan canon to "the holy pope of Rome
   in presence of clerics of Constantinople, and that he had accepted it"
   (L. and C., Conc., iv. 815).  But quite possibly this evidence is of
   little value.  But what is more to the point is that the Papal legates
   most probably had already at this very council recognized the right of
   Constantinople to rank immediately after Rome.  For at the very first
   session when the Acts of the Latrocinium were read, it was found that
   to Flavian, the Archbishop of Constantinople, was given only the fifth
   place.  Against this the bishop protested and asked, "Why did not
   Flavian receive his position?" and the papal legate Paschasinus
   answered:  "We will, please God, recognize the present bishop Anatolius
   of Constantinople as the first [i.e. after us], but Dioscorus made
   Flavian the fifth."  It would seem to be in vain to attempt to escape
   the force of these words by comparing with them the statement made in
   the last session, in a moment of heat and indignation, by Lucentius the
   papal legate, that the canons of Constantinople were not found among
   those of the Roman Code.  It may well be that this statement was true,
   and yet it does not in any way lessen the importance of the fact that
   at the first session (a very different thing from the sixteenth)
   Paschasinus had admitted that Constantinople enjoyed the second place.
   It would seem that Quesnel has proved his point, notwithstanding the
   attempts of the Ballerini to counteract and overthrow his arguments.

   It would be the height of absurdity for any one to attempt to deny that
   the canon of Constantinople was entirely in force and practical
   execution, as far of those most interested were concerned, long before
   the meeting of the council of Chalcedon, and in 394, only thirteen
   years after the adoption of the canon, we find the bishop of
   Constantinople presiding at a synod at which both the bishop of
   Alexandria and the bishop of Antioch were present.

   St. Leo made, in connexion with this matter, some statements which
   perhaps need not be commented upon, but should certainly not be
   forgotten.  In his epistle to Anatolius (no. cvi.) in speaking of the
   third canon of Constantinople he says:  "That document of certain
   bishops has never been brought by your predecessors to the knowledge of
   the Apostolic See."  And in writing to the Empress (Ep. cv., ad Pulch.)
   he makes the following statement, strangely contrary to what she at
   least knew to be the fact, "To this concession a long course of years
   has given no effect!"

   We need not stop to consider the question why Leo rejected the
   xxviij^th canon of Chalcedon.  It is certain that he rejected it and
   those who wish to see the motive of this rejection considered at length
   are referred to Quesnel and to the Ballerini; the former affirming that
   it was because of its encroachments upon the prerogatives of his own
   see, the latter urging that it was only out of his zeal for the keeping
   in full force of the Nicene decree.

   Leo can never be charged with weakness.  His rejection of the canon was
   absolute and unequivocal.  In writing to the Emperor he says that
   Anatolius only got the See of Constantinople by his consent, that he
   should behave himself modestly, and that there is no way he can make of
   Constantinople "an Apostolic See," and adds that "only from love of
   peace and for the restoration of the unity of the faith" he has
   "abstained from annulling this ordination" (Ep. civ.).

   To the Empress he wrote with still greater violence:  "As for the
   resolution of the bishops which is contrary to the Nicene decree, in
   union with your faithful piety, I declare it to be invalid and annul it
   by the authority of the holy Apostle Peter" (Ep. cv.).

   The papal annulling does not appear to have been of much force, for Leo
   himself confesses, in a letter written about a year later to the
   Empress Pulcheria (Ep. cxvi.), that the Illyrian bishops had since the
   council subscribed the xxviii^th canon.

   The pope had taken occasion in his letter in which he announced his
   acceptance of the doctrinal decrees of Chalcedon to go on further and
   express his rejection of the canons.  This part of the letter was left
   unread throughout the Greek empire, and Leo complains of it to Julian
   of Cos (Ep. cxxvij.).

   Leo never gave over his opposition, although the breach was made up
   between him and Anatolius by an apparently insincere letter on the part
   of the latter (Ep. cxxxii.).  Leo's successors followed his example in
   rejecting the canons, both the IIId of Constantinople and the XXVIII^th
   of Chalcedon, but as M. l'abbé Duchesne so admirably says:  "Mais leur
   voix fut peu écoutée; on leur accorda sans doute des satisfactions,
   mais de pure cérémonie." [296]   But Justinian acknowledged the
   Constantinopolitan and Chalcedonian rank of Constantinople in his
   CXXXI^st Novel. (cap. j.), and the Synod in Trullo in canon xxxvj.
   renewed exactly canon xxviij. of Chalcedon.  Moreover the Seventh
   Ecumenical with the approval of the Papal Legates gave a general
   sanction to all the canons accepted by the Trullan Synod.  And finally
   in 1215 the Fourth Council of the Lateran in its Vth Canon acknowledged
   Constantinople's rank as immediately after Rome, but this was while
   Constantinople was in the hands of the Latins!  Subsequently at
   Florence the second rank, in accordance with the canons of I.
   Constantinople and of Chalcedon (which had been annulled by Leo) was
   given to the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople, and so the opposition
   of Rome gave way after seven centuries and a half, and the Nicene Canon
   which Leo declared to be "inspired by the Holy Ghost" and "valid to the
   end of time" (Ep. cvi.), was set at nought by Leo's successor in the
   Apostolic See.

   From the Acts of the same Holy Synod concerning Photius, Bishop of
   Tyre, and Eustathius, Bishop of Berytus.

   The most magnificent and glorious judges said:

   What is determined by the Holy Synod [in the matter of the Bishops
   ordained by the most religious Bishop Photius, but removed by the most
   religious Bishop Eustathius and ordered to be Presbyters after (having
   held) the Episcopate]?

   The most religious Bishops Paschasinus and Lucentius, and the Priest
   Boniface, representatives of the Church [297] of Rome, said:

   Canon XXIX.

   It is sacrilege to degrade a bishop to the rank of a presbyter; but, if
   they are for just cause removed from episcopal functions, neither ought
   they to have the position of a Presbyter; and if they have been
   displaced without any charge, they shall be restored to their episcopal
   dignity.

   And Anatolius, the most reverend Archbishop of Constantinople, said:
   If those who are alleged to have been removed from the episcopal
   dignity to the order of presbyter, have indeed been condemned for any
   sufficient causes, clearly they are not worthy of the honour of a
   presbyter.  But if they have been forced down into the lower rank
   without just cause, they are worthy, if they appear guiltless, to
   receive again both the dignity and priesthood of the Episcopate.

   And all the most reverend Bishops cried out:

   The judgment of the Fathers is right.  We all say the same.  The
   Fathers have righteously decided.  Let the sentence of the Archbishops
   prevail.

   And the most magnificent and glorious judges said:

   Let the pleasure of the Holy Synod be established for all time.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIX.

   He is sacrilegious who degrades a bishop to the rank of a presbyter.
   For he that is guilty of crime is unworthy of the priesthood.  But he
   that was deposed without cause, let him be [still] bishop.

   What precedes and follows the so-called canon is abbreviated from the
   IV^th Session of the Council (L. and C., Conc., Tom. IV., col. 550).  I
   have followed a usual Greek method of printing it.

   Hefele.

   This so-called canon is nothing but a verbal copy of a passage from the
   minutes of the fourth session in the matter of Photius of Tyre and
   Eustathius of Berytus.  Moreover, it does not possess the peculiar form
   which we find in all the genuine canons of Chalcedon, and in almost all
   ecclesiastical canons in general; on the contrary, there adheres to it
   a portion of the debate, of which it is a fragment, in which Anatolius
   is introduced as speaking.  Besides it is wanting in all the old Greek,
   as well as in the Latin collections of canons, and in those of John of
   Antioch and of Photius, and has only been appended to the twenty-eight
   genuine canons of Chalcedon from the fact that a later transcriber
   thought fit to add to the genuine canons the general and important
   principle contained in the place in question of the fourth session.
   Accordingly, this so-called canon is certainly an ecclesiastical rule
   declared at Chalcedon, and in so far a kanon, but it was not added as a
   canon proper to the other twenty-eight by the Synod.

   From the Fourth Session of the same Holy Synod, having reference to the
   matter of the Egyptian Bishops.

   The most magnificent and glorious judges, and the whole Senate, said:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXX.

   Since the most religious bishops of Egypt have postponed for the
   present their subscription to the letter of the most holy Archbishop
   Leo, not because they oppose the Catholic Faith, but because they
   declare that it is the custom in the Egyptian diocese to do no such
   thing without the consent and order of their Archbishop, and ask to be
   excused until the ordination of the new bishop of the metropolis of
   Alexandria, it has seemed to us reasonable and kind that this
   concession should be made to them, they remaining in their official
   habit in the imperial city until the Archbishop of the Metropolis of
   Alexandria shall have been ordained.

   And the most religious Bishop Paschasinus, representative of the
   Apostolic throne for Rome [298] ], said:

   If your authority suggests and commands that any indulgence be shewn to
   them, let them give securities that they will not depart from this city
   until the city of Alexandria receives a Bishop.

   And the most magnificent and glorious judges, and the whole Senate,
   said:

   Let the sentence of the most holy Paschasinus be confirmed.

   And therefore let them [i.e., the most religious Bishops of the
   Egyptians] remain in their official habit, either giving securities, if
   they can, or being bound by the obligation of an oath.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXX.

   It is the custom of the Egyptians that none subscribe [299] without the
   permission of their Archbishop.  Wherefore they are not to be blamed
   who did not subscribe the Epistle of the holy Leo until an Archbishop
   had been appointed for them.

   As in the case of the last so-called "canon" I have followed a usual
   Greek method, the wording departs but little from that of the acts
   (Vide L. and C., Conc., Tom. IV., col. 517).

   Hefele.

   This paragraph, like the previous one, is not a proper canon, but a
   verbal repetition of a proposal made in the fourth session by the
   imperial commissioners, improved by the legate Paschasinus, and
   approved by the Synod.  Moreover, this so-called canon is not found in
   the ancient collections, and was probably added to the twenty-eight
   canons in the same manner and for the same reasons as the preceding.

   Bright.

   The council could insist with all plainness on the duty of hearing
   before condemning (see on Canon XXIX.); yet on this occasion bishop
   after bishop gave vent to harsh unfeeling absolutism, the only excuse
   for which consists in the fact that the outrages of the Latrocinium
   were fresh in their minds, and that three of the Egyptian supplicants,
   whom they were so eager to terrify or crush, had actually supported
   Dioscorus on the tragical August 8, 449.  It was not in human nature to
   forget this; but the result is a blot on the history of the Council of
   Chalcedon.

   Session XVI.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 794.)

   Paschasinus and Lucentius, the most reverend bishops, holding the place
   of the Apostolic See, said:  If your magnificence so orders, we have
   something to lay before you.

   The most glorious judges, said:  Say what you wish.  The most holy
   Paschasinus the bishop, holding the place of Rome, said:  The rulers of
   the world, taking care of the holy Catholic faith, by which their
   kingdom and glory is increased, have deigned to define this, in order
   that unity through a holy peace may be preserved through all the
   churches.  But with still greater care their clemency has vouchsafed to
   provide for the future, so that no contention may spring up again
   between God's bishops, nor any schisms, nor any scandal.  But yesterday
   after your excellencies and our humility had left, it is said that
   certain decrees were made, which we esteem to have been done contrary
   to the canons, and contrary to ecclesiastical discipline.  We request
   that your magnificence order these things to be read, that all the
   brethren may know whether the things done are just or unjust.

   The most glorious judges said:  If anything was done after our leaving
   let it be read.

   And before the reading, Aëtius, the Archdeacon of the Church of
   Constantinople said:  It is certain that the matters touching the faith
   received a suitable form.  But it is customary at synods, after those
   things which are chiefest of all shall have been defined, that other
   things also which are necessary should be examined and put into shape.
   We have, I mean the most holy Church of Constantinople has, manifestly
   things to be attended to.  We asked the lord bishops (kuriois tois
   episkopois) from Rome, to join with us in these matters, but they
   declined, saying they had received no instructions on the subject.  We
   referred the matter to your magnificence and you bid the holy Synod to
   consider this very point.  And when your magnificence had gone forth,
   as the affair was one of common interest, the most holy bishops,
   standing up, prayed that this thing might be done.  And they were
   present here, and this was done in no hidden nor secret fashion, but in
   due course and in accordance with the canons.

   The most glorious judges said:  Let the acts be read.

   [ The canon (number XXVIII.), was then read, and the signatures, in all
   192, including the bishops of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Heraclea, but not
   Thalassius of Cæsarea who afterwards assented.  Only a week before
   350had signed the Definition of faith.  When the last name was read a
   debate arose as follows.  (Col. 810.).]

   Lucentius, the most reverend bishop and legate of the Apostolic See,
   said:  In the first place let your excellency notice that it was
   brought to pass by circumventing the holy bishops so that they were
   forced to sign the as yet unwritten canons, of which they made
   mention.  [The Greek reads a little differently (I have followed the
   Latin as it is supposed by the critics to be more pure than the Greek
   we now have):  Your excellency has perceived how many things were done
   in the presence of the bishops, in order that no one might be forced to
   sign the aforementioned canons; defining by necessity.]

   The most reverend bishops cried out:  No one was forced.

   Lucentius the most reverend bishop and legate of the Apostolic See,
   said:  It is manifest that the decrees of the 318 have been put aside,
   and that mention only has been made of those of the 150, which are not
   found to have any place in the synodical canons, and which were made as
   they acknowledge eighty years ago.  If therefore they enjoyed this
   privilege during these years, what do they seek for now?  If they never
   used it, why seek it?  [The Greek reads:  "It is manifest that the
   present decrees have been added to the decrees of the 318 and to those
   of the 150 after them, decrees not received into the synodical canons,
   these things they pretend to be defined.  If therefore in these times
   they used this benefit what now do they seek which according to the
   canons they had not used?]

   Aëtius, the archdeacon of the most holy Church of Constantinople,
   said:  If on this subject they had received any commands, let them be
   brought forward.

   Bonifacius, a presbyter and vicar of the Apostolic See, said:  The most
   blessed and Apostolic Pope, among other things, gave us this
   commandment.  And he read from the chart, "The rulings of the holy
   fathers shall with no rashness be violated or diminished.  Let the
   dignity of our person in all ways be guarded by you.  And if any,
   influenced by the power of his own city, should undertake to make
   usurpations, withstand this with suitable firmness."

   The most glorious judges said:  Let each party quote the canons.

   ------------------------

   Paschasinus, the most reverend bishop and representative, read:  Canon
   Six of the 318 holy fathers, "The Roman Church hath always had the
   primacy.  Let Egypt therefore so hold itself that the bishop of
   Alexandria have the authority over all, for this is also the custom as
   regards the bishop of Rome.  So too at Antioch and in the other
   provinces let the churches of the larger cities have the primacy.  [In
   the Greek let the primacy be kept to the churches;' a sentence which I
   do not understand, unless it means that for the advantage of the
   churches the primatial rights of Antioch must be upheld.  But such a
   sentiment one would expect to find rather in the Latin than in the
   Greek.]  And one thing is abundantly clear, that if any one shall have
   been ordained bishop contrary to the will of the metropolitan, this
   great synod has decreed that such an one ought not to be bishop.  If
   however the judgment of all his own [fellows] is reasonable and
   according to the canons, and if two or three dissent through their own
   obstinacy, then let the vote of the majority prevail.  For a custom has
   prevailed, and it is an ancient tradition, that the bishop of Jerusalem
   be honoured, let him have his consequent honour, but the rights of his
   own metropolis must be preserved."

   Constantine, the secretary, read from a book handed him by Aëtius, the
   archdeacon; Canon Six of the 318 holy Fathers. "Let the ancient customs
   prevail, those of Egypt, so that the bishop of Alexandria shall have
   jurisdiction over all, since this also is the custom at Rome.  Likewise
   at Antioch and in the rest of the provinces, let the rank (presbeia) be
   preserved to the churches.  For this is absolutely clear that if anyone
   contrary to the will of the metropolitan be ordained bishop, such an
   one the great synod decreed should not be a bishop.  If however by the
   common vote of all, founded upon reason, and according to the canons,
   two or three moved by their own obstinacy, make opposition, let the
   vote of the majority stand."

   The same secretary read from the same codex the determination of the
   Second Synod.  "These things the bishops decreed who assembled by the
   grace of God in Constantinople from far separated provinces,...and
   bishops are not to go to churches which are outside the bounds of their
   dioceses, nor to confound the churches, but according to the canons the
   bishop of Alexandria shall take the charge of the affairs of Egypt
   only, and the bishops of Orient shall govern the Oriental diocese only,
   the honours due to the Church of Antioch being guarded according to the
   Nicene canons, and the Asiatic bishops shall care for the diocese of
   Asia only, and those of Pontus the affairs of Pontus only, and those of
   Thrace the affairs of Thrace only.  But bishops shall not enter
   uncalled another diocese for ordination, or any other ecclesiastical
   function.  And the aforesaid canon concerning dioceses being observed,
   it is evident that the synod of every province will administer the
   affairs of that particular province as was decreed at Nice.  But the
   churches of God in heathen nations must be governed according to the
   custom which has prevailed from the times of the Fathers.  The bishop
   of Constantinople however shall have the prerogative of honour next
   after the bishop of Rome, because Constantinople is new Rome."

   Notes.

   An attempt has been made to shew that this statement of the acts is a
   mere blunder.  That no correct copy of the Nicene canons was read, and
   that the council accepted the version produced by the Roman legate as
   genuine.  The proposition appears to me in itself ridiculous, and taken
   in connexion with the fact that the acts shew that the true canon of
   Nice was read immediately afterwards I cannot think the hypothesis
   really worthy of serious consideration.  But it is most ably defended
   by the Ballerini in their edition of St. Leo's works (Tom. iii., p.
   xxxvij. et seqq.) and Hefele seems to have accepted their conclusions
   (Vol. III., p. 435).  Bright, however, I think, takes a most just view
   of the case, whom I therefore quote.

   Bright.

   If we place ourselves for a moment in the position of the ecclesiastics
   of Constantinople when they heard Paschasinus read his "version," which
   the Ballerini gently describe as "differing a little" from the Greek
   text, we shall see that it was simply impossible for them not to quote
   that text as it was preserved in their archives, and had been correctly
   translated by Philo and Evarestus in their version beginning "Antiqui
   mores obtineant."  No comment on the difference between it and the
   Roman "version" is recorded to have been made:  and, in truth, none was
   necessary.  Simply to confront the two, and pass on to the next point,
   was to confute Paschasinus at once most respectfully and most
   expressively.

   It should be added that the Ballerini ground their theory chiefly upon
   the authority of a Latin ms., the Codex Julianus, now called
   Parisiensis, in which this reading of the true text of the canon of
   Nice is not contained, as Baluzius was the first to point out.

   ------------------------

   The most glorious judges said:  Let the most holy Asiatic and Pontic
   bishops who have signed the tome just read say whether they gave their
   signatures of their own judgment or compelled by any necessity.  And
   when these were come into the midst, the most reverend Diogenes, the
   bishop of Cyzicum, said:  I call God to witness that I signed of my own
   judgment.  [And so on, one after the other.]

   The rest cried out:  We signed willingly.

   The most glorious judges said:  As it is manifest that the subscription
   of each one of the bishops was given without any necessity but of his
   own will, let the most holy bishops who have not signed say something.

   Eusebius, the bishop of Ancyra, said:  I am about to speak but for
   myself alone.

   [His speech is a personal explanation of his own action with regard to
   consecrating a bishop for Gangra.]

   The most glorious judges said:  From what has been done and brought
   forward on each side, we perceive that the primacy of all (pro panton
   ta proteia) and the chief honour (ten exaireton timen) according to the
   canons, is to be kept for the most God-beloved archbishop of Old Rome,
   but that the most reverend archbishop of the royal city Constantinople,
   which is new Rome, is to enjoy the honour of the same primacy, and to
   have the power to ordain the metropolitans in the Asiatic, Pontic, and
   Thracian dioceses, in this manner:  that there be elected by the
   clergy, and substantial (ktetoron) and most distinguished men of each
   metropolis and moreover by all the most reverend bishops of the
   province, or a majority of them, and that he be elected whom those
   afore mentioned shall deem worthy of the metropolitan episcopate and
   that he should be presented by all those who had elected him to the
   most holy archbishop of royal Constantinople, that he might be asked
   whether he [i.e., the Patriarch of Constantinople] willed that he
   should there be ordained, or by his commission in the province where he
   received the vote to the episcopate.  The most reverend bishops of the
   ordinary towns should be ordained by all the most reverend bishops of
   the province or by a majority of them, the metropolitan having his
   power according to the established canon of the fathers, and making
   with regard to such ordinations no communications to the most holy
   archbishop of royal Constantinople.  Thus the matter appears to us to
   stand.  Let the holy Synod vouchsafe to teach its view of the case.

   The most reverend bishops cried out:  This is a just sentence.  So we
   all say.  These things please us all.  This is a just determination.
   Establish the proposed form of decree.  This is a just vote.  All has
   been decreed as should be.  We beg you to let us go.  By the safety of
   the Emperor let us go.  We all will remain in this opinion, we all say
   the same things.

   Lucentius, the bishop, said:  The Apostolic See gave orders that all
   things should be done in our presence [This sentence reads in the
   Latin:  The Apostolic See ought not to be humiliated in our presence.
   I do not know why Canon Bright in his notes on Canon XXVIII. has
   followed this reading]; and therefore whatever yesterday was done to
   the prejudice of the canons during our absence, we beseech your
   highness to command to be rescinded.  But if not, let our opposition be
   placed in the minutes, and pray let us know clearly [Lat. that we may
   know] what we are to report to that most apostolic bishop who is the
   ruler of the whole church, so that he may be able to take action with
   regard to the indignity done to his See and to the setting at naught of
   the canons.

   [John, the most reverend bishop of Sebaste, said:  We all will remain
   of the opinion expressed by your magnificence. [300] ]

   The most glorious judges said:  The whole synod has approved what we
   proposed.

   (Hist. Counc., Vol. III., p. 428.)

   That is, the prerogative assigned to the Church of Constantinople is,
   in spite of the opposition of the Roman legate decreed by the Synod.
   Thus ended the Council of Chalcedon after it had lasted three weeks.

   How it is possible after reading the foregoing proceedings to imagine
   for an instant that the bishops of this Council considered the rights
   they were discussing to be of Divine origin, and that the occupant of
   the See of Rome was, jure divino, supreme over all pontiffs I cannot
   understand.  It is quite possible, of course, to affirm, as some have
   done, that the acts, as we have them, have been mutilated, but the
   contention involves not only many difficulties but also no few
   absurdities; and yet I cannot but think that even this extreme
   hypothesis is to be preferred to any attempt to reconcile the acts as
   we now have them with the acceptance on the part of the members of the
   council of the doctrine of a jure divino Papal Supremacy as it is now
   held by the Latin Church.

   Historical Introduction.

   (Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. IV., p. 289.)

   In accordance with the imperial command, but without the assent of the
   Pope, the synod was opened on the 5th of May a.d. 553, in the
   Secretarium of the Cathedral Church at Constantinople.  Among those
   present were the Patriarchs, Eutychius of Constantinople, who presided,
   Apollinaris of Alexandria, Domninus of Antioch, three bishops as
   representatives of the Patriarch Eustochius of Jerusalem, and 145 other
   metropolitans and bishops, of whom many came also in the place of
   absent colleagues.

   (Bossuet, Def. Cleri Gall., Lib. vii., cap. xix.  Abridged.
   Translation by Allies.)

   The three chapters were the point in question; that is, respecting
   Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret's writings against Cyril, and the
   letter of Ibas of Edessa to Maris the Persian.  They examined whether
   that letter had been approved in the Council of Chalcedon.  So much was
   admitted that it had been read there, and that Ibas, after
   anathematizing Nestorius, had been received by the holy Council.  Some
   contended that his person only was spared; others that his letter also
   was approved.  Thus inquiry was made at the fifth Council how the
   writings on the Faith were wont to be approved in former Councils.  The
   Acts of the third and fourth Council, those which we have mentioned
   above respecting the letter of St. Cyril and of St. Leo, were set
   forth.  Then the holy Council declared:  "It is plain, from what has
   been recited, in what manner the holy Councils are wont to approve what
   is brought before them.  For great as was the dignity of those holy men
   who wrote the letters recited, yet they did not approve their letters
   simply or without inquiry, nor without taking cognizance that they were
   in all things agreeable to the exposition and doctrine of the holy
   Fathers, with which they were compared."  But the Acts proved that this
   course was not pursued in the case of the letter of Ibas; they
   inferred, therefore, most justly, that that letter had not been
   approved.  So, then, it is certain from the third and fourth Councils,
   the fifth so declaring and understanding it, that letters approved by
   the Apostolic See, such as was that of Cyril, or even proceeding from
   it, as that of Leo, were received by the holy Councils not simply, nor
   without inquiry.  The holy Fathers proceed to do what the Bishops at
   Chalcedon would have done, had they undertaken the examination of
   Ibas's letter.  They compare the letter with the Acts of Ephesus and
   Chalcedon.  Which done, the holy Council declared--"The comparison made
   proves, beyond a doubt, that the letter which Ibas is said to have
   written is, in all respects, opposed to the definition of the right
   Faith, which the Council of Chalcedon set forth."  All the Bishops
   cried out, "We all say this; the letter is heretical."  Thus,
   therefore, is it proved by the fifth Council, that our holy Fathers in
   Ecumenical Councils pronounce the letters read, whether of Catholics or
   heretics, or even of Roman Pontiffs, and that on matter of Faith, to be
   orthodox or heretical, according to the same procedure, after
   legitimate cognizance, the truth being inquired into, and then cleared
   up; and upon these premises judgment given.

   What! you will say, with no distinction, and with minds equally
   inclined to both parties?  Indeed, we have said, and shall often
   repeat, that there was a presumption in favour of the decrees of
   orthodox Pontiffs; but in Ecumenical Councils, where judgment is to be
   passed in matter of Faith, that they were bound no longer to act upon
   presumption, but on the truth clearly and thoroughly ascertained.

   Such were the Acts of the fifth Council.  This it learnt from the third
   and fourth Councils, and approved; and in this argument we have brought
   at once in favour of our opinion the decrees of three Ecumenical
   Councils, of Ephesus, of Chalcedon, and the second Constantinopolitan.
   The Emperor Justinian desired that the question concerning the
   above-mentioned Three Chapters should be considered in the Church.  He
   therefore sent for Pope Vigilius to Constantinople.  There he not long
   after assembled a council.  He and the Orientals thought it of great
   moment that these Chapters should be condemned, against the Nestorians,
   who were raising their heads to defend them; Vigilius, with the
   Occidentals, feared lest this occasion should be taken to destroy the
   authority of the Council of Chalcedon:  because it was admitted that
   Theodoret and Ibas had been received in that Council, whilst Theodore,
   though named, was let go without any mark of censure.  Though then both
   parties easily agreed as to the substance of the Faith, yet the
   question had entirely respect to the Faith, it being feared by the one
   party lest the Nestorian, by the other lest the Eutychian, enemies of
   the Council of Chalcedon should prevail.  Vigilius on the 11th of
   April, 548, issues his "Judicatum" against the Three Chapters, saving
   the authority of the Council of Chalcedon.  Thereupon the Bishops of
   Africa, Illyria, and Dalmatia, with two of his own confidential
   Deacons, withdraw from his communion.  In the year 550 the African
   Bishops, under Reparatus of Carthage, not only reject the Judicatum,
   but anathematize Vigilius himself, and sever him from Catholic
   Communion, reserving to him a place for repentance.  At length the Pope
   publicly withdraws his "Judicatum."  While the Council is sitting at
   Constantinople he publishes his "Constitutum," in which he condemns
   certain propositions of Theodore, but spares his person; the same
   respecting Theodoret; but with respect to Ibas, he declares that his
   letter was pronounced orthodox by the Council of Chalcedon.  However
   this may be, so much is clear, that Vigilius, though invited, declined
   being present at the council:  that nevertheless the council was held
   without him; that he published a "Constitutum," in which he disapproved
   of what Theodore, Theodoret, and Ibas were said to have written against
   the Faith; but decreed that their names should be spared because they
   were considered to have been received by the fourth Council, or to have
   died in the communion of the Church, and to be reserved to the judgment
   of God.  Concerning the letter of Ibas, he published the following,
   that, "understood in the best and most pious sense," it was blameless;
   and concerning the three Chapters generally, he ordered that after his
   present declaration ecclesiastics should move no further question.

   Such was the decree of Vigilius, issued upon the authority with which
   he was invested.  But the council, after his Constitution, both raised
   a question about the Three Chapters, and decided that question was
   properly raised concerning the dead, and that the letter of Ibas was
   manifestly heretical and Nestorian, and contrary in all things to the
   Faith of Chalcedon, and that they were altogether accursed, who
   defended the impious Theodore of Mopsuestia, or the writings of
   Theodoret against Cyril, or the impious letter of Ibas defending the
   tenets of Nestorius:  and all such as did not anathematize it, but said
   it was correct.

   In these latter words they seemed not even to spare Vigilius, although
   they did not mention his name.  And it is certain their decree was
   confirmed by Pelagius the Second, Gregory the Great, and other Roman
   Pontiffs.  These things prove, that in a matter of the utmost
   importance, disturbing the whole Church, and seeming to belong to the
   Faith, the decrees of sacred councils prevail over the decrees of
   Pontiffs, and that the letter of Ibas, though defended by a judgment of
   the Roman Pontiff, could nevertheless be proscribed as heretical.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Excursus on the Genuineness of the Acts of the Fifth Council.

   Some suspicion has arisen with regard to how far the acts of the Fifth
   Ecumenical Council may be relied upon.  Between the Roman Manuscript
   printed by Labbe and the Paris manuscript found in Mansi there are
   considerable variations and, strange to say, some of the most injurious
   things to the memory of Pope Vigilius are found only in the Paris
   manuscript.  Moreover we know that the manuscript kept in the
   patriarchal archives at Constantinople had been tampered with during
   the century that elapsed before the next Ecumenical Synod, for at that
   council the forgeries and interpolations were exposed by the Papal
   Legates.

   At the XIV^th Session of that synod the examination of the genuineness
   of the acts of the Second Council of Constantinople was resumed.  It
   had been begun at the XII^th Session.  Up to this time only two mss.
   had been used, now the librarian of the patriarchate presented a third
   ms. which he had found in the archives, and swore that neither himself
   nor any other so far as he knew had made any change in these mss.
   These were then compared and it was found that the two first agreed in
   containing the pretended letter of Mennas to Pope Vigilius, and the two
   writings addressed by Vigilius to Justinian and Theodora; but that none
   of these were found in the third ms.  It was further found that the
   documents in dispute were in a different hand from the rest of the ms.,
   and that in the first book of the parchment ms., three quarternions had
   been inserted, and in the second book between quarternions 15 and 16,
   four unpaged leaves had been placed.  So too the second ms. had been
   tampered with.  The council inserted these particulars in a decree, and
   ordered that "these additions must be quashed in both mss., and marked
   with an obelus, and the falsifiers must be smitten with anathema."
   Finally the council cried out, "Anathema to the pretended letters of
   Mennas and Vigilius!  Anathema to the forger of Acts!  Anathema to all
   who teach, etc."

   From all this it would seem that the substantial accuracy of the rest
   of the acts have been established by the authority of the Sixth Synod,
   and Hefele and all recent scholars follow Mansi's Paris ms.

   It may be well here to add that a most thorough-going attack upon the
   acts has been made in late years by Professor Vincenzi, in defence of
   Pope Vigilius and of Origen.  The reader is referred to his writings on
   the subject:  In Sancti Gregorii Nysseni et Originis scripta et
   doctrinam nova defensio; Vigil., Orig., Justin. triumph., in Synod V.
   (Romæ, 1865.)  The Catholic Dictionary frankly says that this is "an
   attempt to deny the most patent facts, and treat some of the chief
   documents as forgeries," and "unworthy of serious notice." [301]

   Session I.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. V., col. 419.)

   [The Emperor's Letter which was read to the Fathers.]

   In the Name of our Lord God Jesus Christ.  The Emperor Flavius
   Justinian, German, Gothic, etc., and always Augustus, to the most
   blessed bishops and patriarchs, Eutychius of Constantinople,
   Apollinarius of Alexandria, Domninus of Theopolis, Stephen, George, and
   Damian, the most religious bishops taking the place of that man of
   singular blessedness, Eustochius, the Archbishop and Patriarch of
   Jerusalem, and the other most religious bishops stopping in this royal
   city from the different provinces.

   [The following is the letter condensed, including Hefele's digest.
   History of the Councils, Vol. IV., p. 298.]

   The effort of my predecessors, the orthodox Emperors, ever aimed at the
   settling of controversies which had arisen respecting the faith by the
   calling of Synods.  For this cause Constantine assembled 318 Fathers at
   Nice, and was himself present at the Council, and assisted those who
   confessed the Son to be consubstantial with the Father.  Theodosius,
   150 at Constantinople, Theodosius the younger, the Synod of Ephesus,
   the Emperor Marcian, the bishops at Chalcedon.  As, however, after
   Marcian's death, controversies respecting the Synod of Chalcedon had
   broken out in several places, the Emperor Leo wrote to all bishops of
   all places, in order that everyone might declare his opinion in writing
   with regard to this holy Council.  Soon afterwards, however, had arisen
   again the adherents of Nestorius and Eutyches, and caused great
   divisions, so that many Churches had broken off communion with one
   another.  When, now, the grace of God raised us to the throne, we
   regarded it as our chief business to unite the Churches again, and to
   bring the Synod of Chalcedon, together with the three earlier, to
   universal acceptance.  We have won many who previously opposed that
   Synod; others, who persevered in their opposition, we banished, and so
   restored the unity of the Church again.  But the Nestorians want to
   impose their heresy upon the Church; and, as they could not use
   Nestorius for that purpose, they made haste to introduce their errors
   through Theodore of Mopsuestia, the teacher of Nestorius, who taught
   still more grievous blasphemies than his.  He maintained, e.g., that
   God the Word was one, and Christ another.  For the same purpose they
   made use of those impious writings of Theodoret which were directed
   against the first Synod of Ephesus, against Cyril and his Twelve
   Chapters, and also the shameful letter which Ibas is said to have
   written.  They maintain that this letter was accepted by the Synod of
   Chalcedon, and so would free from condemnation Nestorius and Theodore
   who were commended in the letter.  If they were to succeed, the Logos
   could no longer be said to be "made man," nor Mary called the Mother
   (genetrix) of God.  We, therefore, following the holy Fathers, have
   first asked you in writing to give your judgment on the three impious
   chapters named, and you have answered, and have joyfully confessed the
   true faith.  Because, however, after the condemnation proceeding from
   you, there are still some who defend the Three Chapters, therefore we
   have summoned you to the capital, that you may here, in common
   assembly, place again your view in the light of day.  When, for
   example, Vigilius, Pope of Old Rome, came hither, he, in answer to our
   questions, repeatedly anathematised in writing the Three Chapters, and
   confirmed his steadfastness in this view by much, even by the
   condemnation of his deacons, Rusticus and Sebastian.  We possess still
   his declarations in his own hand.  Then he issued his Judicatum, in
   which he anathematised the Three Chapters, with the words, Et quoniam,
   etc.  You know that he not only deposed Rusticus and Sebastian because
   they defended the Three Chapters, but also wrote to Valentinian, bishop
   of Scythia, and Aurelian, bishop of Arles, that nothing might be
   undertaken against the Judicatum.  When you afterwards came hither at
   my invitation, letters were exchanged between you and Vigilius in order
   to a common assembly. [302]   But now he had altered his view, would no
   longer have a synod, but required that only the three patriarchs and
   one other bishop (in communion with the Pope and the three bishops
   about him) should decide the matter.  In vain we sent several commands
   to him to take part in the synod.  He rejected also our two proposals,
   either to call a tribunal for decision, or to hold a smaller assembly,
   at which, besides him and his three bishops, every other patriarch
   should have place and voice, with from three to five bishops of his
   diocese.*  We further declare that we hold fast to the decrees of the
   four Councils, and in every way follow the holy Fathers, Athanasius,
   Hilary, Basil, Gregory the Theologian, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose,
   Theophilus, John (Chrysostom) of Constantinople, Cyril, Augustine,
   Proclus, Leo and their writings on the true faith.  As, however, the
   heretics are resolved to defend Theodore of Mopsuestia and Nestorius
   with their impieties, and maintain that that letter of Ibas was
   received by the Synod of Chalcedon, so do we exhort you to direct your
   attention to the impious writings of Theodore, and especially to his
   Jewish Creed which was brought forward at Ephesus and Chalcedon, and
   anathematized by each synod with those who had so held or did so hold;
   and we further exhort you to consider what the holy Fathers have
   written concerning him and his blasphemies, as well as what our
   predecessors have promulgated, as also what the Church historians have
   set forth concerning him. [303]   You will thence see that he and his
   heresies have since been condemned and that therefore his name has long
   since been struck from the diptychs of the Church of Mopsuestia.
   Consider the absurd assertion that heretics ought not to be
   anathematized after their deaths; and we exhort you further to follow
   in this matter the doctrine of the holy Fathers, who condemned not only
   living heretics but also anathematized after their death those who had
   died in their iniquity, just as those who had been unjustly condemned
   they restored after their death and wrote their names in the sacred
   diptychs; which took place in the case of John and of Flavian of pious
   memory, both of them bishops of Constantinople. [304]   Moreover we
   exhort you to examine the writing of Theodoret and the supposed letter
   of Ibas, in which the incarnation of the Word is denied, the expression
   "Mother of God" and the holy Synod of Ephesus rejected, Cyril called a
   heretic, and Theodore and Nestorius defended and praised.  And as they
   say that the Council of Chalcedon has received this letter, you must
   compare the declarations of this Council relating to the faith with the
   contents of the impious letter.  Finally, we entreat you to accelerate
   the matter.  For he who when asked concerning the right faith, puts off
   his answer for a long while, does nothing else but deny the right
   faith.  For in questioning and answering on things which are of faith,
   it is not he who is found first or second, but he who is the more ready
   with a right confession, that is acceptable to God.  May God keep you,
   most holy and religious fathers, for many years.  Given IV. Nones of
   May, at Constantinople, in the xxvii^th year of the reign of the
   imperial lord Justinian, the perpetual Augustus, and in the xii^th year
   after the consulate of the most illustrious Basil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [302] From here to the next asterisk the text varies.  Hefele says he
   follows the Paris codex with "abridgments."

   [303] The emperor could say that the letter was condemned at Chalcedon,
   because the Acts of Ephesus were read in the first session of
   Chalcedon.  Garnier is in error with regard to this, as Hefele points
   out.

   full in any other ms.  The Ballerini [Hefele notes] raise objections to
   the genuineness of the additions [in Noris. Opp., Tom. IV., 1037], but
   Hefele does not consider the objections of serious moment.  [Hist. of
   the Councils, Vol. IV., p. 323, note 2.]  All the mss. agree that The
   most glorious quæster of the sacred palace, Constantine, was sent by
   the most pious Emperor, and when he had entered the Council spake as
   follows:  "Certum est vestræ beatitudini, quantum, etc."  The rest of
   the speech differs in the different manuscripts.  I follow that of
   Paris.)

   You know how much care the most invincible Emperor has always had that
   the contention raised up by certain persons with regard to the Three
   Chapters should have a termination....For this intent he has required
   the most religious Vigilius to assemble with you and draw up a decree
   on this matter in accordance with the Orthodox faith.  Although
   therefore, Vigilius has already frequently condemned the Three Chapters
   in writing, and has done this also by word of mouth in the presence of
   the Emperor, and of the most glorious judges and of many members of
   this synod, and has always been ready to smite with anathema the
   defenders of Theodore of Mopsuestia, and the letter which was
   attributed to Ibas, and the writings of Theodoret which he set forth
   against the orthodox faith and against the twelve capitula of the holy
   Cyril: [305]   yet he has refused to do this in communion with you and
   your synod.

   Yesterday Vigilius sent Servus Dei, a most reverend Subdeacon of the
   Roman Church, and invited Belisarius, [306] Cethegus, as also Justinus
   and Constantine the most glorious consuls, as well as bishops Theodore,
   Ascidas, Benignus, and Phocas, to come to him as he wished to give
   through them an answer to the Emperor.  They came, but speedily
   returned and informed the most pious lord, that we had visited
   Vigilius, the most religious bishop, and that he had said to us:  "We
   have called you for this reason, that you may know what things have
   been done in the past days.  To this end I have written a document
   about the disputed Three Chapters, addressed to the most pious Emperor,
   [307] pray be good enough to read it, and to carry it to his
   Serenity."  But when we had heard this and had seen the document
   written to your serenity, we said to him that we could not by any means
   receive any document written to the most pious Emperor without his
   bidding.  "But you have deacons for running with messages, by whom you
   can send it."  He, however, said to us:  "You now know that I have made
   the document."  But we, bishops, answered him:  "If your blessedness is
   willing to meet together with us and the most holy Patriarchs, and the
   most religious bishops, and to treat of the Three Chapters and to give,
   in unison with us all, a suitable form of the orthodox faith, as the
   Holy Apostles and the holy Fathers and the four Councils have done, we
   will hold thee as our head, as a father and primate.  But if your
   holiness has drawn up a document for the Emperor, you have
   errand-runners, as we have said; send it by them."  And when he had
   heard these things from us, he sent Servus Dei the Subdeacon, who now
   awaits the answer of your serenity.  And when his Piety had heard this,
   he commanded through the aforesaid most religious and glorious men, the
   before-named subdeacon to carry back this message to the most religious
   Vigilius:  "We invited him (you) to meet together with the most blessed
   patriarchs and other religious bishops, and with them in common to
   examine and judge the Three Chapters.  But since you have refused to do
   this, and you say that you alone have written by yourself somewhat on
   the Three Chapters; if you have condemned them, in accordance with
   those things which you did before, we have already many such statements
   and need no more; but if you have written now something contrary to
   these things which were done by you before, you have condemned yourself
   by your own writing, since you have departed from orthodox doctrine and
   have defended impiety.  And how can you expect us to receive such a
   document from you?"

   And when this answer was given by the most pious Emperor, he did not
   send through the same deacon any document in writing from himself.  And
   all this was done without writing as also to your blessedness.

   [He then, according to all the mss., presented certain documents to be
   read, in the ms. printed by Labbe and Cossart, Tom. V., col. 549 et
   seqq.  These are fewer than in the Paris ms., which last also contains
   the following just after the reading of the documents and after the
   Council had declared that they proved the Emperor's zeal for the
   faith.]

   Constantine, the most glorious Quæstor, said:  While I am still present
   at your holy council by reason of the reading of the documents which
   have been presented to you, I would say that the most pious Emperor has
   sent a minute (formam), to your Holy Synod, concerning the name of
   Vigilius, that it be no more inserted in the holy diptychs of the
   Church, on account of the impiety which he defended.  Neither let it be
   recited by you, nor retained, either in the church of the royal city,
   or in other churches which are intrusted to you and to the other
   bishops in the State committed by God to his rule.  And when you hear
   this minute, again you will perceive by it how much the most serene
   Emperor cares for the unity of the holy churches and for the purity of
   the holy mysteries.

   [The letter was then read.]

   The holy Synod said:  What has seemed good to the most pious Emperor is
   congruous to the labours which he bears for the unity of the churches.
   Let us preserve unity to (ad) the Apostolic See of the most holy Church
   of ancient Rome, carrying out all things according to the tenor of what
   has been read.  De proposita vero quæstione quod jam promisimus
   procedat.

   Notes.

   Hefele understands that the Council heard and approved this letter of
   the Emperor's, but that the "Emperor did not mean entirely to break off
   communion with the Apostolic see, neither did he wish the Synod to do
   so" (Hist. Councils, Vol. IV., p. 326), as indeed he says in his
   letter.

   The Ballerini consider this letter of the Emperor's to be spurious, but
   (says Hefele) "on insufficient grounds" (l. c., p. 326, note 3).  The
   expressions used by the Emperor may not unnaturally be somewhat
   startling to those holding the theological position of the Ballerini:
   "We will not endure to receive the spotless communion from him nor from
   any one else who does not condemn this impiety...lest we be found thus
   communicating with the impiety of Nestorius and Theodore."  It is
   noteworthy that the Fifth Ecumenical Council should strike the name of
   the reigning Pope from the diptychs as a father of heresy; and that the
   Sixth Ecumenical Synod should anathematize another Pope as a heretic!

   The Sentence of the Synod.

   (From the Acts.  Collation VIII., L. and C., Conc., Tom. V., col. 562.)

   Our Great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, as we learn from the parable in
   the Gospel, distributes talents to each man according to his ability,
   and at the fitting time demands an account of the work done by every
   man.  And if he to whom but one talent has been committed is condemned
   because he has not worked with it but only kept it without loss, to how
   much greater and more horrible judgment must he be subject who not only
   is negligent concerning himself, but even places a stumbling-block and
   cause of offence in the way of others?  Since it is manifest to all the
   faithful that whenever any question arises concerning the faith, not
   only the impious man himself is condemned, but also he who when he has
   the power to correct impiety in others, neglects to do so. [308]

   We therefore, to whom it has been committed to rule the church of the
   Lord, fearing the curse which hangs over those who negligently perform
   the Lord's work, hasten to preserve the good seed of faith pure from
   the tares of impiety which are being sown by the enemy.

   When, therefore, we saw that the followers of Nestorius were attempting
   to introduce their impiety into the church of God through the impious
   Theodore, who was bishop of Mopsuestia, and through his impious
   writings; and moreover through those things which Theodoret impiously
   wrote, and through the wicked epistle which is said to have been
   written by Ibas to Maris the Persian, moved by all these sights we rose
   up for the correction of what was going on, and assembled in this royal
   city called thither by the will of God and the bidding of the most
   religious Emperor.

   And because it happened that the most religious Vigilius stopping in
   this royal city, was present at all the discussions with regard to the
   Three Chapters, and had often condemned them orally and in writing,
   nevertheless afterwards he gave his consent in writing to be present at
   the Council and examine together with us the Three Chapters, that a
   suitable definition of the right faith might be set forth by us all.
   Moreover the most pious Emperor, according to what had seemed good
   between us, exhorted both him and us to meet together, because it is
   comely that the priesthood should after common discussion impose a
   common faith.  On this account we besought his reverence to fulfil his
   written promises; for it was not right that the scandal with regard to
   these Three Chapters should go any further, and the Church of God be
   disturbed thereby.  And to this end we brought to his remembrance the
   great examples left us by the Apostles, and the traditions of the
   Fathers.  For although the grace of the Holy Spirit abounded in each
   one of the Apostles, so that no one of them needed the counsel of
   another in the execution of his work, yet they were not willing to
   define on the question then raised touching the circumcision of the
   Gentiles, until being gathered together they had confirmed their own
   several sayings by the testimony of the divine Scriptures.

   And thus they arrived unanimously at this sentence, which they wrote to
   the Gentiles:  "It has seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay
   upon you no other burden than these necessary things, that ye abstain
   from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things
   strangled, and from fornication."

   But also the Holy Fathers, who from time to time have met in the four
   holy councils, following the example of the ancients, have by a common
   discussion, disposed of by a fixed decree the heresies and questions
   which had sprung up, as it was certainly known, that by common
   discussion when the matter in dispute was presented by each side, the
   light of truth expels the darkness of falsehood.

   Nor is there any other way in which the truth can be made manifest when
   there are discussions concerning the faith, since each one needs the
   help of his neighbour, as we read in the Proverbs of Solomon:  "A
   brother helping his brother shall be exalted like a walled city; and he
   shall be strong as a well-founded kingdom;" and again in Ecclesiastes
   he says:  "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for
   their labour."

   So also the Lord himself says:  "Verily I say unto you that if two of
   you shall agree upon earth as touching anything they shall seek for,
   they shall have it from my Father which is in heaven.  For wheresoever
   two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
   of them."

   But when often he had been invited by us all, and when the most
   glorious judges had been sent to him by the most religious Emperor, he
   promised to give sentence himself on the Three Chapters (sententiam
   proferre):  And when we heard this answer, having the Apostle's
   admonition in mind, that "each one must give an account of himself to
   God" and fearing the judgment that hangs over those who scandalize one,
   even of the least important, and knowing how much sorer it must be to
   give offence to so entirely Christian an Emperor, and to the people,
   and to all the Churches; and further recalling what was said by God to
   Paul:  "Fear not, but speak, and be not silent, for I am with thee, and
   no one can harm thee."  Therefore, being gathered together, before all
   things we have briefly confessed that we hold that faith which our Lord
   Jesus Christ, the true God, delivered to his holy Apostles, and through
   them to the holy churches, and which they who after them were holy
   fathers and doctors, handed down to the people credited to them.

   We confessed that we hold, preserve, and declare to the holy churches
   that confession of faith which the 318 holy Fathers more at length set
   forth, who were gathered together at Nice, who handed down the holy
   mathema or creed.  Moreover, the 150 gathered together at
   Constantinople set forth our faith, who followed that same confession
   of faith and explained it.  And the consent of the 200 holy fathers
   gathered for the same faith in the first Council of Ephesus.  And what
   things were defined by the 630 gathered at Chalcedon for the one and
   the same faith, which they both followed and taught.  And all those who
   from time to time have been condemned or anathematized by the Catholic
   Church, and by the aforesaid four Councils, we confessed that we hold
   them condemned and anathematized.  And when we had thus made profession
   of our faith we began the examination of the Three Chapters, and first
   we brought into review the matter of Theodore of Mopsuestia; and when
   all the blasphemies contained in his writings were made manifest, we
   marvelled at the long-suffering of God, that the tongue and mind which
   had framed such blasphemies were not immediately consumed by the divine
   fire; and we never would have suffered the reader of the aforenamed
   blasphemies to proceed, fearing [as we did] the indignation of God for
   their record alone (as each blasphemy surpassed its predecessor in the
   magnitude of its impiety and moved from its foundation the mind of the
   hearer) had it not been that we saw they who gloried in such
   blasphemies stood in need of the confusion which would come upon them
   through their manifestation.  So that all of us, moved with indignation
   by these blasphemies against God, both during and after the reading,
   broke forth into denunciations and anathematisms against Theodore, as
   if he had been living and present.  O Lord be merciful, we cried, not
   even devils have dared to utter such things against thee.

   O intolerable tongue!  O the depravity of the man!  O that high hand he
   lifted up against his Creator!  For the wretched man who had promised
   to know the Scriptures, had no recollection of the words of the Prophet
   Hosea, "Woe unto them! for they have fled from me:  they are become
   famous because they were impious as touching me; they spake iniquities
   against me, and when they had thought them out, they spake the violent
   things against me.  Therefore shall they fall in the snare by reason of
   the wickedness of their own tongues.  Their contempt shall turn into
   their own bosom:  because they have transgressed my covenant and have
   acted impiously against my laws."

   To these curses the impious Theodore is justly subject.  For the
   prophecies concerning Christ he rejected and hastened to destroy, so
   far as he had the power, the great mystery of the dispensation for our
   salvation; attempting in many ways to show the divine words to be
   nothing but fables, for the mirth of the gentiles, and spurned the
   other prophetic announcements made against the impious, especially that
   which the divine Habacuc said of those who teach falsely, "Woe unto him
   that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him and
   makest him drunken that thou mayest look on their nakedness," that is,
   their doctrines full of darkness and altogether foreign to the light.

   And why should we add anything further?  For anyone can take in his
   hands the writings of the impious Theodore or the impious chapters
   which from his impious writings were inserted by us in our acts, and
   find the incredible foolishness and the detestable things which he
   said.  For we are afraid to proceed further and again to remember these
   infamies.

   There was also read to us what had been written by the holy Fathers
   against him, and his foolishness which exceeded that of all heretics,
   and moreover the histories and the imperial laws, setting forth his
   impiety from the beginning, and since after all these things the
   defenders of his impiety, glorying in the injuries uttered by him
   against his Creator, said that it was not right to anathematize him
   after death, although we knew the ecclesiastical tradition concerning
   the impious, that even after death, heretics are anathematized;
   nevertheless we thought it necessary concerning this also to make
   examination, and there were found in the acts how divers heretics had
   been anathematized after death; and in many ways it was manifest to us
   that those who were saying this cared nothing for the judgment of God,
   nor for the Apostolic announcements, nor for the tradition of the
   Fathers.  And we would like to ask them what they have to say to the
   Lord's having said of himself:  "Whosoever should have believed in him,
   is not judged:  but who should not have believed in him is judged
   already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten
   Son of God," and of that exclamation of the Apostle:  Although we or an
   angel from heaven were to preach to you another gospel than that we
   have preached unto you, let him be anathema:  as we have said, so now I
   say again, If anyone preach to you another gospel than that you have
   received, let him be anathema."

   For when the Lord says:  "he is judged already," and when the Apostle
   anathematizes even angels, if they teach anything different from what
   we have preached, how can even those who dare all things, presume to
   say that these words refer only to the living? or are they ignorant, or
   is it not rather that they feign to be ignorant, that the judgment of
   anathema is nothing else than that of separation from God?  For the
   impious person, although he may not have been verbally anathematized by
   anyone, nevertheless he really is anathematized, having separated
   himself from the true life by his impiety.

   For what have they to answer to the Apostle again when he says, "A man
   that is an heretic reject after the first and second corrections.
   Knowing that such a man is perverse, and sins, and is condemned by
   himself."

   In accordance with which words Cyril of blessed memory, in the books
   which he wrote against Theodore, says as follows:  They are to be
   avoided who are in the grasp of such awful crimes whether they be among
   the quick or not.  For it is necessary always to flee from that which
   is hurtful, and not to have respect of persons, but to consider what is
   pleasing to God.  And again the same Cyril of holy memory, writing to
   John, bishop of Antioch, and to the synod assembled in that city
   concerning Theodore who was anathematized together with Nestorius, says
   thus:  It was therefore necessary to keep a brilliant festival, since
   every voice which agreed with the blasphemies of Nestorius had been
   cast out no matter whose.  For it proceeded against all those who held
   these same opinions or had at one time held them, which is exactly what
   we and your holiness have said:  We anathematize those who say that
   there are two Sons and two Christs.  For one is he who is preached by
   us and you, as we have said, Christ, the Son and Lord, only begotten as
   man, according to the saying of the most learned Paul.  And also in his
   letter to Alexander and Martinian and John and Paregorius and Maximus,
   presbyters and monastic fathers, and those who with them were leading
   the solitary life, he so says:  The holy synod of Ephesus, gathered
   together according to the will of God against the Nestorian perfidy
   with a just and keen sentence condemned together with him the empty
   words of those who afterwards should embrace or who had in time past
   embraced the same opinions with him, and who presumed to say or write
   any such thing, laying upon them an equal condemnation.  For it
   followed naturally that when one was condemned for such profane
   emptiness of speech, the sentence should not come against one only, but
   (so to speak) against every one of their heresies or calumnies, which
   they utter against the pious doctrines of the Christ, worshipping two
   Sons, and dividing the indivisible, and bringing in the crime of
   man-worship (anthropolatry), both into heaven and earth.  For with us
   the holy multitude of the supernal spirits adore one Lord Jesus
   Christ.  Moreover several letters of Augustine, of most religious
   memory, who shone forth resplendent among the African bishops, were
   read, shewing that it was quite right that heretics should be
   anathematized after death.  And this ecclesiastical tradition, the
   other most reverend bishops of Africa have preserved:  and the holy
   Roman Church as well had anathematized certain bishops after their
   death, although they had not been accused of any falling from the faith
   during their lives:  and of each we have the evidence in our hands.

   But since the disciples of Theodore and of his impiety, who are so
   manifestly enemies of the truth, have attempted to bring forward
   certain passages of Cyril of holy memory and of Proclus, as though they
   had been written in favour of Theodore, it is opportune to fit to them
   the words of the prophet when he says:  "The ways of the Lord are right
   and the just walk therein; but the wicked shall be weak in them."  For
   these, evilly receiving the things which have been well and opportunely
   written by the holy Fathers, and making excuses in their sins, quote
   these words.  The fathers do not appear as delivering Theodore from
   anathema, but rather as economically using certain expressions on
   account of those who defended Nestorius and his impiety, in order to
   draw them away from this error, and to lead them to perfection and to
   teach them to condemn not only Nestorius, the disciple of the impiety,
   but also his teacher Theodore.  So in these very words of economy the
   Fathers shew their intention on this point, that Theodore should be
   anathematized, as has been abundantly demonstrated by us in our acts
   from the writings of Cyril and Proclus of holy memory with regard to
   the condemnation of Theodore and his impiety.  And such economy is
   found in divine Scripture:  and it is evident that Paul the Apostle
   made use of this in the beginning of his ministry, in relation to those
   who had been brought up as Jews, and circumcised Timothy, that by this
   economy and condescension he might lead them on to perfection.  But
   afterwards he forbade circumcision, writing thus to the Galatians:
   "Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised Christ profiteth
   you nothing."  But we found that that which heretics were wont to do,
   the defenders of Theodore had done also.  For cutting out certain of
   the things which the holy Fathers had written, and placing with them
   and mixing up certain false things of their own, they have tried by a
   letter of Cyril of holy memory as though from a testimony of the
   Fathers, to free from anathema the aforesaid impious Theodore:  in
   which very passages the truth was demonstrated, when the parts which
   had been cut off were read in their proper order, and the falsehood was
   thoroughly evinced by the collation of the true.  But in all these
   things, they who spake such vanities, "trusted in falsehood," as it is
   written, "they trust in falsehood, and speak vanity; they conceive
   grief and bring forth iniquity, weaving the spider's web."  When we had
   thus considered Theodore and his impiety, we took care to have recited
   and inserted in our acts a few of these things which had been impiously
   written by Theodoret against the right faith and against the Twelve
   Chapters of St. Cyril and against the First Council of Ephesus, also
   certain things written by him in defence of those impious ones Theodore
   and Nestorius, for the satisfaction of the reader; that all might know
   that these had been justly cast out and anathematized.  In the third
   place the letter which is said to have been written by Ibas to Maris
   the Persian, was brought forward for examination, and we found that it,
   too, should be read.  When it was read immediately its impiety was
   manifest to all.  And it was right to make the condemnation and
   anathematism of the aforesaid Three Chapters, as even to this time
   there had been some question on the subject.  But because the defenders
   of these impious ones, Theodore and Nestorius, were scheming in some
   way or other to confirm these persons and their impiety, and were
   saying that this impious letter, which praised and defended Theodore
   and Nestorius and their impiety, had been received by the holy Council
   of Chalcedon we thought it necessary to shew that the holy synod was
   free of the impiety which was contained in that letter, that it might
   be clear that they who say such things do not do so with the favour of
   this holy council, but that through its name they may confirm their own
   impiety.  And it was shewn in the acts that in former times Ibas had
   been accused because of the very impiety which is contained in this
   letter; at first by Proclus, of holy memory, the bishop of
   Constantinople, and afterwards by Theodosius, of pious memory, and by
   Flavian, who was ordained bishop in succession to Proclus, who
   delegated the examination of the matter to Photius, bishop of Tyre, and
   to Eustathius, bishop of the city of Beyroot.  Afterwards the same
   Ibas, being found guilty, was cast out of his bishopric.  Such was the
   state of the case, how could anyone presume to say that that impious
   letter was received by the holy council of Chalcedon and that the holy
   council of Chalcedon agreed with it throughout?  Nevertheless in order
   that they who thus calumniate the holy council of Chalcedon may have no
   further opportunity of doing so, we ordered to be recited the decisions
   of the holy Synods, to wit, of first Ephesus, and of Chalcedon, with
   regard to the Epistles of Cyril of blessed memory and of Leo, of pious
   memory, sometime Pope of Old Rome.  And since we had learned from these
   that nothing written by anyone else ought to be received unless it had
   been proved to agree with the orthodox faith of the holy Fathers, we
   interrupted our proceedings so as to recite also the definition of the
   faith which was set forth by the holy council of Chalcedon, so that we
   might compare the things in the epistle with this decree.  And when
   this was done it was perfectly clear that the contents of the epistle
   were wholly opposite to those of the definition.

   For the definition agreed with the one and unchanging faith set forth
   as well by the 318 holy Fathers as by the 150 and by those who
   assembled at the first synod at Ephesus.  But that impious letter, on
   the other hand, contained the blasphemies of the heretics Theodore and
   Nestorius, and defended them, and calls them doctors, while it calls
   the holy Fathers heretics.

   And this we made manifest to all, that we did not have any intention of
   omitting the Fathers of the first and second interlocutions, which the
   followers of Theodore and Nestorius cited on their side, but these and
   all the others having been read and their contents examined, we found
   that the aforesaid Ibas was not allowed to be received without being
   compelled to anathematize Nestorius and his impious teachings, which
   were defended in that epistle.  And this the rest of the religious
   bishops of the aforesaid holy Council did as well as those two whose
   interlocutions certain tried to use.

   For this they observed in the case of Theodoret, and required him to
   anathematize those things of which he was accused.  If therefore they
   were willing to allow the reception of Ibas in no other manner unless
   he condemned the impiety which was contained in his letters, and
   subscribed the definition of faith adopted by the Council, how can they
   attempt to make out that this impious letter was received by the same
   holy council?  For we are taught, "What fellowship hath righteousness
   with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?  And
   what concord hath Christ with Belial?  Or what part hath he that
   believeth with an infidel?  And what agreement hath the temple of God
   with idols."

   Having thus detailed all that has been done by us, we again confess
   that we receive the four holy Synods, that is, the Nicene, the
   Constantinopolitan, the first of Ephesus, and that of Chalcedon, and we
   have taught, and do teach all that they defined respecting the one
   faith.  And we account those who do not receive these things aliens
   from the Catholic Church.  Moreover we condemn and anathematize,
   together with all the other heretics who have been condemned and
   anathematized by the before-mentioned four holy Synods, and by the holy
   Catholic and Apostolic Church, Theodore who was Bishop of Mopsuestia,
   and his impious writings, and also those things which Theodoret
   impiously wrote against the right faith, and against the Twelve
   Chapters of the holy Cyril, and against the first Synod of Ephesus, and
   also those which he wrote in defence of Theodore and Nestorius.  In
   addition to these we also anathematize the impious Epistle which Ibas
   is said to have written to Maris, the Persian, which denies that God
   the Word was incarnate of the holy Mother of God, and ever Virgin Mary,
   and accuses Cyril of holy memory, who taught the truth, as an heretic,
   and of the same sentiments with Apollinaris, and blames the first Synod
   of Ephesus as deposing Nestorius without examination and inquiry, and
   calls the Twelve Chapters of the holy Cyril impious, and contrary to
   the right faith, and defends Theodorus and Nestorius, and their impious
   dogmas and writings.  We therefore anathematize the Three Chapters
   before-mentioned, that is, the impious Theodore of Mopsuestia, with his
   execrable writings, and those things which Theodoret impiously wrote,
   and the impious letter which is said to be of Ibas, and their
   defenders, and those who have written or do write in defence of them,
   or who dare to say that they are correct, and who have defended or
   attempt to defend their impiety with the names of the holy Fathers, or
   of the holy Council of Chalcedon.  These things therefore being settled
   with all accuracy, we, bearing in remembrance the promises made
   respecting the holy Church, and who it was that said that the gates of
   hell should not prevail against her, that is, the deadly tongues of
   heretics; remembering also what was prophesied respecting it by Hosea,
   saying, "I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and thou shalt
   know the Lord," and numbering together with the devil, the father of
   lies, the unbridled tongues of heretics who persevered in their impiety
   unto death, and their most impious writings, will say to them, "Behold,
   all ye kindle a fire, and cause the flame of the fire to grow strong,
   ye shall walk in the light of your fire, and the flame which ye
   kindle."  But we, having a commandment to exhort the people with right
   doctrine, and to speak to the heart of Jerusalem, that is, the Church
   of God, do rightly make haste to sow in righteousness, and to reap the
   fruit of life; and kindling for ourselves the light of knowledge from
   the holy Scriptures, and the doctrine of the Fathers, we have
   considered it necessary to comprehend in certain Capitula, both the
   declaration of the truth, and the condemnation of heretics, and of
   their wickedness.

   The Capitula of the Council.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. V., col. 568.)

   I.

   If anyone shall not confess that the nature or essence of the Father,
   of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is one, as also the force and the
   power; [if anyone does not confess] a consubstantial Trinity, one
   Godhead to be worshipped in three subsistences or Persons:  let him be
   anathema.  For there is but one God even the Father of whom are all
   things, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things, and one
   Holy Spirit in whom are all things.

   II.

   If anyone shall not confess that the Word of God has two nativities,
   the one from all eternity of the Father, without time and without body;
   the other in these last days, coming down from heaven and being made
   flesh of the holy and glorious Mary, Mother of God and always a virgin,
   and born of her:  let him be anathema.

   III.

   If anyone shall say that the wonder-working Word of God is one [Person]
   and the Christ that suffered another; or shall say that God the Word
   was with the woman-born Christ, or was in him as one person in another,
   but that he was not one and the same our Lord Jesus Christ, the Word of
   God, incarnate and made man, and that his miracles and the sufferings
   which of his own will he endured in the flesh were not of the same
   [Person]:  let him be anathema.

   IV.

   If anyone shall say that the union of the Word of God to man was only
   according to grace or energy, or dignity, or equality of honour, or
   authority, or relation, or effect, or power, or according to good
   pleasure in this sense that God the Word was pleased with a man, that
   is to say, that he loved him for his own sake, as says the senseless
   Theodorus, or [if anyone pretends that this union exists only] so far
   as likeness of name is concerned, as the Nestorians understand, who
   call also the Word of God Jesus and Christ, and even accord to the man
   the names of Christ and of Son, speaking thus clearly of two persons,
   and only designating disingenuously one Person and one Christ when the
   reference is to his honour, or his dignity, or his worship; if anyone
   shall not acknowledge as the Holy Fathers teach, that the union of God
   the Word is made with the flesh animated by a reasonable and living
   soul, and that such union is made synthetically and hypostatically, and
   that therefore there is only one Person, to wit:  our Lord Jesus
   Christ, one of the Holy Trinity:  let him be anathema.  As a matter of
   fact the word "union" (tes henoseos) has many meanings, and the
   partisans of Apollinaris and Eutyches have affirmed that these natures
   are confounded inter se, and have asserted a union produced by the
   mixture of both.  On the other hand the followers of Theodorus and of
   Nestorius rejoicing in the division of the natures, have taught only a
   relative union.  Meanwhile the Holy Church of God, condemning equally
   the impiety of both sorts of heresies, recognises the union of God the
   Word with the flesh synthetically, that is to say, hypostatically.  For
   in the mystery of Christ the synthetical union not only preserves
   unconfusedly the natures which are united, but also allows no
   separation.

   V.

   If anyone understands the expression "one only Person of our Lord Jesus
   Christ" in this sense, that it is the union of many hypostases, and if
   he attempts thus to introduce into the mystery of Christ two
   hypostases, or two Persons, and, after having introduced two persons,
   speaks of one Person only out of dignity, honour or worship, as both
   Theodorus and Nestorius insanely have written; if anyone shall
   calumniate the holy Council of Chalcedon, pretending that it made use
   of this expression [one hypostasis] in this impious sense, and if he
   will not recognize rather that the Word of God is united with the flesh
   hypostatically, and that therefore there is but one hypostasis or one
   only Person, and that the holy Council of Chalcedon has professed in
   this sense the one Person of our Lord Jesus Christ:  let him be
   anathema.  For since one of the Holy Trinity has been made man, viz.:
   God the Word, the Holy Trinity has not been increased by the addition
   of another person or hypostasis.

   VI.

   If anyone shall not call in a true acceptation, but only in a false
   acceptation, the holy, glorious, and ever-virgin Mary, the Mother of
   God, or shall call her so only in a relative sense, believing that she
   bare only a simple man and that God the word was not incarnate of her,
   but that the incarnation of God the Word resulted only from the fact
   that he united himself to that man who was born [of her]; [309] if he
   shall calumniate the Holy Synod of Chalcedon as though it had asserted
   the Virgin to be Mother of God according to the impious sense of
   Theodore; or if anyone shall call her the mother of a man
   (anthropotokon) or the Mother of Christ (Christotokon), as if Christ
   were not God, and shall not confess that she is exactly and truly the
   Mother of God, because that God the Word who before all ages was
   begotten of the Father was in these last days made flesh and born of
   her, and if anyone shall not confess that in this sense the holy Synod
   of Chalcedon acknowledged her to be the Mother of God:  let him be
   anathema.

   VII.

   If anyone using the expression, "in two natures," does not confess that
   our one Lord Jesus Christ has been revealed in the divinity and in the
   humanity, so as to designate by that expression a difference of the
   natures of which an ineffable union is unconfusedly made, [a union] in
   which neither the nature of the Word was changed into that of the
   flesh, nor that of the flesh into that of the Word, for each remained
   that it was by nature, the union being hypostatic; but shall take the
   expression with regard to the mystery of Christ in a sense so as to
   divide the parties, or recognising the two natures in the only Lord
   Jesus, God the Word made man, does not content himself with taking in a
   theoretical manner [310] the difference of the natures which compose
   him, which difference is not destroyed by the union between them, for
   one is composed of the two and the two are in one, but shall make use
   of the number [two] to divide the natures or to make of them Persons
   properly so called:  let him be anathema. [311]

   VIII.

   If anyone uses the expression "of two natures," confessing that a union
   was made of the Godhead and of the humanity, or the expression "the one
   nature made flesh of God the Word," and shall not so understand those
   expressions as the holy Fathers have taught, to wit:  that of the
   divine and human nature there was made an hypostatic union, whereof is
   one Christ; but from these expressions shall try to introduce one
   nature or substance [made by a mixture] of the Godhead and manhood of
   Christ; let him be anathema.  For in teaching that the only-begotten
   Word was united hypostatically [to humanity] we do not mean to say that
   there was made a mutual confusion of natures, but rather each [nature]
   remaining what it was, we understand that the Word was united to the
   flesh.  Wherefore there is one Christ, both God and man, consubstantial
   with the Father as touching his Godhead, and consubstantial with us as
   touching his manhood.  Therefore they are equally condemned and
   anathematized by the Church of God, who divide or part the mystery of
   the divine dispensation of Christ, or who introduce confusion into that
   mystery.

   IX.

   If anyone shall take the expression, Christ ought to be worshipped in
   his two natures, in the sense that he wishes to introduce thus two
   adorations, the one in special relation to God the Word and the other
   as pertaining to the man; or if anyone to get rid of the flesh, [that
   is of the humanity of Christ,] or to mix together the divinity and the
   humanity, shall speak monstrously of one only nature or essence (phusin
   egoun ousian) of the united (natures), and so worship Christ, and does
   not venerate, by one adoration, God the Word made man, together with
   his flesh, as the Holy Church has taught from the beginning:  let him
   be anathema.

   X.

   If anyone does not confess that our Lord Jesus Christ who was crucified
   in the flesh is true God and the Lord of Glory and one of the Holy
   Trinity:  let him be anathema.

   XI.

   If anyone does not anathematize Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius,
   Apollinaris, Nestorius, Eutyches and Origen, as well as their impious
   writings, as also all other heretics already condemned and
   anathematized by the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and by the
   aforesaid four Holy Synods and [if anyone does not equally
   anathematize] all those who have held and hold or who in their impiety
   persist in holding to the end the same opinion as those heretics just
   mentioned:  let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Hefele.

   (Hist. Councils, Vol. iv., p. 336.)

   Halloix, Garnier, Basnage, Walch and others suppose, and Vincenzi
   maintains with great zeal, that the name of Origen is a later insertion
   in this anathematism, because (a) Theodore Ascidas, the Origenist, was
   one of the most influential members of the Synod, and would certainly
   have prevented a condemnation of Origen; further, (b) because in this
   anathematism only such heretics would be named as had been condemned by
   one of the first four Ecumenical Synods, which was not the case with
   Origen; (c) because this anathematism is identical with the tenth in
   the homologia of the Emperor, but in the latter the name of Origen is
   lacking; and, finally, (d) because Origen does not belong to the group
   of heretics to whom this anathematism refers.  His errors were quite
   different.

   All these considerations seem to me of insufficient strength, or mere
   conjecture, to make an alteration in the text, and arbitrarily to
   remove the name of Origen.  As regards the objection in connection with
   Theodore Ascidas, it is known that the latter had already pronounced a
   formal anathema on Origen, and certainly he did the same this time, if
   the Emperor wished it or if it seemed advisable.  The second and fourth
   objections have little weight.  In regard to the third (c) it is quite
   possible that either the Emperor subsequently went further than in his
   homologia, or that the bishops at the fifth Synod, of their own accord,
   added Origen, led on perhaps by one or another anti-Origenist of their
   number.  What, however, chiefly determines us to the retention of the
   text is:  (a) that the copy of the synodal Acts extant in the Roman
   archives, which has the highest credibility, and was probably prepared
   for Vigilius himself, contains the name of Origen in the eleventh
   anathematism; and (b) that the monks of the new Lama in Palestine, who
   are known to have been zealous Origenists, withdrew Church communion
   from the bishops of Palestine after these had subscribed the Acts of
   the fifth Synod.  In the anathema on the Three Chapters these
   Origenists could find as little ground for such a rupture as their
   friends and former colleague Ascidas; it could only be by the synod
   attacking their darling Origen.  (c) Finally, only on the ground that
   the name of Origen really stood in the eleventh anathematism, can we
   explain the widely-circulated ancient rumour that our Synod
   anathematized Origen and the Origenists.

   XII.

   If anyone defends the impious Theodore of Mopsuestia, who has said that
   the Word of God is one person, but that another person is Christ, vexed
   by the sufferings of the soul and the desires of the flesh, and
   separated little by little above that which is inferior, and become
   better by the progress in good works and irreproachable in his manner
   of life, as a mere man was baptized in the name of the Father, and of
   the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and obtained by this baptism the grace
   of the Holy Spirit, and became worthy of Sonship, and to be worshipped
   out of regard to the Person of God the Word (just as one worships the
   image of an emperor) and that he is become, after the resurrection,
   unchangeable in his thoughts and altogether without sin.  And, again,
   this same impious Theodore has also said that the union of God the Word
   with Christ is like to that which, according to the doctrine of the
   Apostle, exists between a man and his wife, "They twain shall be in one
   flesh."  The same [Theodore] has dared, among numerous other
   blasphemies, to say that when after the resurrection the Lord breathed
   upon his disciples, saying, "Receive the Holy Ghost," he did not really
   give them the Holy Spirit, but that he breathed upon them only as a
   sign.  He likewise has said that the profession of faith made by Thomas
   when he had, after the resurrection, touched the hands and the side of
   the Lord, viz.:  "My Lord and my God," was not said in reference to
   Christ, but that Thomas, filled with wonder at the miracle of the
   resurrection, thus thanked God who had raised up Christ.  And moreover
   (which is still more scandalous) this same Theodore in his Commentary
   on the Acts of the Apostles compares Christ to Plato, Manichæus,
   Epicurus and Marcion, and says that as each of these men having
   discovered his own doctrine, had given his name to his disciples, who
   were called Platonists, Manicheans, Epicureans and Marcionites, just so
   Christ, having discovered his doctrine, had given the name Christians
   to his disciples.  If, then, anyone shall defend this most impious
   Theodore and his impious writings, in which he vomits the blasphemies
   mentioned above, and countless others besides against our Great God and
   Saviour Jesus Christ, and if anyone does not anathematize him or his
   impious writings, as well as all those who protect or defend him, or
   who assert that his exegesis is orthodox, or who write in favour of him
   and of his impious works, or those who share the same opinions, or
   those who have shared them and still continue unto the end in this
   heresy:  let him be anathema.

   XIII.

   If anyone shall defend the impious writings of Theodoret, directed
   against the true faith and against the first holy Synod of Ephesus and
   against St. Cyril and his XII. Anathemas, and [defends] that which he
   has written in defence of the impious Theodore and Nestorius, and of
   others having the same opinions as the aforesaid Theodore and
   Nestorius, if anyone admits them or their impiety, or shall give the
   name of impious to the doctors of the Church who profess the hypostatic
   union of God the Word; and if anyone does not anathematize these
   impious writings and those who have held or who hold these sentiments,
   and all those who have written contrary to the true faith or against
   St. Cyril and his XII. Chapters, and who die in their impiety:  let him
   be anathema.

   XIV.

   If anyone shall defend that letter which Ibas is said to have written
   to Maris the Persian, in which he denies that the Word of God incarnate
   of Mary, the Holy Mother of God and ever-virgin, was made man, but says
   that a mere man was born of her, whom he styles a Temple, as though the
   Word of God was one Person and the man another person; in which letter
   also he reprehends St. Cyril as a heretic, when he teaches the right
   faith of Christians, and charges him with writing things like to the
   wicked Apollinaris.  In addition to this he vituperates the First Holy
   Council of Ephesus, affirming that it deposed Nestorius without
   discrimination and without examination.  The aforesaid impious epistle
   styles the XII. Chapters of Cyril of blessed memory, impious and
   contrary to the right faith and defends Theodore and Nestorius and
   their impious teachings and writings.  If anyone therefore shall defend
   the aforementioned epistle and shall not anathematize it and those who
   defend it and say that it is right or that a part of it is right, or if
   anyone shall defend those who have written or shall write in its
   favour, or in defence of the impieties which are contained in it, as
   well as those who shall presume to defend it or the impieties which it
   contains in the name of the Holy Fathers or of the Holy Synod of
   Chalcedon, and shall remain in these offences unto the end:  let him be
   anathema.

   Excursus on the XV. Anathemas Against Origen.

   That Origen was condemned by name in the Eleventh Canon of this council
   there seems no possible reason to doubt.  I have given in connexion
   with that canon a full discussion of the evidence upon which our
   present text rests.  But there arises a further question, to wit, Did
   the Fifth Synod examine the case of Origen and finally adopt the XV.
   Anathemas against him which are usually found assigned to it?  It would
   seem that with the evidence now in our possession it would be the
   height of rashness to give a dogmatic answer to this question.
   Scholars of the highest repute have taken, and do take to-day, the
   opposite sides of the case, and each defends his own side with marked
   learning and ability.  To my mind the chief difficulty in supposing
   these anathematisms to have been adopted by the Fifth Ecumenical is
   that nothing whatever is said about Origen in the call of the council,
   nor in any of the letters written in connexion with it; all of which
   would seem unnatural had there been a long discussion upon the matter,
   and had such an important dogmatic definition been adopted as the XV.
   Anathemas, and yet on the other hand there is a vast amount of
   literature subsequent in date to the council which distinctly
   attributes a detailed and careful examination of the teaching of Origen
   and a formal condemnation of him and of it to this council.

   The XV. Anathemas as we now have them were discovered by Peter Lambeck,
   the Librarian of Vienna, in the XVII^th century; and bear, in the
   Vienna ms., the heading, "Canons, of the 165 holy Fathers of the holy
   fifth Synod, held in Constantinople."  But despite this, Walch
   (Ketzerhist., Vol. vii., p. 661 et seqq. and 671; Vol. viij., p. 281 et
   seqq.); Döllinger (Church History, Eng. Trans., Vol. v., p. 203 et
   seqq.); Hefele (Hist. Councils, Vol. iv., p. 221 sq.), and many others
   look upon this caption as untrustworthy.  Evagrius, the historian,
   distinctly says that Origen was condemned with special anathemas at
   this Council, but his evidence is likewise (and, as it seems to me, too
   peremptorily) set aside.

   Cardinal Noris, in his Dissertatio Historica de Synodo Quinta, is of
   opinion that Origen was twice condemned by the Fifth Synod; the first
   time by himself before the eight sessions of which alone the acts
   remain, and again after those eight sessions, in connexion with two of
   his chief followers, Didymus the Blind and the deacon Evagrius.  The
   Jesuit, John Garnier wrote in opposition to Noris; but his work, while
   exceedingly clever, is considered by the learned to contain (as Hefele
   says) "many statements [which] are rash, arbitrary, and inaccurate, and
   on the whole it is seen to be written in a spirit of opposition to
   Noris." [312]   In defence of Noris's main contention came forward the
   learned Ballerini brothers, of Verona.  In their Defensio
   dissertationis Norisianæ de Syn. V. adv. diss. P. Garnerii, they expand
   and amend Noris's hypothesis.  But after all is said the matter remains
   involved in the greatest obscurity, and it is far easier to bring
   forward objections to the arguments in defence of either view than to
   bring forward a theory which will satisfy all the conditions of the
   problem.

   Those who deny that the XV. Anathemas were adopted by the Fifth Synod
   agree in assigning them to the "Home Synod," that is a Synod at
   Constantinople of the bishops subject to it, in a.d. 543.  Hefele takes
   this view and advocates it with much cogency, but confesses frankly,
   "We certainly possess no strong and decisive proof that the fifteen
   anathematisms belong to the Constantinopolitan synod of the year 543;
   but some probable grounds for the opinion may be adduced." [313]   This
   appears to be a somewhat weak statement with which to overthrow so much
   evidence as there can be produced for the opposite view.  For the
   traditional view the English reader will find a complete defence in E.
   B. Pusey, What is of Faith with regard to Eternal Punishment?

   Before closing it will be well to call the attention of the reader to
   these words now found in the acts as we have them:

   "And we found that many others had been anathematised after death, also
   even Origen; and if any one were to go back to the times of Theophilus
   of blessed memory or further he would have found him anathematised
   after death; which also now your holiness and Vigilius, the most
   religious Pope of Old Rome has done in his case." [314]   It would seem
   that this cannot possibly refer to anything else than a condemnation of
   Origen by the Fifth Ecumenical Synod, and so strongly is Vincenzi,
   Origen's defender, impressed with this that he declares the passage to
   have been tampered with.  But even if these anathemas were adopted at
   the Home Synod before the meeting of the Fifth Ecumenical, it is clear
   that by including his name among those of the heretics in the XI^th
   Canon, it practically ratified and made its own the action of that
   Synod.

   The reader will be glad to know Harnack's judgment in this matter.
   Writing of the Fifth Council, he says:  "It condemned Origen, as
   Justinian desired; it condemned the Three Chapters and consequently the
   Antiochene theology, as Justinian desired," etc., and in a foot-note he
   explains that he agrees with "Noris, the Ballerini, Möller (R. Encykl.,
   xi., p. 113) and Loofs (pp. 287, 291) as against Hefele and Vincenzi."
   [315]   A few pages before, he speaks of this last author's book as "a
   big work which falsifies history to justify the theses of Halloix, to
   rehabilitate Origen and Vigilius, and on the other hand to remodel' the
   Council and partly to bring it into contempt." [316]   Further on he
   says:  "The fifteen anathemas against Origen, on which his condemnation
   at the council was based, contained the following points....Since the
   Three Chapters' were condemned at the same time, Origen and Theodore
   were both got rid of....Origen's doctrines of the consummation, and of
   spirits and matter might no longer be maintained.  The judgment was
   restored to its place, and got back even its literal meaning." [317]

   The Anathemas Against Origen.

   I.

   If anyone asserts the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shall assert
   the monstrous restoration which follows from it:  let him be anathema.

   II.

   If anyone shall say that the creation (teu paragogen) of all reasonable
   things includes only intelligences (noas) without bodies and altogether
   immaterial, having neither number nor name, so that there is unity
   between them all by identity of substance, force and energy, and by
   their union with and knowledge of God the Word; but that no longer
   desiring the sight of God, they gave themselves over to worse things,
   each one following his own inclinations, and that they have taken
   bodies more or less subtile, and have received names, for among the
   heavenly Powers there is a difference of names as there is also a
   difference of bodies; and thence some became and are called Cherubims,
   others Seraphims, and Principalities, and Powers, and Dominations, and
   Thrones, and Angels, and as many other heavenly orders as there may
   be:  let him be anathema.

   III.

   If anyone shall say that the sun, the moon and the stars are also
   reasonable beings, and that they have only become what they are because
   they turned towards evil:  let him be anathema.

   IV.

   If anyone shall say that the reasonable creatures in whom the divine
   love had grown cold have been hidden in gross bodies such as ours, and
   have been called men, while those who have attained the lowest degree
   of wickedness have shared cold and obscure bodies and are become and
   called demons and evil spirits:  let him be anathema,.

   V.

   If anyone shall say that a psychic (psuchiken) condition has come from
   an angelic or archangelic state, and moreover that a demoniac and a
   human condition has come from a psychic condition, and that from a
   human state they may become again angels and demons, and that each
   order of heavenly virtues is either all from those below or from those
   above, or from those above and below:  let him be anathema.

   VI.

   If anyone shall say that there is a twofold race of demons, of which
   the one includes the souls of men and the other the superior spirits
   who fell to this, and that of all the number of reasonable beings there
   is but one which has remained unshaken in the love and contemplation of
   God, and that that spirit is become Christ and the king of all
   reasonable beings, and that he has created [318] all the bodies which
   exist in heaven, on earth, and between heaven and earth; and that the
   world which has in itself elements more ancient than itself, and which
   exists by themselves, viz.:  dryness, damp, heat and cold, and the
   image (idean) to which it was formed, was so formed, and that the most
   holy and consubstantial Trinity did not create the world, but that it
   was created by the working intelligence (Nous demirurgos) which is more
   ancient than the world, and which communicates to it its being:  let
   him be anathema.

   VII.

   If anyone shall say that Christ, of whom it is said that he appeared in
   the form of God, and that he was united before all time with God the
   Word, and humbled himself in these last days even to humanity, had
   (according to their expression) pity upon the divers falls which had
   appeared in the spirits united in the same unity (of which he himself
   is part), and that to restore them he passed through divers classes,
   had different bodies and different names, became all to all, an Angel
   among Angels, a Power among Powers, has clothed himself in the
   different classes of reasonable beings with a form corresponding to
   that class, and finally has taken flesh and blood like ours and is
   become man for men; [if anyone says all this] and does not profess that
   God the Word humbled himself and became man:  let him be anathema.

   VIII.

   If anyone shall not acknowledge that God the Word, of the same
   substance with the Father and the Holy Ghost, and who was made flesh
   and became man, one of the Trinity, is Christ in every sense of the
   word, but [shall affirm] that he is so only in an inaccurate manner,
   and because of the abasement (kenosanta), as they call it, of the
   intelligence (nous); if anyone shall affirm that this intelligence
   united (sunemmenon ) to God the Word, is the Christ in the true sense
   of the word, while the Logos is only called Christ because of this
   union with the intelligence, and e converso that the intelligence is
   only called God because of the Logos:  let him be anathema.

   IX.

   If anyone shall say that it was not the Divine Logos made man by taking
   an animated body with a psuche logike and noera, that he descended into
   hell and ascended into heaven, but shall pretend that it is the Nous
   which has done this, that Nous of which they say (in an impious
   fashion) he is Christ properly so called, and that he is become so by
   the knowledge of the Monad:  let him be anathema.

   X.

   If anyone shall say that after the resurrection the body of the Lord
   was ethereal, having the form of a sphere, and that such shall be the
   bodies of all after the resurrection; and that after the Lord himself
   shall have rejected his true body and after the others who rise shall
   have rejected theirs, the nature of their bodies shall be annihilated:
   let him be anathema.

   XI.

   If anyone shall say that the future judgment signifies the destruction
   of the body and that the end of the story will be an immaterial psusis,
   and that thereafter there will no longer be any matter, but only spirit
   nous):  let him be anathema.

   XII.

   If anyone shall say that the heavenly Powers and all men and the Devil
   and evil spirits are united with the Word of God in all respects, as
   the Nous which is by them called Christ and which is in the form of
   God, and which humbled itself as they say; and [if anyone shall say]
   that the Kingdom of Christ shall have an end:  let him be anathema.

   XIII.

   If anyone shall say that Christ [i.e., the Nous] is in no wise
   different from other reasonable beings, neither substantially nor by
   wisdom nor by his power and might over all things but that all will be
   placed at the right hand of God, as well as he that is called by them
   Christ [the Nous], as also they were in the feigned pre-existence of
   all things:  let him be anathema.

   XIV.

   If anyone shall say that all reasonable beings will one day be united
   in one, when the hypostases as well as the numbers and the bodies shall
   have disappeared, and that the knowledge of the world to come will
   carry with it the ruin of the worlds, and the rejection of bodies as
   also the abolition of [all] names, and that there shall be finally an
   identity of the gnosis and of the hypostasis; moreover, that in this
   pretended apocatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was
   in the feigned pre-existence:  let him be anathema.

   XV.

   If anyone shall say that the life of the spirits (noon) shall be like
   to the life which was in the beginning while as yet the spirits had not
   come down or fallen, so that the end and the beginning shall be alike,
   and that the end shall be the true measure of the beginning:  let him
   be anathema.

   The Anathematisms of the Emperor Justinian Against Origen. [319]

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. v., col. 677.)

   I.

   Whoever says or thinks that human souls pre-existed, i.e., that they
   had previously been spirits and holy powers, but that, satiated with
   the vision of God, they had turned to evil, and in this way the divine
   love in them had died out (appsugeisas) and they had therefore become
   souls (psuchas) and had been condemned to punishment in bodies, shall
   be anathema.

   II.

   If anyone says or thinks that the soul of the Lord pre-existed and was
   united with God the Word before the Incarnation and Conception of the
   Virgin, let him be anathema.

   III.

   If anyone says or thinks that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was
   first formed in the womb of the holy Virgin and that afterwards there
   was united with it God the Word and the pre-existing soul, let him be
   anathema.

   IV.

   If anyone says or thinks that the Word of God has become like to all
   heavenly orders, so that for the cherubim he was a cherub, for the
   seraphim a seraph:  in short, like all the superior powers, let him be
   anathema.

   V.

   If anyone says or thinks that, at the resurrection, human bodies will
   rise spherical in form and unlike our present form, let him be
   anathema.

   VI.

   If anyone says that the heaven, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the
   waters that are above heavens, have souls, and are reasonable beings,
   let him be anathema.

   VII.

   If anyone says or thinks that Christ the Lord in a future time will be
   crucified for demons as he was for men, let him be anathema.

   VIII.

   If anyone says or thinks that the power of God is limited, and that he
   created as much as he was able to compass, let him be anathema.

   IX.

   If anyone says or thinks that the punishment of demons and of impious
   men is only temporary, and will one day have an end, and that a
   restoration (apokatastasis) will take place of demons and of impious
   men, let him be anathema.

   Anathema to Origen and to that Adamantius, who set forth these opinions
   together with his nefarious and execrable and wicked doctrine [320] and
   to whomsoever there is who thinks thus, or defends these opinions, or
   in any way hereafter at any time shall presume to protect them.

   The Decretal Epistle of Pope Vigilius in Confirmation of the Fifth
   Ecumenical Synod.

   Historical Note.

   (Fleury.  Hist. Eccl., Liv. xxxiii. 52.)

   At last the Pope Vigilius resigned himself to the advice of the
   Council, and six months afterwards wrote a letter to the Patriarch
   Eutychius, wherein he confesses that he has been wanting in charity in
   dividing from his brethren.  He adds, that one ought not to be ashamed
   to retract, when one recognises the truth, and brings forward the
   example of Augustine.  He says, that, after having better examined the
   matter of the Three Chapters, he finds them worthy of condemnation.
   "We recognize for our brethren and colleagues all those who have
   condemned them, and annul by this writing all that has been done by us
   or by others for the defence of the three chapters."
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Decretal Letter of Pope Vigilius.

   (The manuscript from which this letter was printed was found in the
   Royal Library of Paris by Peter de Marca and by him first published,
   with a Latin translation and with a dissertation.  Both of these with
   the Greek text are found in Labbe and Cossart's Concilia, Tom. V., col.
   596 et seqq.; also in Migne's Patr. Lat., Tom. LXIX., col. 121 et
   seqq.  Some doubts have been expressed about its genuineness and
   Harduin is of opinion that the learned Jesuit, Garnerius, in his notes
   on the Deacon Leberatus's Breviary, has proved its supposititious
   character.  But the learned have not generally been of this mind but
   have accepted the letter as genuine.)

   Vigilius to his beloved brother Eutychius.

   No one is ignorant of the scandals which the enemy of the human race
   has stirred up in all the world:  so that he made each one with a
   wicked object in view, striving in some way to fulfil his wish to
   destroy the Church of God spread over the whole world, not only in his
   own name but even in ours and in those of others to compose diverse
   things as well in words as in writing; in so much that he attempted to
   divide us who, together with our brethren and fellow bishops, are
   stopping in this royal city, and who defend with equal reverence the
   four synods, and sincerely persist in the one and the same faith of
   those four synods, by his sophistries and machinations he tried to part
   from them; so that we ourselves who were and are of the same opinion as
   they touching the faith, went apart into discord, brotherly love being
   despised. [321]

   But since Christ our God, who is the true light, whom the darkness
   comprehendeth not, hath removed all confusion from our minds, and hath
   so recalled peace to the whole world and to the Church, so that what
   things should be defined by us have been healthfully fulfilled through
   the revelation of the Lord and through the investigation of the truth.

   Therefore, my dear brothers, I do you to wit, that in common with all
   of you, our brethren, we receive in all respects the four synods, that
   is to say the Nicene, the Constantinopolitan, the first Ephesian, and
   the Chalcedonian; and we venerate them with devout mind, and watch over
   them with all our mind.  And should there be any who do not follow
   these holy synods in all things which they have defined concerning the
   faith, we judge them to be aliens to the communion of the holy and
   Catholic Church.

   Wherefore on account of our desire that you, my brothers, should know
   what we have done in this matter, we make it known to you by this
   letter.  For no one can doubt how many were the discussions raised on
   account of the Three Chapters, that is, concerning Theodore, sometime
   bishop of Mopsuestia, and his writings, as well as concerning the
   writings of Theodoret, and concerning that letter which is said to have
   been written by Ibas to Maris the Persian:  and how diverse were the
   things spoken and written concerning these Three Chapters.  Now if in
   every business sound wisdom demands that there should be a retractation
   of what was propounded after examination, there ought to be no shame
   when what was at first omitted is made public after it is discovered by
   a further study of the truth.  [And if this is the case in ordinary
   affairs] how much more in ecclesiastical strifes should the same
   dictate of sound reason be observed?  Especially since it is manifest
   that our Fathers, and especially the blessed Augustine, who was in very
   sooth illustrious in the Divine Scriptures, and a master in Roman
   eloquence, retracted some of his own writings, and corrected some of
   his own sayings, and added what he had omitted and afterward found
   out.  We, led by their example never gave over the study of the
   questions raised by the controversy with regard to the before-mentioned
   Three Chapters, nor our search for passages in the writings of our
   Fathers which were applicable to the matter.

   As a result of this investigation it became evident that in the sayings
   of Theodore of Mopsuestia (which are spoken against on all hands) there
   are contained very many things contrary to the right faith and to the
   teachings of the holy Fathers; and for this very reason these same holy
   Fathers have left for the instruction of the Church treatises which
   they had written against him.

   For among other blasphemies of his we find that he openly said that God
   the Word was one [Person] and Christ another [Person], vexed with the
   passions of the soul and with the desires of the flesh, and that he
   little by little advanced from a lower to a higher stage of excellence
   by the improvement (prokope, per profectum operum) of his works, and
   became irreprehensible in his manner of life. [322]   And further he
   taught that it was a mere man who was baptized in the Name of the
   Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and that he received
   through his baptism the grace of the Holy Spirit, and merited his
   adoption; and therefore that Christ could be venerated in the same way
   that the image of the Emperor is venerated as being the persona (eis
   prosopon) of God the Word.  And he also taught that [only] after his
   resurrection he became immutable in his thoughts and altogether
   impeccable.

   Moreover he said that the union of the Word of God was made with Christ
   as the Apostle says the union is made between a man and his wife:  They
   twain shall be one flesh; and that after his resurrection, when the
   Lord breathed upon his disciples and said, Receive the Holy Ghost, he
   did not give to them the Holy Spirit.  In like strain of profanity he
   dared to say that the confession which Thomas made, when he touched the
   hands and side of the Lord after his resurrection, saying, My Lord and
   my God, did not apply to Christ (for Theodore did not acknowledge
   Christ to be God); but that Thomas gave glory to God being filled with
   wonder at the miracle of the resurrection, and so said these words.

   But what is still worse is this, that in interpreting the Acts of the
   Apostles, Theodore makes Christ like to Plato, and Manichæus, and
   Epicurus, and Marcian, saying:  Just as each of these were the authors
   of their own peculiar teachings, and called their disciples after their
   own names, Platonists, and Manichæans, and Epicureans, and Marcionites,
   just so Christ invented dogmas and called his followers Christians
   after himself.

   Let therefore the whole Catholic Church know that justly and
   irreproachably we have arrived at the conclusions contained in this our
   constitution.  Wherefore we condemn and anathematize Theodore, formerly
   bishop of Mopsuestia, and his impious writings, together with all other
   heretics, who (as is manifest) have been condemned and anathematized by
   the four holy Synods aforesaid, and by the Catholic Church:  also the
   writings of Theodoret which are opposed to the right faith, and are
   against the Twelve Chapters of St. Cyril, and against the first Council
   of Ephesus, which were written by him in defence of Theodore and
   Nestorius.

   Moreover we anathematize and condemn the letter to the Persian heretic
   Maris, which is said to have been written by Ibas, which denies that
   Christ the Word was incarnate of the holy Mother of God and ever-virgin
   Mary, and was made man, but declares that a mere man was born of her,
   and this man it styles a temple, so from this we are given to
   understand that God the Word is one [Person] and Christ another
   [Person].  Moreover it calumniates Saint Cyril, the master and herald
   of the orthodox faith, calling him a heretic, and charging him with
   writing things similar to Apollinaris; and it reviles the first Synod
   of Ephesus, as having condemned Nestorius without deliberation or
   investigation; it likewise declares the twelve chapters of St. Cyril to
   be impious and contrary to the right faith; and further still it
   defends Theodore and Nestorius, and their impious teachings and
   writings.

   Therefore we anathematize and condemn the aforesaid impious Three
   Chapters, to-wit, the impious Theodore of Mopsuestia and his impious
   writings; And all that Theodoret impiously wrote, as well as the letter
   said to have been written by Ibas, in which are contained the above
   mentioned profane blasphemies.  We likewise subject to anathema whoever
   shall at any time believe that these chapters should be received or
   defended; or shall attempt to subvert this present condemnation.

   And further we define that they are our brethren and fellow-priests who
   ever keep the right faith set forth by those afore-mentioned synods,
   and shall have condemned the above-named Three Chapters, or even do now
   condemn them.

   And further we annul and evacuate by this present written definition of
   ours whatever has been said by me (a me) or by others in defence of the
   aforesaid Three Chapters.

   Far be it from the Catholic Church that anyone should say that all the
   blasphemies above related or they who held and followed such things,
   were received by the before-mentioned four synods or by any one of
   them.  For it is most clear, that no one was admitted by the
   before-mentioned holy Fathers and especially by the Council of
   Chalcedon, about whom there was any suspicion, unless he had first
   repelled the above-named blasphemies and all like to them, or else had
   denied and condemned the heresy or blasphemies of which he was
   suspected.

   Subscription.

   May God preserve thee in health, most honourable brother.  Dated VI.
   Id. Dec. in the xxij^d year of our lord the Emperor Justinian, eternal
   Augustus, the xij^th year after the consulate of the illustrious Basil.

   Historical Excursus on the After History of the Council.

   Pope Vigilius died on his way home, but not until, as we have seen, he
   had accepted and approved the action of the council in doing exactly
   that which he "by the authority of the Apostolic See" in his
   Constitutum had forbidden it to do. [324]   He died at the end of 554
   or the beginning of 555.

   Pelagius I., who succeeded him in the See of Rome, likewise confirmed
   the Acts of the Fifth Synod.  The council however was not received in
   all parts of the West, although it had obtained the approval of the
   Pope.  It was bitterly opposed in the whole of the north of Italy, in
   England, France, and Spain, and also in Africa and Asia.  The African
   opposition died out by 559, but Milan was in schism until 571, when
   Pope Justin II. published his "Henoticon."  In Istria the matter was
   still more serious, and when in 607 the bishop of Aquileia-Grado with
   those of his suffragans who were subject to the Empire made their
   submission and were reconciled to the Church, the other bishops of his
   jurisdiction set up a schismatical Patriarchate at old Aquileia, and
   this schism continued till the Council of Aquileia in 700.  But before
   this the II. Council of Constantinople was received all the world over
   as the Fifth Ecumenical Council; and was fully recognized as such by
   the Sixth Council in 680.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [324] The last sentence of the Constitutum, the sentence which the Pope
   gave and which the council rejected, is as follows:  "We ordain and
   decree that it be permitted to no one who stands in ecclesiastical
   order of office, to write or bring forward, or undertake, or teach
   anything contrary to the contents of this Constitutum in regard to the
   Three Chapters, or, after this declaration begin a new controversy
   about them.  And if anything has already been done or spoken in regard
   of the Three Chapters in contradiction of this our ordinance by anyone
   whomsoever, this we declare void by the authority of the Apostolic
   See."  It is perfectly clear that the Emperor is the "anyone" referred
   to.

   Historical Introduction.

   The Sixth Ecumenical Council met on November 7, 680, for its first
   session, and ended its meetings, which are said to have been eighteen
   in number, on September 16th of the next year.  The number of bishops
   present was under three hundred and the minutes of the last session
   have only 174 signatures attached to them.

   When the Emperor first summoned the council he had no intention that it
   should be ecumenical.  From the Sacras it appears that he had summoned
   all the Metropolitans and bishops of the jurisdiction of
   Constantinople, and had also informed the Archbishop of Antioch that he
   might send Metropolitans and bishops.  A long time before he had
   written to Pope Agatho on the subject.

   When the synod assembled however, it assumed at its first session the
   title "Ecumenical," and all the five patriarchs were represented,
   Alexandria and Jerusalem having sent deputies although they were at the
   time in the hands of the infidel.

   In this Council the Emperor presided in person surrounded by high court
   officials.  On his right sat the Patriarchs of Constantinople and
   Antioch and next to them the representative of the Patriarch of
   Alexandria.  On the Emperor's left were seated the representatives of
   the Pope.  In the midst were placed, as usual, the Holy Gospels.  After
   the eleventh session however the Emperor was no longer able to be
   present, but returned and presided at the closing meeting.

   The sessions of the council were held in the domed hall (or possibly
   chapel) in the imperial palace; which, the Acts tell us, was called
   Trullo (en to sekreto tou theiou palatiou, to houto legomeno Troullo).

   It may be interesting to remark that the Sacras sent to the bishops of
   Rome and Constantinople are addressed, the one to "The Most holy and
   Blessed Archbishop of Old Rome and Ecumenical Pope," and the other to
   "The Most holy and Blessed Archbishop of Constantinople and Ecumenical
   Patriarch."  Some of the titles given themselves by the signers of the
   "Prosphoneticus" are interesting--"George, an humble presbyter of the
   holy Roman Church, and holding the place of the most blessed Agatho,
   ecumenical Pope of the City of Rome...," "John, an humble deacon of the
   holy Roman Church and holding the place of the most blessed Agatho, and
   ecumenical Pope of the City of Rome...," "George, by the mercy of God
   bishop of Constantinople which is New Rome," "Peter a presbyter and
   holding the place of the Apostolic See of the great city
   Alexandria...," "George, an humble presbyter of the Holy Resurrection
   of Christ our God, and holding the place of Theodore the presbyter,
   beloved of God, who holds the place of the Apostolic See of
   Jerusalem...," "John, by the mercy of God bishop of the City of
   Thessalonica, and legate of the Apostolic See of Rome," "John, the
   unworthy bishop of Portus, legate of the whole Council of the holy
   Apostolic See of Rome," "Stephen, by the mercy of God, bishop of
   Corinth, and legate of the Apostolic See of Old Rome."

   Extracts from the Acts.

   Session I.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 609 et seqq.)

   [After a history of the assembly of the Council, the Acts begin with
   the Speech of the Papal Legates, as follows:]

   Most benign lord, in accordance with the Sacra to our most holy Pope
   [325] from your God-instructed majesty, we have been sent by him to the
   most holy footsteps of your God-confirmed serenity, bearing with us his
   suggestion (anaphoras, suggestione) as well as the other suggestion of
   his Synod equally addressed to your divinely preserved Piety by the
   venerable bishops subject to it, which also we offered to your
   God-crowned Fortitude.  Since, then, during the past forty-six years,
   more or less, certain novelties in expression, contrary to the Orthodox
   faith, have been introduced by those who were at several times bishops
   of this, your royal and God-preserved city, to wit:  Sergius, Paul,
   Pyrrhus, and Peter, as also by Cyrus, at one time archbishop of the
   city of Alexandria, as well also as by Theodore, who was bishop of a
   city called Pharan, and by certain others their followers, and since
   these things have in no small degree brought confusion into the Church
   throughout the whole world, for they taught dogmatically that there was
   but one will in the dispensation of the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, one of the Holy Trinity, and one operation; and since many
   times your servant, our apostolic see, has fought against this, and
   then prayed against it, and by no means been able, even up to now, to
   draw away from such a depraved opinion its advocates, we beseech your
   God-crowned fortitude, that such as share these views of the most holy
   church of Constantinople may tell us, what is the source of this
   new-fangled language.

   [Answer of the Monothelites made at the Emperor's bidding:]

   We have brought out no new method of speech, but have taught whatever
   we have received from the holy Ecumenical Synods, and from the holy
   approved Fathers, as well as from the archbishops of this imperial
   city, to wit:  Sergius, Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter, as also from Honorius
   who was Pope of Old Rome, and from Cyrus who was Pope of Alexandria,
   that is to say with reference to will and operation, and so we have
   believed, and so we believe, so we preach; and further we are ready to
   stand by, and defend this faith.

   The Letter of Agatho, Pope of Old Rome, to the Emperor, and the Letter
   of Agatho and of 125 Bishops of the Roman Synod, Addressed to the Sixth
   Council.

   (Read at the Fourth Session, November 15, at the request of George,
   Patriarch of Constantinople and his Suffragans.)

   Introductory Note.

   (Bossuet, Defensio Cler. Gal. Lib. VII., cap. xxiv.)

   All the fathers spoke one by one, and only after examination were the
   letters of St. Agatho and the whole Western Council approved.  Agatho,
   indeed, and the Western Bishops put forth their decrees thus [We have
   directed persons from our humility to your valour protected of God,
   which shall offer to you the report of us all, that is, of all the
   Bishops in the Northern or Western Regions, in which too we have summed
   up the confession of our Apostolic Faith, yet [326] ] not as those who
   wished to contend about these things as being uncertain, but, being
   certain and unchangeable to see them forth in a brief definition,
   [suppliantly beseeching you that, by the favour of your sacred majesty,
   you would command these same things to be preached to all, and to have
   force with all.']  Undoubtedly, therefore, so far as in them lay, they
   defined the matter.  The question was, whether the other Churches
   throughout the world would agree, and a matter so great was only made
   clear after Episcopal examination.  But the high, magnificent, yet true
   expressions, which St. Agatho had used of his See, namely, that resting
   on the promise of the Lord it had never turned aside from the path of
   truth, and that its Pontiffs, the predecessors of Agatho, who were
   charged in the person of Peter to strengthen their brethren, had ever
   discharged that office, this the Fathers of the Council hear and
   receive.  But not the less they examine the matter, they inquire into
   the decrees of Roman Pontiffs, and, after inquiry held, approve
   Agatho's decrees, condemn those of Honorius:  a certain proof that they
   did not understand Agatho's expressions as if it were necessary to
   receive without discussion every decree of Roman Pontiffs even de fide,
   inasmuch as they are subjected to the supreme and final examination of
   a General Council:  but as if these expressions taken as a whole, in
   their total, hold good in the full and complete succession of Peter, as
   we have often said, and in its proper place shall say at greater
   length.

   The Letter of Pope Agatho.

   (Found in Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. LXXXVII., col. 1161; L. and C., Tom.
   VI., col. 630.)

   Agatho a bishop and servant of the servants of God to the most devout
   and serene victors and conquerors, our most beloved sons and lovers of
   God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Emperor Constantine the Great,
   and to Heraclius and Tiberius, Augustuses.

   While contemplating the various anxieties of human life, and while
   groaning with vehement weeping before the one true God, in prayer that
   he might impart to my wavering soul the comfort of his divine mercy,
   and might lift me by his right hand out of the depths of grief and
   anxiety, I most gratefully recognize, my most illustrious lords and
   sons, that your purpose [i.e. of holding a Council] afforded me deep
   and wonderful consolation.  For it was most pious and emanated from
   your most meek tranquillity, taught by the divine benignity for the
   benefit of the Christian commonwealth divinely entrusted to your
   keeping, that your imperial power and clemency might have a care to
   enquire diligently concerning the things of God (through whom Kings do
   reign, who is himself King of Kings and Lord of Lords) and might seek
   after the truth of his spotless faith as it has been handed down by the
   Apostles and by the Apostolic Fathers, and be zealously affected to
   command that in all the churches the pure tradition be held.  And that
   no one may be ignorant of this pious intention of yours, or suspect
   that we have been compelled by force, and have not freely consented to
   the carrying into effect of the imperial decrees touching the preaching
   of our evangelical faith which was addressed to our predecessor Donus,
   a pontiff of Apostolic memory, they have through our ministry been sent
   to and entirely approved by all nations and peoples; for these decrees
   the Holy Spirit by his grace dictated to the tongue of the imperial
   pen, out of the treasure of a pure heart, as the words of an adviser
   not of an oppressor, defending himself, not looking with contempt upon
   others; not afflicting, but exhorting; and inviting to those things
   which are of God in godly wise, because he, the Maker and Redeemer of
   all men, who had he come in the majesty of his Godhead into the world,
   might have terrified mortals, preferred to descend through his
   inestimable clemency and humility to the estate of us whom he had
   created and thus to redeem us, who also expects from us a willing
   confession of the true faith.

   And this it is that the blessed Peter, the prince of the Apostles,
   teaches:  "Feed the flock of Christ which is among you, not by
   constraint, but willingly, exhorting it according to God."  Therefore,
   encouraged by these imperial decrees, O most meek lords of all things,
   and relieved from the depths of affliction and raised to the hope of
   consolation, I have begun, refreshed somewhat by a better confidence,
   to comply with promptness with the things which were sometime ago
   bidden by the Sacra of your gentlest fortitude, and am endeavouring in
   obedience therewith to find persons, such as our deficient times and
   the quality of this obedient province permit, and taking advice with my
   fellow-servant bishops, as well concerning the approaching synod of
   this Apostolic See, as concerning our own clergy, the lovers of the
   Christian Empire, and, afterwards concerning the religious servants of
   God, that I might exhort them to follow in haste the footsteps of your
   most pious Tranquillity.  And, were it not that the great compass of
   the provinces, in which our humility's council is situated had caused
   so great a loss of time, our servitude a while ago could have fulfilled
   with studious obedience what even now has scarcely been done.  For
   while from the various provinces a council has been gathering about us,
   and while we have been able to select some persons of those from this
   very Roman city immediately subject to your most serene power, or from
   those near by, others again we have been obliged to wait for from far
   distant provinces, in which the word of Christian faith was preached by
   those sent by the predecessors of my littleness; and thus quite a space
   of time has elapsed:  and I pass over my bodily pains in consequence of
   which life to a perpetually suffering person is neither possible nor
   pleasant.  Therefore, most Christian lords and sons, in accordance with
   the most pious jussio of your God-protected clemency, we have had a
   care to send, with the devotion of a prayerful heart (from the
   obedience we owe you, not because we relied on the [superabundant]
   knowledge of those whom we send to you), our fellow-servants here
   present, Abundantius, John, and John, our most reverend brother
   bishops, Theodore and George our most beloved sons and presbyters, with
   our most beloved son John, a deacon, and with Constantine, a subdeacon
   of this holy spiritual mother, the Apostolic See, as well as Theodore,
   the presbyter legate of the holy Church of Ravenna and the religious
   servants of God the monks.  For, among men placed amid the Gentiles,
   and earning their daily bread by bodily labour with considerable
   distraction, how could a knowledge of the Scriptures, in its fulness,
   be found unless what has been canonically defined by our holy and
   apostolic predecessors, and by the venerable five councils, we preserve
   in simplicity of heart, and without any distorting keep the faith come
   to us from the Fathers, always desirous and endeavouring to possess
   that one and chiefest good, viz.:  that nothing be diminished from the
   things canonically defined, and that nothing be changed nor added
   thereto, but that those same things, both in words and sense, be
   guarded untouched?  To these same commissioners we also have given the
   witness of some of the holy Fathers, whom this Apostolic Church of
   Christ receives, together with their books, so that, having obtained
   from the power of your most benign Christianity the privilege of
   suggesting, they might out of these endeavour to give satisfaction,
   (when your imperial Meekness shall have so commanded) as to what this
   Apostolic Church of Christ, their spiritual mother and the mother of
   your God-sprung empire, believes and preaches, not in words of worldly
   eloquence, which are not at the command of ordinary men, but in the
   integrity of the apostolic faith, in which having been taught from the
   cradle, we pray that we may serve and obey the Lord of heaven, the
   Propagator of your Christian empire, even unto the end.  Consequently,
   we have granted them faculty or authority with your most tranquil
   mightiness, to afford satisfaction with simplicity whenever your
   clemency shall command, it being enjoined on them as a limitation that
   they presume not to add to, take away, or to change anything; but that
   they set forth this tradition of the Apostolic See in all sincerity as
   it has been taught by the apostolic pontiffs, who were our
   predecessors.  For these delegates we most humbly implore with bent
   knees of the mind your clemency ever full of condescension, that
   agreeably to the most benign and most august promise of the imperial
   Sacra, your Christlike Tranquillity may deem them worthy of acceptance
   and may deign to give a favourable hearing to their most humble
   suggestions.  Thus may your meekest Piety find the ears of Almighty God
   open to your prayers, and may you order that they return to their own
   unharmed in their rectitude of our Apostolic faith, as well as in the
   integrity of their bodies.  And thus may the supernal Majesty restore
   to the benign rule of your government through the most heroic and
   unconquerable labours of your God-strengthened clemency, the whole
   Christian commonwealth, and may he subdue hostile nations to your
   mighty sceptre, that there may be satisfaction from this time forth to
   every soul and to all nations, because what you deigned to promise
   solemnly by your most august letters about the immunity and safety of
   those who came to the Council, you have fulfilled in all respects.  It
   is not their wisdom that gave us confidence to make bold to send them
   to your pious presence; but our littleness obediently complied with
   what your imperial benignity, with a gracious order, exhorted to.  And
   briefly we shall intimate to your divinely instructed Piety, what the
   strength of our Apostolic faith contains, which we have received
   through Apostolic tradition and through the tradition of the
   Apostolical pontiffs, and that of the five holy general synods, through
   which the foundations of Christ's Catholic Church have been
   strengthened and established; this then is the status [and the regular
   tradition [327] ] of our Evangelical and Apostolic faith, to wit, that
   as we confess the holy and inseparable Trinity, that is, the Father,
   the Son and the Holy Ghost, to be of one deity, of one nature and
   substance or essence, so we will profess also that it has one natural
   will, power, operation, domination, majesty, potency, and glory.  And
   whatever is said of the same Holy Trinity essentially in singular
   number we understand to refer to the one nature of the three
   consubstantial Persons, having been so taught by canonical logic.  But
   when we make a confession concerning one of the same three Persons of
   that Holy Trinity, of the Son of God, or God the Word, and of the
   mystery of his adorable dispensation according to the flesh, we assert
   that all things are double in the one and the same our Lord and Saviour
   Jesus Christ according to the Evangelical tradition, that is to say, we
   confess his two natures, to wit the divine and the human, of which and
   in which he, even after the wonderful and inseparable union, subsists.
   And we confess that each of his natures has its own natural propriety,
   and that the divine, has all things that are divine, without any sin.
   And we recognize that each one (of the two natures) of the one and the
   same incarnated, that is, humanated (humanati) Word of God is in him
   unconfusedly, inseparably and unchangeably, intelligence alone
   discerning a unity, to avoid the error of confusion.  For we equally
   detest the blasphemy of division and of commixture.  For when we
   confess two natures and two natural wills, and two natural operations
   in our one Lord Jesus Christ, we do not assert that they are contrary
   or opposed one to the other (as those who err from the path of truth
   and accuse the apostolic tradition of doing.  Far be this impiety from
   the hearts of the faithful!), nor as though separated (per se
   separated) in two persons or subsistences, but we say that as the same
   our Lord Jesus Christ has two natures so also he has two natural wills
   and operations, to wit, the divine and the human:  the divine will and
   operation he has in common with the coessential Father from all
   eternity:  the human, he has received from us, taken with our nature in
   time.  This is the apostolic and evangelic tradition, which the
   spiritual mother of your most felicitous empire, the Apostolic Church
   of Christ, holds.

   This is the pure expression of piety.  This is the true and immaculate
   profession of the Christian religion, not invented by human cunning,
   but which was taught by the Holy Ghost through the princes of the
   Apostles.  This is the firm and irreprehensible doctrine of the holy
   Apostles, the integrity of the sincere piety of which, so long as it is
   preached freely, defends the empire of your Tranquillity in the
   Christian commonwealth, and exults [will defend it, will render it
   stable; and exulting], and (as we firmly trust) will demonstrate it
   full of happiness.  Believe your most humble [servant], my most
   Christian lords and sons, that I am pouring forth these prayers with my
   tears, or its stability and exultation [in Greek exaltation].  And
   these things I (although unworthy and insignificant) dare advise
   through my sincere love, because your God-granted victory is our
   salvation, the happiness of your Tranquillity is our joy, the
   harmlessness of your kindness is the security of our littleness.  And
   therefore I beseech you with a contrite heart and rivers of tears, with
   prostrated mind, deign to stretch forth your most clement right hand to
   the Apostolic doctrine which the co-worker of your pious labours, the
   blessed apostle Peter, has delivered, that it be not hidden under a
   bushel, but that it be preached in the whole earth more shrilly than a
   bugle:  because the true confession thereof for which Peter was
   pronounced blessed by the Lord of all things, was revealed by the
   Father of heaven, for he received from the Redeemer of all himself, by
   three commendations, the duty of feeding the spiritual sheep of the
   Church; under whose protecting shield, this Apostolic Church of his has
   never turned away from the path of truth in any direction of error,
   whose authority, as that of the Prince of all the Apostles, the whole
   Catholic Church, and the Ecumenical Synods have faithfully embraced,
   and followed in all things; and all the venerable Fathers have embraced
   its Apostolic doctrine, through which they as the most approved
   luminaries of the Church of Christ have shone; and the holy orthodox
   doctors have venerated and followed it, while the heretics have pursued
   it with false criminations and with derogatory hatred.  This is the
   living tradition of the Apostles of Christ, which his Church holds
   everywhere, which is chiefly to be loved and fostered, and is to be
   preached with confidence, which conciliates with God through its
   truthful confession, which also renders one commendable to Christ the
   Lord, which keeps the Christian empire of your Clemency, which gives
   far-reaching victories to your most pious Fortitude from the Lord of
   heaven, which accompanies you in battle, and defeats your foes; which
   protects on every side as an impregnable wall your God-sprung empire,
   which throws terror into opposing nations, and smites them with the
   divine wrath, which also in wars celestially gives triumphal palms over
   the downfall and subjection of the enemy, and ever guards your most
   faithful sovereignty secure and joyful in peace.  For this is the rule
   of the true faith, which this spiritual mother of your most tranquil
   empire, the Apostolic Church of Christ, has both in prosperity and in
   adversity always held and defended with energy; which, it will be
   proved, by the grace of Almighty God, has never erred from the path of
   the apostolic tradition, nor has she been depraved by yielding to
   heretical innovations, but from the beginning she has received the
   Christian faith from her founders, the princes of the Apostles of
   Christ, and remains undefiled unto the end, according to the divine
   promise of the Lord and Saviour himself, which he uttered in the holy
   Gospels to the prince of his disciples:  saying, "Peter, Peter, behold,
   Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat; but I
   have prayed for thee, that (thy) faith fail not.  And when thou art
   converted, strengthen thy brethren."  Let your tranquil Clemency
   therefore consider, since it is the Lord and Saviour of all, whose
   faith it is, that promised that Peter's faith should not fail and
   exhorted him to strengthen his brethren, how it is known to all that
   the Apostolic pontiffs, the predecessors of my littleness, have always
   confidently done this very thing:  of whom also our littleness, since I
   have received this ministry by divine designation, wishes to be the
   follower, although unequal to them and the least of all.  For woe is
   me, if I neglect to preach the truth of my Lord, which they have
   sincerely preached.  Woe is me, if I cover over with silence the truth
   which I am bidden to give to the exchangers, i.e., to teach to the
   Christian people and imbue it therewith.  What shall I say in the
   future examination by Christ himself, if I blush (which God forbid!) to
   preach here the truth of his words?  What satisfaction shall I be able
   to give for myself, what for the souls committed to me, when he demands
   a strict account of the office I have received?  Who, then, my most
   clement and most pious lords and sons, (I speak trembling and prostrate
   in spirit) would not be stirred by that admirable promise, which is
   made to the faithful:  "Whoever shall confess me before men, him also
   will I confess before my Father, who is in heaven"?  And which one even
   of the infidels shall not be terrified by that most severe threat, in
   which he protests that he will be full of wrath, and declares that
   "Whoever shall deny me before men, him also will I deny before my
   Father, who is in heaven"?  Whence also blessed Paul, the apostle of
   the Gentiles, gives warning and says:  "But though we, or an angel from
   the heaven should preach to you any other Gospel from what we have
   evangelized to you, let him be anathema."  Since, therefore, such an
   extremity of punishment overhangs the corruptors, or suppressors of
   truth by silence, would not any one flee from an attempt at curtailing
   the truth of the Lord's faith?  Wherefore the predecessors of Apostolic
   memory of my littleness, learned in the doctrine of the Lord, ever
   since the prelates of the Church of Constantinople have been trying to
   introduce into the immaculate Church of Christ an heretical innovation,
   have never ceased to exhort and warn them with many prayers, that they
   should, at least by silence, desist from the heretical error of the
   depraved dogma, lest from this they make the beginning of a split in
   the unity of the Church, by asserting one will, and one operation of
   the two natures in the one Jesus Christ our Lord:  a thing which the
   Arians and the Apollinarists, the Eutychians, the Timotheans, the
   Acephali, the Theodosians and the Gaianitæ taught, and every heretical
   madness, whether of those who confound, or of those who divide the
   mystery of the Incarnation of Christ.  Those that confound the mystery
   of the holy Incarnation, inasmuch as they say that there is one nature
   of the deity and humanity of Christ, contend that he has one will, as
   of one, and (one) personal operation.  But they who divide, on the
   other hand, the inseparable union, unite the two natures which they
   acknowledge that the Saviour possesses, not however in an union which
   is recognized to be hypostatic; but blasphemously join them by concord,
   through the affection of the will, like two subsistences, i.e., two
   somebodies.  Moreover, the Apostolic Church of Christ, the spiritual
   mother of your God-founded empire, confesses one Jesus Christ our Lord
   existing of and in two natures, and she maintains that his two natures,
   to wit, the divine and the human, exist in him unconfused even after
   their inseparable union, and she acknowledges that each of these
   natures of Christ is perfect in the proprieties of its nature, and she
   confesses that all things belonging to the proprieties of the natures
   are double, because the same our Lord Jesus Christ himself is both
   perfect God and perfect man, of two and in two natures:  and after his
   wonderful Incarnation, his deity cannot be thought of without his
   humanity, nor his humanity without his deity.  Consequently, therefore,
   according to the rule of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of
   Christ, she also confesses and preaches that there are in him two
   natural wills and two natural operations.  For if anybody should mean a
   personal will, when in the holy Trinity there are said to be three
   Persons, it would be necessary that there should be asserted three
   personal wills, and three personal operations (which is absurd and
   truly profane).  Since, as the truth of the Christian faith holds, the
   will is natural, where the one nature of the holy and inseparable
   Trinity is spoken of, it must be consistently understood that there is
   one natural will, and one natural operation.  But when in truth we
   confess that in the one person of our Lord Jesus Christ the mediator
   between God and men, there are two natures (that is to say the divine
   and the human), even after his admirable union, just as we canonically
   confess the two natures of one and the same person, so too we confess
   his two natural wills and two natural operations.  But that the
   understanding of this truthful confession may become clear to your
   Piety's mind from the God-inspired doctrine of the Old and the New
   Testament, (for your Clemency is incomparably more able to penetrate
   the meaning of the sacred Scriptures, than our littleness to set it
   forth in flowing words), our Lord Jesus Christ himself, who is true and
   perfect God, and true and perfect man, in his holy Gospels shews forth
   in some instances human things, in others, divine, and still in others
   both together, making a manifestation concerning himself in order that
   he might instruct his faithful to believe and preach that he is both
   true God and true man.  Thus as man he prays to the Father to take away
   the cup of suffering, because in him our human nature was complete, sin
   only excepted, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;
   nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."  And in another
   passage:  "Not my will, but thine be done."  If we wish to know the
   meaning of which testimony as explained by the holy and approved
   Fathers, and truly to understand what "my will," what "thine" signify,
   the blessed Ambrose in his second book to the Emperor Gratian, of
   blessed memory, teaches us the meaning of this passage in these words,
   saying:  "He then, receives my will, he takes my sorrow, I confidently
   call it sorrow as I am speaking of the cross, mine is the will, which
   he calls his, because he bears my sorrow as man, he spoke as a man, and
   therefore he says:  Not as I will but as thou wilt.'"  Mine is the
   sadness which he has received according to my affection. [328]   See,
   most pious of princes, how clearly here this holy Father sets forth
   that the words our Lord used in his prayer, "Not my will," pertain to
   his humanity; through which also he is said, according to the teaching
   of Blessed Paul the Apostle of the Gentiles, to have "become obedient
   unto death, even the death of the Cross."  Wherefore also it is taught
   us that he was obedient to his parents, which must piously be
   understood to refer to his voluntary obedience, not according to his
   divinity (by which he governs all things), but according to his
   humanity, by which he spontaneously submitted himself to his parents.
   St. Luke the Evangelist likewise bears witness to the same thing,
   telling how the same our Lord Jesus Christ prayed according to his
   humanity to his Father, and said, "Father, if it be possible let the
   cup pass from me; nevertheless not my will but thine be done,"--which
   passage Athanasius, the Confessor of Christ, and Archbishop of the
   Church of Alexandria, in his book against Apollinaris the heretic,
   concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation, also understanding the
   wills to be two, thus explains:  And when he says, "Father, if it be
   possible, let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not my will but thine
   be done," and again, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak;" he
   shews that there are two wills, the one human which is the will of the
   flesh, but the other divine.  For his human will, out of the weakness
   of the flesh was fleeing away from the passion, but his divine will was
   ready for it.  What truer explanation could be found?  For how is it
   possible not to acknowledge in him two wills, to wit, a human and a
   divine, when in him, even after the inseparable union, there are two
   natures according to the definitions of the synods?  For John also, who
   leaned upon the Lord's breast, his beloved disciple, shews forth the
   same self-restraint in these words:  "I came down from heaven not to do
   mine own will but the will of the Father that sent me."  And again:
   "This is the will of him that sent me, that of all that he gave me I
   should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day."
   Again he introduces the Lord as disputing with the Jews, and saying
   among other things:  "I seek not mine own will, but the will of him
   that sent me."  On the meaning of which divine words blessed Augustine,
   a most illustrious doctor, thus writes in his book against Maximinus
   the Arian.  He says, "When the Son says to the Father Not what I will,
   but what thou wilt,' what doth it profit thee, that thou broughtest thy
   words into subjection and sayest, It shews truly that his will was
   subject to his Father, as though we would deny that the will of man
   should be subject to the will of God?  For that the Lord said this in
   his human nature, anyone will quickly see who studies attentively this
   place of the Gospel.  For therein he says, My soul is exceeding
   sorrowful even unto death.'  Can this possibly be said of the nature of
   the One Word?  But, O man, who thinkest to make the nature of the Holy
   Ghost to groan, why do you say that the nature of the Only-begotten
   Word of God cannot be sad?  But to prevent anyone arguing in this way,
   he does not say I am sad;' (and even if he had so said, it could
   properly only have been understood of his human nature) but he says My
   soul is sad,' which soul he has as man; however in this also which he
   said, Not what I will' he shewed that he willed something different
   from what the Father did, which he could not have done except in his
   human nature, since he did not introduce our infirmity into his divine
   nature, but would transfigure human affection.  For had he not been
   made man, the Only Word could in no way have said to the Father, Not
   what I will.'  For it could never be possible for that immutable nature
   to will anything different from what the Father willed.  If you would
   but make this distinction, O ye Arians, ye would not be heretics."

   In this disputation this venerable Father shews that when the Lord says
   "his own" he means the will of his humanity, and when he says not to do
   "his own will," he teaches us not chiefly to seek our own wills but
   that through obedience we should submit our wills to the Divine Will.
   From all which it is evident that he had a human will by which he
   obeyed his Father, and that he had in himself this same human will
   immaculate from all sin, as true God and man.  Which thing St. Ambrose
   also thus treats of in his explanation of St. Luke the Evangelist.

   [After this follows a catena of Patristic quotations which I have not
   thought worth while to produce in full.  After St. Ambrose he cites St.
   Leo, then St. Gregory Nazianzen, then St. Augustine.  (L. & C., col.
   647.)]

   From which testimonies it is clear that each of those natures which the
   spiritual Doctor has here enumerated has its own natural property, and
   that to each one a will ought to be assigned.  For an angelic nature
   cannot have a divine or a human will, neither can a human nature have a
   divine or an angelic will.  For no nature can have anything or any
   motion which pertains to another nature but only that which is
   naturally given by creation.  And as this is the truth of the matter it
   is most certainly clear that we must needs confess that in our Lord
   Jesus Christ there are two natures and substances, to wit, the Divine
   and human, united in his one subsistence or person, and that we further
   confess that there are in him two natural wills, viz.:  the divine and
   the human, for his divinity so far as its nature is concerned could not
   be said to possess a human will, nor should his humanity be believed to
   have naturally a divine will:  And again, neither of these two
   substances of Christ must be confessed as being without a natural will;
   but his human will was lifted up by the omnipotency of his divinity,
   and his divine will was revealed to men through his humanity.
   Therefore it is necessary to refer to him as God such things as are
   divine, and as man such things as are human; and each must be truly
   recognized through the hypostatic union of the one and the same our
   Lord Jesus Christ, which the most true decree of the Council of
   Chalcedon sets forth--[Here follows citation.]  This same thing also
   the holy synod which was gathered together in Constantinople in the
   time of the Emperor Justinian of august memory, teaches in the vii^th.
   chapter of its definitions.  [Here follows the citation.]  Moreover it
   is necessary that we should faithfully keep what those Venerable Synods
   taught, so that we never take away the difference of natures as a
   result of the union, but confess one Christ, true and perfect God and
   also true and perfect man, the propriety of each nature being kept
   intact.  Wherefore, if in no respect the difference of the natures of
   our Lord Jesus Christ has been taken away, it is necessary that we
   preserve this same difference in all its proprieties.  For whoso
   teaches that the difference is in no respect to be taken away, declares
   that it must be preserved in all things.  But when the heretics and the
   followers of heretics say that there is but one will and one operation,
   how is this difference recognized?  Or where is the difference which
   has been defined by this holy Synod preserved?  While if it is asserted
   that there is but one will in him (which is absurd), those who make
   this assertion must needs say that that will is either human or divine,
   or else composite from both, mixed and confused, or (according to the
   teaching of all heretics) that Christ has one will and one operation,
   proceeding from his one composite nature (as they hold).  And thus,
   without any doubt, the difference of nature is destroyed, which the
   holy synods declared to be preserved in all respects even after the
   admirable union.  Because, though they taught that Christ was one, his
   person and substance one, yet on account of the union of the natures
   which was made hypostatically, they likewise decreed that we should
   clearly acknowledge and teach the difference of those natures which
   were united in him, after the admirable union.  Therefore if the
   proprieties of the natures in the same our one Lord Jesus Christ were
   preserved on account of the difference [of the natures], it is
   congruous that we should with full faith confess also the difference of
   his natural wills and operations, in order that we may be shown to have
   followed in all respects their doctrine, and may admit into the Church
   of Christ no heretical novelty.

   And although there exist numerous works of the other holy Fathers,
   nevertheless we subjoin to this our humble exposition a few testimonies
   out of the books which are in Greek, for the sake of fastidiousness.
   [329]

   [Here follows a catena of passages from the Greek fathers, viz.:  St.
   Gregory Theologus, St. Gregory Nyssen, St. John bishop of
   Constantinople, St. Cyril, bishop of Alexandria.  (L. & C., col. 654.)]

   From these truthful testimonies it is also demonstrated that these
   venerable fathers predicated in the one and the same Lord Jesus Christ
   two natural wills, viz.:  a divine and a human, for when St. Gregory
   Nazianzen says, "The willing of that man who is understood to be the
   Saviour," he shows that the human will of the Saviour was deified
   through its union with the Word, and therefore it is not contrary to
   God.  So likewise he proves that he had a human, although deified will,
   and this same he had (as he teaches in what follows) as well as his
   divine will, which was one and the same with that of the Father.  If
   therefore he had a divine and a deified will, he had also two wills.
   For what is divine by nature has no need of being deified; and what is
   deified is not truly divine by nature.  And when St. Gregory Nyssen, a
   great bishop, says that the true confession of the mystery is, that
   there should be understood one human will and another a divine will in
   Christ, what does he bid us understand when he says one and another
   will, except that there are manifestly two wills?

   [He next proceeds to comment upon the passage cited from St. John, then
   upon that from St. Cyril of Alexandria.  After this follow quotations
   from St. Hilary, St. Athanasius, St. Denys the Areopagite, St. Ambrose,
   St. Leo, St. Gregory Nyssen, St. Cyril of Alexandria, which are next
   commented on in their order. He then proceeds:  (L. & C., col. 662.)]

   There are not lacking most telling passages in other of the venerable
   fathers, who speak clearly of the two natural operations in Christ, not
   to mention St. Cyril of Jerusalem, St. John of Constantinople, or those
   who afterwards conducted the laborious conflicts in defence of the
   venerable council of Chalcedon and of the Tome of St. Leo against the
   heretics from whose error the assertion of this new dogma has arisen:
   that is to say, John, bishop of Scythopolis, Eulogius, bishop of
   Alexandria, Euphræmius and Anastasius the elder, most worthy rulers of
   the church of Theopolis, and above all that emulator of the true and
   apostolic faith, the Emperor Justinian of pious memory, whose
   uprightness of faith exalted the Christian State as much as his sincere
   confession pleased God.  And his pious memory is esteemed worthy of
   veneration by all nations, whose uprightness of faith was disseminated
   with praise throughout the whole world by his most august edicts:  one
   of these, to wit, that addressed to Zoilus, the patriarch of
   Alexandria, against the heresy of the Acephali to satisfy them of the
   rectitude of the apostolic faith, we offer to your most tranquil
   Christianity, sending it together with this paper of our lowliness
   through the same carriers.  But lest this declaration should be thought
   burdensome on account of its length, we have inserted in this
   declaration of our humility only a few of the testimonies of the Holy
   Fathers, especially [when writing to those] on whom the care and
   arrangement of the whole world as on a firm foundation are recognized
   to rest; since this is altogether incomparable and great, that the care
   of the whole Christian State being laid aside for a little out of love
   and zeal for true religion, your august and most religious clemency
   should desire to understand more clearly the doctrine of apostolical
   preaching.  For from the different approved fathers the truth of the
   Orthodox faith has become clear although the treatment is short.  For
   the approved fathers thought it to be superfluous to discourse at
   length upon what was evident and clear to all; for who, even if he be
   dull of wit, does not perceive what is evident to all?  For it is
   impossible and contrary to the order of nature that there should be a
   nature without a natural operation:  and even the heretics did not dare
   to say this, although they were, all of them, hunting for human
   craftiness and cunning questions against the orthodoxy of the faith,
   and arguments agreeable to their depravities.

   How then can that now be asserted which never was said by the holy
   orthodox fathers, nor even was presumptuously invented by the profane
   heretics, viz.:  that of the two natures of Christ, the divine and the
   human, the proprieties of each of which are recognized as being
   preserved in Christ, that anyone in sound mind should declare there was
   but one operation?  Since if there is one, let them say whether it be
   temporal or eternal, divine or human, uncreated or created:  the same
   as that of the Father or different from that of the Father.  If
   therefore it is one, that one and the same must be common to the
   divinity and to the humanity (which is absurd), therefore while the Son
   of God, who is both God and man, wrought human things on earth,
   likewise also the Father worked with him according to his nature
   (naturaliter, phusikos); for what things the Father doeth these the Son
   also doeth likewise.  But if (as is the truth) the human acts which
   Christ did are to be referred to his person alone as the Son, which is
   not the same as that of the Father; in one nature Christ worked one set
   of works, and in the other another, so that according to his divinity
   the Son does the same things that the Father does; and likewise
   according to his humanity, what things are proper to the manhood, those
   same, he as man, did because he is truly both God and man.  For which
   reason we rightly believe that that same person, since he is one, has
   two natural operations, to wit, the divine and the human, one
   uncreated, and the other created, as true and perfect God and as true
   and perfect man, the one and the same, the mediator between God and
   men, the Lord Jesus Christ.  Wherefore from the quality of the
   operations there is recognized a difference void of offence (aproskopos
   ) of the natures which are joined in Christ through the hypostatic
   union.  We now proceed to cite some passages from the execrable
   writings of the heretics hated of God, [330] whose words and sayings we
   equally abominate, for the demonstration of those things which our
   inventors of new dogma have followed teaching that in Christ there is
   but one will and one operation.

   [Then follow quotations from Apollinaris, Severus, Theodosius of
   Alexandria.  (L. & C., col. 667.)]

   Behold, most pious lords and sons, by the testimonies of the holy
   Fathers, as by spiritual rays, the doctrine of the Catholic and
   Apostolic Church has been illustrated and the darkness of heretical
   blindness, which is offering error to men for imitation, has been
   revealed.  Now it is necessary that the new doctrine should follow
   somebody, and by whose authority it is supported, we shall note.

   [Here follow quotations from Cyrus of Alexandria, Theodore of Pharon,
   Sergius of Constantinople, Pyrrhus, Paulus his successor, Peter his
   successor.  (L. & C., col. 670.)]

   Let then your God-founded clemency with the internal eye of
   discrimination, which for the guidance of the Christian people you have
   been deemed worthy to receive by the Grace of God, take heed which one
   of such doctors you think the Christian people should follow, the
   doctrine of which one of these they should embrace so as to be saved;
   for they condemn all, and each one of them the other, according as the
   various and unstable definitions in their writings assert sometimes
   that there is one will and one operation, sometimes that there is
   neither one nor two operations, sometimes one will and operation, and
   again two wills and two operations, likewise one will and one
   operation, and again neither one, nor two, and somebody else one and
   two.

   Who does not hate, and rage against, and avoid such blind errors, if he
   have any desire to be saved and seek to offer to the Lord at his coming
   a right faith?  Therefore the Holy Church of God, the mother of your
   most Christian power, should be delivered and liberated with all your
   might (through the help of God) from the errors of such teachers, and
   the evangelical and apostolic uprightness of the orthodox faith, which
   has been established upon the firm rock of this Church of blessed
   Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, which by his grace and guardianship
   remains free from all error, [that faith I say] the whole number of
   rulers and priests, of the clergy and of the people, unanimously should
   confess and preach with us as the true declaration of the Apostolic
   tradition, in order to please God and to save their own souls.

   And these things we have taken pains to insert in the tractate of our
   humility, for we have been afflicted and have groaned without ceasing
   that such grievous errors should be entertained by bishops of the
   Church, who are zealous to establish their own peculiar views rather
   than the truth of the faith, and think that our sincere fraternal
   admonition has its spring in a contempt for them.  And indeed the
   apostolic predecessors of my humility admonished, begged, upbraided,
   besought, reproved, and exercised every kind of exhortation that the
   recent wound might receive a remedy, moved thereto not by a mind filled
   with hatred (God is my witness) nor through the elation of boasting,
   nor through the opposition of contention, nor through an inane desire
   to find some fault with their teachings, nor through anything akin to
   the love of arrogance, but out of zeal for the uprightness of the
   truth, and for the rule of the confession of the pure Gospel, and for
   the salvation of souls, and for the stability of the Christian state,
   and for the safety of those who rule the Roman Empire.  Nor did they
   cease from their admonitions after the long duration of this
   domesticated error, but always exhorted and bore record, and that with
   fraternal charity, not through malice or pertinacious hatred (far be it
   from the Christian heart to rejoice at another's fall, when the Lord of
   all teaches, "I desire not the death of a sinner, but that he be
   converted and live;" and who rejoiceth over one sinner that repenteth
   more than over ninety-and-nine just persons:  who came down from heaven
   to earth to deliver the lost sheep, inclining the power of his
   majesty), but desiring them with outstretched spiritual arms, and
   exhorting to embrace them returning to the unity of the orthodox faith,
   and awaiting their conversion to the full rectitude of the orthodox
   faith:  that they might not make themselves aliens from our communion,
   that is from the communion of blessed Peter the Apostle, whose
   ministry, we (though unworthy) exercise, and preach the faith he has
   handed down, but that they should together with us pray Christ the
   Lord, the spotless sacrifice, for the stability of your most strong and
   serene Empire.

   We believe, most pious lords [singular in the Latin] of all things,
   that there has been left no possible ambiguity which can prevent the
   recognizing of those who have followed the inventors of new dogma.  For
   the sweetness of spiritual understanding with which the sayings of the
   Fathers are full has become evident to the eyes of all; and the stench
   of the heretics, to be avoided by all the faithful, has been made
   notorious.  Nor has it remained unknown that the inventors of new dogma
   have been shewn to be the followers of heretics, and not the walkers in
   the footsteps of the holy Fathers:  therefore whoever wishes to colour
   any error of his whatever, is condemned by the light of truth, as the
   Apostle of the Gentiles says, "For everything that doth make manifest
   is light," for the truth ever remains constant and the same, but
   falsehood is ever varying, and in its wanderings adopting things
   mutually contradictory.  On this account the inventors of the new dogma
   have been shewn to have taught things mutually contradictory, because
   they were not willing to be followers of the Evangelical and Apostolic
   faith.  Wherefore since the truth has shone forth by the observations
   of your God-inspired piety, and falsity which has been exposed has
   attained the contempt which it deserved, it remains that the crowned
   truth may shine forth victoriously through the pious favours of your
   God-crowned clemency; and that the error of novelty with its inventors
   and with those who follow their doctrine, may receive the punishment
   due their presumption, and be cast forth from the midst of the orthodox
   prelates for the heretical pravity of their innovation, which into the
   holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ they have endeavoured to
   introduce, and to stain with the contagion of heretical pravity the
   indivisible and unspotted body of the Church [of Christ].  For it is
   not just that the injurious should injure the innocent, nor that the
   offences of some should be visited upon the inoffensive, for even if in
   this world to the condemned mercy is extended, yet they who are thus
   spared reap for that sparing no benefit in the judgment of God, and by
   those thus sparing them there is incurred no little danger for their
   unlawful compassion.

   But we believe that Almighty God has reserved for the happy days of
   your gentleness the amending of these things, that filling on earth the
   place and zeal of our Lord Jesus Christ himself, who has vouchsafed to
   crown your rule, ye may judge just judgment for his Evangelical and
   Apostolical truth:  for although he be the Redeemer and Saviour of the
   human race yet he suffered injury, and bore it even until now, and
   inspired the empire of your fortitude, so that you should be worthy to
   follow the cause of his faith (as equity demanded, and as the
   determination of the Holy Fathers and of the Five General Synods
   decreed), and that you should avenge, through his guardianship, on the
   spurners of his faith, the injury done your Redeemer and Colleague in
   reigning, thus fulfilling magnanimously with imperial clemency that
   prophetic utterance with which David the King and Prophet, spake to
   God, saying, "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up."  Wherefore
   having been extolled for so God-pleasing a zeal, he was deemed fit to
   hear that blessed word spoken by the Creator of all men, "I have found
   David, a man after my heart, who will do all my will."  And to him also
   it was promised in the Psalms, "I have found David, my servant, with my
   holy oil have I anointed him:  My hand shall aid him and my arm shall
   comfort him," so that the most pious majesty of your Christian clemency
   may work to further the cause of Christ with burning zeal for the sake
   of remuneration, and may he make all the acts of your most powerful
   empire both happy and prosperous, who hath stored up his promise in the
   Holy Gospels, saying, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these
   things shall be added unto you."  For all, to whom has come the
   knowledge of the sacred heads, [331] have been offering innumerable
   thanksgivings and unceasing praises to the defender of your most
   powerful dominion, being filled with admiration for the greatness of
   your clemency, in that you have so benignly set forth the kind
   intention of your august magnanimity; for in truth, as most pious and
   most just princes, you have deigned to treat divine things with the
   fear of God, having promised every immunity to those persons sent to
   you from our littleness.

   And we are confident that what your pious clemency has promised, you
   are powerful to carry out, in order that what has been vowed and
   promised to God by the religious philanthropy beyond your Christian
   power, may nevertheless be fulfilled by the aid of his omnipotency.

   Wherefore let praise by all Christian nations, and eternal memory, and
   frequent prayer be poured forth before the Lord Christ, whose is the
   cause, for your safety, and your triumphs, and your complete victory,
   that the nations of the Gentiles, being impressed by the terror of the
   supernal majesty, may lay down most humbly their necks beneath the
   sceptre of your most powerful rule, that the power of your most pious
   kingdom may continue until the ceaseless joy of the eternal kingdom
   succeeds to this temporal reign.  Nor could anything be found more
   likely to commend the clemency of your unconquerable fortitude to the
   divine majesty, than that those who err from the rule of truth should
   be repelled and the integrity of our Evangelical and Apostolic faith
   should be everywhere set forth and preached.

   Moreover, most pious and God-instructed sons and lords, if the
   Archbishop of the Church of Constantinople shall choose to hold and to
   preach with us this most unblameable rule of Apostolic doctrine of the
   Sacred Scriptures, of the venerable synods, of the spiritual Fathers,
   according to their evangelical understanding, through which the form of
   the truth has been set forth by us through the assistance of the
   Spirit, there will ensue great peace to them that love the name of God,
   and there will remain no scandal of dissension, and that will come to
   pass which is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, when through the
   grace of the Holy Spirit the people had come to the acknowledging of
   Christianity, all of us will be of one heart and of one mind.  But if
   (which God forbid!) he shall prefer to embrace the novelty but lately
   introduced by others; and shall ensnare himself with doctrines which
   are alien to the rule of orthodox truth and of our Apostolic faith, to
   decline which as injurious to souls these have put off, despite the
   exhortation and admonitions of our predecessors in the Apostolic See,
   down to this day, he himself should know what kind of an answer he will
   have to give for such contempt in the divine examination of Christ
   before the judge of all, who is in heaven, to whom when he cometh to
   judgment also we ourselves are about to give an account of the ministry
   of preaching the truth which has been committed to us, or for the
   toleration of things contrary to the Christian religion:  and may we
   (as I humbly pray) preserve unconfusedly and freely, with simplicity
   and purity, whole and undefiled, the Apostolic and Evangelical rule of
   the right faith as we have received it from the beginning.  And may
   your most august serenity, for the affection and reverence which you
   bear to the Catholic and Apostolic right faith, receive the perfect
   reward of your pious labours from our Lord Jesus Christ himself, the
   ruler with you of your Christian empire, whose true confession you
   desire to preserve undefiled, because nothing in any respect has been
   neglected or omitted by your God-crowned clemency, which could minister
   to the peace of the churches, provided always that the integrity of the
   true faith was maintained:  since God, the Judge of all, who disposes
   the ending of all matters as he deems most expedient, seeks out the
   intent of the heart, and will accept a zeal for piety.  Therefore I
   exhort you, O most pious and clement Emperor, and together with my
   littleness every Christian man exhorts you on bended knee with all
   humility, that to all the God-pleasing goodnesses and admirable
   imperial benefits which the heavenly condescension has vouchsafed to
   grant to the human race through your God-accepted care, this also you
   would order, for the redintegration of perfect piety, to offer an
   acceptable sacrifice to Christ the Lord your fellow-ruler, granting
   entire impunity, and free faculty of speech to each one wishing to
   speak, and to urge a word in defence of the faith which he believes and
   holds, so that it may most manifestly be recognized by all that by no
   terror, by no force, by no threat or aversion any one wishing to speak
   for the truth of the Catholic and Apostolic faith, has been prohibited
   or repulsed, and that all unanimously may glorify your imperial
   (divinam) majesty, throughout the whole space of their lives for so
   great and so inestimable a good, and may pour forth unceasing prayers
   to Christ the Lord that your most strong empire may be preserved
   untouched and exalted.  The Subscription.  May the grace from above
   keep your empire, most pious lords, and place beneath its feet the neck
   of all the nations.

   The Letter of Agatho and of the Roman Synod of 125 Bishops which was to
   Serve as an Instruction to the Legates Sent to Attend the Sixth Synod.

   (Found in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 677 et seqq., and
   in Migne, Pat. Lat. Tom. LXXXVII., col. 1215 et seqq.  [This last text,
   which is Mansi's, I have followed].)

   To the most pious Lords and most serene victors and conquerors, our own
   sons beloved of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, Constantine, the
   great Emperor, and Heraclius and Tiberius, Augustuses, Agatho, the
   bishop and servant of the servants of God, together with all the synods
   subject to the council of the Apostolic See.

   [The Letter opens with a number of compliments to the Emperor, much in
   style and matter like the introduction of the preceding letter.  I have
   not thought it worth while to translate this, but have begun at the
   doctrinal part, which is given to the reader in full.  (Labbe and
   Cossart, col. 682.)]

   We believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and
   of all things visible and invisible; and in his only-begotten Son, who
   was begotten of him before all worlds; very God of Very God, Light of
   Light, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father, that
   is of the same substance as the Father; by him were all things made
   which are in heaven and which are in earth; and in the Holy Ghost, the
   Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father, and with the
   Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; the Trinity in
   unity and Unity in trinity; a unity so far as essence is concerned, but
   a trinity of persons or subsistences; and so we confess God the Father,
   God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost; not three gods, but one God, the
   Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost:  not a subsistency of three names,
   but one substance of three subsistences; and of these persons one is
   the essence, or substance or nature, that is to say one is the godhead,
   one the eternity, one the power, one the kingdom, one the glory, one
   the adoration, one the essential will and operation of the same Holy
   and inseparable Trinity, which hath created all things, hath made
   disposition of them, and still contains them.

   Moreover we confess that one of the same holy consubstantial Trinity,
   God the Word, who was begotten of the Father before the worlds, in the
   last days of the world for us and for our salvation came down from
   heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Ghost, and of our Lady, the holy,
   immaculate, ever-virgin and glorious Mary, truly and properly the
   Mother of God, that is to say according to the flesh which was born of
   her; and was truly made man, the same being very God and very man.  God
   of God his Father, but man of his Virgin Mother, incarnate of her flesh
   with a reasonable and intelligent soul:  of one substance with God the
   Father, as touching his godhead, and consubstantial with us as touching
   his manhood, and in all points like unto us, but without sin.  He was
   crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, he suffered, was buried and rose
   again; ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the
   Father, and he shall come again to judge both the quick and the dead,
   and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

   And this same one Lord of ours, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of
   God, we acknowledge to subsist of and in two substances unconfusedly,
   unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably, the difference of the natures
   being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the proprieties
   of each nature being preserved and concurring in one Person and one
   Subsistence, not scattered or divided into two Persons, nor confused
   into one composite nature; but we confess one and the same
   only-begotten Son, God the Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, not one in
   another, nor one added to another, but himself the same in two
   natures--that is to say in the Godhead and in the manhood even after
   the hypostatic union:  for neither was the Word changed into the nature
   of flesh, nor was the flesh transformed into the nature of the Word,
   for each remained what it was by nature.  We discern by contemplation
   alone the distinction between the natures united in him of which
   inconfusedly, inseparably and unchangeably he is composed; for one is
   of both, and through one both, because there are together both the
   height of the deity and the humility of the flesh, each nature
   preserving after the union its own proper character without any defect;
   and each form acting in communion with the other what is proper to
   itself.  The Word working what is proper to the Word, and the flesh
   what is proper to the flesh; of which the one shines with miracles, the
   other bows down beneath injuries.  Wherefore, as we confess that he
   truly has two natures or substances, viz.:  the Godhead and the
   manhood, inconfusedly, indivisibly and unchangeably [united], so also
   the rule of piety instructs us that he has two natural wills and two
   natural operations, as perfect God and perfect man, one and the same
   our Lord Jesus Christ.  And this the apostolic and evangelical
   tradition and the authority of the Holy Fathers (whom the Holy
   Apostolic and Catholic Church and the venerable Synods receive), has
   plainly taught us.

   [The letter goes on to say that this is the traditional faith, and is
   that which was set forth in a council over which Pope Martin presided,
   and that those opposed to this faith have erred from the truth, some in
   one way, and some in another.  It next apologizes for the delay in
   sending the persons ordered by the imperial Sacra, and proceeds thus:
   (Labbe and Cossart, col. 686; Migne, col. 1224).]

   In the first place, a great number of us are spread over a vast extent
   of country even to the sea coast, and the length of their journey
   necessarily took much time.  Moreover we were in hopes of being able to
   join to our humility our fellow-servant and brother bishop, Theodore,
   the archbishop and philosopher of the island of Great Britain, with
   others who have been kept there even till to-day; and to add to these
   divers bishops of this council who have their sees in different parts,
   that our humble suggestion [i.e., the doctrinal definition contained in
   the letters] might proceed from a council of wide-spread influence,
   lest if only a part were cognizant of what was being done, it might
   escape the notice of a part; and especially because among the Gentiles,
   as the Longobards, and the Sclavi, as also the Franks, the French, the
   Goths, and the Britains, there are known to be very many of our
   fellow-servants who do not cease curiously to enquire on the subject,
   that they may know what is being done in the cause of the Apostolic
   faith:  who as they can be of advantage so long as they hold the true
   faith with us, and think in unison with us, so are they found
   troublesome and contrary, if (which may God forbid!) they stumble at
   any article of the faith.  But we, although most humble, yet strive
   with all our might that the commonwealth of your Christian empire may
   be shown to be more sublime than all the nations, for in it has been
   founded the See of Blessed Peter, the prince of the Apostles, by the
   authority of which, all Christian nations venerate and worship with us,
   through the reverence of the blessed Apostle Peter himself.  (This is
   the Latin, which appears to me to be corrupt, the Greek reads as
   follows:  "The authority of which for the truth, all the Christian
   nations together with us worship and revere, according to the honour of
   the blessed Peter the Apostle himself.")

   [The letter ends with prayers for constancy, and blessings on the State
   and Emperor, and hopes for the universal diffusion and acceptance of
   the truth.]

   [The answer of George, with which all his bishops, many of them,
   speaking one by one, agreed except Theodore of Metilene (who handed in
   his assent at the end of the Tenth Session).]

   I have diligently examined the whole force of the suggestions sent to
   your most pious Fortitude, as well by Agatho, the most holy Pope of Old
   [333] Rome, as by his synod, and I have scrutinized the works of the
   holy and approved Fathers, which are laid up in my venerable
   patriarchate, and I have found that all the testimonies of the holy and
   accepted Fathers, which are contained in those suggestions agree with,
   and in no particular differ from, the holy and accepted Fathers.
   Therefore I give my submission to them and thus I profess and believe.

   [The answer of all the rest of the Bishops subject to the See of
   Constantinople.  (Col. 735.)]

   And we, most pious Lord, accepting the teaching of the suggestion sent
   to your most gentle Fortitude by the most holy and blessed Agatho, Pope
   of Old Rome, and of that other suggestion which was adopted by the
   council subject to him, and following the sense therein contained, so
   we are minded, so we profess, and so we believe that in our one Lord
   Jesus Christ, our true God, there are two natures unconfusedly,
   unchangeably, undividedly, and two natural wills and two natural
   operations; and all who have taught, and who now say, that there is but
   one will and one operation in the two natures of our one Lord Jesus
   Christ our true God, we anathematize.

   [The Emperor's demand to Macarius.  (Col. 739.)]

   Let Macarius, the Venerable Archbishop of Antioch, who has now heard
   what has been said by this holy and Ecumenical Synod [demanding the
   expression of his faith], answer what seemeth him good.

   [The answer of Macarius.]

   I do not say that there are two wills or two operations in the
   dispensation of the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, but one will
   and one theandric operation.

   Session XIII.

   (L. and C., Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 943.)

   The holy council said:  After we had reconsidered, according to our
   promise which we had made to your highness, the doctrinal letters of
   Sergius, at one time patriarch of this royal god-protected city to
   Cyrus, who was then bishop of Phasis and to Honorius some time Pope of
   Old Rome, as well as the letter of the latter to the same Sergius, we
   find that these documents are quite foreign to the apostolic dogmas, to
   the declarations of the holy Councils, and to all the accepted Fathers,
   and that they follow the false teachings of the heretics; therefore we
   entirely reject them, and execrate them as hurtful to the soul.  But
   the names of those men whose doctrines we execrate must also be thrust
   forth from the holy Church of God, namely, that of Sergius some time
   bishop of this God-preserved royal city who was the first to write on
   this impious doctrine; also that of Cyrus of Alexandria, of Pyrrhus,
   Paul, and Peter, who died bishops of this God-preserved city, and were
   like-minded with them; and that of Theodore sometime bishop of Pharan,
   all of whom the most holy and thrice blessed Agatho, Pope of Old Rome,
   in his suggestion to our most pious and God-preserved lord and mighty
   Emperor, rejected, because they were minded contrary to our orthodox
   faith, all of whom we define are to be subjected to anathema.  And with
   these we define that there shall be expelled from the holy Church of
   God and anathematized Honorius who was some time Pope of Old Rome,
   because of what we found written by him to Sergius, that in all
   respects he followed his view and confirmed his impious doctrines.  We
   have also examined the synodal letter of Sophronius of holy memory,
   some time Patriarch of the Holy City of Christ our God, Jerusalem, and
   have found it in accordance with the true faith and with the Apostolic
   teachings, and with those of the holy approved Fathers.  Therefore we
   have received it as orthodox and as salutary to the holy Catholic and
   Apostolic Church, and have decreed that it is right that his name be
   inserted in the diptychs of the Holy Churches.

   The Definition of Faith.

   (Found in the Acts, Session XVIII., L. and C., Concilia, Tom. VI., col.
   1019.)

   The holy, great, and Ecumenical Synod which has been assembled by the
   grace of God, and the religious decree of the most religious and
   faithful and mighty Sovereign Constantine, in this God-protected and
   royal city of Constantinople, New Rome, in the Hall of the imperial
   Palace, called Trullus, has decreed as follows.

   The only-begotten Son, and Word of God the Father, who was made man in
   all things like unto us without sin, Christ our true God, has declared
   expressly in the words of the Gospel, "I am the light of the world; he
   that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light
   of life."  And again, "My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto
   you."  Our most gentle Sovereign, the champion of orthodoxy, and
   opponent of evil doctrine, being reverentially led by this divinely
   uttered doctrine of peace, and having convened this our holy and
   Ecumenical assembly, has united the judgment of the whole Church.
   Wherefore this our holy and Ecumenical Synod having driven away the
   impious error which had prevailed for a certain time until now, and
   following closely the straight path of the holy and approved Fathers,
   has piously given its full assent to the five holy and Ecumenical
   Synods (that is to say, to that of the 318 holy Fathers who assembled
   in Nice against the raging Arius; and the next in Constantinople of the
   150 God-inspired men against Macedonius the adversary of the Spirit,
   and the impious Apollinaris; and also the first in Ephesus of 200
   venerable men convened against Nestorius the Judaizer; and that in
   Chalcedon of 630 God-inspired Fathers against Eutyches and Dioscorus
   hated of God; and in addition to these, to the last, that is the Fifth
   holy Synod assembled in this place, against Theodore of Mopsuestia,
   Origen, Didymus, and Evagrius, and the writings of Theodoret against
   the Twelve Chapters of the celebrated Cyril, and the Epistle which was
   said to be written by Ibas to Maris the Persian), renewing in all
   things the ancient decrees of religion, and chasing away the impious
   doctrines of irreligion.  And this our holy and Ecumenical Synod
   inspired of God has set its seal to the Creed which was put forth by
   the 318 Fathers, and again religiously confirmed by the 150, which also
   the other holy synods cordially received and ratified for the taking
   away of every soul-destroying heresy.

   The Nicene Creed of the 318 holy Fathers.

   We believe, etc.

   The Creed of the 150 holy Fathers assembled at Constantinople.  We
   believe, etc.

   The holy and Ecumenical Synod further says, this pious and orthodox
   Creed of the Divine grace would be sufficient for the full knowledge
   and confirmation of the orthodox faith.  But as the author of evil,
   who, in the beginning, availed himself of the aid of the serpent, and
   by it brought the poison of death upon the human race, has not
   desisted, but in like manner now, having found suitable instruments for
   working out his will (we mean Theodorus, who was Bishop of Pharan,
   Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter, who were Archbishops of this royal
   city, and moreover, Honorius who was Pope of the elder Rome, Cyrus
   Bishop of Alexandria, Macarius who was lately bishop of Antioch, and
   Stephen his disciple), has actively employed them in raising up for the
   whole Church the stumbling-blocks of one will and one operation in the
   two natures of Christ our true God, one of the Holy Trinity; thus
   disseminating, in novel terms, amongst the orthodox people, an heresy
   similar to the mad and wicked doctrine of the impious Apollinaris,
   Severus, and Themistius, and endeavouring craftily to destroy the
   perfection of the incarnation of the same our Lord Jesus Christ, our
   God, by blasphemously representing his flesh endowed with a rational
   soul as devoid of will or operation.  Christ, therefore, our God, has
   raised up our faithful Sovereign, a new David, having found him a man
   after his own heart, who as it is written, "has not suffered his eyes
   to sleep nor his eyelids to slumber," until he has found a perfect
   declaration of orthodoxy by this our God-collected and holy Synod; for,
   according to the sentence spoken of God, "Where two or three are
   gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them," the
   present holy and Ecumenical Synod faithfully receiving and saluting
   with uplifted hands as well the suggestion which by the most holy and
   blessed Agatho, Pope of ancient Rome, was sent to our most pious and
   faithful Emperor Constantine, which rejected by name those who taught
   or preached one will and one operation in the dispensation of the
   incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ who is our very God, has likewise
   adopted that other synodal suggestion which was sent by the Council
   holden under the same most holy Pope, composed of 125 Bishops, beloved
   of God, to his God-instructed tranquillity, as consonant to the holy
   Council of Chalcedon and to the Tome of the most holy and blessed Leo,
   Pope of the same old Rome, which was directed to St. Flavian, which
   also this Council called the Pillar of the right faith; and also agrees
   with the Synodal Epistles which were written by Blessed Cyril against
   the impious Nestorius and addressed to the Oriental Bishops.  Following
   the five holy Ecumenical Councils and the holy and approved Fathers,
   with one voice defining that our Lord Jesus Christ must be confessed to
   be very God and very man, one of the holy and consubstantial and
   life-giving Trinity, perfect in Deity and perfect in humanity, very God
   and very man, of a reasonable soul and human body subsisting;
   consubstantial with the Father as touching his Godhead and
   consubstantial with us as touching his manhood; in all things like unto
   us, sin only excepted; begotten of his Father before all ages according
   to his Godhead, but in these last days for us men and for our salvation
   made man of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, strictly and
   properly the Mother of God according to the flesh; one and the same
   Christ our Lord the only-begotten Son of two natures unconfusedly,
   unchangeably, inseparably indivisibly to be recognized, the
   peculiarities of neither nature being lost by the union but rather the
   proprieties of each nature being preserved, concurring in one Person
   and in one subsistence, not parted or divided into two persons but one
   and the same only-begotten Son of God, the Word, our Lord Jesus Christ,
   according as the Prophets of old have taught us and as our Lord Jesus
   Christ himself hath instructed us, and the Creed of the holy Fathers
   hath delivered to us; defining all this we likewise declare that in him
   are two natural wills and two natural operations indivisibly,
   inconvertibly, inseparably, inconfusedly, according to the teaching of
   the holy Fathers.  And these two natural wills are not contrary the one
   to the other (God forbid!) as the impious heretics assert, but his
   human will follows and that not as resisting and reluctant, but rather
   as subject to his divine and omnipotent will.  For it was right that
   the flesh should be moved but subject to the divine will, according to
   the most wise Athanasius.  For as his flesh is called and is the flesh
   of God the Word, so also the natural will of his flesh is called and is
   the proper will of God the Word, as he himself says:  "I came down from
   heaven, not that I might do mine own will but the will of the Father
   which sent me!" where he calls his own will the will of his flesh,
   inasmuch as his flesh was also his own.  For as his most holy and
   immaculate animated flesh was not destroyed because it was deified but
   continued in its own state and nature (oro te kai logo), so also his
   human will, although deified, was not suppressed, but was rather
   preserved according to the saying of Gregory Theologus:  "His will
   [i.e., the Saviour's] is not contrary to God but altogether deified."

   We glorify two natural operations indivisibly, immutably, inconfusedly,
   inseparably in the same our Lord Jesus Christ our true God, that is to
   say a divine operation and a human operation, according to the divine
   preacher Leo, who most distinctly asserts as follows:  "For each form
   (morphe) does in communion with the other what pertains properly to it,
   the Word, namely, doing that which pertains to the Word, and the flesh
   that which pertains to the flesh."

   For we will not admit one natural operation in God and in the creature,
   as we will not exalt into the divine essence what is created, nor will
   we bring down the glory of the divine nature to the place suited to the
   creature.

   We recognize the miracles and the sufferings as of one and the same
   [Person], but of one or of the other nature of which he is and in which
   he exists, as Cyril admirably says.  Preserving therefore the
   inconfusedness and indivisibility, we make briefly this whole
   confession, believing our Lord Jesus Christ to be one of the Trinity
   and after the incarnation our true God, we say that his two natures
   shone forth in his one subsistence in which he both performed the
   miracles and endured the sufferings through the whole of his economic
   conversation (di holes autou tes oikonomkes anastrophes), and that not
   in appearance only but in very deed, and this by reason of the
   difference of nature which must be recognized in the same Person, for
   although joined together yet each nature wills and does the things
   proper to it and that indivisibly and inconfusedly.  Wherefore we
   confess two wills and two operations, concurring most fitly in him for
   the salvation of the human race.

   These things, therefore, with all diligence and care having been
   formulated by us, we define that it be permitted to no one to bring
   forward, or to write, or to compose, or to think, or to teach a
   different faith.  Whosoever shall presume to compose a different faith,
   or to propose, or teach, or hand to those wishing to be converted to
   the knowledge of the truth, from the Gentiles or Jews, or from any
   heresy, any different Creed; or to introduce a new voice or invention
   of speech to subvert these things which now have been determined by us,
   all these, if they be Bishops or clerics let them be deposed, the
   Bishops from the Episcopate, the clerics from the clergy; but if they
   be monks or laymen:  let them be anathematized.

   The Prosphoneticus to the Emperor.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 1047 et seqq.)

   [This address begins with many compliments to the Emperor, especially
   for his zeal for the true faith.]

   But because the adversary Satan allows no rest, he has raised up the
   very ministers of Christ against him, as if armed and carrying weapons,
   etc.

   [The various heretics are then named and how they were condemned by the
   preceding five councils is set forth.]

   Things being so, it was necessary that your beloved of Christ majesty
   should gather together this all holy, and numerous assembly.

             *          *          *          *          *
   *          *          *          *          *

   Thereafter being inspired by the Holy Ghost, and all agreeing and
   consenting together, and giving our approval to the doctrinal letter of
   our most blessed and exalted pope, Agatho, which he sent to your
   mightiness, as also agreeing to the suggestion of the holy synod of one
   hundred and twenty-five fathers held under him, we teach that one of
   the Holy Trinity, our Lord Jesus Christ, was incarnate, and must be
   celebrated in two perfect natures without division and without
   confusion.  For as the Word, he is consubstantial and eternal with God
   his father; but as taking flesh of the immaculate Virgin Mary, the
   Mother of God, he is perfect man, consubstantial with us and made in
   time.  We declare therefore that he is perfect in Godhead and that the
   same is perfect likewise in manhood, according to the pristine
   tradition of the fathers and the divine definition of Chalcedon.

   And as we recognize two natures, so also we recognize two natural wills
   and two natural operations.  For we dare not say that either of the
   natures which are in Christ in his incarnation is without a will and
   operation:  lest in taking away the proprieties of those natures, we
   likewise take away the natures of which they are the proprieties.  For
   we neither deny the natural will of his humanity, or its natural
   operation:  lest we also deny what is the chief thing of the
   dispensation for our salvation, and lest we attribute passions to the
   Godhead.  For this they were attempting who have recently introduced
   the detestable novelty that in him there is but one will and one
   operation, renewing the malignancy of Arius, Apollinaris, Eutyches and
   Severus.  For should we say that the human nature of our Lord is
   without will and operation, how could we affirm in safety the perfect
   humanity?  For nothing else constitutes the integrity of human nature
   except the essential will, through which the strength of free-will is
   marked in us; and this is also the case with the substantial
   operation.  For how shall we call him perfect in humanity if he in no
   wise suffered and acted as a man?  For like as the union of two natures
   preserves for us one subsistence without confusion and without
   division; so this one subsistence, shewing itself in two natures,
   demonstrates as its own what things belong to each.

   Therefore we declare that in him there are two natural wills and two
   natural operations, proceeding commonly and without division:  but we
   cast out of the Church and rightly subject to anathema all superfluous
   novelties as well as their inventors:  to wit, Theodore of Pharan,
   Sergius and Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter (who were archbishops of
   Constantinople), moreover Cyrus, who bore the priesthood of Alexandria,
   and with them Honorius, who was the ruler (proedron) of Rome, as he
   followed them in these things.  Besides these, with the best of cause
   we anathematize and depose Macarius, who was bishop of Antioch, and his
   disciple Stephen (or rather we should say master), who tried to defend
   the impiety of their predecessors, and in short stirred up the whole
   world, and by their pestilential letters and by their fraudulent
   institutions devastated multitudes in every direction.  Likewise also
   that old man Polychronius, with an infantile intelligence, who promised
   he would raise the dead and who when they did not rise, was laughed at;
   and all who have taught, or do teach, or shall presume to teach one
   will and one operation in the incarnate Christ....But the highest
   prince of the Apostles fought with us:  for we had on our side his
   imitator and the successor in his see, who also had set forth in his
   letter the mystery of the divine word (theologias).  For the ancient
   city of Rome handed thee a confession of divine character, and a chart
   from the sunsetting raised up the day of dogmas, and made the darkness
   manifest, and Peter spoke through Agatho, and thou, O autocratic King,
   according to the divine decree, with the Omnipotent Sharer of thy
   throne, didst judge.

   *          *          *          *          *          *
   *          *          *          *

   But, O benign and justice-loving Lord, do thou in return do this favour
   to him who hath bestowed thy power upon thee; and give, as a seal to
   what has been defined by us, thy imperial ratification in writing, and
   so confirm them with the customary pious edicts and constitutions, that
   no one may contradict the things which have been done, nor raise any
   fresh question.  For rest assured, O serene majesty, that we have not
   falsified anything defined by the Ecumenical Councils and by the
   approved fathers, but we have confirmed them.  And now we all cry out
   with one mind and one voice, "O God, save the King! etc., etc."

   [Then follow numerous compliments to the Emperor and prayers for his
   preservation.]

   Letter of the Council to St. Agatho.

   (Found in Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. LXXXVII., col. 1247 et seqq.; and
   Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 1071 et seqq.)

   A copy of the letter sent by the holy and Ecumenical Sixth Council to
   Agatho, the most blessed and most holy pope of Old Rome.

   The holy and ecumenical council which by the grace of God and the pious
   sanction of the most pious and faithful Constantine, the great Emperor,
   has been gathered together in this God-preserved and royal city,
   Constantinople, the new Rome, in the Secretum of the imperial (theiou,
   sacri) palace called Trullus, to the most holy and most blessed pope of
   Old Rome, Agatho, health in the Lord.

   Serious illnesses call for greater helps, as you know, most blessed
   [father]; and therefore Christ our true God, who is the creator and
   governing power of all things, gave a wise physician, namely your
   God-honoured sanctity, to drive away by force the contagion of
   heretical pestilence by the remedies of orthodoxy, and to give the
   strength of health to the members of the church.  Therefore to thee, as
   to the bishop of the first see of the Universal Church, we leave what
   must be done, since you willingly take for your standing ground the
   firm rock of the faith, as we know from having read your true
   confession in the letter sent by your fatherly beatitude to the most
   pious emperor:  and we acknowledge that this letter was divinely
   written (perscriptas) as by the Chief of the Apostles, and through it
   we have cast out the heretical sect of many errors which had recently
   sprung up, having been urged to making a decree by Constantine who
   divinely reigns, and wields a most clement sceptre.  And by his help we
   have overthrown the error of impiety, having as it were laid siege to
   the nefarious doctrine of the heretics.  And then tearing to pieces the
   foundations of their execrable heresy, and attacking them with
   spiritual and paternal arms, and confounding their tongues that they
   might not speak consistently with each other, we overturned the tower
   built up by these followers of this most impious heresy; and we slew
   them with anathema, as lapsed concerning the faith and as sinners, in
   the morning outside the camp of the tabernacle of God, that we may
   express ourselves after the manner of David, [334] in accordance with
   the sentence already given concerning them in your letter, and their
   names are these:  Theodore, bishop of Pharan, Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus,
   Paul, Pyrrhus and Peter.  Moreover, in addition to these, we justly
   subjected to the anathema of heretics those also who live in their
   impiety which they have received, or, to speak more accurately, in the
   impiety of these God-hated persons, Apollinaris, Severus and
   Themestius, to wit, Macarius, who was the bishop of the great city of
   Antioch (and him we also stripped deservedly of his pastor's robes on
   account of his impenitence concerning the orthodox faith and his
   obstinate stubbornness), and Stephen, his disciple in craziness and his
   teacher in impiety, also Polychronius, who was inveterate in his
   heretical doctrines, thus answering to his name; and finally all those
   who impenitently have taught or do teach, or now hold or have held
   similar doctrines.

   Up to now grief, sorrow, and many tears have been our portion.  For we
   cannot laugh at the fall of our neighbours, nor exult with joy at their
   unbridled madness, nor have we been elated that we might fall all the
   more grievously because of this thing; not thus, O venerable and sacred
   head, have we been taught, we who hold Christ, the Lord of the
   universe, to be both benign and man-loving in the highest degree; for
   he exhorts us to be imitators of him in his priesthood so far as is
   possible, as becometh the good, and to obtain the pattern of his
   pastoral and conciliatory government.  But also to true repentance the
   most Serene Emperor and ourselves have exhorted them in various ways,
   and we have conducted the whole matter with great religiousness and
   care.  Nor have we been moved to do so for the sake of gain, nor by
   hatred, as you can easily see from what things have been done in each
   session, and related in the minutes, which are herewith sent to your
   blessedness:  and you will understand from your holiness's vicars,
   Theodore and George, presbyters beloved of God, and from John, the most
   religious deacon, and from Constantine, the most venerable sub-deacon,
   all of them your spiritual children and our well-loved brethren.  So
   too you will hear the same things from those sent by your holy synod,
   the holy bishops who rightly and uprightly, in accordance with your
   discipline, decreed with us in the first chapter of the faith.

   Thus, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, and instructed by your doctrine,
   we have cast forth the vile doctrines of impiety, making smooth the
   right path of orthodoxy, being in every way encouraged and helped in so
   doing by the wisdom and power of our most pious and serene Emperor
   Constantine.  And then one of our number, the most holy præsul of this
   reigning Constantinople, in the first place assenting to the orthodox
   compositions sent by you to the most pious emperor as in all respects
   agreeable to the teaching of the approved Fathers and of the
   God-instructed Fathers, and of the holy five universal councils, we
   all, by the help of Christ our God, easily accomplished what we were
   striving after.  For as God was the mover, so God also he crowned our
   council.

   Thereupon, therefore, the grace of the Holy Spirit shone upon us,
   displaying his power, through your assiduous prayers, for the uprooting
   of all weeds and every tree which brought not forth good fruit, and
   giving command that they should be consumed by fire.  And we all agree
   both in heart and tongue, and hand, and have put forth, by the
   assistance of the life-giving Spirit, a definition, clean from all
   error, certain, and infallible; not removing the ancient landmarks,' as
   it is written (God forbid!), but remaining steadfast in the testimonies
   and authority of the holy and approved fathers, and defining that, as
   of two and in two natures (to wit, the divinity and the humanity) of
   which he is composed and in which he exists, Christ our true God is
   preached by us, and is glorified inseparably, unchangeably,
   unconfusedly, and undividedly; just so also we predicate of him two
   natural operations, undividedly, incontrovertibly, unconfusedly,
   inseparably, as has been declared in our synodal definition.  These
   decrees the majesty of our God-copying Emperor assented to, and
   subscribed them with his own hand.  And, as has been said, we rejected
   and condemned that most impious and unsubstantial heresy which affirmed
   but one will and one operation in the incarnate Christ our true God,
   and by so doing we have pressed sore upon the crowd who confound and
   who divide, and have extinguished the inflamed storm of other heresies,
   but we have set forth clearly with you the shining light of the
   orthodox faith, and we pray your paternal sanctity to confirm our
   decree by your honourable rescript; through which we confide in good
   hope in Christ that his merciful kindness will grant freely to the
   Roman State, committed to the care of our most clement Emperor,
   stability; and will adorn with daily yokes and victories his most
   serene clemency; and that in addition to the good things he has here
   bestowed upon us, he will set your God-honoured holiness before his
   tremendous tribunal as one who has sincerely confessed the true faith,
   preserving it unsullied and keeping good ward over the orthodox flocks
   committed to him by God.

   We and all who are with us salute all the brethren in Christ who are
   with your blessedness.

   Excursus on the Condemnation of Pope Honorius.

   To this decree attaches not only the necessary importance and interest
   which belongs to any ecumenical decision upon a disputed doctrinal
   question with regard to the incarnation of the Son of God, but an
   altogether accidental interest, arising from the fact that by this
   decree a Pope of Rome is stricken with anathema in the person of
   Honorius.  I need hardly remind the reader how many interesting and
   difficult questions in theology such an action on the part of an
   Ecumenical Council raises, and how all important, not to say vital, to
   such as accept the ruling of the recent Vatican Council, it is that
   some explanation of this fact should be arrived at which will be
   satisfactory.  It would be highly improper for me in these pages to
   discuss the matter theologically.  Volumes on each side have been
   written on this subject, and to these I must refer the reader, but in
   doing so I hope I may be pardoned if I add a word of counsel--to read
   both sides.  If one's knowledge is derived only from modern Eastern,
   Anglican or Protestant writers, such as "Janus and the Council," the
   Père Gratry's "Letters," or Littledale's controversial books against
   Rome, one is apt to be as much one-sided as if he took his information
   from Cardinal Baronius, Cardinal Bellarmine, Rohrbacher's History, or
   from the recent work on the subject by Pennacchi. [335]   Perhaps the
   average reader will hardly find a more satisfactory treatment than that
   by Bossuet in the Defensio.  (Liber VII., cap. xxi., etc.)

   It will be sufficient for the purposes of this volume to state that
   Roman Catholic Curialist writers are not at one as to how the matter is
   to be treated.  Pennacchi, in his work referred to above, is of opinion
   that Honorius's letters were strictly speaking Papal decrees, set forth
   auctoritate apostolica, and therefore irreformable, but he declares,
   contrary to the opinion of almost all theologians and to the decree of
   this Council, that they are orthodox, and that the Council erred in
   condemning them; as he expresses it, the decree rests upon an error in
   facto dogmatico.  To save an Ecumenical Synod from error, he thinks the
   synod ceased to be ecumenical before it took this action, and was at
   that time only a synod of a number of Orientals!  Cardinal Baronius has
   another way out of the difficulty.  He says that the name of Honorius
   was forged and put in the decree by an erasure in the place of the name
   of Theodore, the quondam Patriarch, who soon after the Council got
   himself restored to the Patriarchal position.  Baronius moreover holds
   that Honorius's letters have been corrupted, that the Acts of the
   Council have been corrupted, and, in short, that everything which
   declares or proves that Honorius was a heretic or was condemned by an
   Ecumenical Council as such, is untrustworthy and false.  The
   groundlessness, not to say absurdity, of Baronius's view has been often
   exposed by those of his own communion, a brief but sufficient summary
   of the refutation will be found in Hefele, who while taking a very
   halting and unsatisfactory position himself, yet is perfectly clear
   that Baronius's contention is utterly indefensible. [336]

   Most Roman controversialists of recent years have admitted both the
   fact of Pope Honorius's condemnation (which Baronius denies), and the
   monothelite (and therefore heretical) character of his epistles, but
   they are of opinion that these letters were not his ex cathedrâ
   utterances as Doctor Universalis, but mere expressions of the private
   opinion of the Pontiff as a theologian.  With this matter we have no
   concern in this connexion.

   I shall therefore say nothing further on this point but shall simply
   supply the leading proofs that Honorius was as a matter of fact
   condemned by the Sixth Ecumenical Council.

   1.  His condemnation is found in the Acts in the xiii^th Session, near
   the beginning.

   2.  His two letters were ordered to be burned at the same session.

   3.  In the xvi^th Session the bishops exclaimed "Anathema to the
   heretic Sergius, to the heretic Cyrus, to the heretic Honorius, etc."

   4.  In the decree of faith published at the xviij^th Session it is
   stated that "the originator of all evil...found a fit tool for his will
   in...Honorius, Pope of Old Rome, etc."

   5.  The report of the Council to the Emperor says that "Honorius,
   formerly bishop of Rome" they had "punished with exclusion and
   anathema" because he followed the monothelites.

   6.  In its letter to Pope Agatho the Council says it "has slain with
   anathema Honorius."

   7.  The imperial decree speaks of the "unholy priests who infected the
   Church and falsely governed" and mentions among them "Honorius, the
   Pope of Old Rome, the confirmer of heresy who contradicted himself."
   The Emperor goes on to anathematize "Honorius who was Pope of Old Rome,
   who in everything agreed with them, went with them, and strengthened
   the heresy."

   8.  Pope Leo II. confirmed the decrees of the Council and expressly
   says that he too anathematized Honorius. [337]

   9.  That Honorius was anathematized by the Sixth Council is mentioned
   in the Trullan Canons (No. j.).

   10.  So too the Seventh Council declares its adhesion to the anathema
   in its decree of faith, and in several places in the acts the same is
   said.

   11.  Honorius's name was found in the Roman copy of the Acts.  This is
   evident from Anastasius's life of Leo II.  (Vita Leonis II.)

   12.  The Papal Oath as found in the Liber Diurnus [338] taken by each
   new Pope from the fifth to the eleventh century, in the form probably
   prescribed by Gregory II., "smites with eternal anathema the
   originators of the new heresy, Sergius, etc., together with Honorius,
   because he assisted the base assertion of the heretics."

   13.  In the lesson for the feast of St. Leo II. in the Roman Breviary
   the name of Pope Honorius occurs among those excommunicated by the
   Sixth Synod.  Upon this we may well hear Bossuet:  "They suppress as
   far as they can, the Liber Diurnus:  they have erased this from the
   Roman Breviary.  Have they therefore hidden it?  Truth breaks out from
   all sides, and these things become so much the more evident, as they
   are the more studiously put out of sight." [339]

   With such an array of proof no conservative historian, it would seem,
   can question the fact that Honorius, the Pope of Rome, was condemned
   and anathematized as a heretic by the Sixth Ecumenical Council.

   The Imperial Edict Posted in the Third Atrium of the Great Church Near
   What is Called Dicymbala.

   In the name of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, our God and Saviour,
   the most pious Emperor, the peaceful and Christ-loving Constantine, an
   Emperor faithful to God in Jesus Christ, to all our Christ-loving
   people living in this God-preserved and royal city.

   [The document is very long, Hefele gives the following epitome, which
   is all sufficient for the ordinary reader, who will remember that it is
   an Edict of the Emperor and not anything proceeding from the council.]

   Hefele's Epitome (Hist. of the Councils, Vol. v., p. 178).

   "The heresy of Apollinaris, etc., has been renewed by Theodore of
   Pharan and confirmed by Honorius, sometime Pope of Old Rome, who also
   contradicted himself.  Also Cyrus, Pyrrhus, Paul, Peter; more
   recently.  Macarius, Stephen, and Polychronius had diffused
   Monothelitism.  He, the Emperor, had therefore convoked this holy and
   Ecumenical Synod, and published the present edict with the confession
   of faith, in order to confirm and establish its decrees.  (There
   follows here an extended confession of faith, with proofs for the
   doctrine of two wills and operations.)  As he recognized the five
   earlier Ecumenical Synods, so he anathematized all heretics from Simon
   Magus, but especially the originator and patrons of the new heresy,
   Theodore and Sergius; also Pope Honorius, who was their adherent and
   patron in everything, and confirmed the heresy (ton kata panta toutois
   sunaireten kai sundromon kai bebaioten tes haireseos, further, Cyrus,
   etc., and ordained that no one henceforth should hold a different
   faith, or venture to teach one will and one energy.  In no other than
   the orthodox faith could men be saved.  Whoever did not obey the
   imperial edict should, if he were a bishop or cleric be deposed; if an
   official, punished with confiscation of property and loss of the girdle
   (zone); if a private person, banished from the residence and all other
   cities."

   The Canons of the Council in Trullo;

   Often Called

   The Quinisext Council.

   a.d. 692.

   Elenchus.

   Introductory Note.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Introductory Note.

   From the fact that the canons of the Council in Trullo are included in
   this volume of the Decrees and Canons of the Seven Ecumenical Councils
   it must not for an instant be supposed that it is intended thereby to
   affirm that these canons have any ecumenical authority, or that the
   council by which they were adopted can lay any claim to being
   ecumenical either in view of its constitution or of the subsequent
   treatment by the Church of its enactments.

   It is true that it claimed at the time an ecumenical character, and
   styled itself such in several of its canons, it is true that in the
   mind of the Emperor Justinian II., who summoned it, it was intended to
   have been ecumenical.  It is true that the Greeks at first declared it
   to be a continuation of the Sixth Synod and that by this name they
   frequently denominate and quote its canons.  But it is also true that
   the West was not really represented at it at all (as we shall see
   presently); that when the Emperor afterwards sent the canons to the
   Pope to receive his signature, he absolutely refused to have anything
   to do with them; and it is further true that they were never
   practically observed by the West at all, and that even in the East
   their authority was rather theoretical than real.

   (Fleury.  Histoire Ecclesiastique, Livre XL., Chap. xlix.)

   As the two last General Councils (in 553 and in 681) had not made any
   Canons, the Orientals judged it suitable to supply them eleven years
   after the Sixth Council, that is to say, the year 692, fifth
   indiction.  For that purpose the Emperor Justinian convoked a Council,
   at which 211 Bishops attended, of whom the principal were the four
   Patriarchs, Paul of Constantinople, Peter of Alexandria, Anastasius of
   Jerusalem, George of Antioch.  Next in the subscriptions are named John
   of Justinianopolis, Cyriacus of Cesarea in Cappadocia, Basil of Gortyna
   in Crete, who says that he represents the whole Council of the Roman
   Church, as he had said in subscribing the Sixth Council.  But it is
   certain otherwise that in this latter council there were present
   Legates of the Holy See.  This council, like the Sixth, [340] assembled
   in the dome of the palace called in Latin Trullus, which name it has
   kept.  It is also named in Latin Quinisextum, in Greek Penthecton, as
   one might say, the fifth-sixth, to mark that it is only the supplement
   of the two preceding Councils, though properly it is a distinct one.

   The intention was to make a body of discipline to serve thenceforth for
   the whole Church, and it was distributed into 102 Canons.

   To this statement by Fleury some additions must be made.  First, with
   regard to the date of the synod.  This is not so certain as would
   appear at first sight.  At the Seventh Ecumenical Council, the
   patriarch Tarasius of Constantinople asserted that, "four or five years
   after the sixth Ecumenical Council the same bishops, in a new assembly
   under Justinian II. had published the [Trullan] Canons mentioned," and
   this assertion the Seventh Council appears to have accepted as true, if
   we understand the sixth session aright.  Now were this statement true,
   the date would be probably 686, but this is impossible by the words of
   the council itself, where we find mention made of the fifteenth of
   January of the past 4th indiction, or the year of the world, 6109.  To
   make this agree at all, scholars tell us that for iv. must be read
   xiv.  But the rest of the statement is equally erroneous, the bishops
   were not the same, as can readily be seen by comparing the
   subscriptions to the Acts.

   The year of the world 6109 is certainly wrong, and so other scholars
   would read 6199, but here a division takes place, for some reckon by
   the Constantinopolitan era, and so fix the date at 691, and others
   following the Alexandrian era fix it at 706.  But this last is
   certainly wrong, for the canons were sent for signature to Pope
   Sergius, who died as early as 701.  Hefele's conclusion is as follows:

   (Hefele.  Hist. of the Councils, Vol. V., p. 222.)

   The year 6199 of the Constantinopolitan era coincides with the year 691
   after Christ and the IV^th Indiction ran from September 1, 690, to
   August 31, 691.  If then, our Synod, in canon iij., speaks of the 15th
   of January in the past Indiction IV., it means January 691; but it
   belongs itself, to the Vth Indiction, i.e., it was opened after
   September 1, 691, and before September 1, 692.

   As this is not a history of the Councils but a collection of their
   decrees and canons with illustrative notes, the only other point to be
   considered is the reception these canons met with.

   The decrees were signed first by the Emperor, the next place was left
   vacant for the Pope, then followed the subscriptions of the Patriarchs
   of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch, the whole number
   being 211, bishops or representatives of bishops.  It is not quite
   certain whether any of the Patriarchs were present except Paul of
   Constantinople; but taking it all in all the probability is in favour
   of their presence. [341]   Blank places were left for the bishops of
   Thessalonica, Sardinia, Ravenna and Corinth.  The Archbishop of Gortyna
   in Crete added to his signature the phrase "Holding the place of the
   holy Church of Rome in every synod."  He had in the same way signed the
   decrees of III. Constantinople, Crete belonging to the Roman
   Patriarchate; as to whether his delegation on the part of the Roman
   Synod continued or was merely made to continue by his own volition we
   have no information.  The ridiculous blunder of Balsamon must be noted
   here, who asserts that the bishops whose names are missing and for
   which blank places were left, had actually signed.

   Pope Sergius refused to sign the decrees when they were sent to him,
   rejected them as "lacking authority" (invalidi) and described them as
   containing "novel errors."  With the efforts to extort his signature we
   have no concern further than to state that they signally failed.  Later
   on, in the time of Pope Constantine, a middle course seems to have been
   adopted, a course subsequently in the ninth century thus expressed by
   Pope John VIII., "he accepted all those canons which did not contradict
   the true faith, good morals, and the decrees of Rome," a truly notable
   statement!  Nearly a century later Pope Hadrian I. distinctly
   recognizes all the Trullan decrees in his letter to Tenasius of
   Constantinople and attributes them to the Sixth Synod.  "All the holy
   six synods I receive with all their canons, which rightly and divinely
   were promulgated by them, among which is contained that in which
   reference is made to a Lamb being pointed to by the Precursor as being
   found in certain of the venerable images."  Here the reference is
   unmistakably to the Trullan Canon LXXXII.

   Hefele's summing up of the whole matter is as follows:

   (Hefele, Hist. of the Councils, Vol. V., p. 242.)

   That the Seventh Ecumenical Council at Nice ascribed the Trullan canons
   to the Sixth Ecumenical Council, and spoke of them entirely in the
   Greek spirit, cannot astonish us, as it was attended almost solely by
   Greeks.  They specially pronounced the recognition of the canons in
   question in their own first canon; but their own canons have never
   received the ratification of the Holy See.

   Thus far Hefele, but it seems that Gratian's statement on the subject
   in the Decretum should not be omitted here.  (Pars I. Dist. XVI., c.
   v.)

   "Canon V.  The Sixth Synod is confirmed by the authority of Hadrian.

   "I receive the Sixth Synod with all its canons.

   "Gratian.  There is a doubt whether it set forth canons but this is
   easily removed by examining the fourth session of the VII^th [VI^th by
   mistake, vide Roman Correctors' note] Synod.

   "For Peter the Bp. of Nicomedia says:

   "C. VI. The Sixth Synod wrote canons.

   "I have a book containing the canons of the holy Sixth Synod.  The
   Patriarch said:  § 1. Some are scandalized through their ignorance of
   these canons, saying:  Did the Sixth Synod make any canons?  Let them
   know then that the Sixth Holy Synod was gathered together under
   Constantine against those who said there is one operation and one will
   in Christ, in which the holy Fathers anathematized these as heretics
   and explained the orthodox faith.

   "II. Pars § 2. And the synod was dissolved in the XIV^th year of
   Constantine.  After four or five years the same holy Fathers met
   together under Justinian, the son of Constantine, and promulgated the
   aforementioned canons, of which let no one have any doubt.  For they
   who under Constantine were in synod, these same bishops under Justinian
   subscribed to all these canons.  For it was fitting that a Universal
   Synod should promulgate ecclesiastical canons.  Item:  § 3. The Holy
   Sixth Synod after it promulgated its definition against the
   Monothelites, the emperor Constantine who had summoned it, dying soon
   after, and Justinian his son reigning in his stead, the same holy synod
   divinely inspired again met at Constantinople four or five years
   afterwards, and promulgated one hundred and two canons for the
   correction of the Church.

   "Gratian.  From this therefore it may be gathered that the Sixth Synod
   was twice assembled:  the first time under Constantine and then passed
   no canons; the second time under Justinian his son, and promulgated the
   aforesaid canons."

   Upon this passage of Gratian's the Roman Correctors have a long and
   interesting note, with quotations from Anastasius, which should be read
   with care by the student but is too long to cite here.

   I close with some eminently wise remarks by Prof. Michaud.

   (E. Michaud, Discussion sur les Sept Conciles OEcuméniques, p. 272.)

   Upon the canons of this council we must remark:

   1.  That save its acceptance of the dogmatic decisions of the six
   Ecumenical Councils, which is contained in the first canon, this
   council had an exclusively disciplinary character; and consequently if
   it should be admitted by the particular churches, these would always
   remain, on account of their autonomy, judges of the fitness or
   non-suitability of the practical application of these decisions.

   2.  That the Easterns have never pretended to impose this code upon the
   practice of the Western Churches, especially as they themselves do not
   practise everywhere the hundred and two canons mentioned.  All they
   wished to do was to maintain the ancient discipline against the abuses
   and evil innovations of the Roman Church, and to make her pause upon
   the dangerous course in which she was already beginning to enter.

   3.  That if among these canons, some do not apply to the actual present
   state of society, e.g., the 8th, 10th, 11th, etc.; if others, framed in
   a spirit of transition between the then Eastern customs and those of
   Rome, do not appear as logical nor as wise as one might desire, e.g.,
   the 6th, 12th, 48th, etc., nevertheless on the other hand, many of them
   are marked with the most profound sagacity.

   The Canons of the Council in Trullo.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 1135 et seqq.)

   Canon I.

   That order is best of all which makes every word and act begin and end
   in God.  Wherefore that piety may be clearly set forth by us and that
   the Church of which Christ is the foundation may be continually
   increased and advanced, and that it may be exalted above the cedars of
   Lebanon; now therefore we, by divine grace at the beginning of our
   decrees, define that the faith set forth by the God-chosen Apostles who
   themselves had both seen and were ministers of the Word, shall be
   preserved without any innovation, unchanged and inviolate.

   Moreover the faith of the three hundred and eighteen holy and blessed
   fathers who were assembled at Nice under Constantine our Emperor,
   against the impious Arius, and the gentile diversity of deity or rather
   (to speak accurately) multitude of gods taught by him, who by the
   unanimous acknowledgment of the faithful revealed and declared to us
   the consubstantiality of the Three Persons comprehended in the Divine
   Nature, not suffering this faith to lie hidden under the bushel of
   ignorance, but openly teaching the faithful to adore with one worship
   the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, confuting and scattering to
   the winds the opinion of different grades, and demolishing and
   overturning the puerile toyings fabricated out of sand by the heretics
   against orthodoxy.

   Likewise also we confirm that faith which was set forth by the one
   hundred and fifty fathers who in the time of Theodosius the Elder, our
   Emperor, assembled in this imperial city, accepting their decisions
   with regard to the Holy Ghost in assertion of his godhead, and
   expelling the profane Macedonius (together with all previous enemies of
   the truth) as one who dared to judge Him to be a servant who is Lord,
   and who wished to divide, like a robber, the inseparable unity, so that
   there might be no perfect mystery of our faith.

   And together with this odious and detestable contender against the
   truth, we condemn Apollinaris, priest of the same iniquity, who
   impiously belched forth that the Lord assumed a body unendowed with a
   soul, [342] thence also inferring that his salvation wrought for us was
   imperfect.

   Moreover what things were set forth by the two hundred God-bearing
   fathers in the city of Ephesus in the days of Theodosius our Emperor,
   the son of Arcadius; these doctrines we assent to as the unbroken
   strength of piety, teaching that Christ the incarnate Son of God is
   one; and declaring that she who bare him without human seed was the
   immaculate Ever-Virgin, glorifying her as literally and in very truth
   the Mother of God.  We condemn as foreign to the divine scheme the
   absurd division of Nestorius, who teaches that the one Christ consists
   of a man separately and of the Godhead separately and renews the Jewish
   impiety.

   Moreover we confirm that faith which at Chalcedon, the Metropolis, was
   set forth in accordance with orthodoxy by the six hundred and thirty
   God-approved fathers in the time of Marcian, who was our Emperor, which
   handed down with a great and mighty voice, even unto the ends of the
   earth, that the one Christ, the son of God, is of two natures, and must
   be glorified [343] in these two natures, and which cast forth from the
   sacred precincts of the Church as a black pestilence to be avoided,
   Eutyches, babbling stupidly and inanely, and teaching that the great
   mystery of the incarnation (oikonomias) was perfected in thought only.
   And together with him also Nestorius and Dioscorus of whom the former
   was the defender and champion of the division, the latter of the
   confusion [of the two natures in the one Christ], both of whom fell
   away from the divergence of their impiety to a common depth of
   perdition and denial of God.

   Also we recognize as inspired by the Spirit the pious voices of the one
   hundred and sixty-five God-bearing fathers who assembled in this
   imperial city in the time of our Emperor Justinian of blessed memory,
   and we teach them to those who come after us; for these synodically
   anathematized and execrated Theodore of Mopsuestia (the teacher of
   Nestorius), and Origen, and Didymus, and Evagrius, all of whom
   reintroduced feigned Greek myths, and brought back again the circlings
   of certain bodies and souls, and deranged turnings [or transmigrations]
   to the wanderings or dreamings of their minds, and impiously insulting
   the resurrection of the dead.  Moreover [they condemned] what things
   were written by Theodoret against the right faith and against the
   Twelve Chapters of blessed Cyril, and that letter which is said to have
   been written by Ibas.

   Also we agree to guard untouched the faith of the Sixth Holy Synod,
   which first assembled in this imperial city in the time of Constantine,
   our Emperor, of blessed memory, which faith received still greater
   confirmation from the fact that the pious Emperor ratified with his own
   signet that which was written for the security of future generations.
   This council taught that we should openly profess our faith that in the
   incarnation of Jesus Christ, our true God, there are two natural wills
   or volitions and two natural operations; and condemned by a just
   sentence those who adulterated the true doctrine and taught the people
   that in the one Lord Jesus Christ there is but one will and one
   operation; to wit, Theodore of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria, Honorius of
   Rome, Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter, who were bishops of this
   God-preserved city; Macarius, who was bishop of Antioch; Stephen, who
   was his disciple, and the insane Polychronius, depriving them
   henceforth from the communion of the body of Christ our God.

   And, to say so once for all, we decree that the faith shall stand firm
   and remain unsullied until the end of the world as well as the writings
   divinely handed down and the teachings of all those who have beautified
   and adorned the Church of God and were lights in the world, having
   embraced the word of life.  And we reject and anathematize those whom
   they rejected and anathematized, as being enemies of the truth, and as
   insane ragers against God, and as lifters up of iniquity.

   But if any one at all shall not observe and embrace the aforesaid pious
   decrees, and teach and preach in accordance therewith, but shall
   attempt to set himself in opposition thereto, let him be anathema,
   according to the decree already promulgated by the approved holy and
   blessed Fathers, and let him be cast out and stricken off as an alien
   from the number of Christians.  For our decrees add nothing to the
   things previously defined, nor do they take anything away, nor have we
   any such power.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   No innovation upon the faith of the Apostles is to be allowed.  The
   faith of the Nicene fathers is perfect, which overthrows through the
   homousion the doctrines of Arius who introduced degrees into the
   Godhead.

   The Synod held under Theodosius the great shall be held inviolate,
   which deposed Macedonius who asserted that the Holy Ghost was a
   servant.

   The two hundred who under Theodosius the Younger assembled at Ephesus
   are to be revered for they expelled Nestorius who asserted that the
   Lord was man and God separately (idikos).

   Those who assembled at Chalcedon in the time of Marcion are to be
   celebrated with eternal remembrance, who deposed Eutyches, who dared to
   say that the great mystery was accomplished only in image, as well as
   Nestorius and Dioscorus, observing equal things in an opposite
   direction.

   One hundred and sixty-five were assembled in the imperial city by
   Justinian, who anathematized Origen, for teaching periods (periodous )
   of bodies and souls, and Theodoret who dared to set himself up to
   oppose the Twelve Chapters of Cyril.

   At Constantinople a Synod was collected under Constantine which
   rejected Honorius of Rome and Sergius, prelate of Constantinople, for
   teaching one will and one operation.

   Aristenus.

   The fifth was held in the time of Justinian the Great at Constantinople
   against the crazy (paraphrons) Origen, Evagrius and Didymus, who
   remodelled the Greek figments, and stupidly said that the same bodies
   they had joined with them would not rise again; and that Paradise was
   not subject to the appreciation of the sense, and that it was not from
   God, and that Adam was not formed in flesh, and that there would be an
   end of punishment, and a restitution of the devils to their pristine
   state, and other innumerable insane blasphemies.

   Canon II.

   It has also seemed good to this holy Council, that the eighty-five
   canons, received and ratified by the holy and blessed Fathers before
   us, and also handed down to us in the name of the holy and glorious
   Apostles should from this time forth remain firm and unshaken for the
   cure of souls and the healing of disorders.  And in these canons we are
   bidden to receive the Constitutions of the Holy Apostles [written] by
   Clement.  But formerly through the agency of those who erred from the
   faith certain adulterous matter was introduced, clean contrary to
   piety, for the polluting of the Church, which obscures the elegance and
   beauty of the divine decrees in their present form.  We therefore
   reject these Constitutions so as the better to make sure of the
   edification and security of the most Christian flock; by no means
   admitting the offspring of heretical error, and cleaving to the pure
   and perfect doctrine of the Apostles.  But we set our seal likewise
   upon all the other holy canons set forth by our holy and blessed
   Fathers, that is, by the 318 holy God-bearing Fathers assembled at
   Nice, and those at Ancyra, further those at Neocæsarea and likewise
   those at Gangra, and besides, those at Antioch in Syria:  those too at
   Laodicea in Phrygia:  and likewise the 150 who assembled in this
   heaven-protected royal city:  and the 200 who assembled the first time
   in the metropolis of the Ephesians, and the 630 holy and blessed
   Fathers at Chalcedon.  In like manner those of Sardica, and those of
   Carthage:  those also who again assembled in this heaven-protected
   royal city under its bishop Nectarius and Theophilus Archbishop of
   Alexandria.  Likewise too the Canons [i.e. the decretal letters] of
   Dionysius, formerly Archbishop of the great city of Alexandria; and of
   Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria and Martyr; of Gregory the
   Wonder-worker, Bishop of Neocæsarea; of Athanasius, Archbishop of
   Alexandria; of Basil, Archbishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia; of Gregory,
   Bishop of Nyssa; of Gregory Theologus; of Amphilochius of Iconium; of
   Timothy, Archbishop of Alexandria; of Theophilus, Archbishop of the
   same great city of Alexandria; of Cyril, Archbishop of the same
   Alexandria; of Gennadius, Patriarch of this heaven-protected royal
   city.  Moreover the Canon set forth by Cyprian, Archbishop of the
   country of the Africans and Martyr, and by the Synod under him, which
   has been kept only in the country of the aforesaid Bishops, according
   to the custom delivered down to them.  And that no one be allowed to
   transgress or disregard the aforesaid canons, or to receive others
   beside them, supposititiously set forth by certain who have attempted
   to make a traffic of the truth.  But should any one be convicted of
   innovating upon, or attempting to overturn, any of the afore-mentioned
   canons, he shall be subject to receive the penalty which that canon
   imposes, and to be cured by it of his transgression.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   Whatever additions have been made through guile by the heterodox in the
   Apostolic Constitutions edited by Clement, shall be cut out.

   This canon defines what canons are to be understood as having received
   the sanction of ecumenical authority, and since these canons of the
   Council in Trullo were received at the Seventh Ecumenical Council in
   its first canon as the canons of the Sixth Ecumenical (of which the
   Quinisext claimed to be a legitimate continuation) there can be no
   doubt that all these canons enumerated in this canon are set forth for
   the guidance of the Church.

   With regard to what councils are intended:  there is difficulty only in
   two particulars, viz., the "Council of Constantinople under Nectarius
   and Theophilus," [344] and the "Council under Cyprian;" the former must
   be the Council of 394, and the latter is usually considered to be the
   III. Synod of Carthage, a.d. 257.

   Fleury.

   (H. E. Liv. xl., chap. xlix.)

   The Council of Constantinople under Nectarius and Theophilus of
   Alexandria must be that held in 394, at the dedication of Ruffinus's
   Church; but we have not its canons...."The canon published by St.
   Cyprian for the African Church alone."  It is difficult to understand
   what canon is referred to unless it is the preface to the council of
   St. Cyprian where he says that no one should pretend to be bishop of
   bishops, or to oblige his colleagues to obey him by tyrannical fear.

   It will be noticed that while the canon is most careful to mention the
   exact number of Apostolic canons it received, thus deciding in favour
   of the larger code, it is equally careful not to assign them an
   Apostolic origin, but merely to say that they had come down to them "in
   the name of" the Apostles.  In the face of this it is strange to find
   Balsamon saying, "Through this canon their mouth is stopped who say
   that 85 canons were not set forth by the holy Apostles;" what the
   council did settle, so far as its authority went, was the number not
   the authorship of the canons.  This, I think, is all that Balsamon
   intended to assert, but his words might easily be quoted as having a
   different meaning.

   This canon is found, in part, in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's
   Decretum, Pars I., Dist. XVI, c. VII.

   [344] The Ultramontane Roisselet de Sauclières, in his Histoire
   chronologique et dogmatique des Conciles de la Chrétieté, Tome III., p.

   made by Ivo, cf. Gratian's Dec., P. I., Dist. xvi., c. vii., note by
   correctors.

   Canon III.

   Since our pious and Christian Emperor has addressed this holy and
   ecumenical council, in order that it might provide for the purity of
   those who are in the list of the clergy, and who transmit divine things
   to others, and that they may be blameless ministrants, and worthy of
   the sacrifice of the great God, who is both Offering and High Priest, a
   sacrifice apprehended by the intelligence:  and that it might cleanse
   away the pollutions wherewith these have been branded by unlawful
   marriages:  now whereas they of the most holy Roman Church purpose to
   keep the rule of exact perfection, but those who are under the throne
   of this heaven-protected and royal city keep that of kindness and
   consideration, so blending both together as our fathers have done, and
   as the love of God requires, that neither gentleness fall into licence,
   nor severity into harshness; especially as the fault of ignorance has
   reached no small number of men, we decree, that those who are involved
   in a second marriage, and have been slaves to sin up to the fifteenth
   of the past month of January, in the past fourth Indiction, the 6109th
   year, and have not resolved to repent of it, be subjected to canonical
   deposition:  but that they who are involved in this disorder of a
   second marriage, but before our decree have acknowledged what is
   fitting, and have cut off their sin, and have put far from them this
   strange and illegitimate connexion, or they whose wives by second
   marriage are already dead, or who have turned to repentance of their
   own accord, having learnt continence, and having quickly forgotten
   their former iniquities, whether they be presbyters or deacons, these
   we have determined should cease from all priestly ministrations or
   exercise, being under punishment for a certain time, but should retain
   the honour of their seat and station, being satisfied with their seat
   before the laity and begging with tears from the Lord that the
   transgression of their ignorance be pardoned them:  for unfitting it
   were that he should bless another who has to tend his own wounds.  But
   those who have been married to one wife, if she was a widow, and
   likewise those who after their ordination have unlawfully entered into
   one marriage that is, presbyters, and deacons, and subdeacons, being
   debarred for some short time from sacred ministration, and censured,
   shall be restored again to their proper rank, never advancing to any
   further rank, their unlawful marriage being openly dissolved.  This we
   decree to hold good only in the case of those that are involved in the
   aforesaid faults up to the fifteenth (as was said) of the month of
   January, of the fourth Indiction, decreeing from the present time, and
   renewing the Canon which declares, that he who has been joined in two
   marriages after his baptism, or has had a concubine, cannot be bishop,
   or presbyter, or deacon, or at all on the sacerdotal list; in like
   manner, that he who has taken a widow, or a divorced person, or a
   harlot, or a servant, or an actress, cannot be bishop, or presbyter, or
   deacon, or at all on the sacerdotal list.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   Priests who shall have contracted second marriages and will not give
   them up are to be deposed.  But those who leave off the wickedness, let
   them cease for a fixed period.  For he that is himself wounded does not
   bless.  But who are implicated in nefarious marriage and who after
   ordination have contracted marriage, after a definite time they shall
   be restored to their grade, provided they remain without offence,
   having plainly broken off the marriage.  But if after it shall have
   been prohibited by this decree they attempt to do so they shall remain
   deposed.

   Zonaras.

   What things pertain to this third canon are only adapted to the time in
   which the canon was passed; and afterwards are of no force at all.  But
   what things the Fathers wished to be binding on posterity are contained
   in the seventeenth and eighteenth canons of the holy Apostles, which as
   having been neglected during the course of time this synod wished to
   renew.

   Van Espen.

   It is clear from this canon that the Emperor very especially intended
   that the indulgence which the Church of Constantinople extended to its
   presbyters and deacons in allowing them the use of marriage entered
   into before ordination, should not be allowed to go any further, nor to
   be an occasion for the violation of that truly Apostolic canon, "The
   bishop, the presbyter, and the deacon must be the husband of one wife."
   I Tim. iii. 2.

   For never did the Constantinopolitan nor any other Eastern Church allow
   by canon a digamist (or a man successively the husband of many wives)
   to be advanced to the order of presbyter or deacon, or to use any
   second marriage.

   Antonio Pereira.

   (Tentativa Theologica. [Eng. trans.] III. Principle, p. 79.)

   In the same manner a second marriage always, and everywhere,
   incapacitated the clergy for Holy Orders and the Episcopate.  This
   appears from St. Paul, 1 Tim. Chap. iii., and Titus, Chap. i., and it
   was expressly enacted by the sixteenth of the Apostolical Canons,
   renewed by the Popes Siricius, Innocent and Leo the Great, and may be
   gathered from the ancient fathers and councils generally received in
   the Church.

   Nevertheless we know from Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus, that many bishops
   remarkable for their learning and sanctity, frequently dispensed with
   this Apostolical law; as Alexander of Antioch, Acacius of Berea,
   Praylius of Jerusalem, Proclus of Constantinople, and others, by whose
   example Theodoret defends his own conduct in the case of Irenæus, in
   ordaining him Archbishop of Tyre, although he had been twice married.
   But what is more surprising in this matter is that, notwithstanding the
   eleventh Decretal of Siricius, and the twelfth of Innocentius the
   First, that they who had either been twice married, or had married
   widows, were incapable of ordination, and ought to be deposed; the
   Council of Toledo, Canon 3, and the First Council of Orange, Canon 25,
   both dispensed with these Pontifical laws.  The first, in order that
   those who had married widows might remain in holy orders; the second,
   that such as had twice married might be promoted to the order of
   subdeacon.  Socrates also observes that although it was a general law
   not to admit catechumens to orders, the bishops of Alexandria were in
   the habit of promoting such to the order of readers and singers.

   Fleury.

   (H. E., Liv. XL., chap. 1.)

   These canons of the Council of Trullo have served ever since to the
   Greeks and to all the Christians of the East as the universal rule with
   regard to clerical continence, and they have been now in full force for
   a thousand years.  That is to say, It is not permitted to men who are
   clerics in Holy Orders to marry after their ordination.  Bishops must
   keep perfect continence, whether before their consecration they are
   married or not.  Priests, deacons, and subdeacons already married can
   keep their wives and live with them, except on the days they are to
   approach the holy mysteries.

   Canon IV.

   If any bishop, presbyter, deacon, sub-deacon, lector, cantor, or
   door-keeper has had intercourse with a woman dedicated to God, let him
   be deposed, as one who has corrupted a spouse of Christ, but if a
   layman let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   A cleric coupled to a spouse of God shall be deposed.  In the case of a
   layman he shall be cut off.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa XXVII., Q. I., c. vj.

   A layman ravishing a nun, by secular law was punished by death.
   Balsamon gives the reference thus:  V Cap. primi tit. iiij. lib.
   Basilic. or cxxiij. Novel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   Let none of those who are on the priestly list possess any woman or
   maid servant, beyond those who are enumerated in the canon as being
   persons free from suspicion, preserving himself hereby from being
   implicated in any blame.  But if anyone transgresses our decree let him
   be deposed.  And let eunuchs also observe the same rule, that by
   foresight they may be free of censure.  But those who transgress, let
   them be deposed, if indeed they are clerics; but if laymen let them be
   excommunicated.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   A priest, even if a eunuch, shall not have in his house a maid or other
   woman except those on whom no suspicion can light.

   See Canon III., of First Ecumenical Council at Nice.  This canon adds
   Eunuchs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   Since it is declared in the apostolic canons that of those who are
   advanced to the clergy unmarried, only lectors and cantors are able to
   marry; we also, maintaining this, determine that henceforth it is in
   nowise lawful for any subdeacon, deacon or presbyter after his
   ordination to contract matrimony but if he shall have dared to do so,
   let him be deposed.  And if any of those who enter the clergy, wishes
   to be joined to a wife in lawful marriage before he is ordained
   subdeacon, deacon, or presbyter, let it be done.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   If any ordained person contracts matrimony, let him be deposed.  If he
   wishes to be married he should become so before his ordination.

   Aristenus points out how this canon annuls the tenth canon of Ancyra,
   which allows a deacon and even a presbyter to marry after ordination
   and continue in his ministry, provided at the time of his ordination he
   had in the presence of witnesses declared his inability to remain
   chaste or his desire to marry.  This present canon follows the XXVI^th
   of the Apostolic canons.

   The last clause of this canon, limited in its application to
   subdeacons, is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XXXII., c. vi.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Excursus on the Marriage of the Clergy.

   On this subject there is a popular misconception which must first be
   removed.  In the popular mind to-day there is no distinction between "a
   married clergy" being allowed, and "the marriage of the clergy" being
   allowed; even theological writers who have attained some repute have
   confused these two things in the most unfortunate and perplexing
   fashion.  It will suffice to mention as an instance of this Bp. Harold
   Browne in his book on the XXXIX. Articles, in which not only is the
   confusion above spoken of made, but the very blunder is used for
   controversial purposes, to back up and support by the authority of the
   ancient Church in the East (which allowed a married clergy) the
   practice of the Nestorians and of the modern Church of England, both of
   which tolerate the marriage of the clergy, a thing which the ancient
   Church abhorred and punished with deposition.

   I cannot better express the doctrine and practice of the ancient Church
   in the East than by quoting the words of the Rev. John Fulton in the
   Introduction to the Third Edition of his Index Canonum. [345]   He
   says:  "Marriage was no impediment to ordination even as a Bishop; and
   Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, equally with other men, were forbidden
   to put away their wives under pretext of religion.  The case was
   different when a man was unmarried at the time of his ordination.  Then
   he was held to have given himself wholly to God in the office of the
   Holy Ministry, and he was forbidden to take back from his offering that
   measure of his cares and his affections which must necessarily be given
   to the maintenance and nurture of his family.  In short, the married
   man might be ordained, but with a few exceptions no man was allowed to
   marry after ordination."  In his "Digest" sub voce "Celibacy" he gives
   the earliest canon law on the subject as follows:  "None of the clergy,
   except readers and singers may marry after ordination (Ap. Can. xxvi.);
   but deacons may marry, if at their ordination they have declared an
   intention to do so (Ancyra x.).  A priest who marries is to be deposed
   (Neocæsarea i.).  A deaconess who marries is to be anathematized (Chal.
   xv.); a monk or dedicated virgin who marries, is to be excommunicated
   (Chal. xvi.).  Those who break their vows of celibacy are to fulfil the
   penance of digamists (Ancyra xix.)." [346]

   We may then take it for a general principle that in no part of the
   ancient Church was a priest allowed to contract holy matrimony; and in
   no place was he allowed to exercise his priesthood afterwards, if he
   should dare to enter into such a relation with a woman.  As I have so
   often remarked it is not my place to approve or disapprove this law of
   the Church, my duty is the much simpler one of tracing historically
   what the law was and what it is in the East and West to-day.  The
   Reformers considered that in this, as in most other matters, these
   venerable churches had made a mistake, but neither the maintenance nor
   the disproof of this opinion in any way concerns me, so far as this
   volume is concerned.  All that is necessary for me to do is to affirm
   that if a priest were at any time to attempt to marry, he would be
   attempting to do that which from the earliest times of which we have
   any record, no priest has ever been allowed to do, but which always has
   been punished as a gross sin of immorality.

   In tracing the history of this subject, the only time during which any
   real difficulty presents itself is the first three centuries, after
   that all is much clearer, and my duty is simply to lay the undisputed
   facts of the case before the reader.

   We begin then with the debatable ground.  And first with regard to the
   Lord, "the great High Priest of our profession," of course there can be
   no doubt that he set the example, or--if any think that he was not a
   pattern for the priests of his Church to follow--at least lived the
   life, of celibacy.  When we come to the question of what was the
   practice of his first followers in this matter, there would likewise
   seem to be but little if any reasonable doubt.  For while of the
   Apostles we have it recorded only of Peter that he was a married man,
   we have it also expressly recorded that in his case, as in that of all
   the rest who had "forsaken all" to follow him, the Lord himself said,
   "Every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or
   father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake
   shall receive an hundred fold and shall inherit eternal life." [347]

   There can be no doubt that St. Paul in his epistles allows and even
   contemplates the probability that those admitted to the ranks of the
   clergy will have been already married, but distinctly says that they
   must have been the "husband of one wife," [348] by which all antiquity
   and every commentator of gravity recognizes that digamists are cut off
   from the possibility of ordination, but there is nothing to imply that
   the marital connexion was to be continued after ordination.  For a
   thorough treatment of this whole subject from the ancient and Patristic
   point of view, the reader is referred to St. Jerome. [349]

   The next stage in our progress is marked by the so-called Apostolical
   Canons.  Now for those who hold that these canons had directly or
   indirectly the Apostles for their author, or that as we have them now
   they are all of even sub-Apostolic date, the matter becomes more
   simple, for while indeed these canons do not expressly set forth the
   law subsequently formulated for the East, they certainly seem to be not
   inconsistent therewith, but rather to look that way, especially Canons
   V. and LI.  But few will be found willing to support so extreme an
   hypothesis, and while indeed many scholars are of opinion that most of
   the canons of the collection we style "Apostolical," are ante-Nicene,
   yet they will not be recognized as of more value than as so many
   mirrors, displaying what was at their date considered pure discipline.
   It is abundantly clear that the fathers in council in Trullo thought
   the discipline they were setting forth to be the original discipline of
   the Church in the matter, and the discipline of the West an innovation,
   but that such was really the case seems far from certain.  Thomassinus
   treats this point with much learning, and I shall cite some of the
   authorities he brings forward.  Of these the most important is
   Epiphanius, who as a Greek would be certain to give the tradition of
   the East, had there been any such tradition known in his time.  I give
   the three great passages.

   "It is evident that those from the priesthood are chiefly taken from
   the order of virgins, or if not from virgins, at least from monks; or
   if not from the order of monks, then they are wont to be made priests
   who keep themselves from their wives, or who are widows after a single
   marriage.  But he that has been entangled by a second marriage is not
   admitted to priesthood in the Church, even if he be continent from his
   wife, or be a widower.  Anyone of this sort is rejected from the grade
   of bishop, presbyter, deacon, or subdeacon.  The order of reader,
   however, can be chosen from all the orders these grades can be chosen
   from, that is to say from virgins, monks, the continent, widowers, and
   they who are bound by honest marriage.  Moreover, if necessity so
   compel, even digamists may be lectors, for such is not a priest, etc.,
   etc." [350]

   "Christ taught us by an example that the priestly work and ornaments
   should be communicated to those who shall have preserved their
   continency after a single marriage, or shall have persevered in
   virginity.  And this the Apostles thereafter honestly and piously
   decreed, through the ecclesiastical canon of the priesthood." [351]

   "Nay, moreover, he that still uses marriage, and begets children, even
   though the husband of but one wife, is by no means admitted by the
   Church to the order of deacon, presbyter, bishop, or subdeacon.  But
   for all this, he who shall have kept himself from the commerce of his
   one wife, or has been deprived of her, may be ordained, and this is
   most usually the case in those places where the ecclesiastical canons
   are most accurately observed." [352]

   Nor is the weight of this evidence lessened, but much increased, by the
   acknowledgment of the same father that in some places in his days the
   celibate life was not observed by such priests as had wives, for he
   explains that such a state of things had come about "not from following
   the authority of the canons, but through the neglect of men, which is
   wont at certain periods to be the case." [353]

   The witness of the Western Fathers although so absolutely and
   indisputably clear is not so conclusive as to the East, and yet one
   passage from St. Jerome should be quoted.  "The Virgin Christ and the
   Virgin Mary dedicated the virginity of both sexes.  The Apostles were
   chosen when either virgins or continent after marriage, and bishops,
   presbyters, and deacons are chosen either when virgins, or widowers, or
   at least continent forever after the priesthood." [354]

   It would be out of place to enter into any detailed argument upon the
   force of these passages, but I shall lay before the reader the summing
   up of the whole matter by a weighty recent writer of the Ultramontane
   Roman School.

   "Is the celibate an Apostolic ordinance?  Bickel affirmed that it is,
   and Funk denied it in 1878.  To-day [1896] canonists commonly admit
   that one cannot prove the existence of any formal precept, either
   divine or apostolic, which imposes the celibate upon the clergy, and
   that all the texts, whether taken out of Holy Scripture or from the
   Fathers, on this subject contain merely a counsel, and not a command."
   "In the Fourth Century a great number of councils forbade bishops,
   priests, and deacons to live in the use of marriage with their lawful
   wives....But there does not appear to have been any disposition to
   declare by law as invalid the marriages of clerics in Holy Orders.  In
   the Fifth and Sixth Centuries the law of the celibate was observed by
   all the Churches of the West, thanks to the Councils and to the
   Popes."  "In the Seventh and down to the end of the Tenth Century,
   [355] as a matter of fact the law of celibacy was little observed in a
   great part of the Western Church, but as a matter of law the Roman
   Pontiffs and the Councils were constant in their proclamation of its
   obligation."  By the canonical practice of the unreformed West, the
   reception of Holy Orders is an impedimentum dirimens matrimonii, which
   renders any marriage subsequently contracted not only illicit but
   absolutely null.  On this diriment impediment the same Roman Catholic
   writer says:  "The diriment impediment of Holy Orders is of
   ecclesiastical obligation and not of divine, and consequently the
   Church can dispense it.  This is the present teaching which is in
   opposition to that of the old schools."

   "There is no question of the nullity of the marriages contracted by
   clerics before 1139.  At the Council of the Lateran of that year,
   Innocent II. declared that these marriages contracted in contempt of
   the ecclesiastical law are not true marriages in his eyes.  His
   successors do not seem to have insisted much upon this new diriment
   impediment, although it was attacked most vigorously by the offending
   clergymen; but the School of Bologna, the authority of which was then
   undisputed, openly declared for the nullity of the marriages contracted
   by clerics in Holy Orders.  Thus it is that this point of law has been
   settled rather by teaching, than by any precise text, or by any law of
   a known date." [356]

   It should not, however, be forgotten that although this is true with
   regard to Pope Innocent II. in 1139, it is also true that in 530 the
   Emperor Justinian declared null and void all marriages contracted by
   clerics in Holy Orders, and the children of such marriages to be
   spurious (spurii).

   The reader will be interested in reading the answer on this point made
   by King Henry VIII. to the letter sent him by the German ambassadors.
   [357]   I can here give but a part translated into English.  "Although
   the Church from the beginning admitted married men, as priests and
   bishops, who were without crime, the husband of one wife, (out of the
   necessity of the times, as sufficient other suitable men could not be
   found as would suffice for the teaching of the world) yet Paul himself
   chose the celibate Timothy; but if anyone came unmarried to the
   priesthood and afterwards took a wife, he was always deposed from the
   priesthood, according to the canon of the Council of Neocæsarea which
   was before that of Nice.  So, too, in the Council of Chalcedon, in the
   first canon of which all former canons are confirmed, it is established
   that a deaconess, if she give herself over to marriage, shall remain
   under anathema, and a virgin who had dedicated herself to God and a
   monk who join themselves in marriage, shall remain excommunicated....No
   Apostolic canon nor the Council of Nice contain anything similar to
   what you assert, viz.:  that priests once ordained can marry
   afterwards.  And with this statement agrees the Sixth Synod, in which
   it was decreed that if any of the clergy should wish to lead a wife, he
   should do so before receiving the Subdiaconate, since afterwards it was
   by no means lawful; nor was there given in the Sixth Synod any liberty
   to priests of leading wives after their priesting, as you assert.
   Therefore from the beginning of the newborn Church it is clearly seen
   that at no time it was permitted to a priest to lead a wife after his
   priesting, and nowhere, where this was attempted, was it done with
   impunity, but the culprit was deposed from his priesthood."

   Canon VII.

   Since we have learned that in some churches deacons hold ecclesiastical
   offices, and that hereby some of them with arrogancy and license sit
   daringly before the presbyters:  we have determined that a deacon, even
   if in an office of dignity, that is to say, in whatever ecclesiastical
   office he may be, is not to have his seat before a presbyter, except he
   is acting as representative of his own patriarch or metropolitan in
   another city under another superior, for then he shall be honoured as
   filling his place.  But if anyone, possessed with a tyrannical
   audacity, shall have dared to do such a thing, let him be ejected from
   his peculiar rank and be last of all of the order in whose list he is
   in his own church; our Lord admonishing us that we are not to delight
   in taking the chief seats, according to the doctrine which is found in
   the holy Evangelist Luke, as put forth by our Lord and God himself.
   For to those who were called he taught this parable:  "When ye are
   bidden by anyone to a marriage sit not down in the highest room lest a
   more honourable man than thou shall have been bidden by him; and he who
   bade thee and him come and say to thee:  Give this man place, and thou
   begin with shame to take the lowest room.  But when thou art bidden,
   sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who bade thee cometh he
   may say to thee, Friend go up higher:  then thou shalt have worship in
   the presence of them that sit with thee.  For whosoever exalteth
   himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be
   exalted."  But the same thing also shall be observed in the remaining
   sacred orders; seeing that we know that spiritual things are to be
   preferred to worldly dignity.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   A deacon in the execution of his office, if he shall have occasion to
   sit in the presence of presbyters, shall take the lowest place unless
   he be the representative of the Patriarch or bishop.

   Balsamon, Zonaras, and following them Van Espen point out that this
   canon is a relaxation of the XVIII. Canon of Nice which punishes
   presumptuous deacons not only with loss of rank in their grade, but
   also with expulsion from their ministry.

   Van Espen well remarks that the Fathers of this synod had in mind not
   only the preservation of the distinction between deacons and
   presbyters, but also between those in ecclesiastical orders and those
   enjoying secular dignities with regard to ecclesiastical matters, but
   who were not to gain there from ecclesiastical precedence.  This is
   what is meant by the last clause of the canon.

   Beveridge gives a list of these quasi ecclesiastical dignitaries as
   follows:  Magnus OEconomus, Magno Sacello Præpositus, Magnus Vasorum
   Custos, Chartophylax, Parvo Sacello Præpositus, Primus Defensor.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VIII.

   Since we desire that in every point the things which have been decreed
   by our holy fathers may also be established and confirmed, we hereby
   renew the canon which orders that synods of the bishops of each
   province be held every year where the bishop of the metropolis shall
   deem best.  But since on account of the incursions of barbarians and
   certain other incidental causes, those who preside over the churches
   cannot hold synods twice a year, it seems right that by all means once
   a year--on account of ecclesiastical questions which are likely to
   arise--a synod of the aforesaid bishops should be holden in every
   province, between the holy feast of Easter and October, as has been
   said above, in the place which the Metropolitan shall have deemed most
   fitting.  And let such bishops as do not attend, when they are at home
   in their own cities and are in good health, and free from all
   unavoidable and necessary business, be fraternally reproved.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   Whenever it is impossible to hold two synods a year, one at least shall
   be celebrated, between Easter and the month of October.

   This canon under the name of the "Sixth Synod" is referred to in Canon
   VI. of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (II. Nice), and the bishops of
   Quinisext are called "Fathers."

   Van Espen.

   What at first was only allowed on account of necessity, little by
   little passed into general law, and at last was received as law, that
   once a year there was to be a meeting of the provincial synod.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IX.

   Let no cleric be permitted to keep a "public house."  For if it be not
   permitted to enter a tavern, much more is it forbidden to serve others
   in it and to carry on a trade which is unlawful for him.  But if he
   shall have done any such thing, either let him desist or be deposed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   If clerics are forbidden to enter public houses, much more are they
   forbidden to keep them.  Let them either give them up or be deposed.

   Compare with this canon liv. of the Apostolic Canons; xxiv. of
   Laodicea; and xliij. of the Synod of Carthage. [358]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [358] It is curious that Balsamon quotes this canon at xl., i.e., the
   Latin numbering and not the Greek which he himself uses in his scholia.

   Canon X.

   A bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who receives usury, or what is called
   hecatostæ, let him desist or be deposed.

   Notes.

   A bishop, presbyter, or deacon who takes usury shall be deposed unless
   he stops doing so.

   Canon XI.

   Let no one in the priestly order nor any layman eat the unleavened
   bread of the Jews, nor have any familiar intercourse with them, nor
   summon them in illness, nor receive medicines from them, nor bathe with
   them; but if anyone shall take in hand to do so, if he is a cleric, let
   him be deposed, but if a layman let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   Jewish unleavened bread is to be refused.  Whoever even calls in Jews
   as physicians or bathes with them is to be deposed.

   Van Espen.

   Theodore Balsamon is of opinion that this canon does not forbid the
   eating of unleavened bread; but that what is intended is the keeping of
   feasts in a Jewish fashion, or in sacrifices to use unleavened bread
   (azymes), and this, says Balsamon, on account of the Latins who
   celebrate their feasts with azymes.

   Canon lxix. [i.e., lxx.] of those commonly called Apostolic forbids the
   observance of festivals with the Jews; and declares it to be unlawful
   to receive manuscula from them, but by this canon all familiar
   intercourse with them is forbidden.

   While there can be no doubt that in all the Trullan canons there is an
   undercurrent of hostility to the West, yet in this canon I can see no
   such spirit, and I think it has been read into it by the greater
   bitterness of later times.  This seems the more certain from the fact
   that there is nothing new whatever in the provision with respect to the
   passover bread, vide canons of Laodicea xxxvij. and xxxviij.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa xxviij., can. xiii. [359]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [359] Van Espen says that in his copy of Gratian this canon is assigned
   to the VII^th Synod.  Such is not the case in the edition in Migne's
   Patrologia Latina, where the reference is given as ex VI. Synodo. c.
   II., and Judæorum is found in the text instead of the eorum of which
   Van Espen complains.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XII.

   Moreover this also has come to our knowledge, that in Africa and Libya
   and in other places the most God-beloved bishops in those parts do not
   refuse to live with their wives, even after consecration, thereby
   giving scandal and offence to the people.  Since, therefore, it is our
   particular care that all things tend to the good of the flock placed in
   our hands and committed to us,--it has seemed good that henceforth
   nothing of the kind shall in any way occur.  And we say this, not to
   abolish and overthrow what things were established of old by Apostolic
   authority, but as caring for the health of the people and their advance
   to better things, and lest the ecclesiastical state should suffer any
   reproach.  For the divine Apostle says:  "Do all to the glory of God,
   give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Greeks, nor to the
   Church of God, even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine
   own profit but the profit of many, that they may be saved.  Be ye
   imitators of me even as I also am of Christ."  But if any shall have
   been observed to do such a thing, let him be deposed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   Although it has been decreed that wives are not to be cast forth,
   nevertheless that we may counsel for the better, we give command that
   no one ordained a bishop shall any longer live with his wife.

   Aristenus.

   The fifth Apostolic canon allows neither bishop, presbyter, nor deacon
   to cast forth his wife under pretext of piety; and assigns penalties
   for any that shall do so, and if he will not amend he is to be
   deposed.  But this canon on the other hand does not permit a bishop
   even to live with his wife after his consecration.  But by this change
   no contempt is meant to be poured out upon what had been established by
   Apostolic authority, but it was made through care for the people's
   health and for leading on to better things, and for fear that the
   sacerdotal estate might suffer some wrong.

   Van Espen.

   (In Can. vi. Apost.)

   In the time of this canon [of the Apostles so called] not only
   presbyters and deacons, but bishops also, it is clear, were allowed by
   Eastern custom to have their wives; and Zonaras and Balsamon note that
   even until the Sixth Council, commonly called in Trullo bishops were
   allowed to have their wives.

   (The same on this canon.)

   But not only do they command [in this canon] that bishops after their
   consecration no longer have commerce with their own wives, but further,
   they prohibit them even to presume to live with them.

   Zonaras.

   When the faith first was born and came forth into the world, the
   Apostles treated with greater softness and indulgence those who
   embraced the truth, which as yet was not scattered far and wide, nor
   did they exact from them perfection in all respects, but made great
   allowances for their weakness and for the inveterate force of the
   customs with which they were surrounded, both among the heathen and
   among the Jews.  But now, when far and wide our religion has been
   propagated, more strenuous efforts were made to enforce those things
   which pertain to a higher and holier life, as our angelical worship
   increased day by day, and to insist on by law a life of continence to
   those who were elevated to the episcopate, so that not only they should
   abstain from their wives, but that they should have them no longer as
   bed-fellows; and not only that they no longer admit them as sharers of
   their bed, but they do not allow them even to stop under the same roof
   or in the house.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIII.

   Since we know it to be handed down as a rule of the Roman Church that
   those who are deemed worthy to be advanced to the diaconate or
   presbyterate should promise no longer to cohabit with their wives, we,
   preserving the ancient rule and apostolic perfection and order, will
   that the lawful marriages of men who are in holy orders be from this
   time forward firm, by no means dissolving their union with their wives
   nor depriving them of their mutual intercourse at a convenient time.
   Wherefore, if anyone shall have been found worthy to be ordained
   subdeacon, or deacon, or presbyter, he is by no means to be prohibited
   from admittance to such a rank, even if he shall live with a lawful
   wife.  Nor shall it be demanded of him at the time of his ordination
   that he promise to abstain from lawful intercourse with his wife:  lest
   we should affect injuriously marriage constituted by God and blessed by
   his presence, as the Gospel saith:  "What God hath joined together let
   no man put asunder;" and the Apostle saith, "Marriage is honourable and
   the bed undefiled;" and again, "Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to
   be loosed."  But we know, as they who assembled at Carthage (with a
   care for the honest life of the clergy) said, that subdeacons, who
   handle the Holy Mysteries, and deacons, and presbyters should abstain
   from their consorts according to their own course [of ministration].
   So that what has been handed down through the Apostles and preserved by
   ancient custom, we too likewise maintain, knowing that there is a time
   for all things and especially for fasting and prayer.  For it is meet
   that they who assist at the divine altar should be absolutely continent
   when they are handling holy things, in order that they may be able to
   obtain from God what they ask in sincerity.

   If therefore anyone shall have dared, contrary to the Apostolic Canons,
   to deprive any of those who are in holy orders, presbyter, or deacon,
   or subdeacon of cohabitation and intercourse with his lawful wife, let
   him be deposed.  In like manner also if any presbyter or deacon on
   pretence of piety has dismissed his wife, let him be excluded from
   communion; and if he persevere in this let him be deposed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   Although the Romans wish that everyone ordained deacon or presbyter
   should put away his wife, we wish the marriages of deacons and
   presbyters to continue valid and firm.

   Fleury.

   (H. E., Livre XL., chap. 1.)

   What is said in this canon, that the council of Carthage orders priests
   to abstain from their wives at prescribed periods, is a
   misunderstanding of the decree, caused either by malice or by
   ignorance.  This canon is one of those adopted by the Fifth Council of
   Carthage held in the year 400, and it is decreed that subdeacons,
   deacons; priests, and bishops shall abstain from their wives, following
   the ancient statutes, and shall be as though they had them not.  The
   Greek version of this canon has rendered the Latin words priora statuta
   by these, idious horous, which may mean "fixed times":  for the
   translator read, following another codex, propria for priora.  Be this
   as it may, the Fathers of the Trullan council supposed that this
   obliged the clergy only to continence at certain fixed times, and were
   not willing to see that it included bishops as well.

   Van Espen.

   Although the Latin Church does not disapprove, [360] as contrary to the
   law of the Gospel the discipline of the Greeks which allows the use of
   marriage to presbyters and deacons, provided it was contracted before
   ordination; yet never has it approved this canon which with too great
   zeal condemns the opposite custom, and rashly assigns great errors to
   the Roman Church.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XXXI., c. xiij.

   Antonius Augustinus in his proposed emendations of Gratian says (Lib.
   I. dial. de emend. Grat. c. 8.):  "This canon can in no way be
   received; for it is written in opposition to the celibacy of the Latin
   priests, and openly is against the Roman Church."  But to me the note
   which Gratian appends seems much more learned and true:  "This however
   must be understood as of local application; for the Eastern Church, to
   which the VI. Synod prescribed this rule, did not receive a vow of
   chastity from the ministers of the altar."  It may be well to note here
   that by the opinion of most Latin casuists the obligation to chastity
   among the Roman clergy rests upon the vow and not upon any law of the
   Church binding thereto.  This evidently was the opinion of Gratian.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [360] Clement VIII. made a decree in conformity with this canon that a
   Greek presbyter who was married shall abstain from his wife for a week
   or three days before he offered the sacrifice of the mass.  Const. 33,
   in Bull. Rom (cit. Van Espen l. c.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIV.

   Let the canon of our holy God-bearing Fathers be confirmed in this
   particular also; that a presbyter be not ordained before he is thirty
   years of age, even if he be a very worthy man, but let him be kept
   back.  For our Lord Jesus Christ was baptized and began to teach when
   he was thirty.  In like manner let no deacon be ordained before he is
   twenty-five, nor a deaconess before she is forty.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   A presbyter thirty years of age, a deacon twenty-five, and a deaconess
   forty.

   Compare Canon XI. of Neocæsarea.

   It may be interesting to note here that by the law of the Roman
   Communion the canonical ages are as follows:

   A subdeacon must have completed his twenty-first year, a deacon his
   twenty-second, a priest his twenty-fourth, and a bishop his thirtieth.
   None of the inferior clergy can hold a simple benefice before he has
   begun his fourteenth year.  Ecclesiastical dignities, such as Cathedral
   canonries, cannot be conferred on any who have not finished the
   twenty-second year.  A benefice to which is attached a cure of souls
   can be given only to one who is over twenty-four, and a diocese only to
   one who has completed his thirtieth year.  (Vide Ferraris, Bibliotheca
   Prompta.)

   In the Anglican Communion the ages are, in England, for a bishop "fully
   thirty years of age," for a priest twenty-four, and for a deacon
   twenty-three: [361]   and in the United States, for a bishop thirty
   years of age, for a priest twenty-four, and for a deacon twenty-one.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [361] A faculty is allowed for earlier ordination, but since 1804 only
   to be granted by the Archbishop of Canterbury.  This limitation is,
   however, only of Parliamentary sanction (44 Geo. III., ch. 43).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XV.

   A subdeacon is not to be ordained under twenty years of age.  And if
   any one in any grade of the priesthood shall have been ordained
   contrary to the prescribed time let him be deposed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   Those shall be chosen as Subdeacons who are twenty years of age.

   This age seems first to have been fixed by the Second Council of Toledo
   [362] (circa, a.d. 535) in its first canon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [362] It is curious that so learned a scholar as the late Henry
   Bradshaw in his article "Subdeacon" in Smith & Cheetham'sDictionary of
   Christ. Antiq. should give the date of this synod as 447.  Hefele fixes
   it at 527 or 531.  Baronius, Binius, Labbe, and many others at 531.  A
   very ancient ms. assigns it to the year 565 of the Spanish era, i.e.
   527, and this is the date Cardinal de Aguirre adopts, and is also the
   one given to the council by the editors of L'Art de Vérifier les dates.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVI.

   Since the book of the Acts tells us that seven deacons were appointed
   by the Apostles, and the synod of Neocæsarea in the canons which it put
   forth determined that there ought to be canonically only seven deacons,
   even if the city be very large, in accordance with the book of the
   Acts; we, having fitted the mind of the fathers to the Apostles' words,
   find that they spoke not of those men who ministered at the Mysteries
   but in the administration which pertains to the serving of tables.  For
   the book of the Acts reads as follows:  "In those days, when the number
   of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring dissension of
   the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected
   in the daily ministrations.  And the Twelve called the multitude of the
   disciples with them and said, It is not meet for us to leave the word
   of God and serve tables.  Look ye out therefore, brethren, from among
   you seven men of good report full of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom, whom
   we may appoint over this business.  But we will give ourselves
   continually unto prayer and unto the ministry of the word.  And the
   saying pleased the whole multitude:  and they chose Stephen a man full
   of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor,
   and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:  whom they
   set before the Apostles."

   John Chrysostom, a Doctor of the Church, interpreting these words,
   proceeds thus:  "It is a remarkable fact that the multitude was not
   divided in its choice of the men, and that the Apostles were not
   rejected by them.  But we must learn what sort of rank they had, and
   what ordination they received.  Was it that of deacons?  But this
   office did not yet exist in the churches.  But was it the dispensation
   of a presbyter?  But there was not as yet any bishop, but only
   Apostles, whence I think it is clear and manifest that neither of
   deacons nor of presbyters was there then the name." [363]

   But on this account therefore we also announce that the aforesaid seven
   deacons are not to be understood as deacons who served at the
   Mysteries, according to the teaching before set forth, but that they
   were those to whom a dispensation was entrusted for the common benefit
   of those that were gathered together, who to us in this also were a
   type of philanthropy and zeal towards those who are in need.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.

   Whoever affirms that the number of deacons should be seven according to
   the saying of the Acts, should know that the reference in that passage
   is not to Deacons of the Mysteries but to such as serve tables.

   Van Espen here reminds us that this is, as Zonaras calls attention to
   in his scholion on this place, a correction rather than an
   interpretation of the XV^th Canon of Neocæsarea, and Balsamon also says
   the same.  The only interest that the matter possesses is that a canon
   which had been received by the Fourth Ecumenical Council (Chalcedon)
   should receive such treatment from such an assembly as the Synod in
   Trullo.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [363] I have not followed the Oxford translation, which seems to me to
   have reversed the point.  In a foot-note to that translation
   (Chrysostom on Acts, Part I., p. 199) will be found a translation of
   this canon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVII.

   Since clerics of different churches have left their own churches in
   which they were ordained and betaken themselves to other bishops, and
   without the consent of their own bishop have been settled in other
   churches, and thus they have proved themselves to be insolent and
   disobedient; we decree that from the month of January of the past IV^th
   Indiction no cleric, of whatsoever grade he be, shall have power,
   without letters dimissory of his own bishop, to be registered in the
   clergy list of another church.  Whoever in future shall not have
   observed this rule, but shall have brought disgrace upon himself as
   well as on the bishop who ordained him, let him be deposed together
   with him who also received him.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.

   Whoever receives and ordains a wandering cleric shall be deposed
   together with him thus wickedly ordained.

   Canon XVIII.

   Those clerics who in consequence of a barbaric incursion or on account
   of any other circumstance have gone abroad, we order to return again to
   their churches after the cause has passed away, or when the incursion
   of the barbarians is at an end.  Nor are they to leave them for long
   without cause.  If anyone shall not have returned according to the
   direction of this present canon--let him be cut off until he shall
   return to his own church.  And the same shall be the punishment of the
   bishop who received him.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.

   Whoever has emigrated on account of an invasion of the barbarians,
   shall return to the Church to whose clergy he belongs as soon as the
   incursion ceases.  But if he shall not do so, he shall be cut off
   together with him to whom he has gone.

   Balsamon.

   The Fathers are worthy of great praise.  For having regard to the
   honour of the ecclesiastical order and of each bishop, they have
   decreed that clergymen, who from just and valid causes have gone forth
   without letters dimissory from those who ordained them, should return
   to their own clergy soon as the cause which drove them forth ceases;
   and that they should not be enrolled on the clergy list of any other
   church.  But whosoever cannot be persuaded to return is to be cut off,
   as well as the bishop who detains him.  But someone will say, If a
   bishop who does such a thing is cut off by his Metropolitan; and
   likewise if a Metropolitan spurns this canon he is punished by the
   Patriarch.  But if an autocephalous archbishop or a Patriarch other
   than the Patriarch of Constantinople (for he has a faculty for doing
   so) should be convicted of a breach of this Canon, by whom would he be
   cut off?  I suppose by the Supreme Pontiff [364] (oiomai oun para tou
   meizonos archiereos).

   Canon XIX.

   It behoves those who preside over the churches, every day but
   especially on Lord's days, to teach all the clergy and people words of
   piety and of right religion, gathering out of holy Scripture
   meditations and determinations of the truth, and not going beyond the
   limits now fixed, nor varying from the tradition of the God-bearing
   fathers.  And if any controversy in regard to Scripture shall have been
   raised, let them not interpret it otherwise than as the lights and
   doctors of the church in their writings have expounded it, and in those
   let them glory rather than in composing things out of their own heads,
   lest through their lack of skill [365] they may have departed from what
   was fitting.  For through the doctrine of the aforesaid fathers, the
   people coming to the knowledge of what is good and desirable, as well
   as what is useless and to be rejected, will remodel their life for the
   better, and not be led by ignorance, but applying their minds to the
   doctrine, they will take heed that no evil befall them and work out
   their salvation in fear of impending punishment.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.

   The prelates of the Church, especially upon Lord's days, shall teach
   doctrine.

   Van Espen.

   How great an obligation of preaching rests upon bishops, the successors
   of the Apostles, is evident from the words of St. Paul, "Christ sent me
   not to baptize but to preach" (1 Cor. i. 17), and his chief adjuration
   to Timothy though Jesus Christ and his coming, was "Preach the Word" (2
   Tim. ii. 4.).  For this reason the fathers formerly called the
   episcopate the preaching-office (officium predicationis), as is evident
   from the profession of Adelbert Morinensis, and the form of profession
   of a future Archbishop.  Both of these will be found in Labbe, appendix
   to Tom. VIII., of his Concilia.

   The clergy will be careful to teach nothing in their sermons to be

   the doctrine of the Old and New Testament, and what the Catholic
   Fathers and Ancient Bishops have collected out of the same. [366]

   Canon XX.

   It shall not be lawful for a bishop to teach publicly in any city which
   does not belong to him.  If any shall have been observed doing this,
   let him cease from his episcopate, but let him discharge the office of
   a presbyter.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.

   The bishop of one city shall not teach publicly in another.  If he
   shall be shown to have dose so he shall be deprived of the episcopate
   and shall perform the functions of a presbyter.

   The meaning of this canon is most obscure.  Balsamon and Zonaras think
   that the Bishop is not to be deposed from his Episcopate, but only
   shorn of his right of executing the Episcopal functions, so that he
   will virtually be reduced to a presbyter.  Aristenus, on the other
   hand, considers the deposition to be real and that this canon creates
   an exception to Canon XXIX. of Chalcedon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXI.

   Those who have become guilty of crimes against the canons, and on this
   account subject to complete and perpetual deposition, are degraded to
   the condition of layman.  If, however, keeping conversion continually
   before their eyes, they willingly deplore the sin on account of which
   they fell from grace, and made themselves aliens therefrom, they may
   still cut their hair after the manner of clerics.  But if they are not
   willing to submit themselves to this canon, they must wear their hair
   as laymen, as being those who have preferred the communion of the world
   to the celestial life.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.

   Whoever is already deposed and reduced to the lay estate, if he shall
   repent, let him continue deposed but be shorn.  But if otherwise, he
   must let his hair grow.

   crimes," substituting kanonikos for kanonikois, in accordance with the
   Bodleian and Amerbachian codices.

   Canon XXII.

   Those who are ordained for money, whether bishops or of any rank

   deposed as well as those also who ordained them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.

   Whoever is ordained for pay shall be deposed together with his
   ordainer.

   Van Espen.

   The present canon orders to be deposed not only the one simoniacally
   ordained, but also his ordainer, ordering that ordinations should take
   place on account, not of money, but of the excellence of the
   examination stood by the candidate and on account of his uprightness of
   life.  And it evidently takes it for granted that, where money has been
   used, examination, excellence of life, and consideration of merit enter
   but little into the matter, or at least are paid no attention to.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXIII.

   That no one, whether bishop, presbyter, or deacon, when giving the
   immaculate Communion, shall exact from him who communicates fees of any
   kind.  For grace is not to be sold, nor do we give the sanctification
   of the Holy Spirit for money; but to those who are worthy of the gift
   it is to be communicated in all simplicity.  But if any of those
   enrolled among the clergy make demands on those he communicates let him
   be deposed, as an imitator of the error and wickedness of Simon.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIII.

   Whoever shall demand an obolus or anything else for giving the spotless
   communion shall be deposed.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,

   Canon XXIV.

   No one who is on the priestly catalogue nor any monk is allowed to take
   part in horse-races or to assist at theatrical representations. But if
   any clergyman be called to a marriage, as soon as the games begin let
   him rise up and go out, for so it is ordered by the doctrine of our
   fathers. And if any one shall be convicted of such an offence let him
   cease therefrom or be deposed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIV.

   A clergyman or monk shall be deposed who goes to horse-races, or does
   not leave nuptials before the players are brought in.

   Van Espen.

   Scarcely ever were these plays exhibited without the introduction of
   something contrary to honesty and chastity.  As Lupus here notes, the
   word "obscene" has its derivation from these "scenic" representations.

   Rightly therefore has it been forbidden by the sacred canons that the
   clergy should witness any such plays.

   In the second part of this canon by the words "ordered by the doctrine
   of our fathers," the Synod understands the doctrine of the fathers of
   the synod of Laodicea, which in its canon liv. condemned the same
   abuse.

   Moreover we renew the canon which orders that country (agroikikas)
   parishes and those which are in the provinces (enchorious) shall remain
   subject to the bishops who had possession of them; especially if for
   thirty years they had administered them without opposition.  But if
   within thirty years there had been or should be any controversy on the
   point, it is lawful for those who think themselves injured to refer the
   matter to the provincial synod.

   Rural and out of town parishes held for thirty years may be retained.
   But within that time there may be a controversy.

   Canon XXVI.

   If a presbyter has through ignorance contracted an illegal marriage,
   while he still retains the right to his place, as we have defined in
   the sacred canons, yet he must abstain from all sacerdotal work.  For
   it is sufficient if to such an one indulgence is granted.  For he is
   unfit to bless another who needs to take care of his own wounds, for
   blessing is the imparting of sanctification.  But how can he impart
   this to another who does not possess it himself through a sin of
   ignorance?  Neither then in public nor in private can he bless nor
   distribute to others the body of Christ, [nor perform any other
   ministry]; but being content with his seat of honour let him lament to
   the Lord that his sin of ignorance may be remitted.  For it is manifest
   that the nefarious marriage must be dissolved, neither can the man have
   any intercourse with her on account of whom he is deprived of the
   execution of his priesthood.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVI.

   A priest who has fallen into an illicit marriage and been deposed, may
   still have his seat, but only when he abstains for the future from his
   wickedness.

   Aristenus.

   If any presbyter before his ordination had married a widow, or a
   harlot, or an actress, or any other woman such as are forbidden, in
   ignorance, he shall cease from his priesthood but shall still have his
   place among the presbyters.  But such an illegitimate marriage, on
   account of which he was deprived of the Sacred Ministry, must be
   dissolved.

   belong to the clergy.  And if any one shall violate this canon, he
   shall be cut off for one week.

   A clergyman must not wear an unsuitable dress either when travelling or
   when at home.  Should he do so, he shall be cut off for one week.

   Canon XXVIII.

   Since we understand that in several churches grapes are brought to the
   altar, according to a custom which has long prevailed, and the
   ministers joined this with the unbloody sacrifice of the oblation, and
   distributed both to the people at the same time, we decree that no
   priest shall do this for the future, but shall administer the oblation
   alone to the people for the quickening of their souls and for the
   remission of their sins.  But with regard to the offering of grapes as
   first fruits, the priests may bless them apart [from the offering of
   the oblation] and distribute them to such as seek them as an act of
   thanksgiving to him who is the Giver of the fruits by which our bodies
   are increased and fed according to his divine decree.  And if any
   cleric shall violate this decree let him be deposed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVIII.

   Grapes are by some joined with the unbloody sacrifice.  It is hereby
   decreed that no one shall for the future dare to do this.

   Van Espen.

   Similar blessings of fruit, and particularly of grapes, are found in
   more recent rituals as well as in the ancient Greek Euchologions and
   the Latin Rituales.  In the Sacramentary of St. Gregory will be found a
   benediction of grapes on the feast of St. Sixtus.

   Cardinal Bona says (De Rob. Liturg., Lib. II., cap. xiv.), that
   immediately before the words Semper bona creas, sanctificas, etc., if
   new fruits or any other things adapted to human use were to be blessed,
   they were wont in former times to be placed before the altar, and there
   to be blessed by the priest; and when the benediction was ended with
   the accustomed words "Through Christ our Lord," there was added the
   following prayer:  "Perquem hæc omnia, etc.," which words are not so
   much to be referred to the body and blood of Christ, as to the things
   to be blessed, which God continually creates by renewing, and we ask
   that they may be sanctified by his benediction to our use.

   But in after ages when the fervour of the faithful had grown cold, that
   the mass might not be too long, they were separated and yet the prayer
   remained which, as said to-day over the consecrated species alone, can
   hardly be understood.

   Canon XXIX.

   A canon of the Synod of Carthage says that the holy mysteries of the
   altar are not to be performed but by men who are fasting, except on one
   day in the year on which the Supper of the Lord is celebrated.  At that
   time, on account perhaps of certain occasions in those places useful to
   the Church, even the holy Fathers themselves made use of this
   dispensation.  But since nothing leads us to abandon exact observance,
   we decree that the Apostolic and Patristic tradition shall be followed;
   and define that it is not right to break the fast on the fifth feria of
   the last week of Lent, and thus to do dishonour to the whole of Lent.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIX.

   Some of the Fathers after they had supped on the day of the Divine
   Supper made the offering. [367]   However, it has seemed good to the
   synod that this should not be done, and that the fast should not be
   broken upon the fifth feria [368] of the last week of Lent, and so the
   whole of Lent be dishonoured.

   Zonaras remarks that the "Apostolic and Patristic tradition" is a
   reference to canon lxix. of the Apostolic Canons and to canon l. of
   Laodicea.  See notes on this last canon.

   Canon XXX.

   Willing to do all things for the edification of the Church, we have
   determined to take care even of priests who are in barbarian churches.
   Wherefore if they think that they ought to exceed the Apostolic Canon
   concerning the not putting away of a wife on the pretext of piety and
   religion, and to do beyond that which is commanded, and therefore
   abstain by agreement with their wives from cohabitation, we decree they
   ought no longer to live with them in any way, so that hereby they may
   afford us a perfect demonstration of their promise.  But we have
   conceded this to them on no other ground than their narrowness, and
   foreign and unsettled manners.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXX.

   Those priests who are in churches among the barbarians, if with consent
   they have abstained from commerce with their wives shall never
   afterwards have any commerce with them in any way.

   Fleury.

   (Hist. Eccl., Liv. XL., chap. l.)

   "Priests who are among the barbarians," that is to say, it would seem,
   in Italy and in the other countries of the Latin rite.  "Their
   narrowness and foreign and unsettled manners," that is to say that
   according to them it is an imperfection to aspire after perfect
   continence.

   I do not think that this explanation of Fleury's can be sustained, and
   it would seem that Van Espen is more near the truth when he says:
   "Some priests in barbarous countries thought they should abstain after
   the Latin custom even from wives taken before ordination.  And although
   this was contrary to the discipline of the Greeks, and also to Canon V.
   of the Apostles, nevertheless the Fathers thought it might be
   tolerated, provided such priests should also not live any longer with
   their wives."  There seems no reason to introduce anti-Roman bitterness
   where it is not already found.

   Canon XXXI.

   Clerics who in oratories which are in houses offer the Holy Mysteries
   or baptize, we decree ought to do this with the consent of the bishop

   Canon XXXII.

   Since it has come to our knowledge that in the region of Armenia they
   offer wine only on the Holy Table, those who celebrate the unbloody
   sacrifice not mixing water with it, adducing, as authority thereof,
   John Chrysostom, a doctor of the Church, who says in his interpretation
   of the Gospel according to St. Matthew:

   "And wherefore did he not drink water after he was risen again, but
   wine?  To pluck up by the roots another wicked heresy.  For since there
   are certain who use water in the Mysteries to shew that both when he
   delivered the mysteries he had given wine and that when he had risen
   and was setting before them a mere meal without mysteries, he used
   wine, of the fruit,' saith he, of the vine.'  But a vine produces wine,
   not water." [369]   And from this they think the doctor overthrows the
   admixture of water in the holy sacrifice.  Now, lest on the point from
   this time forward they be held in ignorance, we open out the orthodox
   opinion of the Father.  For since there was an ancient and wicked
   heresy of the Hydroparastatæ (i.e., of those who offered water), who
   instead of wine used water in their sacrifice, this divine, confuting
   the detestable teaching of such a heresy, and showing that it is
   directly opposed to Apostolic tradition, asserted that which has just
   been quoted.  For to his own church, where the pastoral administration
   had been given him, he ordered that water mixed with wine should be
   used at the unbloody sacrifice, so as to shew forth the mingling of the
   blood and water which for the life of the whole world and for the
   redemption of its sins, was poured forth from the precious side of
   Christ our Redeemer; and moreover in every church where spiritual light
   has shined this divinely given order is observed.

   For also James, the brother, according to the flesh, of Christ our God,
   to whom the throne of the church of Jerusalem first was entrusted, and
   Basil, the Archbishop of the Church of Cæsarea, whose glory has spread
   through all the world, when they delivered to us directions for the
   mystical sacrifice in writing, declared that the holy chalice is
   consecrated in the Divine Liturgy with water and wine.  And the holy
   Fathers who assembled at Carthage provided in these express terms:
   "That in the holy Mysteries nothing besides the body and blood of the
   Lord be offered, as the Lord himself laid down, that is bread and wine
   mixed with water."  Therefore if any bishop or presbyter shall not
   perform the holy action according to what has been handed down by the
   Apostles, and shall not offer the sacrifice with wine mixed with water,
   let him be deposed, as imperfectly shewing forth the mystery and
   innovating on the things which have been handed down.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXII.

   Chrysostom, when overthrowing the heresy of the Hydroparastatæ, says:
   "When the Lord suffered and rose again he used wine."  The Armenians,
   laying hold on this, offer wine alone, not understanding that
   Chrysostom himself, and Basil, and James used wine mixed with water;
   and left the tradition that we should so make the offering.  If,
   therefore, any one shall offer wine alone, or water alone, and not the
   mixed [chalice] let him be deposed.

   Van Espen.

   Justin Martyr in his Second Apology, Ambrose, or whoever was the author
   of the books on the Sacraments (Lib. v., cap. i.), Augustine and many
   others make mention of this rite, and above all St. Cyprian, who wrote
   a long epistle on the subject to Cecilius, and seeking the reason of
   the ceremony as a setting forth of the union of the people, represented
   by the water, with Christ, figured by the wine.

   Another signification of this rite St. Augustine indicates in his
   sermon to Neophytes, saying:  "Take this in bread, which hung upon the
   Cross:  Take this in the cup which poured forth from the side," that is
   to say blood and water.

   Cardinal Bona (De Rebus Liturgicis, Lib. II., cap. ix., n. 3 and 4)
   refers to many ancient rituals in which a similar prayer is used to
   that found in the Ambrosian rite, which says as the water is poured
   in:  "Out of the side of Christ there flowed forth blood and water
   together.  In the name of the Father, etc."  Bona further notes that
   "The Greeks twice mingle water with the wine, once cold water, when in
   the prothesis they are preparing the Holy Gifts, and the Priest pierces
   the bread with the holy spear, and says, "One of the soldiers with a
   lance opened his side, and immediately there flowed forth blood and
   water," and the deacon pours in wine and water.  From this it is
   evident that the Greeks agree with St. Augustine's explanation.

   For the second time the Greeks mix "hot water after consecration and
   immediately before communion, the deacon begging from the priest a
   blessing upon the warm water; and he blesses it in these words:
   Blessed be the fervour of thy Saints, now and ever and to the ages of
   ages.  Amen.'  Then the deacon pours the water into the chalice,
   saying:  The fervour of faith, full of the Holy Spirit.'"  So Cardinal
   Bona as above.

   The third reason of this rite is assumed by some from the fact that
   Christ is believed thus to have instituted this sacrament at the last
   supper; and this the synod seems to intimate in the present canon when
   it says "as the Lord himself delivered."

   In this case the Greeks suppose that this rite was also handed down by
   the Apostles, and this is evident from their citing the Liturgy of St.
   James, which they believed to be a genuine work of his.

   Canon XXXIII.

   Since we know that, in the region of the Armenians, only those are
   appointed to the clerical orders who are of priestly descent (following
   in this Jewish customs); and some of those who are even untonsured are
   appointed to succeed cantors and readers of the divine law, we decree
   that henceforth it shall not be lawful for those who wish to bring any
   one into the clergy, to pay regard to the descent of him who is to be
   ordained; but let them examine whether they are worthy (according to
   the decrees set forth in the holy canons) to be placed on the list of
   the clergy, so that they may be ecclesiastically promoted, whether they
   are of priestly descent or not; moreover, let them not permit any one
   at all to read in the ambo, according to the order of those enrolled in
   the clergy, unless such an one have received the priestly tonsure and
   the canonical benediction of his own pastor; but if any one shall have
   been observed to act contrary to these directions, let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXIII.

   Whoever is worthy of the priesthood should be ordained whether he is
   sprung of a priestly line or no.  And he that has been blessed
   untonsured shall not read the Holy Scriptures at the ambo.

   Van Espen.

   Here not obscurely does the canon join the clerical tonsure received
   from the bishop with the office of Reader, so much so that he that has
   been tonsured by the bishop is thought to have received at the same
   time the tonsure and the order of lector.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXXIV.

   But in future, since the priestly canon openly sets this forth, that
   the crime of conspiracy or secret society is forbidden by external
   laws, but much more ought it to be prohibited in the Church; we also
   hasten to observe that if any clerics or monks are found either
   conspiring or entering secret societies, or devising anything against
   bishops or clergymen, they shall be altogether deprived of their rank.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXIV.

   If clerics or monks enter into conspiracies or fraternities, or plots
   against the bishop or their fellow clerics, they shall be cast out of
   their grade.

   This is but a renewal of Canon xviij. of Chalcedon, which see with the

   Canon XXXV.

   It shall be lawful for no Metropolitan on the death of a bishop of his
   province to appropriate or sell the private property of the deceased,
   or that of the widowed church:  but these are to be in the custody of
   the clergy of the diocese over which he presided until the election of
   another bishop, unless in the said church there are no clergymen left.
   For then the Metropolitan shall protect the property without
   diminution, handing over everything to the bishop when he is appointed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXV.

   When the bishop is dead the clergy shall guard his goods.  If, however,
   no clergyman remains, the Metropolitan shall take charge of them until
   another be ordained.

   Compare Canon xxii. of Chalcedon. This canon extends the prohibition to
   Metropolitans as well.

   Aristenus.

   Neither the clergy nor metropolitan after the death of the bishop are
   allowed to carry off his goods, but all should be guarded by the clergy
   themselves, until another bishop is chosen.  But if by chance no
   clergyman is left in that church, the metropolitan is to keep all the
   possessions undiminished and to return them to the future bishop.

   Canon XXXVI.

   Renewing the enactments by the 150 Fathers assembled at the
   God-protected and imperial city, and those of the 630 who met at
   Chalcedon; we decree that the see of Constantinople shall have equal
   privileges with the see of Old Rome, and shall be highly regarded in
   ecclesiastical matters as that is, and shall be second after it.  After
   Constantinople shall be ranked the See of Alexandria, then that of
   Antioch, and afterwards the See of Jerusalem.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXVI.

   Let the throne of Constantinople be next after that of Rome, and enjoy
   equal privileges.  After it Alexandria, then Antioch, and then
   Jerusalem.

   Balsamon.

   The Fathers here speak of the Second and Third canons of the Second
   Synod [i.e. I. Constantinople] and of canon xxviij. of the Fourth Synod
   [i.e. Chalcedon].  And read what we have said on these canons.

   Aristenus.

   We have explained the third canon of the Synod of Constantinople and
   the twenty-eighth canon of the Synod of Chalcedon as meaning, when
   asserting that the bishop of Constantinople should enjoy equal
   privileges after the Roman bishop, that he should be placed second from
   the Roman in point of time.  So here too this preposition "after"
   denotes time but not honour.  For after many years this throne of
   Constantinople obtained equal privileges with the Roman Church; because
   it was honoured by the presence of the Emperor and of the Senate.

   On this opinion of Aristenus's the reader is referred to the notes on
   Canon iij. of I. Constantinople.

   Justinian.

   (Novella CXXXI., Cap. ij.)

   We command that according to the definitions of the Four Councils the
   most holy Pope of Old Rome shall be first of all the priests.  But the
   most blessed Archbishop of Constantinople, which is New Rome, shall
   have the second place after the Holy Apostolic See of Old Rome.

   This canon, in a mutilated form, is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici,
   Gratian's Decretum, Pars I., Dist. XXII., c. vj.

   Canon XXXVII.

   Since at different times there have been invasions of barbarians, and
   therefore very many cities have been subjected to the infidels, so that
   the bishop of a city may not be able, after he has been ordained, to
   take possession of his see, and to be settled in it in sacerdotal
   order, and so to perform and manage for it the ordinations and all
   things which by custom appertain to the bishop:  we, preserving honour
   and veneration for the priesthood, and in no wise wishing to employ the
   Gentile injury to the ruin of ecclesiastical rights, have decreed that
   those who have been ordained thus, and on account of the aforesaid
   cause have not been settled in their sees, without any prejudice from
   this thing may be kept [in good standing] and that they may canonically
   perform the ordination of the different clerics and use the authority
   of their office according to the defined limits, and that whatever
   administration proceeds from them may be valid and legitimate.  For the
   exercise of his office shall not be circumscribed by a season of
   necessity when the exact observance of law is circumscribed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXVII.

   A bishop who, on account of the incursions of the barbarians, is not
   set in his throne, shall have his own chair of state, and shall ordain,
   and shall enjoy most firmly all the rights of the priesthood.

   By Canon XVIII. of Antioch the principle of this canon was enunciated,
   that when a bishop did not take possession of his see because he could
   not do so, he was not to be held responsible or to lose any of his
   episcopal rights and powers, in that case the impossibility arose from
   the insubordination of the people, in this from the diocese being in
   the hands of the barbarians.

   It has been commonly thought that the Bishops in partibus infidelium
   had their origin in the state of things calling for this canon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXXVIII.

   The canon which was made by the Fathers we also observe, which thus
   decreed:  If any city be renewed by imperial authority, or shall have
   been renewed, let the order of things ecclesiastical follow the civil
   and public models.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXVIII.

   If any city is or shall be renewed by the Emperor, the ecclesiastical
   order shall follow the political and public example.

   Van Espen.

   The canon of the Fathers which the Synod wishes observed is XVII of
   Chalcedon, the notes on which see.

   Here it must be noted that by "civil and public models" is signified
   the "pragmatic" or imperial letters, by which the emperors granted to
   newly raised up or re-edified towns the privilege of other cities, or
   else annexed them to some Province.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXXIX.

   Since our brother and fellow-worker, John, bishop of the island of
   Cyprus, together with his people in the province of the Hellespont,
   both on account of barbarian incursions, and that they may be freed
   from servitude of the heathen, and may be subject alone to the sceptres
   of most Christian rule, have emigrated from the said island, by the
   providence of the philanthropic God, and the labour of our
   Christ-loving and pious Empress; we determine that the privileges which
   were conceded by the divine fathers who first at Ephesus assembled, are
   to be preserved without any innovations, viz.:  that new
   Justinianopolis shall have the rights of Constantinople and whoever is
   constituted the pious and most religious bishop thereof shall take
   precedence of all the bishops of the province of the Hellespont, and be
   elected [?] by his own bishops according to ancient custom.  For the
   customs which obtain in each church our divine Fathers also took pains
   should be maintained, the existing bishop of the city of Cyzicus being
   subject to the metropolitan of the aforesaid Justinianopolis, for the
   imitation of all the rest of the bishops who are under the aforesaid
   beloved of God metropolitan John, by whom, as custom demands, even the
   bishop of the very city of Cyzicus shall be ordained.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXIX.

   The new Justinianopolis shall have the rights of Constantinople, and
   its prelate shall rule over all the bishops of the Hellespont to whom
   he has gone, and he shall be ordained by his own bishop:  as the
   fathers of Ephesus decreed.

   Hefele.

   Hitherto the bishop of Cyzicus was metropolitan of the province of the
   Hellespont.  Now he too is to be subject to the bishop of
   New-Justinianopolis.  What, however, is meant by "the right of
   Constantinople"?  It was impossible that the Synod should place the
   bishop of Justinianopolis in equal dignity with the patriarch of
   Constantinople.  But they probably meant to say:  "The rights which the
   bishop of Constantinople has hitherto exercised over the province of
   the Hellespont, as chief metropolitan, fall now to the bishop of
   New-Justinianopolis."  Or perhaps we should read, instead of
   Constantinople Konstantineon poleos, as the Amerbachian ms. has it, and
   translate:  "The same rights which Constantia (the metropolis of
   Cyprus) possessed, New Justinianopolis shall henceforth have."  The
   latter is the more probable.

   Van Espen.

   To understand this canon it must be remembered that the Metropolis of
   Cyprus, which was formerly called Constantia, when restored by the
   Emperor Justinian was called by his name, New Justinianopolis.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XL.

   Since to cleave to God by retiring from the noise and turmoil of life
   is very beneficial, it behoves us not without examination to admit
   before the proper time those who choose the monastic life, but to
   observe respecting them the limit handed down by our fathers, in order
   that we may then admit a profession of the life according to God as for
   ever firm, and the result of knowledge and judgment after years of
   discretion have been reached.  He therefore who is about to submit to
   the yoke of monastic life should not be less than ten years of age, the
   examination of the matter depending on the decision of the bishop,
   whether he considers a longer time more conducive for his entrance and
   establishment in the monastic life.  For although the great Basil in
   his holy canons decreed that she who willingly offers to God and
   embraces virginity, if she has completed her seventeenth year, is to be
   entered in the order of virgins:  nevertheless, having followed the
   example respecting widows and deaconesses, analogy and proportion being
   considered, we have admitted at the said time those who have chosen the
   monastic life.  For it is written in the divine Apostle that a widow is
   to be elected in the church at sixty years old:  but the sacred canons
   have decreed that a deaconess shall be ordained at forty, since they
   saw that the Church by divine grace had gone forth more powerful and
   robust and was advancing still further, and they saw the firmness and
   stability of the faithful in observing the divine commandments.
   Wherefore we also, since we most rightly comprehend the matter, appoint
   the benediction of grace to him who is about to enter the struggle
   according to God, even as impressing speedily a certain seal upon him,
   hereupon introducing him to the not-long-to-be-hesitated-over and
   declined, or rather inciting him even to the choice and determination
   of good.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XL.

   A monk must be ten years old.  Even if the Divine Basil thought the one
   shorn should be over seventeen.  But although the Apostle ordains that
   a widow to be espoused to the Church must be sixty, yet the Fathers say
   a Deaconess is to be ordained at forty, the Church in the meanwhile
   having become stronger; so we place the seal on a monk at an earlier
   age.

   Aristenus.

   The eighteenth canon of Basil the Great orders that she who offers
   herself to the Lord and renounces marriage, ought to be over sixteen or
   even seventeen years of age:  so that her promise may be firm and that
   if she violates it she may suffer the due penalties.  For, says he,
   children's voices are not to be thought of any value in such matters.
   But the present canon admits him who is not less than ten years and
   desires to be a monk, but entrusts the determination of the exact time
   to the judgment of the hegumenos, whether he thinks it more
   advantageous to increase the age-requirement for the entering and being
   established in the married life.  But the canon lessens the time
   defined by Basil the Great, because the Fathers thought that the Church
   by divine grace had grown stronger since then, and was going on more
   and more, and that the faithful seemed firmer and more stable for the
   observance of the divine commandments.  And for the same reason, viz.,
   that the Church was growing better, the sacred canons had lessened the
   age of deaconesses, and fixed it at forty years, although the Apostle
   himself orders that no widow is to be chosen into the Church under
   sixty years of age.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLI.

   Those who in town or in villages wish to go away into cloisters, and
   take heed for themselves apart, before they enter a monastery and
   practise the anchorite's life, [370] should for the space of three
   years in the fear of God submit to the Superior of the house, and
   fulfil obedience in all things, as is right, thus shewing forth their
   choice of this life and that they embrace it willingly and with their
   whole hearts; they are then to be examined by the superior (proedros)
   of the place; and then to bear bravely outside the cloister one year
   more, so that their purpose may be fully manifested.  For by this they
   will shew fully and perfectly that they are not catching at vain glory,
   but that they are pursuing the life of solitude because of its inherent
   beauty and honour.  After the completion of such a period, if they
   remain in the same intention in their choice of the life, they are to
   be enclosed, and no longer is it lawful for them to go out of such a
   house when they so desire, unless they be induced to do so for the
   common advantage, or other pressing necessity urging on to death; and
   then only with the blessing of the bishop of that place.

   And those who, without the above-mentioned causes, venture forth of
   their convents, are first of all to be shut up in the said convent even
   against their wills, and then are to cure themselves with fasting and
   other afflictions, knowing how it is written that "no one who has put
   his hand to the plough and has looked back, is fit for the kingdom of
   heaven."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLI.

   Whoever is about to enter a cloister, let him live for three years in a
   monastery, and before he is shut up let him spend one year more, and so
   let him be shut up.  And he shall not then go forth unless death or the
   common good demands.

   Van Espen.

   This canon, so far as it sets forth the necessity of probation before
   admission to the Anchorite life, synods in after-years frequently
   approved, taught as they were by experience how perilous a matter it is
   to admit without sufficient probation to this solitary life and state
   of separation from the common intercourse with his fellow men.  Vide
   the Synod of Vannes (about a.d. 465) canon vij., of Agde chap.
   lxxviij., of Orleans the First can. xxij., of Frankfort can. xij., of
   Toledo the Seventh can. v., and the Capitular of Charlemagne To monks,
   Chap. ij.

   Canon XLII.

   Those who are called Eremites and are clothed in black robes, and with
   long hair go about cities and associate with the worldly both men and
   women and bring odium upon their profession--we decree that if they
   will receive the habit of other monks and wear their hair cut short,
   they may be shut up in a monastery and numbered among the brothers; but
   if they do not choose to do this, they are to be expelled from the
   cities and forced to live in the desert (eremous) from whence also they
   derive their name.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLII.

   An eremite dressed in black vesture and not having his hair cut, unless
   he has his hair cut shall be expelled the city and be shut up in his
   monastery.

   It may not be irreverent to remark that this species of impostors
   always has been common in the East, and many examples will be found of
   the dervishes in the Arabian Nights and other Eastern tales.  The
   "vagabond" monks of the West also became a great nuisance as well as a
   scandal in the Middle Ages.  The reader will find interesting instances
   of Spanish deceivers of the same sort in "Gil Blas" and other Spanish
   romances.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLIII.

   It is lawful for every Christian to choose the life of religious
   discipline, and setting aside the troublous surgings of the affairs of
   this life to enter a monastery, and to be shaven in the fashion of a
   monk, without regard to what faults he may have previously committed.
   For God our Saviour says:  "Whose cometh to me, I will in no wise cast
   out."

   As therefore the monastic method of life engraves upon us as on a
   tablet the life of penitence, we receive [371] whoever approaches it
   [372] sincerely; nor is any custom to be allowed to hinder him from
   fulfilling his intention.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIII.

   Whoever flees from the surging billows of life and desires to enter a
   monastery, shall be allowed to do so.

   Zonaras.

   The greatness or the number of a man's sins ought not to make him lose
   hope of propitiating the divinity by his penitence, if he turns his
   eyes to the divine mercy.  This is what the canon asserts, and affirms
   that everyone, no matter how wicked and nefarious his life may have
   been, may embrace monastic discipline, which inscribes, as on a tablet,
   [373] to us a life of penitence.  For as a tablet describes to us what
   is inscribed upon it, so the monastic profession writes and inscribes
   upon us penitence, so that it remains for ever.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLIV.

   A monk convicted of fornication, or who takes a wife for the communion
   of matrimony and for society, is to be subjected to the penalties of
   fornicators, according to the canons.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIV.

   A monk joined in marriage or committing fornication shall pay the
   penalty of a fornicator.

   The punishment here seems too light, so that Balsamon thinks that this
   canon only refers to such monks as freely confess their sin and desist
   from it, remaining in their monasteries; and that the sterner penalties
   assigned to unchaste religious by other synods (notably Chalcedon, can.
   xvj., and Ancyra, can. xix.) are for such as do not confess their
   faults but are after some time convicted of them.

   Aristenus.

   The monk will receive the same punishment whether he be a fornicator or
   has joined himself with a woman for the communion of marriage.

   Van Espen.

   It is very likely from this canon that the Monastic vow at the time of
   this Synod was not yet an impedimentum dirimens of matrimony, for
   nothing is said about the dissolution of the marriage contracted by a
   monk although he had gravely sinned in violating his faith pledged to
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLV.

   Whereas we understand that in some monasteries of women those who are
   about to be clothed with the sacred habit are first adorned in silks
   and garments of all kinds, and also with gold and jewels, by those who
   bring them thither, and that they thus approach the altar and are there
   stripped of such a display of wealth, and that immediately thereafter
   the blessing of their habit takes place, and they are clothed with the
   black robe; we decree that henceforth this shall not be done.  For it
   is not lawful for her who has already of her own free will put away
   every delight of life, and has embraced that method of life which is
   according to God, and has confirmed it with strong and stable reasons,
   and so has come to the monastery, to recall to memory the things which
   they had already forgotten, things of this world which perisheth and
   passeth away.  For thus they raise in themselves doubts, and are
   disturbed in their souls, like the tossing waves, turning hither and
   thither.  Moreover, they should not give bodily evidence of heaviness
   of heart by weeping, but if a few tears drop from their eyes, as is
   like enough to be the case, they may be supposed by those who see them
   to have flowed me mallon on account of their affection (diatheseos,
   affectionem) for the ascetic struggle rather than (e) because they are
   quitting the world and worldly things.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLV.

   Parents shall not deck out in silks a daughter who has chosen the
   monastic life, and thus clothe her, for this is a recalling to her mind
   the world she is leaving.

   This canon is at the present day constantly broken at the profession of
   Carmelites.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLVI.

   Those women who choose the ascetic life and are settled in monasteries
   may by no means go forth of them.  If, however, any inexorable
   necessity compels them, let them do so with the blessing and permission
   of her who is mother superior; and even then they must not go forth
   alone, but with some old women who are eminent in the monastery, and at
   the command of the lady superior.  But it is not at all permitted that
   they should stop outside.

   And men also who follow the monastic life let them on urgent necessity
   go forth with the blessing of him to whom the rule is entrusted.

   Wherefore, those who transgress that which is now decreed by us,
   whether they be men or women, are to be subjected to suitable
   punishments.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVI.

   A nun shall not go out of her convent without the consent of her
   superior, nor shall she go alone but with an older one of the order.
   It is in no case permitted to her to spend the night outside.  The same
   is the case with a monk; he cannot go out of the monastery without the
   consent of the superior.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLVII.

   No woman may sleep in a monastery of men, nor any man in a monastery of
   women.  For it behoves the faithful to be without offence and to give
   no scandal, and to order their lives decorously and honestly and
   acceptably to God.  But if any one shall have done this, whether he be
   cleric or layman, let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVII.

   It is not allowed that a woman should sleep in a convent of men, nor a
   man in a monastery of women.

   The ground covered by this canon is also found in Justinian's Code,
   Book xliv., Of Bishops and Clergy.  Vide also Novella cxxxiii., chap.
   v.

   Van Espen.

   From the whole context of Justinian's law it is manifest that Justinian
   here is condemning "double monasteries," in which both men and women
   dwelt.  And he wishes such to be separated, the men from the women, and
   e contra the women from the men, and that each should dwell in separate
   monasteries.

   The reader may be reminded of some curious double religious houses in
   England for men and women, of which sometimes a woman was the superior
   of both.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLVIII.

   The wife of him who is advanced to the Episcopal dignity, shall be
   separated from her husband by their mutual consent, and after his
   ordination and consecration to the episcopate she shall enter a
   monastery situated at a distance from the abode of the bishop, and
   there let her enjoy the bishop's provision.  And if she is deemed
   worthy she may be advanced to the dignity of a deaconess.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVIII.

   She who is separated from one about to be consecrated bishop, shall
   enter a monastery after his ordination, situated at a distance from the
   See city, and she shall be provided for by the bishop.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XLIX.

   Renewing also the holy canon, we decree that the monasteries which have
   been once consecrated by the Episcopal will, are always to remain
   monasteries, and the things which belong to them are to be preserved to
   the monastery, and they cannot any more be secular abodes nor be given
   by any one to seculars.  But if anything of this kind has been done
   already, we declare it to be null; and those who hereafter attempt to
   do so are to be subjected to canonical penalties.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIX.

   Monasteries built with the consent of the bishop shall not afterwards
   be turned into secular houses, nor shall they pass into the hands of
   seculars.

   Van Espen.

   This canon renews canon xxiv. of Chalcedon.  And here it may be
   observed that the canons even of Ecumenical Synods fall into desuetude
   little by little, unless the care of bishops and pastors keeps them
   alive, and from the example of this synod it may be seen how often they
   need calling back again into observance.

   Nor can there be any doubt that frequently it would be more
   advantageous to renew the canons already set forth by the Fathers,
   rather than to frame new ones.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon L.

   No one at all, whether cleric or layman, is from this time forward to
   play at dice.  And if any one hereafter shall be found doing so, if he
   be a cleric he is to be deposed, if a layman let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   A layman should not play at dice.

   This renews canons xlii. and xliij. of the Apostolic canons.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LI.

   This holy and ecumenical synod altogether forbids those who are called
   "players," and their "spectacles," as well as the exhibition of hunts,
   and the theatrical dances.  If any one despises the present canon, and
   gives himself to any of the things which are forbidden, if he be a
   cleric he shall be deposed, but if a layman let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LI.

   Whose shall play as an actor or shall attend theatrical representations
   or hunts shall be cut off.  Should he be a cleric he shall be deposed.

   Balsamon.

   Some one will enquire why canon xxiiij. decrees that those in holy
   orders and monks, who are constantly attending horse-races, and scenic
   plays, are to cease or be deposed:  but the present canon says without
   discrimination, that those who give themselves over to such things if
   clergymen are to be deposed, and if laymen to be cut off.  The solution
   is this.  It is one thing and more easily to be endured, that a man
   should be present at a horse-race, or be convicted of going to see a
   play; and another thing, and one that cannot be pardoned, that he
   should give himself over to such things, and to exercise this
   continually as his business.  Wherefore those who have once sinned
   deliberately, are admonished to cease.  If they are not willing to
   obey, they are to be deposed.  But those who are constantly engaged in
   this wickedness, if they are clerics, they must be deposed from their
   clerical place, if laymen they must be cut off.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LII.

   On all days of the holy fast of Lent, except on the Sabbath, the Lord's
   day and the holy day of the Annunciation, the Liturgy of the
   Presanctified is to be said.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LII.

   Throughout the whole of Lent except upon the Lord's day, the Sabbath,
   and upon the day of the Annunciation, the presanctified gifts shall be
   offered.

   Balsamon.

   We do not call the service of the Presanctified the unbloody sacrifice,
   but the offering of the previously offered, and of the perfected
   sacrifice, and of the completed priestly act.

   Van Espen.

   The Greeks therefore confess that the bread once offered and
   consecrated, is not to be consecrated anew on another day; but a new
   offering is made of what was before consecrated and presanctified:
   just as in the Latin Church the consecrated or presanctified bread of
   Maundy Thursday is offered on Good Friday.

   The Patriarch Michael of Constantinople is quoted by Leo Allatius as
   saying that "none of the mystic consecratory prayers are said over the
   presanctified gifts, but the priest only recites the prayer that he may
   be a worthy communicant."

   Some among the later Greeks have been of opinion that the unconsecrated
   wine was consecrated by the commixture with the consecrated bread, and
   (without any words of consecration) was transmuted into the sacred
   blood, [374] and with this seems to agree the already quoted Michael,
   Patriarch of Constantinople, who is cited by Leo Allatius in his
   treatise on the rite of the presanctified.  "The presanctified is put
   into the mystic chalice, and so the wine which was then in it, is
   changed into the holy blood of the Lord."  And with this agrees Simeon,
   Archbishop of Thessalonica, in his answer to Gabriel of Pentapolis,
   when he writes:  "In the mass of the Presanctified no consecration of
   what is in the chalice is made by the invocation of the Holy Spirit and
   of his sign, but by the participation and union of the life-giving
   bread, which is truly the body of Christ."

   From this opinion, which was held by some of the Greeks, it gradually
   became the practice at Constantinople not to dip the bread in the
   Sacred Blood, as Michael the patriarch of this very church testifies.
   But in the ordinary Euchologion of the Greeks it is expressly set forth
   that the presanctified bread before it is reserved, should be dipped in
   the sacred blood, and for this a rite is provided.

   Leo Allatius's Dissertatio de Missa Præsanctificatorum should be read;
   an outline of the service as found in the Euchologion, and as reprinted
   by Renaudotius is as follows.

   First of all vespers is said.  After some lessons and prayers,
   including the "Great Ectenia" and that for the Catechumens, these are
   dismissed.

   After the Catechumens have departed there follows the Ectenia of the
   Faithful.  After which, "Now the heavenly Powers invisibly minister
   with us; for, behold, the King of Glory is borne in.  Behold the mystic
   sacrifice having been perfected is borne aloft by angels.

   "Let us draw near with faith and love, that we may become partakers of
   life eternal.  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

   "Deacon.  Let us accomplish our evening prayer to the Lord.

   "For the precious and presanctified gifts that are offered, let us pray
   to the Lord.  "That our man-loving God, etc." as in the ordinary
   liturgy past the Lord's prayer, and down to the Sancta Sanctis, which
   reads as follows:

   Priest.  Holy things presanctified for holy persons.

   Choir.  One holy, one Lord Jesus Christ, to the Glory of God the
   Father--Amen.

   Then the Communion Hymn and the Communion, and the rest as in the
   ordinary liturgy, except "this whole evening," is said for "this whole
   day," and another prayer is provided in the room of that beginning
   "Lord, who blessest them, etc." [375]

   It is curious to note that on Good Friday, the only day on which the
   Mass of the Presanctified is celebrated in the West, its use has died
   out in the East, and now it is used "on the Wednesdays and Fridays of
   the first six weeks of the Great Quadragesima, on the Thursday of the
   fifth week, and on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of Holy Passion
   Week.  It may also be said, excepting on Saturdays and Sundays, and on
   the Festival of the Annunciation, on other days during the Fast, to
   wit, on those of festivals and their Vigils, and on the Commemoration
   of the Dedication of the Church."

   Symeon, who was bishop of Thessalonica, and flourished in the early
   part of the XV^th Century, complains of the general neglect of the Mass
   of the Presanctified on Good Friday in his time, and says that his
   church was the only one in the Exarchate that then retained it.  He
   ascribes the disuse to the example of the Church of Jerusalem.  See the
   matter treated at length in his Quæstiones, lv.-lix. Migne's Pat. Græc.

   Canon LIII.

   Whereas the spiritual relationship is greater than fleshly affinity;
   and since it has come to our knowledge that in some places certain
   persons who become sponsors to children in holy salvation-bearing
   baptism, afterwards contract matrimony with their mothers (being
   widows), we decree that for the future nothing of this sort is to be
   done.  But if any, after the present canon, shall be observed to do
   this, they must, in the first place, desist from this unlawful
   marriage, and then be subjected to the penalties of fornicators.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LIII.

   Godfathers cannot be permitted to be married with the mother of their
   godchildren.  If any one is so joined, let him do penance after
   separation.

   Johnson.

   (Clergyman's Vade Mecum.)

   The imperial law forbade the adopter parent to marry his or her adopted
   son or daughter; for the godchild was thought a sort of an adopted
   child.  See Justin., Institut., Lib. I., Tit. x.

   Van Espen however refers, and to my mind with greater truth, to
   Justinian's law (xxvj of the Cod. de Nuptiis) which forbids the
   marriage of a man with his nurse or with whoever received him from the
   font, "because," says the law, "nothing can so incite to parental
   affection, and therefore induce a just prohibition of marriage, than a
   bond of this sort by which, through God's meditation, their souls are
   bound together."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LIV.

   The divine scriptures plainly teach us as follows, "Thou shalt not
   approach to any that is near of kin to thee to uncover their
   nakedness."  Basil, the bearer-of-God, has enumerated in his canons
   some marriages which are prohibited and has passed over the greater
   part in silence, and in both these ways has done us good service.  For
   by avoiding a number of disgraceful names (lest by such words he should
   pollute his discourse) he included impurities under general terms, by
   which course he shewed to us in a general way the marriages which are
   forbidden.  But since by such silence, and because of the difficulty of
   understanding what marriages are prohibited, the matter has become
   confused; it seemed good to us to set it forth a little more clearly,
   decreeing that from this time forth he who shall marry with the
   daughter of his father; or a father or son with a mother and daughter;
   or a father and son with two girls who are sisters; or a mother and
   daughter with two brothers; or two brothers with two sisters, fall
   under the canon of seven years, provided they openly separate from this
   unlawful union.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LIV.

   Thou shalt not permit the marriage of a son of a brother to the
   daughter of a brother; nor with a daughter and her mother shall there
   be the marriage of a son and his father; neither a mother and a
   daughter with two brothers; nor brothers with two sisters.  But should
   anything of this sort have been done, together with separation, penance
   shall be done for seven years.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LV.

   Since we understand that in the city of the Romans, in the holy fast of
   Lent they fast on the Saturdays, contrary to the ecclesiastical
   observance which is traditional, it seemed good to the holy synod that
   also in the Church of the Romans the canon shall immovably stands fast
   which says:  "If any cleric shall be found to fast on a Sunday or
   Saturday (except on one occasion only) he is to be deposed; and if he
   is a layman he shall be cut off."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LV.

   The Romans fast the Sabbaths of Lent.  Therefore this Synod admonishes
   that upon these days the Apostolical canon is of force.

   The canon quoted is LXVI. of the Apostolic Canons.

   Van Espen.

   The Fathers of this Synod thought that this canon of the Apostles was
   edited by the Apostles themselves, and therefore they seem to have
   reprobated the custom of the Roman Church of fasting on the Sabbath
   more bitterly than was right.  Whence it happens this is one of those
   canons which the Roman Church never received.

   Zonaras.

   The synod took in hand to correct this failing (sphalma) of the Latins;
   but until this time they have arrogantly remained in their pertinacity,
   and so remain to-day.  Nor do they heed the ancient canons which forbid
   fasting on the Sabbath except that one, to wit the great Sabbath, nor
   are they affected by the authority of this canon.  Moreover the clerics
   have no regard for the threatened deposition, nor the laymen for their
   being cut off.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LVI.

   We have likewise learned that in the regions of Armenia and in other
   places certain people eat eggs and cheese on the Sabbaths and Lord's
   days of the holy lent.  It seems good therefore that the whole Church
   of God which is in all the world should follow one rule and keep the
   fast perfectly, and as they abstain from everything which is killed, so
   also should they from eggs and cheese, which are the fruit and produce
   of those animals from which we abstain.  But if any shall not observe
   this law, if they be clerics, let them be deposed; but if laymen, let
   them be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LVI.

   Armenians eat eggs and cheese on the Sabbaths in Lent.  It is
   determined that the whole world should abstain from these.  If not let
   the offender be cast out.

   Van Espen.

   This canon shows that the ancient Greeks, although they did not fast on
   the Sabbaths and Lord's days of Lent, nevertheless they abstained on
   them from flesh food; and it was believed by them that abstinence from
   flesh food involved also necessarily abstinence from all those things
   which have their origin from flesh.  This also formerly was observed by
   the Latins in Lent, and in certain regions is known still to be the
   usage.

   It is not right to offer honey and milk on the altar.

   Notes.

   No one should offer honey or milk at the altar.

   See canon iij. of the Apostles, canon xxviij. of the African code, also
   canon xxviij. of this synod.  The Greeks apparently do not recognize
   the exception specified in the canon of the African Code.

   Canon LVIII.

   None of those who are in the order of laymen may distribute the Divine
   Mysteries to himself if a bishop, presbyter, or deacon be present.  But
   whoso shall dare to do such a thing, as acting contrary to what has
   been determined shall be cut off for a week and thenceforth let him
   learn not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LVIII.

   A layman shall not communicate himself.  Should he do so, let him be
   cut off for a week.

   Van Espen.

   It is well known that in the first centuries it was customary that the
   Holy Eucharist should be taken back by the faithful to their houses;
   and that at home they received it at their own hands.  It is evident
   that this was what was done by the Anchorites and monks who lived in
   the deserts, as may be seen proved by Cardinal Bona.  (De Rebus
   Liturg., Lib. II., cap. xvij.).  From this domestic communion it is
   easily seen how the abuse arose which is condemned in this canon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LIX.

   Baptism is by no means to be administered in an oratory which is within
   a house; but they who are about to be held worthy of the spotless
   illumination are to go to a Catholic Church and there to enjoy this
   gift.  But if any one shall be convicted of not observing what we have
   determined, if he be a cleric let him be deposed, if a layman let him
   be cut off.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LIX.

   In oratories built in houses they shall not celebrate baptism.  Whoever
   shall not observe this, if a cleric he shall be deposed, if a layman he
   shall be cut off.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LX.

   Since the Apostle exclaims that he who cleaves to the Lord is one
   spirit, it is clear that he who is intimate with his [i.e. the Lord's]
   enemy becomes one by his affinity with him.  Therefore, those who
   pretend they are possessed by a devil and by their depravity of manners
   feign to manifest their form and appearance; it seems good by all means
   that they should be punished and that they should be subjected to
   afflictions and hardships of the same kind as those to which they who
   are truly demoniacally possessed are justly subjected with the intent
   of delivering them from the [work or rather] energy of the devil.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LX.

   Whoever shall pretend to be possessed by a devil, shall endure the
   penance of demoniacs.

   Zonaras says in his scholion that even in his day people made the same
   claim to diabolical possession.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXI.

   Those who give themselves up to soothsayers or to those who are called
   hecatontarchs or to any such, in order that they may learn from them
   what things [376] they wish to have revealed to them, let all such,
   according to the decrees lately made by the Fathers concerning them, be
   subjected to the canon of six years.  And to this [penalty] they also
   should be subjected who carry about [377] she-bears or animals of the
   kind for the diversion and injury of the simple; as well as those who
   tell fortunes and fates, and genealogy, and a multitude of words of
   this kind from the nonsense of deceit and imposture.  Also those who
   are called expellers of clouds, enchanters, amulet-givers, and
   soothsayers.

   And those who persist in these things, and do not turn away and flee
   from pernicious and Greek pursuits of this kind, we declare are to be
   thrust out of the Church, as also the sacred canons say.  "For what
   fellowship hath light with darkness?" as saith the Apostle, "or what
   agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? or what part
   hath he that believeth with an infidel?  And what concord hath Christ
   with Belial?"

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXI.

   Whoever shall deliver himself over to a hecatontarch or to devils, so
   as to learn some secret, he shall be put under penance for six years.
   So too those who take around a bear, who join themselves with those who
   seek incantations and drive away the clouds, and have faith in fortune
   and fate, shall be cast out of the assembly of the Church.

   Hefele.

   According to Balsamon (in Beveridge, Synod., Tom. I., p. 228) old
   people who had the reputation of special knowledge [were called
   "hecatontarchs"].  They sold the hair [of these she bears and other
   animals] as medicine or for an amulet.  Cf. Balsamon and Zonaras ut
   supra.

   St. Chrysostom in his Homilies on the Statutes explains, in answer to
   certain who defended them on this ground, that if these incantations
   are made in the name of Christ they are so much the worse.  The Saint
   says, "Moreover I think that she is to be hated all the more who abuses
   the name of God for this purpose, because while professing to be a
   Christian, she shows by her actions that she is a heathen."

   Canon LXII.

   The so-called Calends, and what are called Bota and Brumalia, and the
   full assembly which takes place on the first of March, we wish to be
   abolished from the life of the faithful.  And also the public dances of
   women, which may do much harm and mischief.  Moreover we drive away
   from the life of Christians the dances given in the names of those
   falsely called gods by the Greeks whether of men or women, and which
   are performed after an ancient and un-Christian fashion; decreeing that
   no man from this time forth shall be dressed as a woman, nor any woman
   in the garb suitable to men.  Nor shall he assume comic, satyric, or
   tragic masks; nor may men invoke the name of the execrable Bacchus when
   they squeeze out the wine in the presses; nor when pouring out wine
   into jars [to cause a laugh [378] ], practising in ignorance and vanity
   the things which proceed from the deceit of insanity.  Therefore those
   who in the future attempt any of these things which are written, having
   obtained a knowledge of them, if they be clerics we order them to be
   deposed, and if laymen to be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXII.

   Let these be taken away from the lives of the faithful, viz.:  the
   Bota, and the Calends, and the Brumalia, and salutations in honour of
   the gods, and comic, satyric and tragic masks, and the invocation of
   Bacchus at the wine press, and the laughing at the wine jars.  Whoever
   shall persist in these after this canon shall be liable to give an
   account.

   On the Calends see Du Cange (Glossarium in loc.).  The Bota were feasts
   in honour of Pan, the Brumalia feasts in honour of Bacchus.  Many
   particulars with regard to these superstitions will be found in
   Balsamon's scholion, to which the curious reader is referred.  Van
   Espen also has some valuable notes on the Kalends of January.

   dishonour the martyrs of Christ and induce unbelief among those who

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXIII.

   Martyrologies made up by the ethnics (Elle nion) shall not be published
   in church.

   What is condemned is false histories of true martyrs, not (as Johnson
   erroneously supposes) "false legends of pretended martyrs."  There have
   been martyrs, both royal and plebeian, in much later times whose lives
   have been made ridiculous and whose memory has been rendered hateful to
   the ignorant people by so-called "histories" which might well have
   received the treatment ordered by the canon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXIV.

   It does not befit a layman to dispute or teach publicly, thus claiming
   for himself authority to teach, but he should yield to the order
   appointed by the Lord, and to open his ears to those who have received
   the grace to teach, and be taught by them divine things; for in one
   Church God has made "different members," according to the word of the
   Apostle:  and Gregory the Theologian, wisely interpreting this passage,
   commends the order in vogue with them saying: [379]   "This order
   brethren we revere, this we guard.  Let this one be the ear; that one
   the tongue, the hand or any other member.  Let this one teach, but let
   that one learn."  And a little further on:  "Learning in docility and
   abounding in cheerfulness, and ministering with alacrity, we shall not
   all be the tongue which is the more active member, not all of us
   Apostles, not all prophets, nor shall we all interpret."  And again:
   "Why dost thou make thyself a shepherd when thou art a sheep?  Why
   become the head when thou art a foot?  Why dost thou try to be a
   commander when thou art enrolled in the number of the soldiers?"  And
   elsewhere:  "Wisdom orders, Be not swift in words; nor compare thyself
   with the rich, being poor; nor seek to be wiser than the wise."  But if
   any one be found weakening the present canon, he is to be cut off for
   forty days.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXIV.

   A layman shall not teach, for all are not prophets, nor all apostles.

   Zonaras points out that this canon refers only to public instruction
   and not to private.  Van Espen further notes that in the West this
   restriction is limited to the solemn and public preaching and
   announcing of the Word of God, which is restricted to bishops, and only
   by special and express license given to the other clergy, and refers to
   his own treatment of the subject In jure Eccles., Tom I., part 1, tit.

   The fires which are lighted on the new moons by some before their shops

   wont foolishly and crazily to leap, we order henceforth to cease.
   Therefore, whosoever shall do such a thing, if he be a cleric, let him

   written in the Fourth Book of the Kings "And Manasses built an altar to
   the whole host of heaven, in the two courts of the Lord, and made his
   sons to pass through the fire, he used lots and augurs and divinations
   by birds and made ventriloquists [or pythons [380] ] and multiplied
   diviners, that he might do evil before the Lord and provoke him to
   anger." [381]

   From the holy day of the Resurrection of Christ our God until the next

   to be free from labour, rejoicing in Christ with psalms and hymns and
   spiritual songs; and celebrating the feast, and applying their minds to
   the reading of the holy Scriptures, and delighting in the Holy
   Mysteries; for thus shall we be exalted with Christ and together with
   him be raised up.  Therefore, on the aforesaid days there must not be
   any horse races or any public spectacle.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVI.

   The faithful shall every one of them go to church during the whole week
   after Easter.

   Van Espen.

   It is certain that the whole of Easter week was kept as a feast by the
   whole Church both East and West; and this Synod did not introduce this
   custom by its canon, but adopted this canon to ensure its continuance.

   Here we have clearly set forth the Christian manner of passing a
   feast-day, viz., that the faithful on those days did give themselves up
   to "Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs," from which the divine office
   which we call today canonical [i.e., chiefly Mattins and Vespers] are
   made up; and hence we understand that all the faithful ought to attend
   the choir-offices, which was indeed observed for many centuries, as I
   have shewn in my Dissertation on the Canonical Hours, cap. III., § 1,
   and therefore it was called "public" [or common] prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXVII.

   The divine Scripture commands us to abstain from blood, from things
   strangled, and from fornication.  Those therefore who on account of a
   dainty stomach prepare by any art for food the blood of any animal, and
   so eat it, we punish suitably.  If anyone henceforth venture to eat in
   any way the blood of an animal, if he be a clergyman, let him be
   deposed; if a layman, let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVII.

   A cleric eating blood shall be deposed, but a layman shall be cut off.

   Van Espen.

   The apostolic precept of abstaining "from blood and from things
   strangled" for some ages, not only among the Greeks but also among the
   Latins, was observed in many churches, but little by little and step by
   step it died out in the whole Church, at least in the Latin Church,
   altogether.

   In this the Latin Church followed the opinion of St. Augustine, Contra
   Faustum Manichæum, Lib. XXXII., cap. xiij., where he teaches at great
   length that the precept was given to Christians only while the Gentile
   Church was not yet settled.  This passage of Augustine also proves that
   at that time Africa did not observe this precept of the Apostles.

   Canon LXVIII.

   It is unlawful for anyone to corrupt or cut up a book of the Old or New
   Testament or of our holy and approved preachers and teachers, or to
   give them up to the traders in books or to those who are called
   perfumers, or to hand it over for destruction to any other like
   persons:  unless to be sure it has been rendered useless either by
   bookworms, or by water, or in some other way.  He who henceforth shall
   be observed to do such a thing shall be cut off for one year.  Likewise
   also he who buys such books (unless he keeps them for his own use, or
   gives them to another for his benefit to be preserved) and has
   attempted to corrupt them, let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVIII.

   Thou shalt not destroy nor hand over copies of the Divine Scriptures to
   be destroyed unless they are absolutely useless.

   Van Espen.

   (Foot-note.)

   I think that this canon was directed against certain Nestorian and
   Eutychian heretics, who, that they might find some patronage of their
   errors from the Holy Scriptures, dared in the sixth century most
   infamously to corrupt certain passages of the New Testament.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXIX.

   It is not permitted to a layman to enter the sanctuary (Holy Altar,
   Gk.), though, in accordance with a certain ancient tradition, the
   imperial power and authority is by no means prohibited from this when
   he wishes to offer his gifts to the Creator.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXIX.

   No layman except the Emperor shall go up to the altar.

   Van Espen.

   That in the Latin Church as well as in the Greek for many centuries it
   was the constant custom, ratified by various councils, that lay-men are
   to be excluded from the sanctuary and from the place marked off for the
   priests who are celebrating the divine mysteries, is so notorious as to
   need no proof, and the present canon shows that among the Greeks the
   laity were not admitted to the sacrarium even to make offerings.

   The Synod makes but one exception, to wit, the Emperor, who can enter
   the rails of the holy altar by its permission "when he wishes to offer
   his gifts to the Creator, according to ancient custom."

   Not without foundation does the Synod claim "ancient custom" for this;
   for long before, it is evident, it was the case from the words of the
   Emperor Theodosius the Younger.  See also Theodoret (H. E., lib. v.,
   cap. xvij.).

   In the Latin Church, not only to emperors, kings, and great princes but
   also to patrons of churches, to toparchs of places, and even to
   magistrates, seats have been wont to be assigned honoris causâ within
   the sanctuary or choir, and it has been contended that these are
   properly due to such persons.

   It is evident from Balsamon's note that the later Greeks at least
   looked upon the Emperor as being (like the kings of England and France)
   a persona mixta, sharing in some degree the sacerdotal character, as
   being anointed not merely with oil, but with the sacred chrism.  Vide
   in this connexion J. Wickham Legg, The Sacring of the English Kings, in
   "The Archæological Journal," March, 1894.

   Those who are taught the civil laws must not adopt the customs of the
   Gentiles, nor be induced to go to the theatre, nor to keep what are
   called Cylestras, nor to wear clothing contrary to the general custom;
   and this holds good when they begin their training, when they reach its
   end, and, in short, all the time of its duration.  If any one from this
   time shall dare to do contrary to this canon he is to be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXI.

   Whoever devotes himself to the study of law, uses the manner of the
   Gentiles, going to the theatre, and rolling in the dust, or dressing
   differently to custom, shall be cut off.

   Liddell and Scott identify kalistra with kalindethra , which they
   define as "a place for horses to roll after exercise," and note that it
   is a synonym of alindethra.  But it is interesting to note that
   alinesis is "a rolling in the dust, an exercise in which wrestlers
   rolled on the ground."

   Hefele says that Balsamon and Zonaras have not been able rightly to
   explain what we are to understand by the forbidden "Cylestras," but I
   think Johnson is not far out of the way when he translates "nor to
   meddle with athletic exercises."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXXII.

   An orthodox man is not permitted to marry an heretical woman, nor an
   orthodox woman to be joined to an heretical man.  But if anything of
   this kind appear to have been done by any [we require them] to consider
   the marriage null, and that the marriage be dissolved.  For it is not
   fitting to mingle together what should not be mingled, nor is it right
   that the sheep be joined with the wolf, nor the lot of sinners with the
   portion of Christ.  But if any one shall transgress the things which we
   have decreed let him be cut off.  But if any who up to this time are
   unbelievers and are not yet numbered in the flock of the orthodox have
   contracted lawful marriage between themselves, and if then, one
   choosing the right and coming to the light of truth and the other
   remaining still detained by the bond of error and not willing to behold
   with steady eye the divine rays, the unbelieving woman is pleased to
   cohabit with the believing man, or the unbelieving man with the
   believing woman, let them not be separated, according to the divine
   Apostle, "for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and
   the unbelieving wife by her husband."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXII.

   A marriage contracted with heretics is void.  But if they have made the
   contract before [conversion] let them remain [united] if they so
   desire.

   Perhaps none of the canons of this synod present greater and more
   insolvable difficulties than the present.  It has been for long
   centuries the tradition of the Church that the marriage of a baptized
   Christian with an unbaptized person is null, but this canon seems to
   say that the same is the case if the one party be a heretic even though
   baptized.  If this is what the canon means it elevates heresy into an
   impedimentum dirimens.  Such is not and never has been the law of the
   West, and such is not to-day the practice of the Eastern church, which
   allows the marriage of its people with Lutherans and with Roman
   Catholics and never questions the validity of their marriages.  Van
   Espen thinks "the Greek commentators seem" to think that the heretics
   referred to are unbaptized; I do not know exactly why he thinks so.

   Canon LXXIII.

   Since the life-giving cross has shewn to us Salvation, we should be
   careful that we render due honour to that by which we were saved from
   the ancient fall.  Wherefore, in mind, in word, in feeling giving
   veneration (proskunesin) to it, we command that the figure of the
   cross, which some have placed on the floor, be entirely removed
   therefrom, lest the trophy of the victory won for us be desecrated by
   the trampling under foot of those who walk over it.  Therefore those
   who from this present represent on the pavement the sign of the cross,
   we decree are to be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXIII.

   If there is a cross upon a pavement it must be removed.

   This canon defines that to the image of the cross is to be "given
   veneration (proskunesis) of the intellect, of the words, and of the
   sense," i.e., the cross is to be venerated with the interior cultus of
   the soul, is to be venerated with the exterior culture of praise, and
   also with sensible acts, such as kissings, bowings, etc.

   It is not permitted to hold what are called Agapæ, that is love-feasts,

   spread couches.  If any dare to do so let him cease therefrom or be cut
   off.

   Notes.

   Agapæ are not to be held in the churches, nor shall beds be put up.
   Whoso refuse to give up these, let them be cut off.

   Canon LXXV.

   We will that those whose office it is to sing in the churches do not
   use undisciplined vociferations, nor force nature to shouting, nor
   adopt any of those modes which are incongruous and unsuitable for the
   church:  but that they offer the psalmody to God, who is the observer
   of secrets, with great attention and compunction.  For the Sacred
   Oracle taught that the Sons of Israel were to be pious. [382]

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXV.

   Inordinate vociferation of the psalms is not allowed, nor he that
   adopts things unsuited to the churches.

   This question of the character of church-music was one early discussed
   among Christians, and (long before the time of this synod), St.
   Augustine, in debating as to whether the chanting or the reading of the
   psalter was the more edifying, concludes, "when the psalms are chanted
   with a voice and most suitable modulation (liquida voce et
   convenientissima modulatione), I recognize that there is great utility
   in the practice," and further on he adds that singing is to be the
   rather approved, because "by the delight given to the ears the infirm
   soul is worked up to pious aspirations."  (Confess. Lib. x., cap.
   xxxiij.).

   Canon LXXVI.

   It is not right that those who are responsible for reverence to
   churches should place within the sacred bounds an eating place, nor
   offer food there, nor make other sales.  For God our Saviour teaching
   us when he was tabernacling in the flesh commanded not to make his
   Father's house a house of merchandize.  He also poured out the small
   coins of the money-changers, and drave out all those who made common
   the temple.  If, therefore, anyone shall be taken in the aforesaid
   fault let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXVI.

   A public house should not be established within the sacred precincts;
   and it is wrong to sell food there; and whosoever shall do so shall be
   cut off.

   Both Balsamon and Zonaras remark that this canon refers to the
   vestibule of the church and to the rest of the sacred inclosure, and
   not to the interior of the church proper, for there no one would ever
   think of having a shop.

   Canon LXXVII.

   It is not right that those who are dedicated to religion, whether
   clerics or ascetics, [383] should wash in the bath with women, nor
   should any Christian man or layman do so.  For this is severely
   condemned by the heathens.  But if any one is caught in this thing, if
   he is a cleric let him be deposed; if a layman, let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXVII.

   A Christian man shall not bathe with women.  Should a cleric do so he
   is to be deposed, and a layman cut off.

   This is a renewal of the XXX^th canon of Laodicea.  It will be noted,
   as Zonaras remarks, that the monks must be counted among the laymen who
   are to be cut off, since they have no clerical character or tonsure.

   Canon LXXIX.

   As we confess the divine birth of the Virgin to be without any
   childbed, since it came to pass without seed, and as we preach this to
   the entire flock, so we subject to correction those who through
   ignorance do anything which is inconsistent therewith.  Wherefore since
   some on the day after the holy Nativity of Christ our God are seen
   cooking semidalin , and distributing it to each other, on pretext of
   doing honour to the puerperia of the spotless Virgin Maternity, we
   decree that henceforth nothing of the kind be done by the faithful.
   For this is not honouring the Virgin (who above thought and speech bare
   in the flesh the incomprehensible Word) when we define [384] and
   describe, from ordinary things and from such as occur with ourselves,
   her ineffable parturition.  If therefore anyone henceforth be
   discovered doing any such thing, if he be a cleric let him be deposed,
   but if a layman let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXIX.

   Whoever after the feast of the Mother of God shall prepare semidilin
   (semilam) or anything else on account of what is called puerperia, let
   him be cut off.

   As the Catholic Church has always taught the Virgin-birth as well as
   the Virgin-conception of our Blessed Lord, and has affirmed that Mary
   was ever-virgin, even after she had brought forth the incarnate Son, so
   it follows necessarily that there could be no childbed nor puerperal
   flux.  It need hardly be remarked here that besides other texts that of
   the prophet is considered as teaching thus much, "Behold the Virgin (ha
   alma) shall conceive and bear a son," she that "bare" as well as she
   that "conceived" being a virgin.  Some commentators have taken
   epilocheia for the afterbirth, but Christian Lupus, as Van Espen notes,
   has pointed out that the early fathers seem to have recognized that the
   Virgin did have the "afterbirth," and this St. Jerome expressly teaches
   in his book, Contra Helvidium.

   The Greeks, however, understood it as I have translated, and the
   witness of Zonaras will be sufficient.  The words lochos, lochaios and
   the like all signify "lying in," "a place of lying in," and Liddell and
   Scott say that the latter word is used of "bearing down like heavy ears
   of corn," which would well express the labour pains.

   Zonaras.

   This canon teaches that the parturition of the holy Virgin was without
   any childbed.  For childbed (puerperium) is the emission of the foetus
   accompanied by pain and a flux of blood:  but none of us ever believed
   that the Mother of God was subjected to sufferings of this sort, for
   these are the consequents of natural conception, but her conception was
   supernatural; and by the Holy Spirit it was brought to pass that she
   was not subjected to those evils which rightly are attached to natural
   parturition.

   On this canon should be read the extensive treatment of Asseman (Bib.
   Juris Orient., Tom. v., pp. 193 et seqq.)

   necessity nor difficult business so as to keep him from church for a
   very long time, but being in town does not go to church on three
   consecutive Sundays--three weeks--if he is a cleric let him be deposed,
   but if a layman let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   If anyone without the constraint of necessity leaves his church for
   three Lord's days, he shall be deprived of communion.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXXXI.

   Whereas we have heard that in some places in the hymn Trisagion there
   is added after "Holy and Immortal," "Who was crucified for us, have
   mercy upon us," and since this as being alien to piety was by the
   ancient and holy Fathers cast out of the hymn, as also the violent
   heretics who inserted these new words were cast out of the Church; we
   also, confirming the things which were formerly piously established by
   our holy Fathers, anathematize those who after this present decree
   allow in church this or any other addition to the most sacred hymn; but
   if indeed he who has transgressed is of the sacerdotal order, we
   command that he be deprived of his priestly dignity, but if he be a
   layman or monk let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXI.

   Whoever adds to the hymn Trisagion these words "Who wast crucified"
   shall be deemed heterodox.

   The addition of the phrase condemned by this canon was probably made
   first by Peter Fullo, and although indeed it was capable of a good
   meaning, if the whole hymn was understood as being addressed to Christ,
   and although this was admitted by very many of the orthodox, yet as it
   was chiefly used by the Monophysites and with an undoubtedly heretical
   intention, it was finally ousted from this position and its adherents
   were styled Theopaschites.  From all this it came about that by 518 it
   was a source of disagreement among the Catholics, some affirming the
   expression, as looked at by itself, to be a touchstone of orthodoxy.
   The Emperor Justinian tried to have it approved by Pope Hormisdas, but
   unsuccessfully, the pontiff only declaring that it was unnecessary, and
   even dangerous.  Fulgentius of Ruspe and Dionysius Exiguus had declared
   it orthodox.  Pope John II. almost came to the point of approving the
   phrase "one of the Trinity suffered," nor did his successor Agapetus I.
   speak any more definitely on the point, but the Fifth Ecumenical
   Council directly approved the formula.

   But this, of course, did not touch the point of its introduction into
   the Trisagion or, more accurately, of the introduction of the words
   "who was crucified for us."

   It should have been noted that at a Home Synod in 478, Peter Fullo had
   been deposed for the insertion of this clause, because he intended to
   imply that the true God had suffered death upon the cross.  This
   sentence was a confirmation of one already pronounced against him by a
   synod held at Antioch which had raised a man, Stephen by name, to its
   episcopal throne.

   Such is the history of a matter which, while it seemed at first as of
   little moment, yet for many years was a source of trouble in the
   Church.  (Vide Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. III., pp. 454,
   457; Vol. IV., p. 26.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXXXII.

   In some pictures of the venerable icons, a lamb is painted to which the
   Precursor points his finger, which is received as a type of grace,
   indicating beforehand through the Law, our true Lamb, Christ our God.
   Embracing therefore the ancient types and shadows as symbols of the
   truth, and patterns given to the Church, we prefer "grace and truth,"
   receiving it as the fulfilment of the Law.  In order therefore that
   "that which is perfect" may be delineated to the eyes of all, at least
   in coloured expression, we decree that the figure in human form of the
   Lamb who taketh away the sin of the world, Christ our God, be
   henceforth exhibited in images, instead of the ancient lamb, so that
   all may understand by means of it the depths of the humiliation of the
   Word of God, and that we may recall to our memory his conversation in
   the flesh, his passion and salutary death, and his redemption which was
   wrought for the whole world.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXII.

   Thou shalt not paint a lamb for the type of Christ, but himself.

   As from this canon, a century earlier than the iconoclastic
   controversy, the prevalence of pictures is evident, so from the canon
   of the same synod with regard to the veneration due to the image of the
   cross (number lxxiii.), we learn that the teaching of the Church with
   regard to relative worship was the same as was subsequently set forth,
   so that the charge of innovating, sometimes rashly brought against the
   Seventh Ecumenical Council, has no foundation in fact whatever.

   This canon is further interesting as being the one cited by more than
   one Pope and Western Authority as belonging to "the Sixth Synod."

   The Sacraments must not be given to a dead body.

   This is canon iv. of the Council of Hippo, in the year 393.  (Vide

   that they are undoubtedly baptized; and as often as they are themselves
   unable on account of their age to answer satisfactorily in respect to
   the initiatory mystery given to them; that they ought without any
   offence to be baptized, lest such a doubt might deprive them of the
   sanctification of such a purification.

   Whoever do not know nor can prove by documents that they have been
   baptized, let them be christened.

   will add strength and stability to the liberty given, and they will
   bring it to pass that faith will be kept in those things which they now

   Canon LXXXVII.

   She who has left her husband is an adulteress if she has come to
   another, according to the holy and divine Basil, who has gathered this
   most excellently from the prophet Jeremiah:  "If a woman has become
   another man's, her husband shall not return to her, but being defiled
   she shall remain defiled;" and again, "He who has an adulteress is
   senseless and impious."  If therefore she appears to have departed from
   her husband without reason, he is deserving of pardon and she of
   punishment.  And pardon shall be given to him that he may be in
   communion with the Church.  But he who leaves the wife lawfully given
   him, and shall take another is guilty of adultery by the sentence of
   the Lord.  And it has been decreed by our Fathers that they who are
   such must be "weepers" for a year, "hearers" for two years,
   "prostrators" for three years, and in the seventh year to stand with
   the faithful and thus be counted worthy of the Oblation [if with tears
   they do penance].

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXVII.

   She who goes from her husband to another man is an adulteress.  And he
   who from his wife goes to another woman is an adulterer according to
   the word of the Lord.

   Compare with this canon lviij. of St. Basil.

   The words in brackets are found in Beveridge, but were lacking in
   Hervetus's text.

   Johnson.

   Here discipline is relaxed; formerly an adulteress did fifteen years'
   penance.  See Can. Bas., 58.  No wonder if in 200 years' time from St.
   Basil, the severity of discipline was abated.

   No one may drive any beast into a church except perchance a traveller,

   resting-place, may have turned aside into said church.  For unless the
   beast had been taken inside, it would have perished, and he, by the
   loss of his beast of burden, and thus without means of continuing his
   journey, would be in peril of death.  And we are taught that the
   Sabbath was made for man:  wherefore also the safety and comfort of man
   are by all means to be placed first.  But should anyone be detected
   without any necessity such as we have just mentioned, leading his beast
   into a church, if he be a cleric let him be deposed, and if a layman
   let him be cut off.

   The faithful spending the days of the Salutatory Passion in fasting,
   praying and compunction of heart, ought to fast until the midnight of
   the Great Sabbath:  since the divine Evangelists, Matthew and Luke,
   have shewn us how late at night it was [that the resurrection took
   place], the one by using the words oPse sabbaton, and the other by the
   words orthrou batheos.

   On the Great Sabbath the fast must be continued until midnight.

   Canon XC.

   We have received from our divine Fathers the canon law that in honour
   of Christ's resurrection, we are not to kneel on Sundays.  Lest
   therefore we should ignore the fulness of this observance we make it
   plain to the faithful that after the priests have gone to the Altar for
   Vespers on Saturdays (according to the prevailing custom) no one shall
   kneel in prayer until the evening of Sunday, at which time after the
   entrance for compline, again with bended knees we offer our prayers to
   the Lord.  For taking the night after the Sabbath, which was the
   forerunner of our Lord's resurrection, we begin from it to sing in the
   spirit hymns to God, leading our feast out of darkness into light, and
   thus during an entire day and night, we celebrate the Resurrection.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XC.

   From the evening entrance of the Sabbath until the evening entrance of
   the Lord's day there must be no kneeling.

   Van Espen.

   No doubt the synod by the words "we have received from the divine
   Fathers," referred to canon xx. of the Council of Nice.

   For many centuries this custom was preserved even in the Latin Church;
   and the custom of keeping feasts and whole days generally from evening
   to evening is believed to have been an Apostolic tradition, received by
   them from the Jews.  At the end of the VIII^th Century the Synod of
   Frankfort declared in its xxj. canon, that "the Lord's day should be
   kept from evening to evening." [385]

   Whoever gives or receives medicine to produce abortion is a homicide.

   See Canon XXI. of Ancyra, and Canon II. of St. Basil; to wit, "She who

   And we pay no attention to the subtile distinction as to whether the
   foetus was formed or unformed.  And by this not only is justice
   satisfied for the child that should have been born, but also for her
   who prepared for herself the snares, since the women very often die who

   Canon XCIII.

   If the wife of a man who has gone away and does not appear, cohabit
   with another before she is assured of the death of the first, she is an
   adulteress.  The wives of soldiers who have married husbands who do not
   appear are in the same case; as are also they who on account of the
   wanderings of their husbands do not wait for their return.  But the
   circumstance here has some excuse, in that the suspicion of his death
   becomes very great.  But she who in ignorance has married a man who at
   the time was deserted by his wife, and then is dismissed because his
   first wife returns to him, has indeed committed fornication, but
   through ignorance; therefore she is not prevented from marrying, but it
   is better if she remain as she is.  If a soldier shall return after a
   long time, and find his wife on account of his long absence has been
   united to another man, if he so wishes, he may receive his own wife
   [back again], pardon being extended in consideration of their ignorance
   both to her and to the man who took her home in second marriage.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCIII.

   A woman who when her husband does not turn up, before she is certain he
   is dead, takes another commits adultery.  But when the man returns he
   may receive her again, if he so elects.

   The reference is to canon lxxxj. of St. Basil's canons.

   Van Espen.

   Tertullian (De Idolatria, cap. xx.) supposes that to swear by the false
   gods of the Gentiles, contains in itself some idolatry, an opinion
   shared by St. Basil, comparing those using such oaths with them who
   betrayed Christ, and who are partakers of the talk of devils.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XCV.

   Those who from the heretics come over to orthodoxy, and to the number
   of those who should be saved, we receive according to the following
   order and custom.  Arians, Macedonians, Novatians, who call themselves
   Cathari, Aristeri, and Testareskaidecatitæ, or Tetraditæ, and
   Apollinarians, we receive on their presentation of certificates and on
   their anathematizing every heresy which does not hold as does the holy
   Apostolic Church of God:  then first of all we anoint them with the
   holy chrism on their foreheads, eyes, nostrils, mouth and ears; and as
   we seal them we say--"The seal of the gift of the Holy Ghost."

   But concerning the Paulianists it has been determined by the Catholic
   Church that they shall by all means be rebaptized.  The Eunomeans also,
   who baptize with one immersion; and the Montanists, who here are called
   Phrygians; and the Sabellians, who consider the Son to be the same as
   the Father, and are guilty in certain other grave matters, and all the
   other heresies--for there are many heretics here, especially those who
   come from the region of the Galatians--all of their number who are
   desirous of coming to the Orthodox faith, we receive as Gentiles.  And
   on the first day we make them Christians, on the second Catechumens,
   then on the third day we exorcise them, at the same time also breathing
   thrice upon their faces and ears; and thus we initiate them, and we
   make them spend time in church and hear the Scriptures; and then we
   baptize them.

   And the Manichæans, and Valentinians and Marcionites and all of similar
   heresies must give certificates and anathematize each his own heresy,
   and also Nestorius, Eutyches, Dioscorus, Severus, and the other chiefs
   of such heresies, and those who think with them, and all the aforesaid
   heresies; and so they become partakers of the holy Communion.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCV.

   Thus we admit those converted from the heretics.  We anoint with the
   holy chrism, upon the brow, eyes, nostrils, mouth, and ears, Arians,
   Macedonians, Novatians (who are called Cathari), Aristerians (who are
   called Quartadecimans or Tetraditæ), and Apollinarians when they
   anathematize every heresy; and sign them with the cross as we say, "The
   Seal of the gift of the Holy Ghost.  Amen."

   Compare with this Canon vij. of Laodicea, and the so-called vij^th.
   canon of the First Council of Constantinople.

   The text I have translated is that ordinarily given, I now present to
   the reader Hefele's argument for its worthlessness.

   Hefele.

   This text is undoubtedly false, for (a) the baptism of the Gnostics
   was, according to the recognized ecclesiastical principle, invalid, and
   a Gnostic coming into the Church was required to be baptized anew; (b)
   besides, it would have us first to require of a Gnostic an anathema on
   Nestorius, Eutyches, etc.  More accurate, therefore, is the text, as it
   is given by Beveridge, and as Balsamon had it, to the effect that:  "In
   the same way (as the preceding) are the Manichæans, Valentinians,
   Marcionites, and similar heretics to be treated (i.e., to be baptized
   anew); but the Nestorians must (merely) present certificates, and
   anathematize their heresy, Nestorius, Eutyches, etc."  Here we have
   only this mistake, that the Nestorians must anathematize, among others,
   also Eutyches, which they would certainly have done very willingly.  At
   the best, we must suppose that there is a gap in the text, and that
   after, "all of similar heresies," we must add "the later heretics must
   present certificates and anathematize Nestorius, Eutyches, etc."

   There seems but little doubt that whatever may be the truth in the
   matter, the early theologians and fathers held that even though the
   external rite of Holy Baptism might be validly performed by schismatics
   and heretics, yet that by it the person so baptized did not receive the
   Holy Ghost, and this opinion was not confined to the East, but was also
   prevalent in the West.  Vide Rupertus, De Divinis Officiis, Lib. X.,
   Cap. xxv.

   Canon XCVI.

   Those who by baptism have put on Christ have professed that they will
   copy his manner of life which he led in the flesh.  Those therefore who
   adorn and arrange their hair to the detriment of those who see them,
   that is by cunningly devised intertwinings, and by this means put a
   bait in the way of unstable souls, we take in hand to cure paternally
   with a suitable punishment:  training them and teaching them to live
   soberly, in order that having laid aside the deceit and vanity of
   material things, they may give their minds continually to a life which
   is blessed and free from mischief, and have their conversation in fear,
   pure, [and holy [386] ]; and thus come as near as possible to God
   through their purity of life; and adorn the inner man rather than the
   outer, and that with virtues, and good and blameless manners, so that
   they leave in themselves no remains of the left-handedness of the
   adversary.  But if any shall act contrary to the present canon let him
   be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVI.

   Whoever twist up their hair into artistic plaits for the destruction of
   the beholders are to be cut off.

   For the intricate manner of dressing the hair used in the East, and for
   a description of the golden dye, see the scholion of Zonaras.  Van
   Espen remarks that the curious care for somebody else's hair in the
   form of wigs, so prevalent with many laymen and ecclesiastics of his
   day, is the same vice condemned by the canon in another shape. [387]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [386] These words only in the Latin.

   [387] It is curious to note that so great was the care of the clergy
   for their wigs that the very shape of the vestments was changed so as
   not to disturb them, and the surplices were slit all the way down the
   front, as they continue in some places even down to our own days, after
   the original cause had long passed away.

   Canon XCVII.

   Those who have commerce with a wife or in any other manner without
   regard thereto make sacred places common, and treat them with contempt
   and thus remain in them, we order all such to be expelled, even from
   the dwellings of the catechumens which are in the venerable temples.
   And if any one shall not observe these directions, if he be a cleric
   let him be deposed, but if a layman let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVII.

   Whoever in a temple has commerce with his wife and remains there out of
   contempt, shall be expelled even from the Catechumens.  If any one
   shall not observe this he shall be deposed or cut off.

   Zonaras.

   In the name of holy places, not the church itself but the adjoining and
   dependent buildings are intended such as those which are called the
   "Catechumena."  For no one would be audacious enough to wish to cohabit
   with his wife in the very temple itself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XCVIII.

   He who brings to the intercourse of marriage a woman who is betrothed
   to another man who is still alive, is to lie under the charge of
   adultery.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVIII.

   He is an adulterer who takes one espoused to some one else.

   Aristenus's commentary on this canon is Saphes.  A more extraordinary
   estimate of it could hardly be made.  So far from the meaning being
   "perspicuous," as the Latin translation has it, the meaning seems to be
   past finding out; for, as Van Espen remarks, a man who sins with a
   betrothed woman is certainly not an "adulterer."  He tries therefore to
   introduce the idea that though he is not an adulterer, yet he is to be
   punished as if he were.  But the Greek hardly seems patient of this
   meaning, and the Ancient Epitome says in so many words that he is an
   adulterer.

   On account of this difficulty some have supposed that the espousals
   here mentioned were not de futuro but de proesenti, and that therefore
   it was the case of stealing a real wife of another man.  But this
   explanation also is involved in many difficulties.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XCIX.

   We have further learned that, in the regions of the Armenians, certain
   persons boil joints of meat within the sanctuary and offer portions to
   the priests, distributing it after the Jewish fashion.  Wherefore, that
   we may keep the church undefiled, we decree that it is not lawful for
   any priest to seize the separate portions of flesh meat from those who
   offer them, but they are to be content with what he that offers pleases
   to give them; and further we decree that such offering be made outside
   the church.  And if any one does not thus, let him be cut off.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCIX.

   There are some who like the Jews cook meat in the holy places.  Whoever
   permits this, or receives aught from them, is not fit to be priest.
   But if any one should of his own free choice offer it, then he might
   receive as much as the offerer chose to give him, provided the offer
   were made outside the church.

   A similar Judaizing superstitious custom was also found in the West, of
   which Walafrid Strabo gives an account in the IX. Century (De Rebus
   Ecclesiasticis, cap. xviii.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon C.

   "Let thine eyes behold the thing which is right," orders Wisdom, "and
   keep thine heart with all care."  For the bodily senses easily bring
   their own impressions into the soul.  Therefore we order that
   henceforth there shall in no way be made pictures, whether they are in
   paintings or in what way so ever, which attract the eye and corrupt the
   mind, and incite it to the enkindling of base pleasures.  And if any
   one shall attempt to do this he is to be cut off.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon C.

   Pictures which induce impurity are not to be painted.  Whoso shall
   transgress shall be cut off.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CI.

   The great and divine Apostle Paul with loud voice calls man created in
   the image of God, the body and temple of Christ.  Excelling, therefore,
   every sensible creature, he who by the saving Passion has attained to
   the celestial dignity, eating and drinking Christ, is fitted in all
   respects for eternal life, sanctifying his soul and body by the
   participation of divine grace.  Wherefore, if any one wishes to be a
   participator of the immaculate Body in the time of the Synaxis, and to
   offer himself for the communion, let him draw near, arranging his hands
   in the form of a cross, and so let him receive the communion of grace.
   But such as, instead of their hands, make vessels of gold or other
   materials for the reception of the divine gift, and by these receive
   the immaculate communion, we by no means allow to come, as preferring
   inanimate and inferior matter to the image of God.  But if any one
   shall be found imparting the immaculate Communion to those who bring
   vessels of this kind, let him be cut off as well as the one who brings
   them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CI.

   Whoever comes to receive the Eucharist holds his hands in the form of a
   cross, and takes it with his mouth; whoever shall prepare a receptacle
   of gold or of any other material instead of his hand, shall be cut off.

   Balsamon.

   At first, perchance, this was invented from pious feelings, because the
   hand which came in contact with base and unworthy things was not worthy
   to receive the Lord's body, but, as time went on, piety was turned to
   the injury of the soul, so that those who did this when they came to
   receive with an arrogant and insolent bearing, were preferred to the
   poor.

   St. Cyril of Jerusalem.

   (Cateches. Mystagog. v. [388] )

   When thou goest to receive communion go not with thy wrists extended,
   nor with thy fingers separated, but placing thy left hand as a throne
   for thy right, which is to receive so great a King, and in the hollow
   of the palm receive the body of Christ, saying, Amen.

   Vide also St. John Damascene, De Fide Orthodoxa, lib. iv., cap. xiv.

   xvij., n. 3.

   Canon CII.

   It behoves those who have received from God the power to loose and
   bind, to consider the quality of the sin and the readiness of the
   sinner for conversion, and to apply medicine suitable for the disease,
   lest if he is injudicious in each of these respects he should fail in
   regard to the healing of the sick man.  For the disease of sin is not
   simple, but various and multiform, and it germinates many mischievous
   offshoots, from which much evil is diffused, and it proceeds further
   until it is checked by the power of the physician.  Wherefore he who
   professes the science of spiritual medicine ought first of all to
   consider the disposition of him who has sinned, and to see whether he
   tends to health or (on the contrary) provokes to himself disease by his
   own behaviour, and to look how he can care for his manner of life
   during the interval.  And if he does not resist the physician, and if
   the ulcer of the soul is increased by the application of the imposed
   medicaments, then let him mete out mercy to him according as he is
   worthy of it.  For the whole account is between God and him to whom the
   pastoral rule has been delivered, to lead back the wandering sheep and
   to cure that which is wounded by the serpent; and that he may neither
   cast them down into the precipices of despair, nor loosen the bridle
   towards dissolution or contempt of life; but in some way or other,
   either by means of sternness and astringency, or by greater softness
   and mild medicines, to resist this sickness and exert himself for the
   healing of the ulcer, now examining the fruits of his repentance and
   wisely managing the man who is called to higher illumination.  For we
   ought to know two things, to wit, the things which belong to strictness
   and those which belong to custom, and to follow the traditional form in
   the case of those who are not fitted for the highest things, as holy
   Basil teaches us.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CII.

   The character of a sin must be considered from all points and
   conversion expected.  And so let mercy be meted out.

   Introduction on the Date of the Council.

   (Hefele, Hist. Councils, Vol. II., pp. 86 et seqq.)

   Our inquiries concerning the Synod of Sardica must begin with a
   chronological examination of the date of this assembly.  Socrates and
   Sozomen place it expressly in the year 347 a.d., with the more precise
   statement that it was held under the Consuls Rufinus and Eusebius in
   the eleventh year after the death of Constantine the Great, therefore
   after the 22d of May, 347, according to our way of reckoning.

   This was the most general view until, rather more than a hundred years
   ago, the learned Scipio Maffei discovered at Verona, the fragment of a
   Latin translation of an old Alexandrian chronicle (the Historia
   Acephala), and edited it in the third volume of the Osservazioni
   Litterarii in 1738.  This fragment contains the information that on the
   24th Phaophi (October 21), under the Consuls Constantius IV. and
   Constans II., in the year 346, Athanasius had returned to Alexandria
   from his second exile.  As it is universally allowed, however, as we
   shall presently show more clearly, that this return certainly only took
   place about two years after the Synod of Sardica, Mansi hence saw the
   necessity of dating this synod as early as the year 344.  In this he is
   confirmed by St. Jerome, in the continuation of the Eusebian chronicle,
   who, in accordance with the Historia Acephala, has assigned the return
   of St. Athanasius to the tenth year of the reign of the Emperor
   Constantius, in 346.

   Many learned men now followed Mansi, the greater number blindly;
   others, again, sought to contradict him, at first the learned
   Dominican, Mamachi; then Dr. Wetzer (Professor at Freiburg); and
   latterly, we ourselves in a treatise, "Controversen über die Synode von
   Sardika," in the Tübinger Theol. Quartalschrift, 1852.  Soon after
   there was a fresh discovery.  Some of the Paschal Letters of St.
   Athanasius, which until then were supposed to be lost, were discovered
   in an Egyptian monastery, with a very ancient preface translated into
   Syriac, and were published in that language by Cureton in London, and
   in the year 1852 in German by Professor Larsow, at the Grey Friars
   Convent, in Berlin.

   Among these Festal Letters, the nineteenth, intended for Easter 347,
   and therefore composed in the beginning of that year, had been
   rewritten in Alexandria, as the introduction expressly states.  This
   confirms the statement of the Historia Acephala, that Athanasius was
   already returned to Alexandria in October, 346, and confirms the chief
   points of Mansi's hypothesis; while, on the other hand, it unanswerably
   refutes, by Athanasius' own testimony, the statements of Socrates and
   Sozomen (which, from their dependence on each other, only count as
   one), with reference to the date 347.

   As we said, Mansi placed this Synod in the year 344; but the old
   preface to the Festal Letters of St. Athanasius dates it in the year
   343, and in fact we can now only hesitate between the dates 343 and
   344.  If the preface were as ancient and as powerfully convincing as
   the Festal Letters themselves, then the question concerning the date of
   the Council of Sardica would be most accurately decided.  As, however,
   this preface contains mistakes in several places, especially
   chronological errors--for instance, regarding the death of Constantine
   the Great--we cannot unconditionally accept its statement as to the
   date 344, but can only do so when it corresponds with other dates
   concerning that time.

   Let us, at all events, assume that Athanasius came to Rome about
   Easter, 340.  As is known, he was there for three whole years, and in
   the beginning of the fourth year was summoned to the Emperor Constans
   at Milan.  This points to the summer of 343.  From thence he went
   through Gaul to Sardica, and thus it is quite possible that that Synod
   might have begun in the autumn of 343.  It probably lasted, however,
   until the spring; for when the two envoys, Euphrates of Cologne, and
   Vincent of Capua, who were sent by the Synod to the Emperor Constans,
   arrived in Antioch, it was already Easter 344.  Stephen, the bishop of
   the latter city, treated them in a truly diabolical manner; but his
   wickedness soon became notorious, and a synod was established, which
   deposed him after Easter 344.  Its members were Eusebians, who
   therefore appointed Leontius Castratus as Stephen's successor, and it
   is indeed no other than this assembly which Athanasius has in mind,
   when he says it took place three years after the Synod in Encæniis, and
   drew up a very explicit Eusebian confession of faith, the makrostichos.

   The disgraceful behaviour of Bishop Stephen of Antioch for some time
   inclined the Emperor to place less confidence in the Arian party, and
   to allow Athanasius's exiled clergy to return home in the summer of
   344.  Ten months later, the pseudo-bishop, Gregory of Alexandria, died
   (in June, 345), and Constantius did not permit any fresh appointment to
   the see of Alexandria, but recalled St. Athanasius by three letters,
   and waited for him more than a year.  Thus the see of Alexandria
   remained unoccupied for more than a year, until the last six months of
   346.  At length, in October, 346, Athanasius returned to his bishopric.

   We see then that by accepting the distinct statements of the Paschal
   Letters of St. Athanasius and the preface, we obtain a satisfactory
   chronological system in which the separate details cohere well
   together, and which thus recommends itself.  One great objection which
   we formerly raised ourselves against the date 344 can now be solved.
   It is certainly true that in 353 or 354 Pope Librius wrote thus:
   "Eight years ago the Eusebian deputies, Eudoxius and Martyrius (who
   came to the West with the formula makrostikos), refused to anathematize
   the Arian doctrine at Milan."  But the Synod of Milan here alluded to,
   and placed about the year 345, was not, as we before erroneously
   supposed, held before the Synod of Sardica, but after it.  We are
   somewhat less fortunate as regards another difficulty.  The Eusebians
   assembled at Philippopolis (the pseudo-synod of Sardica) say, in their
   synodal letter:  "Bishop Asclepas of Gaza was deposed from his
   bishopric seventeen years ago."  This deposition occurred at an
   Antiochian synod.  If we identified this synod with the well-known one
   of 330, by which Eustathius of Antioch also was overthrown, we should,
   reckoning the seventeen years, have the year 346 or 347, in which to
   place the writing of the Synodal Letter of Philippopolis, and therefore
   the Synod of Sardica.  There are, however, two ways of avoiding this
   conclusion, either we must suppose that Asclepas has been already
   deposed a year or so before the Antiochian Synod of 330; or that the
   statement as to the number seventeen in the Latin translation of the
   Synodal Letter of Philippopolis (for we no longer possess the original
   text) is an error or slip of the pen.  But in no case can this Synodal
   Letter alter the fact that Athanasius was again in Alexandria when he
   composed his Paschal Letter for the year 347, and that the Synod of
   Sardica must therefore have been held several years before.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Note on the Text of the Canons.

   The Canons of Sardica have come down to us both in Greek and Latin, and
   some writers such as Richer (Histoire Conc. Générale, Tom. i., p. 98),
   have been of opinion that the Latin text alone was the original, while
   others, such as Walch (Gesch. der Kirchenvers., p. 179), have arrived
   at a directly opposite conclusion.  Now, however, chiefly owing to the
   investigations of the Ballerini and of Spittler, the unanimous opinion
   of scholars--so says Hefele--is that the canons were originally drawn
   up in both languages, intended as they were for both Latins and
   Greeks.  I may perhaps remind the reader that in many Western
   collections of canons the canons of Sardica immediately follow those of
   Nice without any break, or note that they were not enacted at that
   council.  It will also be well to bear in mind that they were received
   by the Greeks as of Ecumenical authority by the Council in Trullo, and
   as such are contained in the body of the Greek Canon Law.

   I have provided the reader with a very accurate translation of each
   text.

   The Canons of the Council of Sardica.

   The holy synod assembled in Sardica from various provinces decreed as
   follows.

   (Found in Greek in John of Constantinople's collection of the sixth
   century and several other mss.  Found also in the works of the Greek
   scholiasts.  Found in Latin in the Prisca, in Dionysius Exiguus, and in
   Isidore, genuine and false.)

   Canon I.

   (Greek.)

   Hosius, bishop of the city of Corduba, said:  A prevalent evil, or
   rather most mischievous corruption must be done away with from its very
   foundations.  Let no bishop be allowed to remove from a small city to a
   different one:  as there is an obvious reason for this fault,
   accounting for such attempts; since no bishop could ever yet be found
   who endeavoured to be translated from a larger city to a smaller one.
   It is therefore evident that such persons are inflamed with excessive
   covetousness and are only serving ambition in order to have the repute
   of possessing greater authority.  Is it then the pleasure of all that
   so grave an abuse be punished with great severity?  For I think that
   men of this sort should not be admitted even to lay communion.  All the
   bishops said:  It is the pleasure of all.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  A prevalent evil and mischievous corruption must
   be done away with from its foundation.  Let no bishop be allowed to
   remove from his own city to another.  For the reason of such attempts
   is manifest, since in this matter no bishop has been found who would
   remove from a larger city to a smaller one.  It is therefore evident
   that these men are inflamed with excess of covetousness, and are
   serving ambition and aiming at the possession of power.  If it be the
   pleasure of all, let so great an evil be punished right harshly and
   sternly, so that he who is such shall not even be admitted to lay
   communion.  All with one accord answered:  Such is our pleasure.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   No bishop is to be found passing from a smaller to a greater city.  If
   anyone should move from an humble to a more important see, he shall be
   excommunicated through his whole life as proud and grasping.

   Van Espen.

   (Dissert. in Synod. Sard., § II. [389] )

   What Peter de Marca says (De Concordia Sacerdotii et Imp., Lib. V.,
   cap. iv.), "Hosius presided over" this council as legate of the Roman
   bishop, rests upon no solid foundation, and no trace of any such
   legation is found in Athanasius or in any of the other writers who
   treated of this synod.  Moreover such a thing is contrary to the form
   of subscription used.  For of those who signed the first is Hosius, and
   Athanasius designates him simply as "from Spain," without any addition;
   and then next he mentions "Julius of Rome, by Archidamus and
   Philoxenus, his presbyters," etc.  What is clearer than that, by the
   testimony of Athanasius, Julius was present by these two presbyters
   only, and that they only were his legates or vicars, who in his room
   were present at this synod?

   The first part of this canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici;
   Raymund's Decretales, De Clericis non residentibus, Cap. ii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [389] The whole of this Dissertation is worthy of careful study.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon II.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  But if any such person should be found so mad or
   audacious as to think to advance by way of excuse an affirmation that
   he had brought letters from the people [laity], it is plain that some
   few persons, corrupted by bribes and rewards, could have got up an
   uproar in the church, demanding, forsooth, the said man for bishop.  I
   think then that practices and devices of such sort absolutely must be
   punished, so that a man of this kind be deemed unworthy even of lay
   communion in extremis.  Do ye therefore make answer whether this
   sentence is approved by you.  They [the bishops] answered:  What has
   been said is approved of.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  Even if any such person should show himself so
   rash as perhaps to allege as an excuse and affirm that he has received
   letters from the people, inasmuch as it is evident that a few persons
   could have been corrupted by rewards and bribes--[namely] persons who
   do not hold the pure faith--to raise an uproar in the church, and seem
   to ask for the said man as bishop; I judge that these frauds must be
   condemned, so that such an one should not receive even lay communion at
   the last.  If ye all approve, do ye decree it.  The synod answered:  We
   approve.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   If anyone shall pass from one city to another, and shall raise up
   seditions, tickling the people and be assisted by them in raising a
   disturbance, he shall not be allowed communion even when dying.

   Van Espen.

   To understand this canon aright it must be remembered that in the first
   ages of the Church the people were accustomed to have a share in the
   election of their bishop; and he whom the people demanded was usually
   ordained their bishop.

   Aristenus.

   This [penalty] is something unheard of and horrible, that he should not
   be deemed worthy of communion even at the hour of death; for it is a
   provision found nowhere else imposed by any canon, nor inflicted upon
   any sin.

   Van Espen.

   The Greek author Aristenus [in the above remarks] probably has not
   erred from the truth when he asserts that to no crime was this penalty
   attached, if he refers to the Eastern Churches; for Morinus himself (in
   the xix^th chapter of the ix^th book, De Penitentia), confesses that
   this penalty was never attached to any crime among the Easterns:
   nevertheless in some Churches in the first ages the three crimes of
   idolatry, murder, and adultery were thus punished:  that is, that to
   those who admitted any one of these, reconciliation was denied even at
   his death, "and this," says Morinus, "I think no one can deny, who is
   at all versed in the testimony of the ancients on this point."

   Hefele.

   The addition in the Latin text, qui sinceram fidem non habent, is found
   both in Dionysius Exiguus and in Isidore and the Prisca, and its
   meaning is as follows:  "In a town, some few, especially those who have
   not the true faith, can be easily bribed to demand this or that person
   as bishop."  The Fathers of Sardica plainly had here in view the Arians
   and their adherents, who, through such like machinations, when they had
   gained over, if only a small party in a town, sought to press into the
   bishoprics.  The Synod of Antioch moreover, in 341, although the
   Eusebians, properly speaking, were dominant there, had laid down in the
   twenty-first canon a similar, only less severe, rule.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Raymond's Decretales,
   cap. ii, De electione, but with the noteworthy addition "unless he
   shall have repented."  These words do not occur in the other Latin
   versions, and Hefele thinks them to have been added by Raymond of
   Pennaforte.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon III.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also it is necessary to add,--that no bishop
   pass from his own province to another province in which there are
   bishops, unless indeed he be called by his brethren, that we seem not
   to close the gates of charity.

   And this case likewise is to be provided for, that if in any province a
   bishop has some matter against his brother and fellow-bishop, neither
   of the two should call in as arbiters bishops from another province.

   But if perchance sentence be given against a bishop in any matter and
   he supposes his case to be not unsound but good, in order that the
   question may be reopened, let us, if it seem good to your charity,
   honour the memory of Peter the Apostle, and let those who gave judgment
   write to Julius, the bishop of Rome, so that, if necessary, the case
   may be retried by the bishops of the neighbouring provinces and let him
   appoint arbiters; but if it cannot be shown that his case is of such a
   sort as to need a new trial, let the judgment once given not be
   annulled, but stand good as before.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also it is necessary to add,--that bishops
   shall not pass from their own province to another province in which
   there are bishops, unless perchance upon invitation from their
   brethren, that we seem not to close the door of charity.

   But if in any province a bishop have a matter in dispute against his
   brother bishop, one of the two shall not call in as judge a bishop from
   another province.

   But if judgment have gone against a bishop in any cause, and he think
   that he has a good case, in order that the question may be reopened,
   let us, if it be your pleasure, honour the memory of St. Peter the
   Apostle, and let those who tried the case write to Julius, the bishop
   of Rome, and if he shall judge that the case should be retried, let
   that be done, and let him appoint judges; but if he shall find that the
   case is of such a sort that the former decision need not be disturbed,
   what he has decreed shall be confirmed.  Is this the pleasure of all?
   The synod answered, It is our pleasure.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon

   No bishop, unless called thereto, shall pass to another city.  Moreover
   a bishop of the province who is engaged in any litigation shall not
   appeal to outside bishops.  But if Rome hears the cause, even outsiders
   may be present.

   Van Espen.

   According to the reading of Dionysius and Isidore, as well as of the
   Greeks, Balsamon, Zonaras and Aristenus, as also of Hervetus the
   provision is that bishops of one province shall not pass to another in
   which there are not bishops.

   Zonaras.

   Not only are bishops prohibited from changing their cities, and passing
   from a smaller to a larger one, but also from passing from one province
   to another in which there are bishops, for the sake of doing any
   ecclesiastical work there unless they are called by the bishops of that
   province.

   On the phrase "if it pleases you" the following from St. Athanasius is
   much to the point (cit. by Pusey, Councils, p. 143).  "They [i.e., the
   Council of Nice] wrote concerning Easter, It seemed good' as follows:
   for it did then seem good, that there should be a general compliance;
   but about the faith they wrote not It seemed good,' but Thus believes
   the Catholic Church'; and thereupon they confessed how the faith lay,
   in order to shew that their sentiments were not novel, but apostolic."

   Tillemont.

   This form is very strong to shew that it was a right which the Pope had
   not had hitherto.

   Van Espen.

   Peter de Marca (De Concordia Sacerdotii et Imperii, Lib. VII., Cap.
   iij., § 8) says that Hosius here proposed to the fathers to honour the
   memory of St. Peter that he might the more easily lead them to consent
   to this new privilege; for, as De Marca has proved, the right here
   bestowed upon the Roman Pontiff was clearly unknown before.

   It has been urged that the mention of the pope by name, intimates
   clearly that the provision of these canons of an appeal to Rome was of
   a purely temporary character; and some famous authors such as Edmund
   Richer, of the Sorbonne, have written in defence of this view, but
   Hefele quotes with great force the words of the learned Protestant,
   Spittler (Critical Examination of the Sardican Decisions, Spittler,
   Sämmtlichen Werken, P. viij., p. 129 sq.).

   Spittler.

   It is said that these Sardican decisions were simply provisional, and
   intended for the present necessity; because Athanasius, so hardly
   pressed by the Arians, could only be rescued by authorizing an appeal
   to the Bishop of Rome for a final judgment.  Richer, in his History of
   the General Councils, has elaborately defended this opinion, and Horix
   also has declared in its favour.  But would not all secure use of the
   canons of the councils be done away with if this distinction between
   provisional and permanent synodal decisions were admitted?  Is there
   any sure criterion for distinguishing those canons which were only to
   be provisional, from the others which were made for all future
   centuries?  The Fathers of the Synod of Sardica express themselves
   quite generally; is it not therefore most arbitrary on our part to
   insert limitations?  It is beyond question that these decisions were
   occasioned by the very critical state of the affairs of Athanasius; but
   is everything only provisional that is occasioned by the circumstances
   of individuals?  In this way the most important of the ancient canons
   might be set aside.

   Hefele.

   According to the Greek text, and that of Dionysius, those who had
   pronounced the first judgment were to write to Rome; and Fuchs rightly
   adds, that they were to do this at the desire of the condemned.  But,
   according to Isidore and the Prisca, the right or the duty of bringing
   the affair before Rome, also belonged to the neighbouring bishops.  I
   believe that the last interpretation has only arisen through a mistake,
   from a comment belonging to the next sentence being inserted in the
   wrong place.  It only remains to be remarked here, that Isidore and the
   Prisca have not the name Julio,...But Hardouin's conjecture, that
   instead of Julio, perhaps illi may be read, is entirely gratuitous,
   contrary to the Greek text, and plainly only a stratagem against the
   Gallicans.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars II., Causa VI., Quæst. iv., Canon j. 7, in Isidore's version.
   Dionysius's version is quite wrong as given by Justellus and in the
   Munich edition, changing the negative into the affirmative in the
   phrase ne unus de duobus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IV.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Gaudentius said:  If it seems good to you, it is necessary to
   add to this decision full of sincere charity which thou hast
   pronounced, that [390] if any bishop be deposed by the sentence of
   these neighbouring bishops, and assert that he has fresh matter in
   defence, a new bishop be not settled in his see, unless the bishop of
   Rome judge and render a decision as to this.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Gaudentius said:  It ought to be added, if it be your pleasure,
   to this sentence full of sanctity which thou hast pronounced,
   that--when any bishop has been deposed by the judgment of those bishops
   who have sees in neighbouring places, and he [the bishop deposed] shall
   announce that his case is to be examined in the city of Rome--that no
   other bishop shall in any wise be ordained to his see, after the appeal
   of him who is apparently deposed, unless the case shall have been
   determined in the judgment of the Roman bishop.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   If a bishop has been deposed and affirms that he has an excuse to urge,
   unless Rome has judged the case, no bishop shall be appointed in his
   room.  For he might treat the decree with scorn either through his
   nuncios or by his letters.

   There are two distinct understandings of this canon.  The one view is
   that the "neighbours" of this canon are the same as the "neighbours" of
   the preceding canon (number iij.) and that the meaning of this canon
   therefore is--If the court of second instance, correlating of the
   bishops of the neighbouring province, has pronounced the accused
   guilty, he still has one more appeal to a third court, viz., Rome.
   This is the view taken by the Greeks, Zonaras and Balsamon, by the
   Ballerini, Van Espen, Palma, Walter, Natalis Alexander and many others.

   In direct opposition to this is the view that there is no third but
   only a second appeal mentioned by the canon.  The supporters of this
   interpretation are Peter de Marca, Tillemont, Dupin, Fleury, Remi
   Ceillier, Neander, Stolberg, Echhorn, Kober, and with these Hefele
   sides and states his reasons for doing so.

   Hefele.

   There must be added to the reasons of the connexion of this canon with
   the preceding, the course of events, etc.:

   1.  That it certainly would be very curious if in the third canon
   mention was made of the appeal to Rome as following the judgment of the
   court of first instance; in the fourth, after that of the court of
   second instance; and again in the fifth, after the judgment of the
   court of first instance.

   2.  That if the Synod had really intended to institute a court of third
   instance, it would have done so in clearer and more express terms, and
   not only have, as it were, smuggled in the whole point with the
   secondary question, as to "what was to be done with the bishop's see."

   3.  Farther, that it is quite devoid of proof that the expression
   "neighbouring bishops" is identical with "Bishops in the neighbourhood
   of the said Province," that, indeed this identification is throughout
   unwarrantable and wrong, and it is far more natural to understand by
   the neighbouring bishops, the comprovincials, therefore the court of
   first instance.

   4.  That by this interpretation we obtain clearness, consistency, and
   harmony in all three canons.

   5.  That the word palin in the fourth canon presents no difficulty; for
   even one who has only been heard in the court of first instance may say
   he desires again to defend himself, because he has already made his
   first defence in the court of first instance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [390] At this point begins the Greek text as given in Bev.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  Decreed, that if any bishop is accused, and the
   bishops of the same region assemble and depose him from his office, and
   he appealing, so to speak, takes refuge with the most blessed bishop of
   the Roman church, and he be willing to give him a hearing, and think it
   right to renew the examination of his case, let him be pleased to write
   to those fellow-bishops who are nearest the province that they may
   examine the particulars with care and accuracy and give their votes on
   the matter in accordance with the word of truth.  And if any one
   require that his case be heard yet again, and at his request it seem
   good to move the bishop of Rome to send presbyters a latere, let it be
   in the power of that bishop, according as he judges it to be good and
   decides it to be right--that some be sent to be judges with the bishops
   and invested with his authority by whom they were sent.  And be this
   also ordained.  But if he think that the bishops are sufficient for the
   examination and decision of the matter let him do what shall seem good
   in his most prudent judgment.

   The bishops answered:  What has been said is approved.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  Further decreed, that if a bishop is accused, and
   the bishops of that region assemble and depose him from his office, if
   he who has been deposed shall appeal and take refuge with the bishop of
   the Roman church and wishes to be given a hearing, if he think it right
   that the trial or examination of his case be renewed, let him be
   pleased to write to those bishops who are in an adjacent and
   neighbouring province, that they may diligently inquire into all the
   particulars and decide according to the word of truth.  But if he who
   asks to have his case reheard, shall by his entreaty move the Bishop of
   Rome to send a presbyter a latere it shall be in the power of that
   bishop to do what he shall resolve and determine upon; and if he shall
   decide that some be sent, who shall be present and be judges with the
   bishops invested with his authority by whom they were appointed, it
   shall be as he shall choose.  But if he believe that the bishops
   suffice to give a final decision, he shall do what he shall determine
   upon in his most wise judgment.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   [Lacking.]

   This Canon is vij. of Isidore's collection.

   Van Espen.

   Mere there is properly speaking no provision for "appeal," which
   entirely suspends [i.e. by the canon law] the execution and effect of
   the first sentence; but rather for a revision of judgment....; those
   who were sent by the Roman bishop from his side (a latere) or the
   bishops who were appointed, ought, together with the bishops of the
   province who had given the former sentence, to give a fresh judgment
   and declare their sentence.  And this Hincmar of Rheims was the first
   to notice in his letters in the name of Charles the Bald sent to John
   VIII.

   This view is supported with his accustomed learning and acumen by Du
   Pin, De Antiqua Eccl. Disciplina, Diss. II., Cap. I., Sec. 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  If it happen that in a province in which there are
   very many bishops one bishop should stay away and by some negligence
   should not come to the council and assent to the appointment made by
   the bishops, but the people assemble and pray that the ordination of
   the bishop desired by them take place--it is necessary that the bishop
   who stayed away should first be reminded by letters from the exarch of
   the province (I mean, of course, the bishop of the metropolis), that
   the people demand a pastor to be given them.  I think that it is well
   to await his [the absent bishop's] arrival also.  But if after summons
   by letter he does not come, nor even write in reply, the wish of the
   people ought to be complied with.

   The bishops from the neighbouring provinces also should be invited to
   the ordination of the bishop of the metropolis.

   It is positively not permitted to ordain a bishop in a village or petty
   town, for which even one single presbyter is sufficient (for there is
   no necessity to ordain a bishop there) lest the name and authority of
   bishop should be made of small account, but the bishops of the province
   ought, as before said, to ordain bishops in those cities in which there
   were bishops previously; and if a city should be found with a
   population so large as to be thought worthy of an episcopal see, let it
   receive one.

   Is this the pleasure of all?  All answered:  It is our pleasure.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  If it shall have happened, that in a province in
   which there have been very many bishops, one [i.e., but one] bishop
   remains, but that he by negligence has not chosen [to ordain] a bishop,
   and the people have made application, the bishops of the neighbouring
   province ought first to address [by letter] the bishop who resides in
   that province, and show that the people seek a ruler [i.e., pastor] for
   themselves and that this is right, so that they also may come and with
   him ordain a bishop.  But if he refuses to acknowledge their written
   communication, and leaves it unnoticed, and writes no reply, the
   people's request should be satisfied, so that bishops should come from
   the neighbouring province and ordain a bishop.

   But permission is not to be given to ordain a bishop either in any
   village, or in an unimportant city, for which one presbyter suffices,
   lest the name and authority of bishop grow cheap.  Those [bishops] who
   are invited from another province ought not to ordain a bishop unless
   in the cities which have [previously] had bishops, or in a city which
   is so important or so populous as to be entitled to have a bishop.

   Is this the pleasure of all?  The synod replied:  It is our pleasure.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   If the bishops were present when the people were seeking for a bishop,
   and one was away, let that one be called.  But if he is willing to
   answer the call neither by letter nor in person, let him be ordained
   whom they desire.

   When a Metropolitan is appointed the neighbouring bishops are to be
   sent for.

   In a little city and town, for which one presbyter suffices, a bishop
   is not to be appointed.  But if the city be very populous, it is not
   unfitting to do so.

   The second portion of this canon is entirely lacking in the Latin.  The
   Greek scholiasts, Zonaras, Balsamon, and Aristenus, understand this to
   mean "that at the appointment of a metropolitan the bishops of the
   neighbouring provinces shall also be invited,' probably to give greater
   solemnity to the act," so says Hefele.  And to this agree Van Espen,
   Tillemont, and Herbst.

   The first part in the Greek and Latin have different meanings; the
   Greek text contemplating the case of one bishop stopping away from a
   meeting of bishops for an election to fill a vacancy; the Latin text
   the case of there being only one bishop left in a province (after war,
   pestilence, or the like).  This second meaning is accepted by Van
   Espen, Christian Lupus and others.  Moreover, it would seem from
   Flodoard's History of the Church of Rheims (Geschichte der Rheimser
   Kirche, Lib. III., c. 20 [a book I have never seen]) that the Gallican
   Church acted upon this understanding of this canon.  It is that also of
   Gratian.

   Between the Latin and the Greek text stands the interpretation of
   Zonaras, which is that if a province once having many bishops has by
   any contingency only one left besides the Metropolitan, and he neglects
   to be present at the consecration of the new bishops, he is to be
   summoned by letter of the Metropolitan, and if he does not then come,
   the consecrations are to go on without him.  With this explanation
   Harmenopulus also agrees, adding further that the Metropolitan might
   alone consecrate the bishops, resting his argument on the words to
   hikauon k.t l.

   Some scholars have supposed that neither the present Greek nor the
   present Latin text represent the original, but that the Greek text is
   nearest to it, but must be corrected by an ancient Latin version found
   by Maffei in a codex at Verona.  The Ballerini have devoted careful
   attention to this point in their notes to the Works of St. Leo the
   Great (Tom. iii., p. xxxij. 4).  It would seem that this might be the
   canon quoted by the fathers of Constantinople in 382, and if so, it
   would seem that they had a Greek text like that from which the Verona
   version was made.

   Van Espen.

   The fathers of Sardica [in the second part of this canon, which is
   Canon VII. by the Latin computation] decreed two things:  first, that
   where the people justly asked for a Pastor to be ordained for them,
   their demand should be complied with; but where the people insisted
   upon having a bishop ordained for a village or little city, for which
   one presbyter was all that was needed, no attention should be paid to
   their demands, lest the name and authority of a bishop should become
   despicable.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   P. I., Distinc. lxv., c. ix.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VII.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  Our importunity and great pertinacity and unjust
   petitions have brought it about that we do not have as much favour and
   confidence as we ought to enjoy.  For many of the bishops do not
   intermit resorting to the imperial Court, especially the Africans, who,
   as we have learned from our beloved brother and fellow-bishop, Gratus,
   do not accept salutary counsels, but so despise them that one man
   carries to the Court petitions many and diverse and of no possible
   benefit to the Church, and does not (as ought to be done and as is
   fitting) assist and help the poor and the laity or the widows, but is
   intriguing to obtain worldly dignities and offices for certain
   persons.  This evil then causes enfeeblement [better, murmuring (read
   tonthrusmon or tonthorusmon)], not without some scandal and blame to
   us.  But I account it quite proper for a bishop to give assistance to
   one oppressed by some one, or to a widow suffering injustice, or,
   again, an orphan robbed of his estate, always provided that these
   persons have a just cause of petition.

   If, then, beloved brethren, this seems good to all, do ye decree that
   no bishop shall go to the imperial Court except those whom our most
   pious emperor may summon by his own letters.  Yet since it often
   happens that persons condemned for their offences to deportation or
   banishment to an island, or who have received some sentence or other,
   beg for mercy and seek refuge with the Church [i.e., take sanctuary],
   such persons are not to be refused assistance, but pardon should be
   asked for them without delay and without hesitation.  If this, then, is
   also your pleasure, do ye all vote assent.

   All gave answer:  Be this also decreed.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  Importunities and excessive pertinacity and unjust
   petitions have caused us to have too little favour or confidence, while
   certain bishops cease not to go to the Court, especially the Africans,
   who (as we have learned) spurn and contemn the salutary counsels of our
   most holy brother and fellow-bishop, Gratus, so that they not only
   bring to the Court many and diverse petitions (not for the good of the
   Church nor, as is usual and right, to succour the poor or widows or
   orphans), but even seek to obtain worldly dignities and offices for
   certain persons.  This evil therefore stirs up at times not only
   murmurings, but even scandals.  But it is proper that bishops should
   intercede for persons suffering from violence and oppression, afflicted
   widows and defrauded orphans, provided, nevertheless, that these
   persons have a just cause or petition.

   If, then, brethren dearly beloved, such be your pleasure, do we decree
   that no bishops go to the Court except those who may have been invited
   or summoned by letters of the God-fearing emperor.  But since it often
   happens that those who are suffering from injustice or who are
   condemned for their offences to deportation or banishment to an island,
   or, in short, have received some sentence or other, seek refuge with
   the mercy of the Church, such persons should be succoured and pardon be
   begged for them without hesitation.  Decree this, therefore, if it be
   your pleasure.

   All said:  It is our pleasure and be it decreed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   When an orphan, widow, and other desolate persons are oppressed by
   force let the bishop give them succour and approach the Emperor; but
   through a pretext of this kind let him not be a hanger on of the camp,
   but rather let him send a deacon.

   Van Espen.

   The "salutary counsels" (salutaria consilia) here seem to be synodical
   admonitions, as Zonaras notes; and these might well be ascribed to
   Gratus, the bishop of Carthage, because many of the African synods were
   held under his presidency and direction.

   *          *          *          *          *          *
   *          *          *          *

   Nothing is more noteworthy than how from the first princes summoned
   bishops in counsel with regard to affairs touching either the estate of
   the Church or of the Realm; and called them to their presence in urgent
   and momentous cases, and kept them with them.

   Justinian, the emperor, in his Novels (Chapter II.) defines that no one
   of the God-beloved bishops shall dare to be absent any more from his
   diocese for a whole year, and adds this exception, "unless he does so
   on account of an imperial jussio; in this case alone he shall be held
   to be without blame."

   On this whole matter of bishops interceding for culprits, and
   especially for those condemned to death, see St. Augustine (Epist. 153
   ad Macedonium).

   With this canon may be compared Canon VII. of the Council of Rheims in
   a.d. 630.

   This canon is found in part in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's
   Decretum, P. II., Causa xxiij., Quæst. viij., c. xxviij.

   Canon VIII.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also let your sagacity determine, that [391]
   --inasmuch as this was decreed in order that a bishop might not fall
   under censure by going to the Court--that if any have such petitions as
   we mentioned above, they should send these by one of their deacons.
   For the person of a subordinate does not excite jealousy, and what
   shall be granted [by the Emperor] can thus be reported more quickly.

   All answered:  Be this also decreed.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also your forethought should provide
   for--inasmuch as ye have made this decree in order that the audacity of
   bishops might not labour [or, be observed] to go to Court.  Whosoever
   therefore shall have or receive petitions such as we have mentioned
   above, let them send these [each] by a deacon of his, because the
   person of a minister is not an object of jealousy, and he will be able
   to report more quickly what he has obtained.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   [Lacking.]

   Van Espen.

   This decree is threefold.  First, that the bishop in going to Court
   should not fall under suspicion either at Court or of his own people
   that he was approaching the Prince to obtain some cause of his own.
   Second, according to the interpretation of Zonaras, "that no one should
   be angry with the Minister or Deacon who tarried in camp, as the bishop
   had departed thence."  And third, that the Minister could carry away
   what he had asked for, that is (according to Zonaras), the letters of
   the Emperor pardoning the fault, or such like other matters.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [391] Here the Greek text begins as given by Bev.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IX.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also, I think, follows, that, [392] if in any
   province whatever, bishops send petitions to one of their brothers and
   fellow-bishops, he that is in the largest city, that is, the
   metropolis, should himself send his deacon and the petitions, providing
   him also with letters commendatory, writing also of course in
   succession to our brethren and fellow-bishops, if any of them should be
   staying at that time in the places or cities in which the most pious
   Emperor is administering public affairs.

   But if any of the bishops should have friends at the Court and should
   wish to make requests of them as to some proper object, let him not be
   forbidden to make such requests through his deacon and move these
   [friends] to give their kind assistance as his desire.

   But those who come to Rome ought, as I said before, to deliver to our
   beloved brother and fellow-bishop, Julius, the petitions which they
   have to give, in order that he may first examine them, lest some of
   them should be improper, and so, giving them his own advocacy and care,
   shall send them to the Court.

   All the Bishops made answer that such was their pleasure and that the
   regulation was most proper.

   (Latin.)

   This also seems to follow, that from whatever province bishops shall
   send petitions to that brother and fellow-bishop of ours who has his
   see in the metropolis, he [the metropolitan] should dispatch his deacon
   with the petitions, providing him with commendatory letters of like
   tenour to our brethren and fellow-bishops at that time resident in
   those regions and cities in which the fortunate and blessed Emperor is
   ruling the State.

   If however a bishop who seeks to obtain some petition (a worthy one,
   that is) has friends in the palace, he is not forbidden to make his
   request through his deacon and to advise those who, he knows, can
   kindly intercede for him in his absence.

   X.  But let those who come to Rome, deliver, as before said, to our
   most holy brother and fellow-bishop, the bishop of the Roman church,
   the petitions which they bear, that he also may examine whether they
   are worthy and just, and let him give diligence and care that they be
   forwarded to the Court.

   All said that such was their pleasure and that the regulation was
   proper.

   Bishop Alypius said:  If they have incurred the discomforts of travel
   for the sake of orphans and widows or any in distress and having cases
   that are not unjust, they will have some good reason [for their
   journey]; but now since they chiefly make requests which cannot be
   granted without envy and reproach, it is not necessary for them to go
   to Court.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   If one brother sends to another, let the Metropolitan fortify the
   nuncio with letters; and let him write to the bishops, who have the
   matter in hand, to protect the nuncio.

   Here the Latin is not only a translation but an interpretation of the
   Greek text, for it distinctly says that every bishop shall send the
   petition he intends to present at court first to his Metropolitan, who
   shall send it in.  This is not clearly in the Greek, and yet the Greek
   Commentators find it there.

   Christian Lupus.

   The authority of the bishop alone is not sufficient to send a deacon to
   Court, there must be added the judgment of the Metropolitan who shall
   examine the petition, prove, sign, and commend it, not only to the
   Prince, but also to the bishop in whose diocese he may happen to be.

   Hefele.

   Zonaras, Balsamon, and Aristenus explained this canon somewhat
   differently, thus:  "If a bishop desires to send his petitions
   addressed to the Emperor to the bishop of the town where the Emperor is
   staying, he shall first send them to the Metropolitan of that province
   (according to Aristenus, his own Metropolitan) and the latter shall
   send his own deacon with letters of recommendation to the bishop or
   bishops who may be at court."  This difference rests upon the various
   meanings of "to the brother and fellow-bishop" in the beginning of the
   canon.  We understand by this his own Metropolitan, and treat the
   words:  ho en te meizoni k.t.l., as a more exact definition of
   "fellow-bishop," and the participle tunchanon as equivalent to
   tunchanei, and make the principal clause begin at autos kai ton
   diakonon.  Beveridge translated the canon in the same way.  Zonaras and
   others, on the contrary, understood by "fellow-bishop," the bishop of
   the Emperor's residence for the time being, and regarded the words ho
   en te meizoe k.t l. not as a clearer definition of what had gone
   before, but as the principal clause, in the sense of "then the
   Metropolitan shall," etc.  According to this interpretation, the words
   conveying the idea that the bishop must have recourse to the
   Metropolitan are entirely wanting in the canon.

   The first part of this Canon is the last part of Canon IX. of the
   Latin.  The last part is Canon X. of the Latin, but the personal part
   about Alypius is omitted from the Greek.

   Canon X.

   (Greeks.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also I think necessary. [393]   Ye should
   consider with all thoroughness and care, that if some rich man or
   professional advocate be desired for bishop, he be not ordained until
   he have fulfilled the ministry of reader, deacon, and presbyter, in
   order that, passing by promotion through the several grades, he may
   advance (if, that is, he be found worthy) to the height of the
   episcopate.  And he shall remain in each order assuredly for no brief
   time, that so his faith, his reputable life, his steadfastness of
   character and considerateness of demeanour may be well-known, and that
   he, being deemed worthy of the divine sacerdotal office [sacerdotium,
   i.e., the episcopate] may enjoy the highest honour.  For it is not
   fitting, nor does discipline or good conversation allow to proceed to
   this act rashly or lightly, so as to ordain a bishop or presbyter or
   deacon hastily; as thus he would rightly be accounted a novice,
   especially since also the most blessed Apostle, he who was the teacher
   of the Gentiles, is seen to have forbidden hasty ordinations; for the
   test of [even] the longest period will not unreasonably be required to
   exemplify the conversation and character of each [candidate].

   All said that this was their pleasure and that it must be absolutely
   irreversible.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also I think it necessary for you to consider
   most carefully, that if perchance some rich man or professional
   advocate or ex-official be desired for bishop, he be not ordained until
   he have fulfilled the ministry of a reader and the office of deacon and
   presbyter, and so ascend, if he have shown himself worthy, through the
   several grades to the height of the episcopate.  For by these
   promotions which in any case take a considerable length of time can be
   tested his faith, his discretion, his gravity and modesty.  And if he
   be found worthy, let him be honoured with the divine sacerdotal office
   [i.e. the episcopate].  For it is not fitting, nor does order or
   discipline allow, that one be rashly or lightly ordained bishop,
   presbyter or deacon, who is a novice, especially since also the blessed
   Apostle, the teacher of the Gentiles, is seen to have expressly
   forbidden it.  But those [should be ordained] whose life has been
   tested and their merit approved by length of time.

   All said that this was their pleasure.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   No lawyer, teacher, or gentleman (plousios) shall be made a bishop
   without passing through the holy orders.  Nor shall the space of time
   between the orders be made too brief, that there may be a better proof
   of his faith and good conversation.  For otherwise he is a neophyte.

   This is Canon XIII. of Dionysius, Isidore, and the Prisca.

   Van Espen.

   By Scholasticus de foro ["professional advocate"] must be understood an
   eloquent pleader of difficult causes, who being bound up in forensic
   disputes and strifes, may be presumed to be little fitted for the
   priesthood, and therefore to need a more strict examination.

   The Synodal approbation is lacking in Dionysius as given by Justellus,
   as well as in that of the Roman Code, but is found in Labbe's reprint
   of Dionysius and Isidore.

   This Canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   P. I., Dist. lxj., c. x.

   Canon XI.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also we ought to decree, that [394] when a
   bishop comes from one city to another city, or from one province to
   another province, to indulge boastfulness, ministering to his own
   praises rather than serving religious devotion, and wishes to prolong
   his stay [in a city], and the bishop of that city is not skilled in
   teaching, let him [the visiting bishop] not do despite to the bishop of
   the place and attempt by frequent discourses to disparage him and
   lessen his repute (for this device is wont to cause tumults), and
   strive by such arts to solicit and wrest to himself another's throne,
   not scrupling to abandon the church committed to him and to procure
   translation to another.  A definite limit of time should therefore be
   set in such a case, especially since not to receive a bishop is
   accounted the part of rude and discourteous persons.  Ye remember that
   in former times our fathers decreed that if a layman were staying in a
   city and should not come to divine worship for three [successive]
   Sundays [that is], for three [full] weeks, he should be repelled from
   communion.  If then this has been decreed in the case of laymen, it is
   neither needful, nor fitting, nor yet even expedient that a bishop,
   unless he has some grave necessity or difficult business, should be
   very long absent from his own church and distress the people committed
   to him.

   All the bishops said:  We decide that this decree also is most proper.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also ye ought to determine.  If a bishop
   comes from one city to another city, or from his own province to
   another province, and serving ambition rather than devotion, wishes to
   remain resident for a long time in a strange city, and then (as it
   perchance happens that the bishop of the place is not so practised or
   so learned as himself) he, the stranger, should begin to do him despite
   and deliver frequent discourses to disparage him and lessen his repute,
   not hesitating by this device to leave the church assigned him and
   remove to that which is another's--do ye then [in such a case] set a
   limit of time [for his stay in the city], because on the one hand to
   refuse to receive a bishop is discourteous, and on the other his too
   long stay is mischievous.  Provision must be made against this.  I
   remember that in a former council our brethren decreed that if any
   layman did not attend divine service in a city in which he was staying
   three Sundays, that is, for three weeks, he should be deprived of
   communion.  If then this has been decreed in the case of laymen, it is
   far less lawful and fitting that a bishop, if there be no grave
   necessity detaining him, should be absent from his church longer than
   the time above written.

   All said that such was their pleasure.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   A bishop when called in by another bishop, if he that called him is
   unskilled, must not be too assiduous in preaching, for this would be
   indecorous to the unlearned bishop, and an attack upon his bishopric.
   And both improper.  Without grave necessity it is undesirable for a
   bishop to be absent from his church.

   This is Canon XIV. of the Latin.

   Van Espen.

   To understand this canon it must be again remembered that in the first
   ages of the Church bishops were wont to be appointed at the demand of
   the people; wherefore whoever were going around after the episcopate,
   were accustomed to solicit the hearts of the people, and to make it
   their study to win their affections.

   [394] Here begins the Greek text, according to Bev.

   Canon XII.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  Since no case should be left unprovided for, let
   this also be decreed. [395]   Some of our brethren and fellow-bishops
   are known to possess very little private property in the cities in
   which they are placed as bishops, but have great possessions in other
   places, with which they are, moreover, able to help the poor.  I think
   then permission should be given them, if they are to visit their
   estates and attend to the gathering of the harvest, to pass three
   Sundays, that is, to stay for three weeks, on their estates, and to
   assist at divine worship and celebrate the liturgy in the nearest
   church in which a presbyter holds service, in order that they may not
   be seen to be absent from worship, and in order that they may not come
   too frequently to the city in which there is a bishop.  In this way
   their private affairs will suffer no loss from their absence and they
   will be seen to be clear from the charge of ambition and arrogance.

   All the bishops said:  This decree also is approved by us.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  Since no case should be left unprovided for [let
   this also be decreed].  There are some of our brother-bishops, who do
   not reside in the city in which they are appointed bishops, either
   because they have but little property there, while they are known to
   have considerable estates elsewhere, or, it may be, through affection
   for kith and kin and in complaisance to these.  Let this much be
   permitted them, to go to their estates to superintend and dispose of
   their harvest, and [for this purpose] to remain over three Sundays,
   that is, for three weeks, if it be necessary, on their estates; or
   else, if there is a neighbouring city in which there is a presbyter, in
   order that they may not be seen to pass Sunday without church, let them
   go thither, so that [in this way] neither will their private affairs
   suffer loss from their absence, nor will they, by frequent going to the
   city in which a bishop is resident, incur the suspicion of ambition and
   place-seeking.  All said that this was approved by them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   If a bishop has possessions outside his diocese, and visits them, let
   him be careful not to remain there more than three Lord's days.  For
   thus his own flock will be enriched by him, and he himself will avoid
   the charge of arrogance.

   This is Canon XV. of the Latin.

   Van Espen.

   As Balsamon notes, this canon is an appendix to that which goes before,
   and the context of the canon indicates this clearly enough; for while
   the last canon decrees that no bishop is to be absent from his diocese
   for more than three Lord's days, without grave necessity, in this canon
   a certain modification is introduced with regard to certain bishops.

   Hefele.

   According to the Latin text of Dionysius, it is:  "Some bishops do not
   reside in their Cathedral town, etc."  Isidore and the Prisca, however,
   are nearer the Greek text, as instead of resident they more rightly
   read possident.

   Canon XIII.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  Be this also the pleasure of all.  If any deacon
   or presbyter or any of the clergy be excommunicated and take refuge
   with another bishop who knows him and who is aware that he has been
   removed from communion by his own bishop, [that other bishop] must not
   offend against his brother bishop by admitting him to communion. [396]
     And if any dare to do this, let him know that he must present himself
   before an assembly of bishops and give account.

   All the bishops said:  This decision will assure peace at all times and
   preserve the concord of all.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  Be this also the pleasure of all.  If a deacon or
   presbyter or any of the clergy be refused communion by his own bishop
   and go to another bishop, and he with whom he has taken refuge shall
   know that he has been repelled by his own bishop, then must he not
   grant him communion.  But if he shall do so, let him know that he must
   give account before an assembly of bishops.

   All said:  This decision will preserve peace and maintain concord.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   Whoso knowingly admits to communion one excommunicated by his own
   bishop is not without blame.

   This is Canon XVI. of the Latin.

   Van Espen.

   The present canon agrees with Canon V. of Nice and with Canon IV. of
   Antioch, on which canons see the notes.  The Synod's approbation of
   this canon is found in Dionysius, Isidore, and in the Roman Codex apud
   Hervetus; but it is lacking from Balsamon and Zonaras.

   Canon XIV.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  I must not fail to speak of a matter which
   constantly urgeth me. [397]   If a bishop be found quick to anger
   (which ought not to sway such a man), and he, suddenly moved against a
   presbyter or deacon, be minded to cast him out of the Church, provision
   must be made that such a one be not condemned too hastily [or read
   athoon, if innocent] and deprived of communion.

   All said:  Let him that is cast out be authorized to take refuge with
   the bishop of the metropolis of the same province.  And if the bishop
   of the metropolis is absent, let him hasten to the bishop that is
   nearest, and ask to have his case carefully examined.  For a hearing
   ought not to be denied those who ask it.

   And that bishop who cast out such a one, justly or unjustly, ought not
   to take it ill that examination of the case be made, and his decision
   confirmed or revised.  But, until all the particulars have been
   examined with care and fidelity, he who is excluded from communion
   ought not to demand communion in advance of the decision of his case.
   And if any of the clergy who have met [to hear the case] clearly
   discern arrogance and pretentiousness in him, inasmuch as it is not
   fitting to suffer insolence or unjust censure, they ought to correct
   such an one with somewhat harsh and grievous language, that men may
   submit to and obey commands that are proper and right.  For as the
   bishop ought to manifest sincere love and regard to his subordinates,
   so those who are subject to him ought in like manner to perform the
   duties of their ministry in sincerity towards their bishops.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  I must not fail to speak of a matter which further
   moveth me.  If some bishop is perchance quick to anger (which ought not
   to be the case) and, moved hastily and violently against one of his
   presbyters or deacons, be minded to cast him out of the Church,
   provision must be made that an innocent man be not condemned or
   deprived of communion.

   Therefore let him that is cast out be authorized to appeal to the
   neighbouring bishops and let his case be heard and examined into more
   diligently.  For a hearing ought not to be denied one who asks it.

   And let that bishop who cast him out, justly or unjustly, take it
   patiently that the matter is discussed, so that his sentence may either
   be approved by a number [of judges] or else revised.  Nevertheless,
   until all the particulars shall be examined with care and fidelity, no
   one else ought to presume to admit to communion him who was excluded
   therefrom in advance of the decision of his case.  If, however, those
   who meet to hear it observe arrogance and pride in [such] clergy,
   inasmuch as it surely is not fitting for a bishop to suffer wrong or
   insult, let them correct them with some severity of language, that they
   may obey a bishop whose commands are proper and right.  For as he [the
   bishop] ought to manifest sincere love and charity to his clergy, so
   his ministers ought for their part to render unfeigned obedience to
   their bishop.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   One condemned out of anger, if he asks for assistance, should be
   heard.  But until [he shall have asked for [398] ] the assistance let
   him remain excommunicated.

   This is Canon XVII. of the Latin version.

   Van Espen.

   This canon is intended especially to aid presbyters, deacons, and other
   clerics, who have been excommunicated precipitately and without just
   cause, or suspended by their own bishop in his anger and fury....The
   canon, moreover, admonishes that the bishop with regard to whose
   sentence the dispute has arisen shall patiently consent to the
   discussion of the matter de novo, whether his decision be sustained by
   the majority or emended.

   And let bishops and other prelates who have spiritual jurisdiction over
   the clergy note this, who cannot bear with equanimity that a word
   should be said against their decisions, but exact a kind of blind
   obedience, even frequently with great conscientious suffering to their
   very best ecclesiastics; and in such cases as do not promptly and
   blindly obey them, the clergy are traduced as rebels and even a patient
   hearing is refused to them.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   P. II., Causa XI., Q. iij., c. iv.

   Canon XVIII.  (Of the Latin.)

   Bishop Januarius said:  Let your holiness also decree this, that no
   bishop be allowed to try to gain for himself a minister in the church
   of a bishop of another city and ordain him to one of his own parishes.

   All said:  Such is our pleasure, inasmuch as discord is apt to spring
   from contentions in this matter, and therefore the sentence of us all
   forbids anyone to presume to do

   Note.

   Van Espen.

   It is manifest that these two canons [xviii. of the Latin and xv. of
   the Greek], contain the resolution of the same case, and therefore it
   is that the Greeks keep only the former which contains the decree of
   the synod, made on Hosius's motion, the suggestion having been made by
   Januarius the bishop:  which suggestion makes the first of these
   canons.  [I.e. Latin canon xviij.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XV.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  And let us all decree this also, that [399] if any
   bishop should ordain to any order the minister of another from another
   diocese without the consent of his own bishop, such an ordination
   should be accounted invalid and not confirmed.  And if any take upon
   themselves to do this they ought to be admonished and corrected by our
   brethren and fellow-bishops.

   All said:  Let this decree also stand unalterable.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This also we all decree, that if any [bishop]
   should ordain the minister of another from another diocese without the
   consent and will of his own bishop, his ordination be not ratified.
   And whoever shall have taken upon himself to do this ought to be
   admonished and corrected by our brethren and fellow-bishops.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   If one places a foreign minister without the knowledge of his own
   bishop in any grade (embathmon, in aliquo gradu), he has indeed made
   the appointment, but it is without force.

   This is Canon XIX. in the Latin.

   Hefele.

   Fuchs, in his Bibliothek der Kirchenversammlungen (Pt. II., p. 123,
   note 125) [400] , thinks he has discovered a difference between this
   canon and the exclusively Latin one preceding it, in that the latter
   supposes the case of a bishop ordaining a foreign cleric, over whom he
   has no jurisdiction, to a higher grade, with the view of retaining him
   for his own diocese; while the other--fifteenth or nineteenth
   canon--treats of a case where such an ordination takes place without
   the ordaining bishop intending to keep the person ordained for his own
   diocese.  Van Espen is of another opinion, and maintains that both
   canons obviously refer to one and the same case, for which reason the
   Greek text has only inserted one of them.  It is certain that the text
   of both canons, as we have it, does not clearly indicate the difference
   conjectured by Fuchs, but that it may easily be found there.

   Van Espen.

   If the reading of all the Latins and Greeks is decisive, this canon
   only treats of the ordination of those already ministers or clerics,
   and so the Greek commentators Balsamon, Zonaras, and Aristenus
   understood it, as is evident from their annotations.  But Gratus,
   Bishop of Carthage, and Primate of Africa, in the First Synod of
   Carthage testified that in this canon it was decreed, that without the
   licence of his own bishop, a layman of another diocese was not to be
   ordained, and this interpretation or rather extension of the Canon, was
   received everywhere, as is demonstrated by the fifty-sixth of the
   African Code.

   This together with Canon XIX. of the Latin text are found as one in the
   Corpus Juris Canonici (Gratian's Decretum, P. I., Dist. lxxj.), c. j.

   Canon XVI.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Aëtius said:  Ye are not ignorant how important and how large is
   the metropolitan city of Thessalonica.  Accordingly presbyters and
   deacons often come to it from other provinces and, not content with
   staying a short time, remain and make it their permanent place of
   residence, or are compelled with difficulty and after a very long delay
   to return to their own churches.  A decree should be made bearing on
   this matter.

   Bishop Hosius said:  Let those decrees which have been made in the case
   of bishops, be observed as to these persons also.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Aëtius said:  Ye are not ignorant how large and important is the
   city of Thessalonica.  Presbyters and deacons often come to it from
   other regions, and are not content to remain a short time, but either
   make their residence there or at least are with difficulty compelled to
   return after a long interval to their own place.

   All said:  Those limits of time which have been decreed in the case of
   bishops ought to be observed as to these persons also.

   Notes.

   What things have been decreed for bishops with regard to the length of
   their absence, applies also to presbyters and deacons.

   Canon XVII.

   (Greek.)

   At the suggestion moreover of our brother Olympius, [401] we are
   pleased to decree this also:  That if a bishop suffer violence and is
   unjustly cast out either on account of his discipline or for his
   confession of [the faith of] the Catholic Church or for his defence of
   the truth, and, fleeing from danger, although innocent and devout [or,
   innocent and being under charge of high treason], comes to another
   city, let him not be forbidden to stay there until he is restored or
   until deliverance can be found from the violence and injustice that
   have been done him.  For it would be harsh indeed and most oppressive
   that one who has suffered unjust expulsion should not be harboured by
   us; as such a man ought to be received with the greatest consideration
   and cordiality.*

   All said:  This also is our pleasure.

   (Latin.)

   and unfeeling that he who is suffering persecution should not be
   received; indeed, great cordiality and abundant consideration should be
   shown him.

   All the synod said:  All that has been decreed the Catholic Church
   spread abroad throughout all the world will preserve and maintain.

   And all the bishops of the various provinces who had assembled
   subscribed thus:

   I, N., bishop of the city of N. and the province of N., so believe as
   above is written.

   If a bishop goes into another province after he has been unjustly
   expelled from his own, he should be received, until he has been
   delivered from his injury.

   This is Canon XXI. of the Latin and the last.

   St. Gregory seems to have had this canon in mind when he wrote to the
   bishops of Illyria (Lib. III., Epist. xliij.), who had been cast out by
   the hostility of the barbarians.

   Bishop Gaudentius said:  Thou knowest, brother Aëtius, that since thou
   wast made bishop, peace hath continued to rule [in thy diocese].  In
   order that no remnants of discord concerning ecclesiastics remain, it
   seems good that those who were ordained by Musæus and by Eutychianus,
   provided no fault be found in them, should all be received.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  This is the sentence of my mediocrity [i.e.,
   unworthiness]--that, since we ought to be gentle and patient and to be
   constant in compassion towards all, those who were once advanced to
   clerical office in the Church by certain of our brethren, if they are
   not willing to return to the churches to which they were nominated [or,
   espoused], should for the future not be received, and that neither
   Eutychianus should continue to vindicate to himself the name of bishop,
   nor yet that Musæus be accounted a bishop; but that if they should seek
   for lay communion, it should not be denied them.

   All said:  Such is our pleasure.

   (This canon is wanting in the Latin.)

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canons XVIII. and XIX.

   A clergyman who does not live in the Church among whose clergy he is
   enrolled should not be received.  Eutychian and Musæus shall not have
   the name of bishops.  But let them be admitted to communion with the
   laity, if they wish.

   Both of these canons are lacking in the Latin.

   Hefele.

   It is clear that the reason why these two canons do not exist in the
   Latin text is that they did not apply to the Latin Church and only
   contained a special rule for Thessalonica.

   (Greek.)

   Bishop Gaudentius said:  These things wholesomely, duly, and fitly
   decreed, in the estimation of us the bishops [ton hiereon] such as are
   pleasing both to God and to man will not be able to obtain due force
   and validity, unless fear [of a penalty] be added to the decrees
   proclaimed.  For we ourselves know that through the shamelessness of a
   few, the divine and right reverend title of bishop [of the tes
   hierosunes] hath often come into condemnation.  If therefore any one,
   moved by arrogance and ambition rather than seeking to please God,
   should have the hardihood to pursue a different course of action,
   contrary to the decree of all, let him know beforehand that he must
   give account and defend himself on this charge, and lose the honour and
   dignity of the episcopate.

   All answered:  This sentence is proper and right, and such is our
   pleasure. [402]

   And this decree will be most widely known and best carried into effect,
   if each of those bishops among us who have sees on the thoroughfares or
   highway, on seeing a bishop [pass by] shall inquire into the cause of
   his passage and his place of destination.  And if at his departure he
   shall find that he is going to the Court, he will direct his inquiries
   with reference to the objects [of a resort to the Court] above
   mentioned.  And if he come by invitation let no obstacle be put in the
   way of his departure.  But if he is trying to go to the Court out of
   ostentation, as hath afore been said by your charity, or to urge the
   petitions of certain persons, let neither his letters be signed nor let
   such an one be received to communion.

   All said:  Be this also decreed.

   (Latin.)

   Bishop Gaudentius said:  These things which you have wholesomely and
   suitably provided [in your decrees] pleasing in [or, to] the estimation
   of all both [or, and] to God and to men, can obtain force and validity
   only in case fear [of a penalty] be added to this your action.  For we
   ourselves know that through the shamelessness of a few the sacred and
   venerable sacerdotal [--episcopal] name hath been many times and oft
   brought to blame.  If therefore anyone attempts to oppose the judgment
   of all and seeks to serve ambition rather than please God, he must be
   given to know that he will have to render an account and lose office
   and rank.

   This can be carried into effect only provided each of us whose see is
   on the highway shall, if he sees a bishop pass, inquire into the cause
   of his journey, ascertain his destination, and if he finds that he is
   on his way to the Court, satisfy himself as to what is contained above
   [i.e., as to his objects at Court], lest perhaps he has come by
   invitation, that permission may be given him to proceed.  If, however,
   as your holiness mentioned above, he is going to Court to urge
   petitions and applications for office, let neither his letters be
   signed nor let him be received to communion.

   All said that this was proper and right and that this regulation was
   approved by them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX. [the last part of which in Beveridge,
   Synod., is numbered xxj.]

   If any bishop tries out of pride to do away with what has been decreed
   admirably, and in a manner pleasing to God, he shall lose his
   episcopate.  A bishop who shall see a bishop on his way to the camp, if
   he shall know that he goes there for any of the before-mentioned
   causes, let him not trouble him, but if otherwise let him pronounce
   excommunication against him.

   This is Canon XI. of the Latin.

   Van Espen.

   After the words ["honour and dignity"] according to Balsamon and
   Zonaras, as also Gentian Hervetus, there follows the approbation of the
   synod in these words:  "All answered, This opinion is becoming and
   well-pleasing to us," which indicate this to be the end of the canon;
   and therefore the Greeks make of this two distinct canons.

   Dionysius and Isidore make but one canon,...and this appears to be more
   congruous on account of the subject-matter of the first part, and will
   be manifest by connecting the two parts together.

   Van Espen follows Zonaras and Balsamon in understanding "Bishops in
   Canali," as such as were set on the public roads and public highways,
   or rather "in cities which are on the public highways, or Canals,' by
   which they that pass go without labour, as in a canal or aqueduct the
   water flows, for aqueduct and canal are the same thing in the Roman
   tongue."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [402] Here begins the Canon xxj., according to the Greek text of Bev.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [After Canon XX.]

   Canon XII.  (Of the Latin Texts.)

   Bishop Hosius said:  But some discretion is here requisite, brethren
   dearly beloved, in case some should come to those cities which are on
   the highway still ignorant of what has been decreed in the council.
   The bishop of such a city ought therefore to admonish him [a bishop so
   arriving], and instruct him to send his deacon from that place.  Upon
   this admonition he must, however, himself return to his diocese.

   Notes.

   Van Espen.

   This proposition of Hosius in the Roman Codex is joined as an appendix
   to the preceding canon.  The Greeks omit it altogether, very likely
   either because it seemed to be a proposition of Hosius's rather than a
   synodal canon, for no adoption by the synod is recorded:  or else
   because, even if it were a decree, it was only of temporary character,
   that is to say, until the canons had been sufficiently promulgated, and
   therefore some on the ground of ignorance might be exempt from the
   threatened penalties.

   Excursus on the Other Acts of the Council.

   As only the Canons have any real connexion with the Ecumenical Synods,
   they alone have properly a place in this volume, and yet it may not be
   amiss to give a brief account of the other acts of the council, so far
   as we know them.

   (a)  The Rule for Keeping Easter.--The Anglican Scholar, the Rev.
   William Cureton, of the British Museum, first edited the then recently
   discovered Preface to the Paschal Letters of St. Athanasius, together
   with the Letters themselves.  The ms. which he then published was in
   Syriac and was discovered in Egypt.  In the preface just referred to,
   it is expressly stated that "a plan was agreed upon at Sardica with
   regard to the feast of Easter."  But this new plan, which was only
   expected to hold good for fifty years, failed, and although in a.d. 346
   Easter should have fallen on March 23d, yet the Council (so says St.
   Athanasius) agreed to observe it on March 30th.  Another divergence
   fell in a.d. 349.  Easter, by the Alexandrian calculation, would have
   been April 23d.  But by Roman count, the origin of which was attributed
   to St. Peter, Easter was never to be later than April 21st, and for the
   sake of peace the Alexandrians yielded to the Romans and kept Easter on
   March 26th; but in 350, 360, and 368 the Alexandrian and Roman methods
   again disagreed, and even the fifty years which Sardica had thought to
   ensure uniformity were marked by diverse usages.

   (b)  The Encyclical Letter.--The Council addressed a long Encyclical
   letter to all the bishops of the world; it is found in St. Athanasius
   [403] in Greek, in St. Hilary of Poictiers [404] in Latin, and in
   Theodoret's Ecclesiastical History. [405]   In this last there occurs
   at the end the so-called "Creed of Sardica," which is now considered by
   scholars to be undoubtedly spurious.

   (c)  A Letter to the Diocese of Alexandria.--St. Athanasius [406] gives
   us the Greek text of a letter sent by the council to the diocese of
   Alexandria to the bishops of Egypt and Libya.

   (d)  A Letter to Pope Julius.--Among the Fragments of St. Hilary [407]
   is found a letter from the synod to Pope Julius.  Hefele says that the
   text is "considerably injured."  One clause of this letter above all
   others has given occasion to much controversy.  The passage runs as
   follows:  "It was best and fittest that the priests [i.e., bishops]
   from all the provinces should make their reports to the head, that is,
   the chair of St. Peter."  Blondell declares the passage to be an
   interpolation, resting his opinion upon the barbarous Latin of the
   expression valde congruentissimum.  And even Remi Ceillier, while
   explaining this by the supposition, which is wholly gratuitous, that
   the original was Greek, yet is forced to confess that the sentence
   interrupts the flow of thought and looks like an insertion.  Bower,
   [408] in his History of the Popes, and Fuchs [409] have urged still
   more strongly the spurious character of the phrase, the latter using
   the convenient "marginal comment" explanation.

   Besides these there are three documents which Scipio Maffei discovered
   in ms. at Verona, which by some are supposed to belong to the Council
   of Sardica.

   (a)  A Letter to the Christians of Mareotis.

   (b)  A Letter of St. Athanasius to the same Mareotic Churches.  This
   letter is signed not only by Athanasius, but also by a great number of
   the bishops composing the synod.

   (c)  A Letter from St. Athanasius to the Church of Alexandria.

   On the authority to be attributed to these three documents I can do no
   better than quote the closing words of Hefele, [410] whom I have
   followed in this whole excursus.

   "These extracts shew, I think, quite sufficiently the spuriousness of
   these documents.  Is it possible that the Eusebians would have said of
   themselves:  We are enemies of Christ?'  But apart from this, the whole
   contents of these three letters are lame and feeble.  The constant
   repetition of the same words is intolerable, and the whole style
   pointless and trivial.  To this it must be added that the whole of
   Christian antiquity knew nothing of these three documents, which only
   exist in the codex at Verona, so that we cannot acknowledge them as
   genuine."

   Excursus as to Whether the Sardican Council Was Ecumenical.

   Some theologians and canonists have been of opinion that the Council of
   Sardica was Ecumenical and would reckon it as the Second.  But besides
   the fact that such a numbering is absolutely in contrariety to all
   history it also labours under the difficulty, as we shall see
   presently, that the Westerns by insisting that St. Athanasius should
   have a seat caused a division of the synod at the very outset, so that
   the Easterns met at Philippopolis and confirmed the deposition of the
   Saint.  It is also interesting to remember that when Alexander Natalis
   in his history expressly called this synod ecumenical, the passage was
   marked with disapproval by the Roman censors.

   (Hefele.  Hist. Councils. Vol. II., pp. 172 et seqq.)

   The ecumenical character of this Synod certainly cannot be proved.
   [411]   It is indeed true that it was the design of Pope Julius, as
   well as of the two Emperors, Constantius and Constans, to summon a
   General Council at Sardica; but we do not find that any such actually
   took place:  and the history of the Church points to many like cases,
   where a synod was probably intended to be ecumenical, and yet did not
   attain that character.  In the present case, the Eastern and Western
   bishops were indeed summoned, but by far the greater number of the
   Eastern bishops were Eusebians, and therefore Semi-Arians, and instead
   of acting in a better mind in union with the orthodox, they separated
   themselves and formed a cabal of their own at Philippopolis.

   We cannot indeed agree with those who maintain that the departure of
   the Eusebians in itself rendered it impossible for the synod to be
   ecumenical, or it would be in the power of heretics to make an
   Ecumenical Council possible or not.  We cannot, however, overlook the
   fact that, in consequence of this withdrawal, the great Eastern Church
   was far more poorly represented at Sardica, and that the entire number
   of bishops present did not even amount to a hundred!  So small a number
   of bishops can only form a General Council if the great body of their
   absent colleagues subsequently give their express consent to what has
   been decided.  This was not, however, the case at the Synod of
   Sardica.  The decrees were no doubt at once sent for acceptance and
   signature to the whole of Christendom, but not more than about two
   hundred of those bishops who had been absent signed, and of these,
   ninety-four, or nearly half, were Egyptians.  Out of the whole of Asia
   only a few bishops from the provinces of Cyprus and Palestine signed,
   not one from the other Eastern provinces; and even from the Latin
   Church in Africa, which at that time numbered at least three hundred
   bishops, we meet with very few names.  We cannot give much weight to
   the fact that the Emperor Constantius refused to acknowledge the
   decrees of Sardica:  it is of much greater importance that no single
   later authority declared it to be a General Council.  Natalis Alexander
   [412] is indeed of opinion that because Pope Zosimus, in the year 417
   or 418, cited the fifth canon of Sardica as Nicene, and a synod held at
   Constantinople in 382 cited the sixth as Nicene, the synod must
   evidently have been considered as an appendix to that of Nicea, and
   therefore its equal, that is, must have been honoured as ecumenical.
   But we have already shown how Zosimus and the bishops of Constantinople
   had been led into this confusion from the defects of their manuscript
   collections of the canons.  Athanasius, Sulpicius Severus, Socrates,
   and the Emperor Justinian were cited in later times for the ecumenical
   character of this synod.  Athanasius calls it a megale sunodos;
   Sulpicius Severus says it was ex toto orbe convocata; and Socrates
   relates that "Athanasius and other bishops had demanded an Ecumenical
   Synod, and that of Sardica had been then summoned. [413]   It is clear
   at the first glance that the two last authorities only prove that the
   Synod had been intended to be a general one, and the expression "Great
   Synod," used by Athanasius, cannot be taken as simply identical with
   ecumenical.  While, however, the Emperor Justinian, in his edict of
   346, on the Three Chapters, calls the Synod of Sardica ecumenical, he
   yet, in the same edict, as well as in other places, does not reckon it
   among the General Councils, of which he counts four.  To this must be
   added, first, that the Emperor is not the authority entitled to decide
   as to the character of an Ecumenical Synod; and secondly, that the
   expression Universale Concilium was employed in a wider sense in
   speaking of those synods which, without being general, represented a
   whole patriarchate.

   The Trullan Synod and Pope Nicholas I. are further appealed to.  The
   former in its second canon approved of the Sardican canons, and Pope
   Nicholas said of them:  "omnis Ecclesia recepit eos."  But this in no
   way contains a declaration that the Synod of Sardica was ecumenical,
   for the canons of many other councils also--for instance, Ancyra,
   Neocæsarea, and others--were generally received without those synods
   themselves being therefore esteemed ecumenical.  Nay, the Trullan Synod
   itself speaks for us; for had it held the Synod of Sardica to be the
   second General Council, it would have placed its canons immediately
   after those of Nice, whereas they are placed after the four ancient
   General Councils, and from this we see that the Trullan Synod did not
   reckon the Sardican among those councils, but after them.  To this it
   must be added that the highest Church authorities speak most decidedly
   against the synod being ecumenical.  We may appeal first to Augustine,
   who only knew of the Eusebian assembly at Sardica, and nothing at all
   of an orthodox synod in that place; which would have been clearly
   impossible, if it had at that time been counted among the ecumenical
   synods.  Pope Gregory the Great [414] and St. Isidore of Seville [415]
   speak still more plainly.  They only know of four ancient General
   Councils--those of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon.  The
   objection of the Ballerini that Gregory and Isidore did not intend to
   enumerate the most ancient general synods as such, but only those which
   issued important dogmatic decrees, is plainly quite arbitrary, and
   therefore without force.  Under such circumstances it is natural that
   among the later scholars by far the great majority should have answered
   the question, whether the Synod of Sardica is ecumenical, in the
   negative, as have Cardinal Bellarmin, Peter de Marca, Edmund Richer,
   Fleury, Orsi, Sacharelli, Tillemont, Du Pin, Berti, Ruttenstock,
   Rohrbacher, Remi Ceillier, Stolberg, Neander, and others.  On the other
   hand, Baronius, Natalis Alexander, the brothers Ballerini, Mansi, and
   Palma [416] have sought to maintain the ecumenical character of the
   synod, but as early as the seventeenth century the Roman censors
   condemned the direct assertions of Natalis Alexander on the subject.

   Introductory Note.

   An attempt to write a commentary upon all the canons of the African
   Code, would have meant nothing less than the preparation of one volume
   or more on the canon law of the West.  This is impossible and
   therefore, interesting as the field would be, I have been compelled to
   restrain my pen, and rather than give a scant and insufficient
   annotation, I have contented myself with providing the reader with as
   good a translation as I have been able to make of the very corrupt
   Latin (correcting it at times by the Greek), and have added the Ancient
   Epitome and the quaint notes in full of John Johnson from the Second
   Edition, of 1714, of his "Clergyman's Vade-mecum," Pt. II., which
   occupy little space, but may not be easily reached by the ordinary
   reader.  The student will find full scholia on these Canons in Van
   Espen in the Latin, and in Zonaras and Balsamon in the Greek.  These
   latter are in Beveridge's Synodicon.

   Johnson writes an excellent Introduction to his Epitome of these
   Canons, as follows:

   "Councils were nowhere more frequently called in the Primitive Times
   than in Africa.  In the year 418-19, all canons formerly made in
   sixteen councils held at Carthage, one at Milevis, one at Hippo, that
   were approved of, were read, and received a new sanction from a great
   number of bishops, then met in synod at Carthage.  This Collection is
   the Code of the African Church, which was always in greatest repute in
   all Churches next after the Code of the Universal Church.  This code
   was of very great authority in the old English Churches, for many of
   the Excerptions of Egbert were transcribed from it.  And though the
   Code of the Universal Church ends with the canons of Chalcedon, [417]
   yet these African Canons are inserted into the Ancient Code both of the
   Eastern and Western Churches.  These canons though ratified and
   approved by a synod, yet seem to have been divided or numbered by some
   private and unlearned hand, and have probably met with very unskilful
   transcribers, by which means some of them are much confounded and
   obscured, as to their sense and coherence.  They are by Dionysius
   Exiguus and others entituled The Canons of the Synod of Africa.  And
   though all were not originally made at one time, yet they were all
   confirmed by one synod of African bishops, who, after they had recited
   the Creed and the twenty canons of the Council of Nice, proceeded to
   make new canons, and re-enforce old ones."

   In his "Library of Canon Law" (Bibliotheca Juris Canonici) Justellus
   gives these canons, and, in my opinion, gives them rightly, the title
   "The Code of Canons of the African Church" (Codex Canonum Ecclesiæ
   Africanæ), although Hefele [418] describes them as "the collection of
   those African Canons put together in 419 by Dionysius Exiguus."  Hefele
   says that the title Dionysius gave them in his collection was "The
   Statutes of an African Council" (Statuta Concilii Africani) which would
   certainly be wholly inadequate and misleading; but in the edition of
   Dionysius in Migne's Patrologia Latina (Tom. LXVII., col. 181) in the
   Codex Canonum Ecclesiasticorum no such title occurs, but the perfectly
   accurate one, "A Synod at Carthage in Africa, which adopted one hundred
   and thirty-eight canons."  This is an exact description of what took
   place and of the origin of these most important dogmatic and
   disciplinary enactments.  Hefele must have been thinking of Dionysius's
   Preface where the expression does occur but not as a title.

   (Beveridge.  Synodicon, Tom. II., p. 202.)

   Carthage was formerly the head of the whole of Africa, as St. Augustine
   tells us in his Epistle CLXII.  From this cause it happened that a
   great number of councils were held there, gathered from all the
   provinces of Africa.  Especially while Aurelius as Archbishop was
   occupying the throne were these meetings of bishops frequently holden;
   and by these, for the establishing of ecclesiastical discipline in
   Africa, many canons were enacted.  At last, after the consulate of
   Honorius (XII.) and Theodosius (VIII.), Augustuses, on the eighth day
   before the Calends of June, that is to say, on May 25, in the year of
   our Lord 419, another Council was held in the same city at which all
   the canons previously adopted were considered, and the greater part of
   them were again confirmed by the authority of the synod.  These canons,
   thus confirmed by this council, merited to be called from that day to
   this "The Code of Canons of the African Church."  These canons were not
   at first adopted in Greek but in Latin, and they were confirmed in the
   same language.  This Dionysius Exiguus distinctly testifies to in his
   preface to the "Code of Ecclesiastical Canons," in which they are
   included.  It is uncertain when the canons of this Carthaginian synod
   were done into Greek.  This only is certain, that they had been
   translated into Greek before the Council in Trullo by which, in its
   Second Canon, they were received into the Greek Nomocanon, and were
   confirmed by the authority of this synod; so that from that time these
   canons stand in the Eastern Church on an equality with all the rest.

   An extremely interesting point arises as to what was the authority of
   the collection as a collection, and how this collection was made?
   There seems no doubt that the collection substantially as we know it
   was the code accepted by the Council of Trullo, the canons of which
   received a quasi-ecumenical authority from the subsequent general
   imprimatur given them by the Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second of
   Nice.  Van Espen has considered this point at great length in
   Dissertation VIII. of the First Part of his Commentaries, and to his
   pages I must refer the reader for anything like an adequate
   presentation of the matter.  He concludes (§ I.) that the "Code owes
   its origin to this synod," and argues against De Marca in proof of the
   proposition that the collection was not the private work of Dionysius,
   but the official work of the council by one of its officials,
   concluding with the remark (§ II.) that "this was the persuasion both
   of Greeks and Latins,...and these canons are set forth by Balsamon with
   the title, The Canons of the CCXVII. Blessed Fathers who met together
   at Carthage.'"

   In the notes on each canon I shall give the source, following Hefele in
   all respects (Hist. of the Councils, vol. ii., pp. 468 et seqq.), and
   content myself here with setting down a list of the various councils
   which made the enactments, with their dates.

   Carthage (under Gratus)--345-348 a.d.

   XVI.   "   (May 1)--418

   XVII.   "   (May 25) which adopted the African Code--419

   The numbering of the African councils differs very widely between the
   different writers, and Cave reckons nine between 401 and 608, and
   thirty-five Carthaginian between 215 and 533. [419]   Very useful
   tables, shewing the conclusions of Fuchs, are found at the end of
   Bruns, Canones Apostolorum et Conciliorum Veterum Selecti.

   I need only add that I have frequently used Dr. Bruns's text, but have
   not confined myself to it exclusively.  Evidently in the Latin, as we
   now have it, there are many corrupt passages.  In strange
   contradistinction to this, the Greek is apparently pure and is clear
   throughout.  Possibly the Greek translation was made from a purer Latin
   text than we now possess.

   An Ancient Introduction.

   (Found in Dionysius Exiguus, Codex Can. Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. lxvii.,
   col. 182.)

   After the consulate of the most glorious emperors, Honorus for the
   twelfth time and Theodosius for the eighth time, Augustuses, on the
   VIII. before the Calends of June at Carthage, in the Secretarium of the
   basilica of Faustus, when Pope Aurelius had sat down, together with
   Valentine of the primatial see of the province of Numidia, and
   Faustinus of the Potentine Church, of the Italian province Picenum, a
   legate of the Roman Church, and also with legates of the different
   African provinces, that is to say, of the two Numidias, of Byzacena, of
   Mauritania Cæsariensis, as well as of Tripoli, and with Vincent
   Colositanus, Fortunatian, and other bishops of the proconsular
   province, in all two hundred and seventeen, also with Philip and
   Asellus, presbyters and legates of the Roman Church, and while the
   deacons were standing by, Aurelius the bishop said, etc., ut infra.

   The Canons of the 217 Blessed Fathers who assembled at Carthage.

   (Labbe and Cossart:  Concilia, Tom. II. Col. 1041; Dionysius Ex., Codex
   Can. Eccles.[Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. LXVII.]; Beveridge, Synodicon in
   loc.)

   Aurelius the Bishop said: [420]   You, most blessed brethren, remember
   that after the day fixed for the synod we discussed many things while
   we were waiting for our brethren who now have been sent as delegates
   and have arrived at the present synod, which must be placed in the
   acts.  Wherefore let us render thanks to our Lord for the gathering
   together of so great an assembly.  It remains that the acts of the
   Nicene Synod which we now have, and have been determined by the
   fathers, as well as those things enacted by our predecessors here, who
   confirmed that same Synod, or which according to the same form have
   been usefully enacted by all grades of the clergy, from the highest
   even to the lowest, should be brought forward.  The whole Council
   said:  Let them be brought forward.

   Daniel the Notary read:  The profession of faith or statutes of the
   Nicene Synod are as follows.

   And while he was speaking, Faustinus, a bishop of the people of
   Potentia, of the Italian province of Picenum, a legate of the Roman
   Church said:  There have been entrusted to us by the Apostolic See
   certain things in writings, and certain other things as in ordinances
   to be treated of with your blessedness as we have called to memory in
   the acts above, that is to say, concerning the canons made at Nice,
   that their decrees and customs be observed; for some things are
   observed out of decree and canon, but some from custom.  Concerning
   these things therefore in the first place let us make enquiry, if it
   please your blessedness; and afterwards let the other ordinances which
   have been adopted or proposed be confirmed; so that you may be able to
   show by your rescripts to the Apostolic See, and that you may declare
   to the same venerable Pope, that we have diligently remembered these
   things; although the headings of action taken had been already inserted
   in the acts. [421]   In this matter we should act, as I have said
   above, as shall please your beloved blessedness.  Let, therefore the
   commonitorium come into the midst, that ye may be able to recognize
   what is contained in it, so that an answer can be given to each point.

   Aurelius said:  Let the commonitorium be brought forward, which our
   brethren and fellow-ministers lately placed in the acts, and let the
   rest of the things done or to be done, follow in order.

   Daniel the Notary read the Commonitorium.  To our brother Faustinus and
   to our sons, the presbyters Philip and Asellus, Zosimus, the bishop.
   You well remember that we committed to you certain businesses, and now
   [we bid you] carry out all things as if we ourselves were there (for),
   indeed, our presence is there with you; especially since ye have this
   our commandment, and the words of the canons which for greater
   certainty we have inserted in this our commonitory.  For thus said our
   brethren in the Council of Nice when they made these decrees concerning
   the appeals of bishops:

   "But it seemed good that if a bishop had been accused, etc."  [Here
   follows verbatim Canon v. of Sardica.]

   Ancient Epitome.

   If bishops shall have deposed a bishop, and if he appeal to the Roman
   bishop, he should be benignantly heard, the Roman bishop writing or
   ordering.

   And when this had been read, Alypius, bishop of the Tagastine Church,
   and legate of the province of Numidia, said:  On this matter there has
   been some legislation in former sessions of our council, and we profess
   that we shall ever observe what was decreed by the Nicene Council; yet
   I remember that when we examined the Greek copies of this Nicene Synod,
   we did not find these the words quoted--Why this was the case, I am
   sure I do not know.  For this reason we beg your reverence, holy Pope
   Aurelius, that, as the authentic record of the decrees of the Council
   of Nice are said to be preserved in the city of Constantinople, you
   would deign to send messengers with letters from your Holiness, and not
   only to our most holy brother the bishop of Constantinople, but also to
   the venerable bishops of Alexandria and Antioch, who shall send to us
   the decrees of that council with the authentification of their
   signatures, so that hereafter all ambiguity should be taken away, for
   we failed to find the words cited by our brother Faustinus;
   notwithstanding this however we promise to be ruled by them for a short
   time, as I have already said, until reliable copies come to hand.
   Moreover the venerable bishop of the Roman Church, Boniface, should be
   asked likewise to be good enough to send messengers to the
   aforementioned churches, who should have the same copies according to
   his rescript, but the copies of the aforementioned Nicene Council which
   we have, we place in these Acts.

   Faustinus the bishop, legate of the Roman Church, said:  Let not your
   holiness do dishonour to the Roman Church, either in this matter or in
   any other, by saying the canons are doubtful, as our brother and
   fellow-bishop Alypius has vouchsafed to say:  but do you deign to write
   these things to our holy and most blessed pope, so that he seeking out
   the genuine canons, can treat with your holiness on all matters
   decreed.  But it suffices that the most blessed bishop of the city of
   Rome should make enquiry just as your holiness proposes doing on your
   part, that there may not seem to have arisen any contention between the
   Churches, but that ye may the rather be enabled to deliberate with
   fraternal charity, when he has been heard from, what is best should be
   observed.

   Aurelius the bishop said:  In addition to what is set down in the acts,
   we, by the letters from our insignificance, must more fully inform our
   holy brother and fellow-bishop Boniface of everything which we have
   considered.  Therefore if our plan pleases all, let us be informed of
   this by the mouth of all.  And the whole council said:  It seems good
   to us.

   Novatus the bishop, legate of Mauritania Sitifensis, said:  We now call
   to mind that there is contained in this commonitory something about
   presbyters and deacons, how they should be tried by their own bishops
   or by those adjoining, a provision which we find nothing of in the
   Nicene Council.  For this cause let your holiness order this part to be
   read.

   Aurelius the bishop said:  Let the place asked for be read.  Daniel the
   notary read as follows:  Concerning the appeals of clergymen, that is
   of those of inferior rank, there is a sure answer of this very synod,
   concerning which thing what ye should do, we think should be inserted,
   as follows:

   "Hosius the bishop said:  I should not conceal what has come into my
   mind up to this time.  If any bishop perchance has been quickly angered
   (a thing what should not happen) and has acted quickly or sharply
   against a presbyter or a deacon of his, and has wished to drive him out
   of the Church, provision should be made that the innocent be not
   condemned, or be deprived of communion:  he that has been ejected
   should have the right of appeal to the bishops of the bordering
   dioceses, that his case should be heard, and it should be carried on
   all the more diligently because to him who asks a hearing it should not
   be denied.  And the bishop who either justly or unjustly rejected him,
   should patiently allow the affair to be discussed, so that his sentence
   be either approved or else emended, etc."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome.

   A presbyter or deacon who has been cut off, has the privilege of
   appealing to the neighbouring bishops.  Moreover, he who cut him off
   should bear with equanimity the conclusion arrived at.

   This is the first part of Canon xiv. of Sardica, as the canon
   previously quoted is Canon v. of the same synod.

   And when this had been read, Augustine, the bishop of the Church of
   Hippo of the province of Numidia, said:  We promise that this shall be
   observed by us, provided that upon more careful examination it be found
   to be of the Council of Nice.  Aurelius the bishop said.  If this also
   is pleasing to the charity of you all, give it the confirmation of your
   vote.  The whole Council said:  Everything that has been ordained by
   the Nicene Council pleases us all.  Jocundus, the bishop of the Church
   of Suffitula, legate of the province of Byzacena, said:  What was
   decreed by the Nicene Council cannot in any particular be violated.

   Faustinus the bishop, legate of the Roman Church, said:  So far as has
   developed by the confession of your holiness as well as of the holy
   Alypius, and of our brother Jocundus, I believe that some of the points
   have been made weak and others confirmed, which should not be the case,
   since even the very canons themselves have been brought into question.
   Therefore, that there may be harmony between us and your blessedness,
   let your holiness deign to refer the matter to the holy and venerable
   bishop of the Roman Church, that he may be able to consider whether
   what St. Augustine vouchsafed to enact, should be conceded or not, I
   mean in the matter of appeals of the inferior grade.  If therefore
   there still is doubt, on this head it is right that the bishop of the
   most blessed see be informed, if this can be found in the canons which
   have been approved.

   Ancient Epitome.

   Since the written decrees of the Nicene Council have not been found,
   let the Roman bishop deign to write to the bishop of Constantinople and
   to him of Alexandria, and let us know what he receives from them.

   Aurelius the bishop said:  As we have suggested to your charity, pray
   allow the copies of the statutes of the Nicene Council to be read and
   inserted in the acts, as well as those things what have been most
   healthfully defined in this city by our predecessors, according to the
   rule of that council, and those which now have been ordained by us.
   And the whole council said:  The copies of the Creed, and the statutes
   of the Nicene Synod which formerly were brought to our council through
   Cæcilean of blessed memory, the predecessor of your holiness (who was
   present at it), as well as the copies of the decrees made by the
   Fathers in this city following them, or which now we have decreed by
   our common consultation, shall remain inserted in these ecclesiastical
   acts, so that (as has been already said) your blessedness may vouchsafe
   to write to those most venerable men of the Church of Antioch, and of
   that of Alexandria, and also of that of Constantinople, that they would
   send most accurate copies of the decrees of the Council of Nice under
   the authentification of their signatures, by which, the truth of the
   matter having become evident, those chapters which in the commonitory
   our brother who is present, and fellow-bishop Faustinus, as well as our
   fellow-presbyters Philip and Asellus brought with them, if they be
   found therein, may be confirmed by us; or if they be not found, we will
   hold a synod and consider the matter further.  Daniel the notary read
   the profession of faith of the Council of Nice and its statutes to the
   African Council.

   The Profession of Faith of the Nicene Council.

   We believe in one God, etc.,...and in the Holy Ghost.  But those who
   say, etc.,...anathematize them.

   The statutes also of the Nicene Council in twenty heads were likewise
   read, as are found written before.  Then what things were promulgated
   in the African Synods, were inserted in the present acts.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [420] The reader must not complain if he finds the meaning of the
   translation often obscure.  So great a scholar as Hefele says of one of
   these speeches, "This, I believe, must be the meaning of the somewhat
   unintelligible text, etc.," and again of another passage he says that
   it "is even more obscure," and that "the text is undoubtedly corrupt.
   The sense is probably, etc."

   [421] I have followed in this passage the Greek text as a trifle less
   incomprehensible.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon I.

   That the statutes of the Nicene Council are to be scrupulously
   observed.

   Aurelius the bishop said:  Such are the statutes of the Nicene Council,
   which our fathers at that time brought back with them:  and preserving
   this form, let these things which follow, adopted and confirmed by us,
   be kept firm.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   Let the copies of the decrees of the Nicene Council which our fathers
   brought back with them from that synod, be observed.

   Johnson.

   It is certain that Cæcilian, then Bishop of Carthage, was present at
   the Council of Nice; that any other African bishop was there does not
   appear; but probably he was attended with several clergyman, who were
   afterwards ordained bishops.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon II.

   Of Preaching the Trinity.

   The whole Council said:  By the favour of God, by a unanimous
   confession the Church's faith which through us is handed down should be
   confessed in this glorious assembly before anything else; then the
   ecclesiastical order of each is to be built up and strengthened by the
   consent of all.  That the minds of our brethren and fellow bishops
   lately elevated may be strengthened, those things should be propounded
   which we have certainly received from our fathers, as the unity of the
   Trinity, which we retain consecrated in our senses, of the Father, and
   of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which has no difference, as we say,
   [422] so we shall instruct the people of God.  Moreover by all the
   bishops lately promoted it was said:  So we openly confess, so we hold,
   so we teach, following the Evangelic faith and your teaching.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   No difference is recognised or taught by the decrees of the Council of
   Nice between the Persons of the Holy Trinity.

   This canon, or rather introduction, is taken from Canon j., of the
   Council of Carthage held under Genethlius, a.d. 387 or 390. [423]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [422] Or "have learned."

   [423] In assigning these canons to the several synods that adopted
   them, I have simply followed Hefele.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon III.

   Of Continence.

   Aurelius the bishop said:  When at the past council the matter on
   continency and chastity was considered, those three grades, which by a
   sort of bond are joined to chastity by their consecration, to wit
   bishops, presbyters, and deacons, so it seemed that it was becoming
   that the sacred rulers and priests of God as well as the Levites, or
   those who served at the divine sacraments, should be continent
   altogether, by which they would be able with singleness of heart to ask
   what they sought from the Lord:  so that what the apostles taught and
   antiquity kept, that we might also keep.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   Let a bishop, a presbyter, and a deacon be chaste and continent.

   This canon is taken from Canon ij., of Carthage 387 or 390.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IV.

   Of the different orders that should abstain from their wives.

   Faustinus, the bishop of the Potentine Church, in the province of
   Picenum, a legate of the Roman Church, said:  It seems good that a
   bishop, a presbyter, and a deacon, or whoever perform the sacraments,
   should be keepers of modesty and should abstain from their wives.

   By all the bishops it was said:  It is right that all who serve the
   altar should keep pudicity from all women.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   Let those who pray abstain from their wives that they may obtain their
   petitions.

   This canon is taken from Canon ij., of Carthage 387 or 390, last
   mentioned.

   Johnson.

   See Canon XXV.  "Abstain from their wives," i.e. Some time before and
   after the Eucharist, as the old Scholiasts understand it.  [i.e. the
   Greek scholiasts, but see notes to Canon xiij. of Quinisext.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   Of Avarice.

   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  The cupidity of avarice (which, let no one
   doubt, is the mother of all evil things), is to be henceforth
   prohibited, lest anyone should usurp another's limits, or for gain
   should pass beyond the limits fixed by the fathers, nor shall it be at
   all lawful for any of the clergy to receive usury of any kind.  And
   those new edicts (suggestiones) which are obscure and generally
   ambiguous, after they have been examined by us, will have their value
   fixed (formam accipiunt); but with regard to those upon which the
   Divine Scripture hath already most plainly given judgment, it is
   unnecessary that further sentence should be pronounced, but what is
   already laid down is to be carried out.  And what is reprehensible in
   laymen is worthy of still more severe censure in the clergy.  The whole
   synod said:  No one hath gone contrary to what is said in the Prophets
   and in the Gospels with impunity.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   As the taking of any kind of usury is condemned in laymen, much more is
   it condemned in clergymen.

   This canon is made up of Canons x. and xiij. of the Synod of Carthage
   held under Gratus in a.d. 345-348.  This synod was held to return
   thanks for the ending of the Donatist schism; and indeed for some time
   the evil did seem to have been removed.  Donatist worship was
   prohibited by the imperial law and it was not until the times of
   Constans and Constantius that it again openly asserted itself.  The
   synod while in session also took advantage of the opportunity of
   passing some useful general canons on discipline.

   Johnson.

   See Canon of the Apostles 36 (44); Nic., 17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   That the chrism should not be made by presbyters.

   Fortunatus the bishop, said:  In former councils we remember that it
   was decreed that the chrism or the reconciliation of penitents, as also
   the consecration of virgins be not done by presbyters:  but should
   anyone be discovered to have done this, what ought we to decree with
   regard to him?

   Aurelius the bishop said:  Your worthiness has heard the suggestion of
   our brother and fellow-bishop Fortunatus; What answer will you give?

   And all the bishops replied:  Neither the making of the chrism, nor the
   consecration of virgins, is to be done by presbyters, nor is it
   permitted to a presbyter to reconcile anyone in the public mass (in
   publica missa), this is the pleasure of all of us.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   Let no presbyter make the chrism, nor prepare the unction, nor
   consecrate virgins, nor publicly reconcile anyone to communion.

   This is Canon iij. of the Carthaginian Synod under Genethlius, a.d. 387
   or 390.

   Johnson.

   Not the chrism used upon persons at their baptism, says the scholion in
   Bishop Beveridge's Annotation, but the Mystical Chrism, viz., that used
   at Confirmation; though neither was the chrism used at baptism to be
   consecrated by Priests.  See Decr. of Gelasius 6.

   Du Pin observes, That this is one of the first monuments where the name
   of "mass" occurs to signify the public prayers, which the church made
   at offering the Eucharist.  And let the reader observe, that there is
   no mention of the "mass" in the copies which the Greeks made use of.
   And further, he restrains the meaning of the word "mass" too much, when
   he supposes that it denoted the Communion Office only.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VII.

   Concerning those who are reconciled in peril of death.

   Aurelius the bishop said:  If anyone had fallen into peril of death
   during the absence of the bishop, and had sought to reconcile himself
   to the divine altars, the presbyter should consult the bishop, and so
   reconcile the sick man at his bidding, which thing we should strengthen
   with healthy counsel.  By all the bishops it was said:  Whatever your
   holiness has taught us to be necessary, that is our pleasure.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   A priest desiring to reconcile anyone in peril to the sacred altars
   must consult the bishop and do what seems good to him.

   This is Canon iv. of the Synod of 387 or 390.

   Johnson.

   See Canon 43.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VIII.

   Of those who make accusation against an elder; and that no criminal is
   to be suffered to bring a charge against a bishop.

   Numidius, the bishop of Maxula, said:  Moreover, there are very many,
   not of good life, who think that their elders or bishops should be the
   butt for accusation; ought such to be easily admitted or no?  Aurelius
   the bishop said:  Is it the pleasure of your charity that he who is
   ensnared by divers wickednesses should have no voice of accusation
   against these?

   All the bishops said:  If he is criminous, his accusation is not to be
   received.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   It has seemed good that they who are themselves defendants for crimes
   should not bring accusations; nor should they be allowed to lay crimes
   to anyone's charge.

   This is Canon vi. of Genethlius's Synod at Carthage, a.d. 387 or 390.

   Johnson.

   See Canons 132 and 133 and Constantinople Canon 6.

   [The "elders" mentioned in this canon are] probably the same with senes
   in other canons, viz., Metropolitans, as is generally believed.  The
   Latin here calls them Majores natu, the Greek pateras.  Bishop
   Beveridge supposes that the word denotes bishop, though perhaps Majores
   natu may signify presbyters.  Justellus on the canon produces some
   seeming authorities for this.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IX.

   Of those who on account of their deeds are justly cast forth from the
   congregation of the Church.

   Augustine the bishop, the legate of the Numidian province, said:  Deign
   to enact that if any perchance have been rightly on account of their
   crimes cast forth from the Church, and shall have been received into
   communion by some bishop or presbyter, such shall be considered as
   guilty of an equal crime with them who flee away from the judgment of
   their own bishop.  And all the bishops said:  This is the pleasure of
   all of us.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   Let him be excommunicated who communicates with one excommunicated.

   This is Canon vii. of the same synod of 387 or 390.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon X.

   Of presbyters who are corrected by their own bishops.

   Alypius the bishop, a legate of the province of Numidia, said:  Nor
   should this be passed over; if by chance any presbyter when corrected
   by his bishop, inflamed by self-conceit or pride, has thought fit to
   offer sacrifices to God separately [from the authority of the bishop]
   or has believed it right to erect another altar, contrary to
   ecclesiastical faith and discipline, such should not get off with
   impunity.  Valentine, of the primatial see of the province of Numidia,
   said:  The propositions made by our brother Alypius are of necessity
   congruous to ecclesiastical discipline and faith; therefore enact what
   seems good to your belovedness.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   If one condemned by his bishop shall separate himself and set up an
   altar or make the offering he should be punished.

   Aristenus.

   Whoever has been cut off by his own bishop and does not go to the synod
   to which his bishop is subject, that an examination may be made of the
   grounds of his cutting off, and that whatever is contrary to justice
   may be corrected; but, puffed up with pride and conceit, shall despise
   the synod and separate himself from the Church, and shall set up
   another altar, and shall offer to God the holy gifts; such an one shall
   not be allowed to go on with impunity, since he is acting contrary to
   the faith and constitution of the Church; but he is to be stricken with
   anathema.

   This and the following canon are Canon viii. of the so often mentioned
   synod of 387 or 390.

   Johnson.

   See Canon of the Apostles 24 (or 32) and that of Gangra 6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XI.

   If any presbyter, inflated against his bishop, makes a schism, let him
   be anathema.

   All the bishops said:  If any presbyter shall have been corrected by
   his superior, he should ask the neighbouring bishops that his cause be
   heard by them and that through them he may be reconciled to his
   bishop:  but if he shall not have done this, but, puffed up with pride,
   (which may God forbid!) he shall have thought it proper to separate
   himself from the communion of his bishop, and separately shall have
   offered the sacrifice to God, and made a schism with certain
   accomplices, let him be anathema, and let him lose his place; and if
   the complaint which he brought against his bishop shall [not] have been
   found to be well founded, an enquiry should be instituted.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   A Presbyter condemned by his bishop, is allowed to appeal to the
   neighbouring bishops:  but if he shall not make any appeal, but shall
   make a schism, and be elated with conceit and shall offer the Holy
   Gifts to God, let him be anathema.

   See note to last canon.  The last clause is certainly corrupt; in the
   council of Carthage at which it was first adopted there is no "non,"
   making the meaning clear.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XII.

   If any bishop out of Synod time shall have fallen under accusation, let
   his cause be heard by 12 bishops.

   Felix the bishop, said:  I suggest, according to the statutes of the
   ancient councils, that if any bishop (which may God forbid!) shall have
   fallen under any accusation, and there shall have been too great
   necessity to wait for the summoning of a majority of the bishops, that
   he may not rest under accusation, let his cause be heard by 12 bishops;
   and let a presbyter be heard by six bishops with his own bishop, and a
   deacon shall be heard by three.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   When a bishop is to be tried, if the whole synod does not sit, let at
   least twelve bishops take up the matter; and for the case of a
   presbyter, six and his own diocesan; and for the case of a deacon,
   three.

   This is Canon x. of the Synod of Genethlius.

   Johnson.

   Hereby must be meant African canons; that under Gratus [a.d. 348] had
   decreed the same thing.

   Who was the bishop's judge at the first instance does not appear by
   this canon; but it is natural to suppose it was the Primate.  It is
   probable that this canon is to be understood of hearing upon an appeal,
   because it is certain that a priest's cause, at the first instance, was
   to be tried before the bishop (see Can. 10, 11).  And therefore the
   latter part of the canon can be understood of no hearing but by way of
   appeal, nor by consequence the former.  And this seems more clear by
   Can. Afr. 29.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIII.

   That a bishop should not be ordained except by many bishops, but if
   there should be necessity he may be ordained by three.

   Bishop Aurelius said:  What says your holiness on this matter?  By all
   the bishops it was answered:  The decrees of the ancients must be
   observed by us, to wit, that without the consent of the Primate of any
   province even many bishops assembled together should not lightly
   presume to ordain a bishop.  But should there be a necessity, at his
   bidding, three bishops should ordain him in any place they happen to
   be, and if anyone contrary to his profession and subscription shall
   come into any place he shall thereby deprive himself of his honour.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   At the bidding of the Primate even three bishops can make a bishop.

   deprived of his honour by his own judgment.

   Canon XIV.

   That one of the bishops of Tripoli should come as legate, and that a
   presbyter might be heard there by five bishops.

   It also seemed good that one bishop from Tripoli, on account of the
   poverty of the province, should come as a legation, and that there a
   presbyter might be heard by five bishops, and a deacon by three, as has
   been noted above, his own bishop presiding.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   On account of the scarcity of bishops in Tripoli, one bishop shall
   suffice for a legation.

   This canon is made up of two parts.  The first part is Canon v. of the
   synod of Hippo, a.d. 393, and was repeated at the Carthaginian synod of
   397.  The second half is from Canon viij. of the same council.

   Johnson (See Canon 12).

   "Legate," i.e., to a Synod, there being few bishops in that province.

   Canon XV.

   Of the divers orders who serve the Church, that if any one fall into a
   criminal business and refused to be tried by the ecclesiastical court,
   he ought to be in danger therefor; and that the sons of bishops
   (sacerdotum) are not to attend worldly shows.

   Moreover it seemed good that if any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, who
   had a criminal charge brought against him or who had a civil cause,
   refused to be tried by the ecclesiastical tribunal, but wished to be
   judged by the secular courts, even if he won his suit, nevertheless he
   should lose his office.

   This is the law in a criminal suit; but in a civil suit he shall lose
   that for the recovery of which he instituted the proceedings, if he
   wishes to retain his office.

   This also seemed good, that if from some ecclesiastical judges an
   appeal was taken to other ecclesiastical judges who had a superior
   jurisdiction, this should in no way injure the reputation of those from
   whom the appeal was taken, unless it could be shown that they had given
   sentence moved by hatred or some other mental bias, or that they had
   been in some way corrupted.  But if by the consent of both parties
   judges had been chosen, even if they were fewer in number than is
   specified, no appeal can be taken.

   And [it seemed good] that the sons of bishops should not take part in
   nor witness secular spectacles.  For this has always been forbidden to
   all Christians, so let them abstain from them, that they may not go
   where cursing and blasphemy are to be found.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   A bishop or cleric who has a criminal suit brought against him, if he
   leaves the Church and betakes himself to secular judges even if he had
   been unjustly used, shall lose his rank.  And if he was successful in
   his political affairs, if he follows this, he shall lose his own
   grade.  No appeal can be taken from the ecclesiastical judges, except
   they be proved to have given their decision beforehand moved thereto by
   a bribe or by hatred.  No appeal can be taken from the decision of
   judges chosen by each side.

   This canon is made up of Canons ix., x., and xj. of the Council of
   Hippo, a.d. 393.

   Johnson.

   In this canon the African bishops made bold with the Civil Courts.  To
   lay such restraints on bishops and clergymen is, I am sure, very
   proper, to say no more.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XVI.

   That no bishop, presbyter or deacon should be a "conductor;" and that
   Readers should take wives; and that the clergy should abstain from
   usury; and at what age they or virgins should be consecrated.

   Likewise it seemed good that bishops, presbyters, and deacons should
   not be "conductors" or "procurators;" nor seek their food by any base
   and vile business, for they should remember how it is written, "No man
   fighting for God cumbereth himself with worldly affairs."

   Also it seemed good that Readers when they come to years of puberty,
   should be compelled either to take wives or else to profess continence.

   Likewise it seemed good that if a clergyman had lent money he should
   get it back again, but if kind (speciem) he should receive back the
   same kind as he gave.

   And that younger than twenty-five years deacons should not be ordained,
   nor virgins consecrated.

   And that readers should not salute the people.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of XVI.

   A bishop, presbyter, and deacon may not be a "conductor" or a
   "procurator."  A reader when he comes to puberty must contract marriage
   or profess continence.

   A cleric who has lent to someone, what he gave let him receive, or as
   much.

   Let not him be a deacon, who is made a deacon being under twenty-five.

   And let not readers salute the people.

   This canon is made up of Canons xv., xviij., and xxj., and added to
   these Canon j. of the same Second Series of the synod of Hippo, a.d.
   393.

   Canon XVII.

   That any province on account of its distance, may have its own Primate.

   It seemed good that Mauretania Sitiphensis, as it asked, should have a
   Primate of its own, with the consent of the Primate of Numidia from
   whose synod it had been separated. [424]   And with the consent of all
   the primates of the African Provinces and of all the bishops permission
   was given, by reason of the great distance between them.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.

   Mauretania Sitiphensis, on account of the great distance, is permitted
   to have its own Primate.

   This canon is Canon iij. of the first series of canons enacted at Hippo
   in 393.

   Canon XVIII.  (Gk. xviii.  The Latin caption is the canon of the
   Greek.)

   If any cleric is ordained he ought to be admonished to observe the
   constitutions.

   And that neither the Eucharist nor Baptism should be given to the
   bodies of the dead.

   And that every year in every province the Metropolitans come together
   in synod.

   (Gk. Canon xix.)

   It seemed good that before bishops, or clerics were ordained, the
   provisions of the canons should be brought to their notice, lest, they
   might afterwards repent of having through ignorance acted contrary to
   law.

   Ancient Epitome of Greek Canon XIX.

   The things which have been adopted by the synods should be made known
   to him who is to be ordained.

   (Gk. Canon xx.)

   It also seemed good that the Eucharist should not be given to the
   bodies of the dead.  For it is written:  "Take, Eat," but the bodies of
   the dead can neither "take" nor "eat."  Nor let the ignorance of the
   presbyters baptize those who are dead.

   Ancient Epitome of Greek Canon XX

   The Eucharist is not to be given to the body of one dead for it neither
   eats nor drinks.

   The ignorance of a presbyter shall not baptize a dead man.

   (Gk. Canon xxi.)

   And therefore in this holy synod should be confirmed in accordance with
   the Nicene decrees, on account of Ecclesiastical causes, which often
   are delayed to the injury of the people, that every year there should
   be a synod, to which all, who are primates of the provinces, should
   send bishops as legates, from their own synods, two or as many as they
   choose; so that when the synod meets it may have full power to act.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Greek Canon XXI.

   According to the decrees of the Nicene Fathers a yearly synod shall be
   assembled, and two legates or as many as they shall choose, shall be
   sent by the primates of every province.

   This is composed of Canons II., IV., and V. of the second series of
   enactments of Hippo, a.d. 393.

   Johnson.

   The 18th canon in the Edition of Tilius and Bishop Beveridge runs thus;
   viz. [If any clergyman be ordained he ought to be reminded to keep the
   canons; and that the Eucharist or Baptism be not given to dead corpses;
   and that the Metropolitans in every province meet in synod yearly.]
   They speak their own language, and call him a Metropolitan, whom the
   Africans called a Primate; but then they have also the entire 18th
   canon, as it here stands according to the Latin, which they divide into
   three, and number them 19, 20, 21.

   See Can. Nic. 5.  It seems very odd that they should allege the
   authority of the Nicene Synod upon this occasion; for that orders a
   synod twice a year, this but once; that intends a provincial synod,
   this a diocesan or national one.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XIX.  (Greek xxii.) [425]

   That if any bishop is accused the cause should be brought before the
   primate of his own province.

   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  Whatever bishop is accused the accuser
   shall bring the case before the primates of the province to which the
   accused belongs, and he shall not be suspended from communion by reason
   of the crime laid to his charge unless he fails to put in an appearance
   on the appointed day for arguing his cause before the chosen judges,
   having been duly summoned by the letters; that is, within the space of
   one month from the day in which he is found to have received the
   letters.  But should he be able to prove any true necessity which
   manifestly rendered it impossible for him to appear, he shall have the
   opportunity of arguing his case within another full month; but after
   the second month he shall not communicate until he is acquitted.

   But if he is not willing to come to the annual general council, so that
   his cause may there be terminated, he himself shall be judged to have
   pronounced the sentence of his own condemnation at the time in which he
   does not communicate, nor shall he communicate either in his own church
   or diocese.

   But his accuser, if he has not missed any of the days for pleading the
   cause, shall not be shut out from communion; but if he has missed some
   of them, withdrawing himself, then the bishop shall be restored to
   communion and the accuser shall be removed from communion; so,
   nevertheless, that the possibility of going on with the case be not
   taken from him, if he shall prove that his absence was caused by lack
   of power and not by lack of will.

   And this is enacted, that if the accuser turn out to be himself a
   criminal when the case against the bishop has come to argument, he
   shall not be allowed to testify unless he asserts that the causes are
   personal and not ecclesiastical.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.

   A bishop accused and haled to judgment shall have the space of two
   months; if there is any excuse [426] for his delay from the other
   side.  But after this he shall be excommunicated if he does not
   appear.  But if when the accused is present the accuser flees, then the
   accuser shall be deprived of communion.  But the accuser who is
   infamous shall not be an accuser at all.

   This canon is made up from Canons VI. and VII. of the last mentioned
   second series of the enactments of Hippo, 393.

   Canon XX.  (Greek xxiii.)

   Of accused presbyters or clerks.

   But if presbyters or deacons shall have been accused, there shall be
   joined together from the neighbouring places with the bishop of the
   diocese, the legitimate number of colleagues, whom the accused shall
   seek from the same; that is together with himself six in the case
   against a presbyter, in that against a deacon three.  They shall
   discuss the causes, and the same form shall be kept with regard to days
   and postponements and removals from communion, and in the discussion of
   persons between the accusers and the accused.

   But the causes of the rest of the clergy, the bishop of the place shall
   take cognizance of and determine alone.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.

   When a presbyter is accused, six of the neighbouring bishops together
   with the bishop of that region shall judge the matter.  But for a

   shall examine.

   Canon XXV.  (Greek xxviii.)

   Concerning bishops and the lower orders who wait upon the most holy
   mysteries.  It has seemed good that these abstain from their wives.

   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  We add, most dear brethren, moreover,
   since we have heard of the incontinency of certain clerics, even of
   readers, towards their wives, it seemed good that what had been enacted
   in divers councils should be confirmed, to wit, that subdeacons who
   wait upon the holy mysteries, and deacons, and presbyters, as well as
   bishops according to former statutes, [427] should contain from their
   wives, so that they should be as though they had them not and unless
   they so act, let them be removed from office.  But the rest of the
   clergy are not to be compelled to this, unless they be of mature age.
   And by the whole council it was said:  What your holiness has said is
   just, holy, and pleasing to God, and we confirm it.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXV.

   Those who handle holy things should abstain even from their own wives
   at the times of their ministration.

   This is founded upon Canon iv. of the Council of Carthage, which met
   September 13th, 401, but the provisions are more stringent here,
   subdeacons as well as deacons being constrained to continence.

   Johnson.

   "Times of ministration," so it is explained, Can. Trull., 13, where
   there were several African Bishops present, and allowed of that
   explication; yet Dion. Exig. is not clear, viz., Secundum propria
   statuta.

   By Can. Laod., 23.  Ministers, i.e., sub-deacons, are forbid to touch
   the Holy Vessels, yet here they are said to handle the Mysteries; I
   suppose they might handle the Holy Vessels, etc. before and after the
   celebration, but not during the solemnity; or else the customs of
   several ages and countries differed as to this particular.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [427] The Greek reads "kata tous idious horous," and so it was

   "priora."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXVI.  (Greek xxix.)

   That no one should take from the possessions of the Church. [428]

   Likewise it seemed good that no one should sell anything belonging to
   the Church:  that if there was no revenue, and other great necessity
   urged thereto, this might be brought before the Metropolitan of the
   province that he might deliberate with the appointed number of bishops
   whether this should be done:  that if such urgent necessity lay upon
   any church that it could not take counsel beforehand, at least let it
   call together the neighbouring bishops as witnesses, taking care to
   refer all the necessities of his church to the council:  and that if he
   shall not do this, he shall be held as responsible toward God, and as a
   seller in the eye of the council, and he shall have lost thereby his
   honour.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVI.

   Church goods must not be sold.  If they bring in no revenue they may be
   sold at the will of the bishops.  If the necessity does not allow that
   consultation should take place, he who sells shall call together the
   neighbouring bishops.  If he does not do so he shall be held
   responsible to God and to the Synod.

   It also was confirmed that if presbyters or deacons were convicted of
   any of the greater crimes on account of which it was necessary that
   they should be removed from the ministry, that hands should not be laid
   upon them as upon penitents, or as upon faithful layman, nor should it
   be permitted that they be baptized over again and then advanced to the
   clerical grade.

   Notes.

   A presbyter convicted and repenting, is not to be rebaptized as one to

   Canon XXVIII.  (Greek xxxi.)

   Presbyters, deacons, or clerics, who shall think good to carry appeals
   in their causes across the water shall not at all be admitted to
   communion. [430]

   It also seemed good that presbyters, deacons, and others of the
   inferior clergy in the causes which they had, if they were dissatisfied
   with the judgments of their bishops, let the neighbouring bishops with
   the consent of their own bishop hear them, and let the bishops who have
   been called in judge between them:  but if they think they have cause
   of appeal from these, they shall not betake themselves to judgments
   from beyond seas, but to the primates of their own provinces, or else
   to an universal council, as has also been decreed concerning bishops.
   But whoso shall think good to carry an appeal across the water shall be
   received to communion by no one within the boundaries of Africa.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVIII.

   Clerics who have been condemned, if they take exception to the
   judgment, shall not appeal beyond seas, but to the neighbouring
   bishops, and to their own; if they do otherwise let them be
   excommunicated in Africa.

   This canon is the same as Canon xvij. of the Synod of Carthage of 418,
   but it has some words with regard to appeals which that canon does not
   contain, viz.:  "Aut ad universale conciliam, sicut et de episcopis
   sæpe constitutum est."  This clause, affirming that bishops have often
   been forbidden to appeal across the water from the decisions of the
   African bishops, has caused great perplexity as no such decrees are
   extant.  The Ballerini, to avoid this difficulty, and possibly for
   other reasons, suggest an entirely different meaning to the passage,
   and suppose that it means that "bishops have often been allowed to
   appeal to the Universal Council and now this privilege is extended to
   priests." [431]   But this would seem to be a rather unnatural
   interpretation and Van Espen in his Commentary shews good reason for
   adopting the more evident view.

   Johnson.

   See Can. Afr., 19.

   Clearly the See of Rome is here aimed at, as if Carthage were the place
   designed by Providence to put a stop to the growth of power in
   Christian Rome, as well as heathen.  It is strange, that this canon
   should be received by the Church of Rome in former ages.

   Canon XXIX.  (Greek xxxii.)

   If anyone who is excommunicated shall receive communion before his
   cause is heard he brings damnation on himself. [432]

   Likewise it pleased the whole Council that he who shall have been
   excommunicated for any neglect, whether he be bishop, or any other
   cleric, and shall have presumed while still under sentence, and his
   cause not yet heard, to receive communion, he shall be considered by so
   doing to have given sentence against himself.

   Notes.

   One excommunicate who shall communicate before absolution sentences
   himself.

   This canon seems to be founded upon Canon iv. of Antioch.

   Johnson.

   See Can. Ap., 21 (29), Antioch, 4.

   By this canon the criminous bishop is supposed to be excommunicated
   before he comes to have his cause heard by a Synod, or by 12
   neighbouring bishops:  and it is therefore most rational to believe
   that he was thus censured by his Primate.  See Can. Afr., 12.

   Canon XXXI.  (Greek xxxiv.)

   If certain clerics advanced by their own bishops are supercilious, let

   It also seemed good that whoever of the clergy or of the deacons would
   not help the bishop in the necessities of the churches, when he wished
   to lift them to a higher position in his diocese, should no longer be
   allowed to exercise the functions of that grade from which they were
   not willing to be removed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXI.

   Who despises a greater honour shall lose what he hath.

   Johnson.

   It is most probable that this canon is to be understood of deacons
   designed by the bishop to be ordained priests, for the deacons, at
   least in some Churches, were provided of a better maintenance than
   priests; or it may be understood of inferior clergymen, who were
   permitted to marry in the degree they were now in, but would not
   willingly take the order of priest or deacon, because then they were
   prohibited marriage.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXXII.  (Greek xxxv.)

   If any poor cleric, no matter what his rank may be, shall acquire any
   property, it shall be subject to the power of the bishop. [434]

   It also seemed good that bishops, presbyters, deacons and any other of
   the clergy, who when they were ordained had no possessions, and in the
   time of their episcopate or after they became clerics, shall purchase
   in their own names lands or any other property, shall be held guilty of
   the crime of intrenching upon the Lord's goods, unless, when they are
   admonished to do so, they place the same at the disposal of the
   Church.  But should anything come to them personally by the liberality
   of anyone, or by succession from some relative, let them do what they
   will with it; if, however, they demand it back again, contrary to what
   they proposed, they shall be judged unworthy of ecclesiastical honour
   as back-sliders.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXII.

   Whoso after his ordination although he has nothing yet buys a field,
   shall give it to the Church, unless he got it by succession from a
   relation or by pure liberality.

   In this canon there is difficulty about the meaning of the phrase "quod
   eorum proposito congruat."  Hardouin suggests that "propositum" is the
   same as "profession," or "calling," and the meaning, were this the
   case, would be that he must employ it as befits his clerical calling.
   Van Espen follows Balsamon and Zonaras in understanding it to mean that
   if he has proposed to employ a part for the Church or for the poor, and
   changes his mind, he is to be deposed; and this meaning I have
   followed.

   Canon XXXIII.  (Greek xxxvi.)

   That presbyters should not sell the goods of the Church in which they
   are constituted; and that no bishop can rightly use anything the title
   to which vests in the ecclesiastical maternal centre (matrikos).

   It also seemed good that presbyters should not sell the ecclesiastical
   property where they are settled without their bishop's knowledge; and
   it is not lawful for bishops to sell the goods of the Church without
   the council or their presbyters being aware of it.  Nor should the
   bishop without necessity usurp the property of the maternal (matricis)
   Church [nor should a presbyter usurp the property of his own cure
   (tituli)]. [435]

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXIII.

   A presbyter is not to sell ecclesiastical property without the consent
   of the bishop.  A bishop is not to sell without the approbation of his
   synod a country property.

   Fuchs (Biblioth. der Kirchenvers., vol. iij., p. 5) thinks the text is
   corrupt in the last sentence and should be corrected by Canon x. of the
   Council of Carthage of 421, so as to read, "that which is left by will
   to a rural church in the diocese must not be applied to the Mother
   Church through the usurpation of the bishop."

   Johnson.

   "Or title."  So I turn the Lat. Titulus for want of a proper English
   word.  It denotes a lesser church in any city or diocese, served by a
   priest.

   bishop resides.

   Moreover at this Synod we read all the conciliar decrees of all the
   Province of Africa in the different synods held in the time of Bishop
   Aurelius. [436]

   Concerning the Synod which assembled in Hippo Regio.

   Under the most illustrious consuls, the most glorious Emperor
   Theodosius Augustus for the third time, and Abundantius, on the viij.
   Ides of October, at Hippo Regio, in the secretarium of the Church of
   Peace.  And the rest of the acts of this Synod have not been written
   down here because these constitutions are found set forth above.

   Of the Council of Carthage at which the proconsular bishops were
   appointed legates to the Council at Adrumetum.

   In the consulate of the most glorious emperors--Arcadius for the third
   time and Honorius for the second time, Augustuses, on the vi^th [437]
   day before the Calends of July, at Carthage.  In this council the
   proconsular bishops were chosen as legates to the Council of Adrumetum.

   Of a Council of Carthage at which many statutes were made.

   In the consulate of those most illustrious men, Cæsarius and Atticus,
   on the v^th day before the Calends of September in the secretarium of
   the restored basilica, when Aurelius the bishop, together with the
   bishops, had taken his seat, the deacons also standing by, and Victor
   the old man of Puppiana, Tutus of Migirpa and Evangel of Assuri.

   The Allocution of Aurelius the bishop of Carthage to the bishops.

   Aurelius, the bishop, said: [438]   After the day fixed for the
   council, as ye remember, most blessed brethren, we sat and waited for
   the legations of all the African provinces to assemble upon the day, as
   I have said, set by our missive; but when the letter of our Byzacene
   bishops had been read, that was read to your charity, which they had
   discussed with me who had anticipated the time and day of the council;
   also it was read by our brethren Honoratus and Urban, who are to-day
   present with us in this council, sent as the legation of the
   Sitifensine Province.  For our brother Reginus of the Vege [t]selitane
   [439] Church, [440] the letters sent to my littleness by Crescentian
   and Aurelius, our fellow-bishops, of the first sees of the [two]
   Numidias, in which writings your charity will see with me how they
   promised that either they themselves would be good enough to come or
   else that they would send legates according to custom to this council;
   but this it seems they did not do at all, the legates of Mauritania
   Sitifensis, who had come so great a distance gave notice that they
   could stay no longer; and, therefore, brethren, if it seem good to your
   charity, let the letters of our Byzacene brethren, as also the
   breviary, which they joined to the same letter, be read to this
   assembly, so that if by any chance they are not entirely satisfactory
   to your charity, such things in the breviary may be changed for the
   better after diligent examination.  For this very thing our brother and
   fellow-bishop of the primatial see, a man justly conspicuous for his
   gravity and prudence, Mizonius, demanded in a letter he addressed to my
   littleness.  If therefore it meets with your approval, let there be
   read the things which have been adopted and let each by itself be
   considered by your charity.

   It is not lawful to offer anything in the Holy Mysteries except bread
   and wine mixed with water.

   In the sacraments of the body and blood of the Lord nothing else shall
   be offered than that which the Lord himself ordained, that is to say,
   bread and wine mixed with water.  But let the first-fruits, whether
   honey or milk, be offered on that one most solemn day, as is wont, in
   the mystery of the infants.  For although they are offered on the
   altar, let them have nevertheless their own benediction, that they may
   be distinguished from the sacraments of the Lord's body and blood;
   neither let there be offered as first-fruits anything other than grapes
   and corns.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXVII.

   Let bread and wine mixed with water only be offered.

   The text of the Greek here does not exactly agree with the Latin.  The
   Greek reads as follows:  "That in the Holy Mysteries nothing else be
   offered than the body and blood of the Lord, even as the Lord himself
   delivered, that is bread and wine mixed with water."

   Further down with regard to the first-fruits I have followed the Greek
   text which seems decidedly preferable, in fact the Latin is so corrupt

   Johnson.

   From this canon and the 29th of Trullo, it is evident that by the
   Lord's Supper, the ancients understood the supper going before the
   Eucharist, and not the Eucharist itself, and that on Maunday-Thursday
   [442] yearly, before the Eucharist, they had such a public
   entertainment in imitation of our Saviour's last Paschal Supper.  I
   refer it to the consideration of the learned reader, whether St. Paul,
   by the Deipnon kuriakon, 1 Cor. xi. 20, does not mean this
   entertainment.  For the obvious translation of that verse is, "It is
   not your [duty or business] when you meet together [in the church] to
   eat the Lord's Supper."  He would not have them to eat this supper in
   the public assembly:  "For" (says he) "have ye not houses to eat and
   drink in, or despise ye the Church of God?"  From the 4th age forward,
   the Eucharist was sometimes called the Lord's Supper; but from the
   beginning it was not so.  And even after it did sometimes pass by this
   name, yet at other times this name was strictly used for the previous
   entertainment, as may be seen by this canon, which was made in the 4th
   century.  Further it seems probable, that the Lord's Supper and the
   Love-feast was the same, though it was not usually called the Lord's
   Supper; but only (perhaps) that love-feast, which was made on the day
   of the institution of the Eucharist, which we now call Maundy-Thursday.

   Canon XLVII.  (Greek li.)

   Concerning [the Donatists and [447] ] the children baptized by the
   Donatists.

   Concerning the Donatists [448] it seemed good that we should hold
   counsel with our brethren and fellow priests Siricius and Simplician
   concerning those infants alone who are baptized by Donatists: [449]
   lest what they did not do of their own will, when they should be
   converted to the Church of God with a salutary determination, the error
   of their parents might prevent their promotion to the ministry of the
   holy altar.

   But when these things had been begun, Honoratus and Urbanus, bishops of
   Mauritania Sitifensis, said:  When some time ago we were sent to your
   holiness, we laid aside what things had been written on this account,
   that we might wait for the arrival of our brethren the legates from
   Numidia.  But because not a few days have passed in which they have
   been looked for and as yet they are not arrived, it is not fitting that
   we should delay any longer the commands we received from our
   brother-bishops; and therefore, brethren, receive our story with
   alacrity of mind.  We have heard concerning the faith of the Nicene
   tractate:  True it is that sacrifices are to be forbidden after
   breakfast, so that they may be offered as is right by those who are
   fasting, and this has been confirmed then and now.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVII.

   When those in infancy baptized by Donatists are converted, this shall
   be no impediment to them.  And the Holy Mysteries, as is right, are to
   be celebrated only by them fasting.

   and from Canon j. of the Synod of Carthage of August 28th, a.d. 397.

   Johnson.

   The pretence that the Donatists had for making a schism was, that
   Cæcilian, Bishop of Carthage, had, in the time of persecution, been a
   Traditor, i.e., given up the Bible to the heathen inquisitors; this was
   denied by the Orthodox, who charged them with the same crime in effect,
   viz. of being too favourable to the Traditors, and those that had
   lapsed.  They likewise are charged with Arianism.

   I have omitted what is here mentioned concerning the Council of Nice;
   because I do not find that any one has been able to penetrate into the
   meaning of the Fathers as to that particular.

   Canon XLVIII.  (Greek lii.)

   Of rebaptisms, reordinations, and translations of bishops.

   But we suggest that we decree what was set forth by the wisdom of the
   plenary synod at Capua, that no rebaptisings, nor reordinations should
   take place, and that bishops should not be translated.  For Cresconius,
   bishop of Villa Regis, left his own people and invaded the Church of
   Tubinia and having been admonished down to this very day, to leave,
   according to the decree, the diocese he had invaded, he treated the
   admonition with disdain.  We have heard that the sentence pronounced
   against him has been confirmed; but we seek, according to our decree,
   that ye deign to grant that being driven thereto by necessity, it be
   free to us to address the rector of the province against him, according
   to the statutes of the most glorious princes, so that whoever is not
   willing to acquiesce in the mild admonition of your holiness and to
   amend his lawlessness, shall be immediately cast out by judicial
   authority.  Aurelius the bishop said:  By the observance of the
   constituted form, let him not be judged to be a member of the synod, if
   he has been asked by you, dear brethren, to depart and has refused:
   for out of his own contempt and contumacy he has fallen to the power of
   the secular magistrate. [450]   Honoratus and Urban the bishops said:
   This pleases us all, does it not?  And all the bishops answered:  It is
   just, it pleases us.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVIII.

   Let there be no rebaptisms, nor reordinations nor translations of
   bishops.  Therefore let Cresconius be forbidden by judicial authority,
   for he has left his own people, and has taken possession of the diocese
   of Ceneum, although ecclesiastically admonished that he was not to
   change.

   This canon is Canon j., of the Synod of Carthage of August 28th. a.d.
   397.  The acts of this synod were first accurately edited by the
   Ballerini (in their edition of the works of St. Leo) and were printed
   by Mansi, in an amended form, in his Concilia.

   Canon XLIX.  (Greek liii.)

   How many bishops there should be to ordain a bishop.

   Honoratus and Urban, the bishops, said:  We have issued this command,
   that (because lately two of our brethren, bishops of Numidia, presumed
   to ordain a pontiff,) only by the concurrence of twelve bishops the
   ordination of bishops be celebrated.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  The
   ancient form shall be preserved, that not less than three suffice who
   shall have been designated for ordaining the bishop.  Moreover, because
   in Tripoli, and in Arzug the barbarians are so near, for it is asserted
   that in Tripoli there are but five bishops, and out of that number two
   may be occupied by some necessity; but it is difficult that all of the
   number should come together at any place whatever; ought this
   circumstance to be an impediment to the doing of what is of utility to
   the Church?  For in this Church, to which your holiness has deigned to
   assemble [451] we frequently have ordinations and nearly every Lord's
   day; could I frequently summon twelve, or ten, or about that number of
   bishops?  But it is an easy thing for me to join a couple of neighbours
   to my littleness.  Wherefore your charity will agree with me that this
   cannot be observed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIX.

   Fewer than three bishops do not suffice for the ordination of a bishop.

   This is Canon ij., of the Synod of Carthage, August 28th, 397.

   Johnson.

   See Can. 13.

   The occasion of this canon was a complaint that two bishops in Numidia
   had presumed to ordain a third; upon which it was proposed that not
   less than twelve should perform this office:  But Aurelius, Bishop of
   Carthage, desires that the old form might be observed, and three
   bishops be sufficient; especially, because in Tripoli, where there were
   but five bishops in all, it would be hard to get more than three
   together.  And he adds, that though it were no hard matter for him to
   get two bishops to assist him in his ordinations at Carthage, yet it
   would not be practicable for him to get twelve:  "For," says he, "we
   have frequently, and almost every Sunday, men to be ordained."  He must
   mean bishops for otherwise it had been nothing to his purpose, because
   he could ordain priests or deacons by himself, without the assistance
   of other bishops:  and yet it is very strange, that ordinations of
   bishops should be so frequent as to bear that expression of "almost
   every Sunday."  There were indeed above one hundred bishoprics in his
   Province; but these could not occasion above six or eight ordinations
   in a year; but it is probable that the privilege belonging to him, Can.
   55, brought very many ordinations to the church of Carthage; for it is
   evident, there was a great scarcity of men fit for the Episcopal office
   in Africa.  It is further evident from this canon, that bishops were
   not ordained in the church of their own see, but in that of the
   Primate.  See Can. Ant., 19.

   But this should be decreed, that when we shall have met together to
   choose a bishop, if any opposition shall arise, because such things
   have been treated by us, the three shall not presume to purge [452] him
   who was to be ordained, but one or two more shall be asked to be added
   to the aforesaid number, and the persons of those objecting shall first
   be discussed in the same place (plebe) for which he was to be
   ordained.  And last of all the objections shall be considered; and only
   after he has been cleared in the public sight shall he at last be
   ordained.  If this agrees with the mind of your holiness, let it be
   confirmed by the answer of your worthiness.  All the bishops said, We
   are well pleased.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon L.

   If any controversy arise concerning a bishop who has been elected by
   three bishops, let two others be coöpted, and so let there be an
   examination made of his affairs; and if it shall appear that he is
   pure, let him be ordained.

   This canon is Canon iij., of the Synod of Carthage, Aug. 28th, 397.

   Johnson.

   Here the bishops meet to choose a new one, and it is evident by the
   foregoing canon, that they met not in the vacant church, but in that of
   the Primate; and that therefore not the people, but the bishops had the
   chief share in the election.  The people might make their objections,
   which supposes they knew who their intended bishop was; but the bishops
   were the judges of the cause.  And it seems probable, that if there
   were any dispute, some of the bishops went to the vacant church to hear
   the allegations against the person that was elected, or proposed.

   Canon LI.  (Greek lv.)

   That the date of Easter is to be announced by the Church of Carthage.

   Honoratus and Urban, the bishops, said:  Since all things treated by
   our commonitory are known, [453] we add also what has been ordered
   concerning the day of Easter, that we be informed of the date always by
   the Church of Carthage, as has been accustomed and that no short time
   before.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  If it seems good to your
   holiness, since we remember that we pledged ourselves sometime ago that
   every year we would come together for discussion, when we assemble,
   then let the date of the holy Easter be announced through the legates
   present at the Council.  Honoratus and Urban, the bishops, said:  Now
   we seek of the present assembly that ye deign to inform our province of
   that day by letters.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  It is necessary it
   should be so.

   Canon LII.  (Greek lvi.)

   Of visiting provinces.

   Honoratus and Urban, the bishops, said:  This was commanded to us in
   word, that because it had been decreed in the Council of Hippo that
   each province should be visited in the time of the council, that ye
   also deign that this year or next, according to the order ye have drawn
   up, you should visit the province of Mauritania.

   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  Of the province of Mauritania because it
   is situated in the confines of Africa, we have made no decree, for they
   are neighbours of the barbarians; but God grant (not however that I
   make any rash promise of doing so), we may be able to come to your
   province.  For ye should consider, brethren, that this same thing our
   brethren of Tripoli and of the Arzuges region [454] could demand also,
   if occasion offered.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LII.

   As the Synod at Hippo decreed, every province should be visited in an
   annual Synod.

   August 28th, a.d. 397.

   Johnson.

   The manner of visiting provinces, and that annually; and the persons by
   whom this visitation was performed, can scarce now be discovered; only
   it appears, by the words of Aurelius, that the Bishop of Carthage was
   one, if not the only visitor; but it was impossible that he could visit
   all the provinces in Africa personally every year, he must use
   delegates.

   Orosius that the same province was called Tripolitana and Regio
   Arzugum, and that Arzuges was a race name of wider application.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LIII.  (Greek lvii.)

   That dioceses should not receive a bishop except by the consent of its
   own bishop.

   Epigonius, the bishop, said:  In many councils it has been decreed by
   the sacerdotal assembly that such communities as are contained in other
   dioceses and ruled by their bishops, and which never had any bishops of
   their own, should not receive rulers, that is bishops, for themselves
   except with the consent of the bishop under whose jurisdiction they
   have been.  But because some who have attained a certain domination
   abhor the communion of the brethren, or at least, having become
   depraved, claim for themselves domination with what is really tyranny,
   for the most part tumid and stolid presbyters, who lift up their heads
   against their own bishops or else win the people to themselves by
   feasting them or by malignant persuasion, that they may by unlawful
   favour wish to place themselves as rulers over them; we indeed hold
   fast that glorious desire of your mind, most pious brother Aurelius,
   for thou hast often opposed these things, paying no heed to such
   petitioners; but on account of their evil thoughts and basely conceived
   designs this I say, that such a community, which has always been
   subject in a diocese, ought not to receive a rector, nor should it ever
   have a bishop of its own.  Therefore if this which I have proposed
   seems good to the whole most holy council, let it be confirmed.

   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  I am not in opposition to the proposition
   of our brother and fellow bishop:  but I confess that this has been and
   shall be my practice concerning those who were truly of one mind, not
   only with regard to the Church of Carthage, but concerning every
   sacerdotal assemblage.  For there are many who, as has been said,
   conspire with the people whom they deceive, tickling their ears and
   blandly seducing them, men of vicious lives, or at least puffed up and
   separated from this meeting, who think to watch over their own people,
   and never come to our council for fear that their wickedness should be
   discussed.  I say, if it seems good, that not only should these not
   keep their dioceses, but that every effort should be made to have them
   expelled by public authority from that church of theirs which has
   evilly favoured them, and that they be removed even from the chief
   sees.  For it is right that he who cleaves to all the brethren and the
   whole council, should possess with full right not only his church but
   also the dioceses.  But they who think that the people suffice them and
   spurn the love of the brethren, shall not only lose their dioceses, but
   (as I have said,) they shall be deprived by public authority of their
   own cures as rebels.  Honoratus and Urban, the bishops, said:  The
   lofty provision of your holiness obtains the adherence of the minds of
   all of us, and I think that by the answer of all what you have deigned
   to propose will be confirmed.  All the bishops said:  Placet, placet.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LIII.

   Whoso shall neglect his call to a synod, and shall despise the charity
   of his brethren, putting his trust in the multitude who are with him,
   let him be deprived of them by the imperial authority.

   This canon is Canon v. of the Synod of Carthage of August 28th, a.d.
   397, beginning with the second clause.

   Johnson.

   It is very evident that a diocese here signifies some town or village
   lying remote from the Bishop's City, but belonging to his jurisdiction;
   and is to be understood to be a place distinct from the bishop's church
   or cathedral.

   Canon LIV.  (Greek lviii.)

   That a strange cleric is under no circumstances to be received by
   another.

   Epigonius, the bishop, said:  This has been decreed in many councils,
   also just now it has been confirmed by your prudence, most blessed
   brethren, that no bishop should receive a strange cleric into his
   diocese without the consent of the bishop to whose jurisdiction the
   cleric belongs.  But I say that Julian, who is ungrateful for the
   layouts bestowed upon him by God through my littleness, is so rash and
   audacious, that a certain man who was baptized by me, when he was a
   most needy boy, commended to me by the same, and when for many years he
   had been fed and reared by me, it is certain that this one, as I have
   said, was baptized in my church, by my own unworthy hands; this same
   man began to exercise the office of reader in the Mappalien diocese,
   and read there for nearly two years, with a most incomprehensible
   contempt of my littleness, the aforenamed Julian took this man, whom he
   declared to be a citizen of his own city Vazarita, and without
   consulting me ordained him deacon.  If, most blessed brethren, that is
   permissible, let it be declared to us; but if not, let such an impudent
   one be restrained that he may in no way mix himself in someone's
   communion.

   Numidius, the bishop, said:  If, as it seems, Julian did this without
   your worthiness being asked for his consent, nor even consulted, we all
   judge that this was done iniquitously and unworthily.  Wherefore unless
   Julian shall correct his error, and shall return the cleric to your
   people with proper satisfaction, since what he did was contrary to the
   decrees of the council, let him be condemned and separated from us on
   account of his contumacy.  Epigonius, the bishop, said:  Our father in
   age, and most ancient by his promotion, that laudable man, our brother
   and colleague Victor wishes that this petition should be made general
   to all.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LIV.

   Since Julian has ordained a reader of Epigonius's to the diaconate,
   unless he shall shew authority received from him to do so, he shall
   increase the penalty of his contumacy.

   397.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LV.  (Greek lix.)

   That it be lawful for the bishop of Carthage to ordain a cleric
   whenever he wishes.

   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  My brethren, pray allow me to speak.  It
   often happens that ecclesiastics who are in need seek deacons
   [præpositis in the Latin], or presbyters or bishops from me:  and I,
   bearing in mind what things have been ordained these I observe, to wit,
   I summon the bishop of the cleric who is sought for, and I shew him the
   state of affairs, how that they of a certain church ask for a certain
   one of his clergy.  Perchance then they make no objection, but lest it
   happen that afterwards they might object when in this case they shall
   have been demanded (postulati) by me, who (as you know) have the care
   of many churches and of the ordinands.  It is right therefore that I
   should summon a fellow bishop with two or three witnesses from our
   number.  But if he be found indevotus [akathosiotos], what does your
   charity think should be done?  For I, as ye know, brethren, by the
   condescension of God have the care of all the churches.

   Numidius, the bishop, said: [455]   This see always had the power of
   ordaining a bishop according to the desire of each Church as he wills
   and on whose name there was agreement (fuisset conventus).  Epigonius,
   the bishop, said:  Your good nature makes small use of your powers, for
   you make much less use of them than you might, since, my brother, you
   are good and gentle to all; for you have the power, but it is far from
   your practice to satisfy the person of each bishop in prima tantummodo
   conventione.  But if it should be thought that the rights of this see
   ought to be vindicated, you have the duty of supporting all the
   churches, wherefore we do not give thee power, but we confirm that
   power thou hast, viz.:  that thou hast the right at thy will always to
   choose whom thou wilt, to constitute [456] prelates over peoples and
   churches who shall have asked thee to do so, and when thou so
   desirest.  Posthumianus, the bishop, said:  Would it be right that he
   who had only one presbyter should have that one taken away from him?
   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  But there may be one bishop by whom many
   presbyters can be made through the divine goodness, but one fit to be
   made bishop is found with difficulty.  Wherefore if any bishop has a
   presbyter necessary for the episcopate and has one only, my brother, as
   you have said, even that one he ought to give up for promotion.
   Posthumianus, the bishop, said:  If some other bishop has plenty of
   clergy, should that other diocese come to my help?  Aurelius, the
   bishop, said:  Of course, when you have come to the help of another
   Church, he who has many clerics should be persuaded to make one over to
   you for ordination.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LV.

   It is lawful for the bishop of Carthage, whenever he wills, to choose
   those who are to be set over the churches:  even if there were only one
   presbyter worth of rule.  For one bishop can ordain many presbyters,
   but one fit for the episcopate is hard to find.

   This canon is the first half of Canon vij. of the Council of Carthage
   held August 28th a.d. 397.

   Johnson.

   It is evident, that this privilege of the Bishop of Carthage extended
   to the whole African diocese or the six provinces of Africa, which
   contained near five hundred bishoprics.  This was what caused such
   frequent ordinations of bishops in the Church of Carthage (See Can.
   Afr. 49, and the Note).  And it is further apparent, that the Bishop of
   Carthage had some power over the whole African church, and was probably
   their visitor (See Can. 52).  But that he had the sole power of
   ordaining bishops for every church, with the assistance of any two
   bishops, does not appear, though Justellus is of this opinion; nay, the
   49th canon proves that he had it not.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [455] The meaning of this whole canon is very obscure, the text is
   almost certainly corrupt; and the Greek in many places in no way
   corresponds to the Latin.

   [456] Migne's text reads this negatively "ut non constituas," but I
   have followed Labbe and Cossart and have omitted the "non."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LVI.  (Greek lx.)

   That bishops who were ordained for dioceses shall not choose for
   themselves dioceses [in the Greek provinces].

   Honoratus and Urban, the bishops, said:  We have heard that it has been
   decreed that dioceses should not be deemed fit to receive bishops,
   unless with the consent of their founder:  but in our province since
   some have been ordained bishops in the diocese, by the consent of that
   bishop by whose power they were established, have even seized dioceses
   for themselves, this should be corrected by the judgment of your
   charity, and prohibited for the future.  Epigonius, the bishop, said:
   To every bishop should be reserved what is right, so that from the mass
   of dioceses no part should be snatched away, so as to have its own
   bishop, without consent from the proper authority.  For it shall
   suffice, if the consent be given, that the diocese thus set apart have
   its own bishop only, and let him [457] not seize other dioceses, for
   only the one cut off from the many merited the honour of receiving a
   bishop.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  I do not doubt that it is
   pleasing to the charity of you all, that he who was ordained for a
   diocese by the consent of the bishop who held the mother see, should
   retain only the people for whom he was ordained.  Since therefore I
   think that everything has been treated of, if all things are agreeable
   to your mind, pray confirm them all by your suffrage.  All the bishops
   said:  We all are well pleased, and we have confirmed them with our
   subscription.  And they signed their names.

   I, Aurelius, bishop of the Church of Carthage, have consented to this
   decree, and have subscribed what has been read.  So too did all the
   other bishops in like fashion sign.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LVI.

   If any diocese has received consent to have a bishop of its own from
   him who has the right, that one shall not invade the rest of the
   dioceses.

   This is the last part of Canon vij. of the Synod of Carthage, August
   28, a.d. 397.

   Johnson.

   It had scarce been worth while to give so much of this canon in English
   if I had not thought it proper, in order to confirm the sense of the
   word diocese, mentioned in note on Can. 53, viz., a town or village,
   where there is a church subject to the bishop of the city.

   Between this canon and the following, there is a reference to a former
   council at Carthage forbidding bishops to sail, without a formal letter
   from the Primate; and this said to be done when Cæsarius and Atticus
   were consuls, anno æræ vulg. 397, and there is mention of an embassy of
   two bishops from a council of Carthage to the Emperors, to procure the
   privilege of sanctuary to all impeached for any crime, if they fled to
   the Church.  This is said to be done when Honorius and Eutychianus were
   consuls, anno æræ vulg. 398.  And further, here is an account of a
   bishop sent legate to Anastasius, Bishop of the Apostolical see, and
   Venerius of Milan, to supply the African Church with men fit to be
   ordained.  For Aurelius complains that many Churches have not so much
   as one man, not so much as an illiterate one, in deacon's orders, much
   less had they a competent number of men for the superior dignities.  He
   speaks of the importunate clamours of many people, that were themselves
   almost killed, I suppose, by some common pestilence.

   In this council it was decreed that bishops should not travel by sea
   without formed letters.

   During the consulate of those illustrious men, Cæsar and Atticus, on
   the sixth before the Calends of July, at Carthage, it seemed good that
   no bishop should travel by water without "formed letters" from the
   Primate.  The authentic acts will be found by him who seeks them.

   In this council, bishops whose names are set down hereafter were sent
   as legates to the Emperor.

   After the consulate of the most glorious Emperor Honorius Augustus for
   the fourth time, and of the renowned Eutychian, on the fifth of the
   calends of May, at Carthage in the secretarium of the restored
   basilica.  In this council Epigonius and Vincent, the bishops, received
   a legation, in order that they might obtain a law from the most
   glorious princes in behalf of those taking refuge in the Church,
   whatever might be the crime of which they were accused, that no one
   should dare to force them away.

   In this council a legation was sent to the Bishops of Rome and Milan
   with regard to children baptized by heretics, and to the Emperor with
   regard to having such idols as still remained taken away, and also with
   regard to many other matters.

   After the consulate of the renowned Flabius Stilico, on the sixteenth
   of the calends of July, at Carthage in the secretarium of the restored
   basilica.

   When Aurelius, the Bishop, together with his fellow-bishops had taken
   their seats, the deacons standing by, Aurelius, the Bishop, said:  Your
   charity, most holy brethren, knows fully as well as I do the
   necessities of the churches of God throughout Africa.  And since the
   Lord has vouchsafed that from a part of your holy company this present
   assembly should be convened, it seems to me that these necessities
   which in the discharge of our solicitude we have discovered, we ought
   to consider together.  And afterwards, that there should be chosen a
   bishop from our number who may, with the help of the Lord and your
   prayers, assume the burden of these necessities, and zealously
   accomplish whatever ought to be done in the premises, going to the
   parts of Italy across seas, that he may acquaint our holy brethren and
   fellow-bishops, the venerable and holy brother Anastasius, bishop of
   the Apostolic see, and also our holy brother Venerius the Bishop of
   Milan, with our necessity and grief, and helplessness.  For there has
   been withheld from these sees the knowledge of what was necessary to
   provide against the common peril, especially that the need of clergy is
   so great that many churches are in such destitution as that not so much
   as a single deacon or even an unlettered clerk is to be found.  I say
   nothing of the superior orders and offices, because if, as I have said,
   the ministry of a deacon is not easily to be had, it is certainly much
   more difficult to find one of the superior orders.  [And let them also
   tell these bishops] that we can no longer bear to hear the daily
   lamentations of the different peoples almost ready to die, and unless
   we do our best to help them, the grievous and inexcusable cause of the
   destruction of innumerable souls will be laid at our door before God.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LVII.  (Greek lxi.)

   That persons baptized when children by the Donatists may be ordained
   clergymen in the Catholic Church.

   Since in the former council it was decreed, as your unanimity remembers
   as well as I do, that those who as children were baptized by the
   Donatists, and not yet being able to know the pernicious character of
   their error, and afterward when they had come to the use of reason, had
   received the knowledge of the truth, abhorred their former error, and
   were received, (in accordance with the ancient order) by the imposition
   of the hand, into the Catholic Church of God spread throughout the
   world, that to such the remembrance of the error ought to be no
   impediment to the reception of the clerical office.  For in coming to
   faith they thought the true Church to be their own and there they
   believed in Christ, and received the sacraments of the Trinity.  And
   that all these sacraments are altogether true and holy and divine is
   most certain, and in them the whole hope of the soul is placed,
   although the presumptuous audacity of heretics, taking to itself the
   name of the truth, dares to administer them.  They are but one after
   all, as the blessed Apostle tells us, saying:  "One God, one faith, one
   baptism," and it is not lawful to reiterate what once only ought to be
   administered.  [Those therefore who have been so baptized] having
   anathematized their error may be received by the imposition of the hand
   into the one Church, the pillar as it is called, and the one mother of
   all Christians, where all these Sacraments are received unto salvation
   and everlasting life; even the same sacraments which obtain for those
   persevering in heresy the heavy penalty of damnation.  So that which to
   those who are in the truth lighteneth to the obtaining of eternal life,
   the same to them who are in error tends but to darkness and damnation.
   With regard then to those who, having fled from error, acknowledge the
   breasts of their mother the Catholic Church, who believe and receive
   all these holy mysteries with the love of the truth, and besides the
   Sacraments have the testimony of a good life, there is no one who would
   not grant that without doubt such persons may be raised to the clerical
   office, especially in such necessity as the present.  But there are
   others of this sect, who being already clergymen, desire to pass to us
   with their peoples and also with their honours, such as for the sake of
   office are converts to life, and that they may retain them seek for
   salvation [i.e., enter the Church].  I think that the question
   concerning such may be left to the graver consideration of our
   aforesaid brothers, and that when they have considered by their more
   prudent counsel the matter referred to them, they may vouchsafe to
   advise us what approves itself to them with regard to this question.
   Only concerning those who as children were baptized by heretics we
   decree that they consent, if it seems good, to our decision concerning
   the ordination of the same.  All things, therefore, which we have set
   forth above with the holy bishops, let your honourable fraternity with
   me adjudge to be done.

   Canon LX.  (Greek lxiii.)

   Of heathen feasts.

   This also must be sought, that (since contrary to the divine precepts
   feasts are held in many places, which have been induced by the heathen
   error, so that now Christians are forced to celebrate these by
   heathens, from which state of things it happens that in the times of
   the Christian Emperors a new persecution seems to have secretly
   arisen:)  they order such things to be forbidden and prohibit them from
   cities and possessions under pain of punishment; especially should this
   be done since they do not fear to commit such iniquities in some cities
   even upon the natal days of most blessed martyrs, and in the very
   sacred places themselves.  For upon these days, shame to say, they
   perform the most wicked leapings throughout the fields and open places,
   so that matronal honour and the modesty of innumerable women who have
   come out of devotion for the most holy day are assaulted by lascivious
   injuries, so that all approach to holy religion itself is almost fled
   from.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LX.

   The Greek feasts must cease to be kept, because of their impropriety,
   and because they seduce many Christians, moreover they are celebrated
   on the commemorations of the martyrs.

   Canon LXI.  (Greek lxiv.)

   Of spectacles, that they be not celebrated on Lord's days nor on the
   festivals of the Saints.

   Furthermore, it must be sought that theatrical spectacles and the
   exhibition of other plays be removed from the Lord's day and the other
   most sacred days of the Christian religion, especially because on the
   octave day of the holy Easter [i.e., Low Sunday] the people assemble
   rather at the circus than at church, and they should be transferred to
   some other day when they happen to fall upon a day of devotion, nor
   shall any Christian be compelled to witness these spectacles, [460]
   especially because in the performance of things contrary to the
   precepts of God there should be no persecution made by anyone, but (as
   is right) a man should exercise the free will given him by God.
   Especially also should be considered the peril of the cooperators who,
   contrary to the precepts of God, are forced by great fear to attend the
   shews.

   Concerning the publishing of manumissions in church, if our fellow

   of our confidence to follow their order [of proceedings], full power
   being given to the legate we send, that whatever he can accomplish
   worthy of the faith, for the state of the Church and the salvation of
   souls, we shall laudably accept in the sight of the Lord.  All which
   things, if they please your sanctity, pray set forth, that I may be
   assured that my suggestion has been ratified by you and that their

   It is certain, that in Italy, and some other parts of the Empire,

   Canon LXV.  (Greek lxviii.)

   Concerning the condemned bishop Equitius.

   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  I do not think that the case of Equitius
   should be passed over in the legation, who some time ago for his crimes
   was condemned by an Episcopal sentence; that if by any chance our
   legate should meet him in those parts, our brother should take care for
   the state of the Church, as opportunity offered or where he could, to
   act against him.  And all the bishops said:  This prosecution is
   exceedingly agreeable to us, especially as Equitius was condemned some
   time ago, his impudent unrest ought to be repelled everywhere more and
   more for the good estate and health of the Church.  And they
   subscribed, I, Aurelius, the bishop of the Church of Carthage, have
   consented to this decree, and after having read it have signed my
   name.  Likewise also signed all the other bishops.

   Notes.

   Equitius, who had been condemned by the judgment of the bishops, and

   In this council the letters of Anastasius the Roman Pontiff were read,
   admonishing the Catholic bishops concerning the Donatists.

   In the consulship of those most illustrious men Vencentius and Flavius,
   on the Ides of September, at Carthage, in the secretarium of the
   restored basilica.  When we had been gathered together in council in
   the church at Carthage and had taken our seats, bishops from all the
   African Provinces, that is to say, Aurelius, the bishop of that see
   with his colleagues (just who they were is made evident by their
   signatures) [the same bishop Aurelius said]:  When the letters of our
   most blessed brother and fellow priest, Anastasius, bishop of the
   Church of Rome, had been read, in which he exhorted us out of the
   solicitude and sincerity of his paternal and brotherly love, that we
   should in no way dissimulate with regard to the wiles and wickednesses
   of the Donatist heretics and schismatics, by which they gravely vex the
   Catholic Church of Africa, we thank our Lord that he hath vouchsafed to
   inspire that best and holy archbishop with such a pious care for the
   members of Christ, although in divers lands, yet builded together into
   the one body of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXVI.  (Greek lxix.)

   That the Donatists are to be treated leniently.

   Then when all things had been considered and treated of which seem to
   conduce to the advantage of the church, the Spirit of God suggesting
   and admonishing us, we determined to act leniently and pacifically with
   the before-mentioned men, although they were cut off from the unity of
   the Lord's body by an unruly dissent, so that (as much as in us lies)
   to all those who have been caught in the net of their communion and
   society, it might be known throughout all the provinces of Africa, how
   they have been overcome by miserable error, holding different opinions,
   "that perchance," as the Apostle says, when we have corrected [461]
   them with gentleness, "God should grant them repentance for the
   acknowledging of the truth, and that they might be snatched out of the
   snares of the devil, who are led captive of him at his will."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVI.

   It seemed good that the Donatists should be treated kindly and with
   leniency, even if they should separate themselves from the Church, so
   that perchance through their respect for our great gentleness they may
   be loosed from their captivity.

   The introduction refers to the Synod of Carthage of September 13, 401,

   Of the letters to be sent to the judges, that they may take note of the
   things done between the Donatists and the Maximianists.

   Therefore it seemed good that letters should be given from our council
   to the African judges, from whom it would seem suitable that this
   should be sought, that in this matter they would aid the common mother,
   the Catholic Church, that the episcopal authority may be fortified
   [462] in the cities; that is to say that by their judicial power and
   with diligence out of their Christian faith, they enquire and record in
   the public acts, that all may have a firm notion of it, what has taken
   place in all those places in which the Maximianists, who made a schism
   from them, have obtained basilicas.

   Canon LXVIII.  (Greek lxxi.)

   That the Donatist clergy are to be received into the Catholic Church as
   clergymen.

   It moreover seemed good that letters be sent to our brethren and
   fellow-bishops, and especially to the Apostolic See, over which our
   aforesaid venerable brother and colleague Anastasius, presides, that
   [epeide in the Greek, quo in the Latin] he may know that Africa is in
   great need, for the peace and prosperity of the Church, that those
   Donatists who were clergymen and who by good advice had desired to
   return to Catholic unity, should be treated according to the will and
   judgment of each Catholic bishop who governs the Church in that place;
   and, if it seem good for Christian peace, they be received with their
   honours, as it is clear was done in the former times of this same
   division.  And that this was the case the example of the majority, yea,
   of nearly all the African Churches in which this error had sprung up,
   testify; not that the Council which met about this matter in foreign
   parts should be done away, but that it may remain in force with regard
   to those who so will to come over to the Catholic Church that there be
   procured by them no breaking of unity.  But those through whom Catholic
   unity was seen to have been altogether perfected or assisted by the
   manifest winning of the souls of their brethren in the places where
   they live, there shall not be objected to them the decree contrary to
   their honour adopted by a foreign council, for salvation is shut off to
   no one, that is to say, that those ordained by the Donatist party, if
   having been corrected they have been willing to return to the Catholic
   Church, are not to be [463] received in their grades, according to the
   foreign council; but they are to be excepted through whom they received
   the advice to return to Catholic unity.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVIII.

   Those ordained by the Donatists, even though their reception has been
   forbidden by a foreign synod, since it is truly good that all should be
   saved, if they correct themselves, let them be received.

   Balsamon.

   This canon is special, for it seemed good to the fathers that such of
   the Donatists as came to the orthodox faith should be so received as to
   hold the grade of their holy orders, even though a transmarine, that is
   to say an Italian, council had decreed otherwise.

   Aristenus.

   Those Donatists who are penitent and anathematize their heresy are to
   be allowed to remain in their proper rank, and be numbered among the
   clergy of the Catholic Church, because Africa was labouring under a
   great shortness of clergy.

   This canon is Canon ij. of Carthage, Sept., a.d. 401.

   Johnson.

   Whether the Donatists' clergy should be re-ordained was only a point of
   discipline; for the Donatists retained Episcopacy.  Therefore the
   African fathers, as they leave other churches to their liberty, so at
   the same time they declare that they would continue their old practice,
   and leave every bishop to act according to his own discretion in this
   matter.  Probably, one great motive, besides that of peace, which they
   had to this, was the great scarcity of clergymen in Africa, of which
   Aurelius complains in his speech, inserted into the Acts before Canon
   77 (61), and proposes that they send to the bishops of Rome and Milan
   for a supply.  And that this was the true reason, does in some measure
   appear from the words of the Latin canon at large, in which the
   occasion of this decree is said to be propter necessitatem.  And this
   is the most probable reason why it is left to the discretion of the
   bishop, whether to admit Donatist clergymen as such, if he had occasion
   for their service.  And after all it is clear from this very canon,
   that other churches had determined this point the contrary way.
   Therefore Mr. Calamy exceeds when he says:  "As for the Donatists, all
   agree that their orders were acknowledged."  Further, he would have it
   thought probable that orders were not always conferred among the
   Donatists by persons superior to presbyters.  This he would infer from
   the great number of the bishops of that faction in Africa, viz., 278,
   many of which (says he) could be no more than parish ministers.  But
   why so?  Were there not above four hundred Catholic bishops?  And why
   not as many of one side as the other?  If our dissenters of any sort
   had fallen into the Episcopal form of government, no question but they
   would have had a bishop in every city at least, and equalled our church
   in the number of prelates.

   Canon LXIX.  (Greek lxxii.)

   That a legation be sent to the Donatists for the sake of making peace.

   It further seemed good, that when these things were done, legates
   should be sent from our number to those of the Donatists whom they hold
   as bishops, or to the people, for the sake of preaching peace and
   unity, without which Christian salvation cannot be attained; and that
   these legates should direct the attention of all to the fact that they
   have no just objection to urge against the Catholic Church.  And
   especially that this be made manifest to all by the municipal acts (on
   account of the weight of their documents) what they themselves had done
   in the case of the Maximianists, their own schismatics.  For in this
   case it is shown them by divine grace, if they will but heed it, that
   their separation from the unity of the Church is as iniquitous as they
   now proclaim the schism of the Maximianists from themselves to be.
   Nevertheless from the number, those whom they condemned by the
   authority of their plenary council, they received back with their
   honours, and accepted the baptism which they had given while condemned
   and cut off.  And thus let them see how with stupid heart they resist
   the peace of the Church scattered throughout the whole world, when they
   do these things on the part of Donatus, neither do they say that they
   are contaminated by communion with those whom they so receive for the
   making of peace, and yet they despise us, that is the Catholic Church,
   which is established even in the extreme parts of the earth, as being
   defiled by the communion of those whom the accusers have not been able
   to win over to themselves. [464]

   all such children should be baptized without scruple, lest a hesitation

   "Tractory" has several significations; here it seems to denote the
   written return made by the Primate of the province to the synodical
   letter sent by the Bishop of Carthage.  In the acts inserted between

   Primate to the inferior bishops for choosing legates, if it do not
   rather denote the Bishop of Carthage's circular-letter to all the
   primates, as it does in the next paragraph.

   [The penalty in the last clause is] a very singular sort of censure,
   and very moderate.  See Can. 80 (83).

   appearance.  But if he contemns the summons and does not come, let him

   Canon LXXVIII.  (Greek lxxxi.)

   Of the Church of Hippo-Diarrhytus.

   It further seemed good that since the destitution of the Church of
   Hippo-Diarrhytus should no longer be neglected, and the churches there
   are retained by those who have declined the infamous communion of
   Equitius, that certain bishops be sent from the present council, viz.:
   Reginus, Alypius, Augustine, Maternus, Theasius, Evodius, Placian,
   Urban, Valerius, Ambivius, Fortunatus, Quodvultdeus, Honoratus,
   Januarius, Aptus, Honoratus, Ampelius, Victorian, Evangelus and
   Rogation; and when those had been gathered together, and those had been
   corrected who with culpable pertinacity were of opinion that this
   flight of the same Equitius should be waited for, let a bishop be
   ordained for them by the vote of all.  But if these should not be
   willing to consider peace, let them not prevent the choosing for
   ordination of a bishop, for the advantage of the church which has been
   so long destitute.

   Notes.

   It seemed good that, after Equitius had been condemned by the universal
   vote, a bishop of Hippo should be elected, and that they should in no

   Canon LXXX.  (Greek lxxxiii.)

   That it is not permitted to make superiors of monasteries nor to ordain
   as clerics those who are received from a monastery not one's own.

   Item, it seemed good that if any bishop wished to advance to the
   clericature a monk received from a monastery not under his
   jurisdiction, or shall have appointed him superior of a monastery of
   his own, the bishop who shall have thus acted shall be separated from
   the communion of others and shall rest content with the communion of
   his own people alone, but the monk shall continue neither as cleric nor
   superior.

   Of bishops who appoint heretics or heathens as their heirs.

   Item, it was ordained that if any bishop should prefer to his Church
   strangers to blood relationship with him, or his heretical relatives,
   or pagans as his heirs, he shall be anathematized even after his death,
   and his name shall by no means be recited among those of the priests of
   God.  Nor can he be excused if he die intestate, because being a bishop
   he was bound not to postpone making such a disposition of his goods as
   was befitting his profession.

   There were in this age two written tables kept in every church, whereof
   one contained the names of all eminent bishops and clergymen now
   living, with whom that church held communion and correspondence; the
   other, the names of all eminent bishops, and other men of their own or
   other churches, now dead.  The deacon rehearsed all the names, in both
   tables at the altar, whenever the Eucharist was celebrated.  These
   tables were by the Greeks called Diptucha, and by some English writers
   "diptychs."  See Can. of Peter of Alex., 14.

   Of false Memories of Martyrs.

   Item, it seemed good that the altars which have been set up here and
   there, in fields and by the wayside as Memories of Martyrs, in which no
   body nor reliques of martyrs can be proved to have been laid up, should
   be overturned by the bishops who rule over such places, if such a thing
   can be done.  But should this be impossible on account of the popular
   tumult it would arouse, the people should none the less be admonished
   not to frequent such places, and that those who believe rightly should
   be held bound by no superstition of the place.  And no memory of
   martyrs should at all be accepted, unless where there is found the body
   or some reliques, on which is declared traditionally and by good
   authority to have been originally his habitation, or possession, or the
   scene of his passion.  For altars which have been erected anywhere on
   account of dreams or inane quasi-revelations of certain people, should
   be in every way disapproved of.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXIII.

   An altar in the fields or in a vineyard which lacks the reliques of the
   martyrs should be thrown down unless it would cause a public tumult to
   do so:  and the same is the case with such as have been set up on
   account of dreams and false revelations.

   Canon LXXXV.  (Greek lxxxviii.)

   That by the bishop of Carthage, when there shall be need, letters shall
   be written and subscribed in the name of all the bishops.

   It was said by all the bishops:  If any letters are to be composed in
   the name of the council it seemed good that the venerable bishop who
   presides over this See should vouchsafe to dictate and sign them in the
   name of all, among which also are those to the episcopal legates, who
   are to be sent throughout the African provinces, in the matter of the
   Donatists; and it seemed good that the letters given them should
   contain the tenor of the mandate which they are not to go beyond.  And
   they subscribed:  I, Aurelius, bishop of the church of Carthage have
   consented to this decree and having read it have signed it.  Likewise
   all the rest of the bishops subscribed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXV.

   It seemed good that whatever letters were to be sent from the Synod

   In this Council previous decrees are confirmed.

   In the fifth consulate of the most glorious Emperors Arcadius and
   Honorius, Augusti, the VI Calends of September, in the City of Milevis,
   in the secretarium of the basilica, when Aurelius the bishop of
   Carthage had taken his seat in plenary council, the deacons standing
   by, Aurelius, the bishop, said:  Since the body of the holy Church is
   one, and there is one head of all the members, it has come to pass by
   the divine permission and assistance given to our weakness, that we,
   invited out of brotherly love, have come to this church.  Wherefore I
   beg your charity to believe that our coming to you is neither
   superfluous, nor unacceptable to all; and that the consent of all of us
   may make it manifest that we agree with the decrees already confirmed
   by the Council at Hippo or which were defined afterwards by a larger
   synod at Carthage, these shall now be read to us in order.  Then at
   last the agreement of your holiness will appear clearer than light, if
   they know that the things lawfully defined by us in former councils, ye
   have set forth, not only by your consent to these acts, but also by
   your subscriptions.

   Xantippus, bishop of the first see of Numidia said:  I believe what
   pleased all the brethren and the statutes they confirmed with their
   hands; we by our subscribing our names shew that it pleases us also,
   and have confirmed them with our superscription.

   Nicetius, the bishop of the first see of Mauritania Sitifensis said:
   The decrees which have been read, since they do not lack reason, and
   have been approved by all, these also are pleasing to my littleness,
   and I will confirm them with my subscription.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXXXVI.  (Greek lxxxix.)

   Of the order of bishops, that those ordained more recently do not dare
   to take precedence of those ordained before them.

   Valentine, the bishop, said:  If your good patience will permit, I
   follow the things which were done in time past in the Church of
   Carthage, and which were illustrious having been confirmed by the
   subscriptions of the brethren, and I profess that we intend to preserve
   this.  For this we know, that ecclesiastical discipline has always
   remained inviolate:  therefore let none of the brethren dare to place
   himself before those ordained earlier than himself; but by the offices
   of charity this has always been shewn to those ordained earlier, which
   always should be accepted joyfully by those ordained more recently.
   Let your holiness give command that this order be strengthened by your
   interlocutions.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  It would not be fitting
   that we should repeat these things, were it not for the existence of
   certain inconsiderate minds, which would induce us to making such
   statutes; but this is a common cause about which our brother and fellow
   bishop has spoken, that each one of us should recognize the order
   decreed to him by God, and that the more recent should defer to the
   earlier ordained, and they should presume to do nothing when these have
   not been consulted.  Wherefore I say, now that I think of it, that they
   who think they may presume to take precedence over those ordained
   before them, should be coerced suitably by the great council.
   Xantippus, bishop of the first see of Numidia, said:  All the brethren
   present have heard what our brother and fellow bishop Aurelius has
   said, what answer do we make?  Datian, the bishop, said:  The decrees
   made by our ancestors should be strengthened by our assent, so that the
   action taken by the Church of Carthage in past synods should hold fast,
   being confirmed by the full assent of all of us.  And all the bishops
   said:  This order has been preserved by our fathers and by our
   ancestors, and shall be preserved by us through the help of God, the
   rights of the primacy of Numidia and of Mauritania being kept intact.

   Of the archives and matricula of Numidia.

   Moreover it seemed good to all the bishops who subscribed in this
   council that the matricula and the archives of Numidia should be at the
   first see and in the Metropolis, that is Constantina.

   402.

   This canon (lxxxvj.) is Canon j., of the above named Synod.

   Johnson.

   From this canon it appears that the primacy in Africa was ambulatory,
   and belonged to the senior bishop of the province.  If the primacy had
   been fixed to the bishop of any certain city, as in other countries,
   there would have been a salvo or exception for that bishop, as there is
   in the 24th canon of the Synod of Bracara [Braga] in Spain, which
   orders that all bishops take place according to their seniority, with a
   reserve to the bishop of the metropolis.  The bishop of Carthage was
   not included in this canon; for it is evident that he had a precedence
   annexed to his see, and that he was in reality a sort of patriarch.
   The reason why Numidia and Mauritania are particularly mentioned is,
   that some disputes had been started there on that subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon LXXXVII.  (Greek xc.)

   Concerning Quodvultdeus, the bishop.

   In the case of Quodvultdeus of Centuria, it pleased all the bishops
   that no one should communicate with him until his cause should be
   brought to a conclusion, for his accuser when he sought to bring the
   cause before our council, upon being asked whether he was willing with
   him to be tried before the bishops, at first said that he was, but on
   another day answered that he was not willing, and went away.  Under
   these circumstances to deprive him of his bishoprick, before the
   conclusion of his cause was known, could commend itself to no Christian
   as a just act.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXVII.

   Since Quodvultdeus at first promised to come to our synod when his
   opposer had asked that he be admitted, and afterwards withdrew, saying
   that that was displeasing to him, he should be excommunicated, until
   the cause is finished.  But it is not just that he be deposed before
   sentence is given.

   This canon is part of Canon ij. of Synod of Milevis, a.d. 402.

   Canon LXXXVIII.  (Greek xci.)

   Of Maximian, the bishop.

   But in the case of Maximian of Vagai [467] it seemed good that letters
   be sent from the council both to him and to his people; that he should
   vacate the bishoprick, and that they should request another to be
   appointed for them.

   Notes.

   Canon LXXXIX.  (Greek xcii.)

   That bishops who are ordained shall receive letters from their
   ordainers bearing the date and the name of the consul.

   It further seemed good that whoever thereafter should be ordained by
   the bishops throughout the African provinces, should receive from their
   ordainers letters, written in their own hands, containing the name of
   the consul and the date, that no altercation might arise concerning
   which were ordained first and which afterwards.

   It is evident from this canon that the church in this age followed the

   reign of our King or Queen.

   have consented to this decree, and, having read it, have signed it.
   Likewise also the rest of the bishops signed.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XC.

   He who has only once read in a Church [i.e., diocese] shall not be

   This is Canon iv. of Milevis, 402.

   There is set forth in this council what the bishops did who were sent
   as legates across seas.

   In the consulship of those most illustrious men, the most glorious
   Emperor Theodosius Augustus, and Rumoridus, the VIII. [468] Calends of
   September, at Carthage, in the basilica of the second region, when
   Aurelius the bishop had taken his seat in plenary council, the deacons
   standing by, Aurelius, the bishop, said:  From stress of circumstances,
   venerable brethren, I, although so small, have been led to assemble you
   in council.  For a while ago, as your holinesses will remember, while
   holding a council we sent our brothers as legates to the regions beyond
   seas.  It is right that these should at this meeting of your holinesses
   narrate the course of their now finished legation, and although
   yesterday when we were in session concerning this matter, besides
   ecclesiastical matters, we paid some prolonged attention to what they
   had done, nevertheless it is right that to-day the discussion of
   yesterday should be confirmed by ecclesiastical action.

   Of the bishops of the African provinces who were not present at this
   council. [469]

   The right order of things demands that first of all we should enquire
   concerning our brethren and fellow bishops, who were to come to this
   council either from Byzacena or at least from Mauritania, like as they
   decreed that they would be present in this council.  And when
   Philologius, Geta, Venustianus, and Felician, bishops of the province
   of Byzacena had presented and read their letters of legation, and
   Lucian and Silvanus, legates of the province of Mauritania Sitiphensis,
   had done the same, the bishop Aurelius said:  Let the text of these
   writings be placed in the acts.

   Of the Byzacene bishops.

   Numidius, the bishop, said:  We observe that our brethren and fellow
   bishops of the province of Byzacena and of the province of Mauritania
   Sitiphensis have sent legates to the council; we now seek whether the
   legates of Numidia have come, or at least of the province of Tripoli or
   of Mauritania-Cæsariensis.

   Of the bishops of Mauritania Sitiphensis.

   Lucian and Silvanus, the bishops, legates of the Province of Mauritania
   Sitiphensis said:  The tractory came late to our Cæsarian brethren or
   they would have been here; and they will certainly come, and we are
   confident of their attitude of mind that whatever shall be determined
   by this council, they without doubt will assent unto.

   Of the bishops of Numidia.

   Alypius, bishop of the church of Tagaste said:  We have come from
   Numidia, I and the holy brethren Augustine and Possidius, but a
   legation could not be sent from Numidia, because by the tumult of the
   recruits the bishops have either been prevented from coming or fully
   occupied by their own necessary affairs in their sees.  For after I had
   brought to the holy Senex Xantippus your holiness's tractory, this
   seemed good in the present business that a council should be appointed,
   to which a delegation with instructions should be sent, but when I
   reported to him in later letters the impediment of the recruits, of
   which I have just spoken, he excused them by his own rescripts.
   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  There is no doubt that the aforesaid
   brethren and bishops of Numidia, when they shall have received the acts
   of the council, will give their consent and will take pains to carry
   into effect whatever shall have been adopted.  It is therefore
   necessary that by the solicitude of this see what we shall have
   determined be communicated to them.

   Of the bishops of Tripoli.

   This is what I could learn concerning our brethren of Tripoli, that
   they appointed our brother Dulcicius as a legate: but because he could
   not come, certain of our sons coming from the aforesaid province
   asserted that the aforesaid had taken shipping, and that it was thought
   that his arrival had been delayed by storms; nevertheless also
   concerning these matters, if your charity is willing, this form shall
   be preserved, that the placets of the council be sent to them.  And all
   the bishops said:  What your holiness has decreed pleases us all.

   Canon XCI.  (Greek xciv.)

   Of holding meetings with the Donatists.

   Aurelius, the bishop, said:  What has come out in the handling of your
   charity, I think this should be confirmed by ecclesiastical acts.  For
   the profession of all of you shews that each one of us should call
   together in his city the chiefs of the Donatists either alone and with
   one of his neighbour bishops, so that in like manner in the different
   cities and places there should be meetings of them assembled by the
   magistrates or seniors of the places.  And let this be made an edict if
   it seems good to all.  And all the bishops said:  It seems good to all,
   and we all have confirmed this with our subscription.  Also we desire
   that your holiness sign the letters to be sent from the council to the
   judges.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  If it seems good to your charity,
   let the form of summoning them be read, in order that we all may hold
   the same tenour of proceeding.  All the bishops said:  Let it be read.
   Lætus the Notary read.

   Form of convening the Donatists.

   That bishop of that church said:  What by the authority of that most
   ample see we shall have impetrated, we ask your gravity to have read,
   and that you order it to be joined to the acts and carried into
   effect.  When the jussio had been read and joined to the acts, the
   bishop of the Catholic Church, [470] said:  Vouchsafe to listen to the
   mandate to be sent through your gravity to the Donatists, and to insert
   it in the acts, and to carry it to them, and informs us in your acts of
   their answer.  "We, sent by the authority of our Catholic Council, have
   called you together, desiring to rejoice in your correction, bearing in
   mind the charity of the Lord who said:  Blessed are the peacemakers,
   for they shall be called the children of God; and moreover he
   admonished through the prophet those who say they are not our brothers,
   that we ought to say:  Ye are our brethren.  Therefore you ought not to
   despise this pacific commonitory coming of love, so that if ye think we
   have any part of the truth, ye do not hesitate to say so:  that is,
   when your council is gathered together, ye delegate of your number
   certain to whom you intrust the statement of your case; so that we may
   be able to do this also, that there shall be delegated from our Council
   who with them delegated by you may discuss peacefully, at a determined
   place and time, whatever question there is which separates your
   communion from us; and that at length the old error may receive an end
   through the assistance of our Lord God, lest through the animosity of
   men, weak souls, and ignorant people should perish by sacrilegious
   dissension.  But if ye shall accept this proposition in a fraternal
   spirit, the truth will easily shine forth, but if ye are not willing to
   do this, your distrust will be easily known."  And when this had been
   read, all the bishops said:  This pleases us well, so let it be.  And
   they subscribed:  I, Aurelius, bishop of the Carthaginian Church, have
   consented to this decree, and having read it, have subscribed it.
   Likewise also the rest of the bishops signed.

   This synod sent a legation to the Princes against the Donatists.

   The most glorious emperor Honorius Augustus, being consul for the sixth
   time, on the Calends of July, at Carthage in the basilica of the second
   region.  In this council Theasius and Euodius received a legation
   against the Donatists.  In this council was inserted the commonitorium
   which follows.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCII.

   What things should be said to the Donatists are these:  "We greatly
   desire to rejoice in your conversion; for we have been commanded to say
   even to those not desiring to be our brethren, Ye are our brothers.'
   We come therefore to you and we exhort you that if you have any defence
   to make, ye should appoint certain persons to whom this should be
   entrusted, who, at a fixed time and place, shall urge your case;
   otherwise your distrust wilt be thenceforward patent."

   Canon XCIII.  (Greek xcvi.)

   The character of the Commonitory which the legates received against the
   Donatists.

   The Commonitorium for our brothers Theasius and Evodius, sent as
   legates from the Council of Carthage to the most glorious and most
   religious princes.  When by the help of the Lord they are come into the
   presence of the most pious princes, they shall declare to them with
   what fulness of confidence, according to the direction of the council
   of the year before, the prelates of the Donatists had been urged by the
   municipal authority to assemble, in order that if they really meant
   their professions, they might by fit persons chosen from their number,
   enter into a peaceful conference with us in Christian meekness, and
   whatever they held as truth they might not hesitate to declare it
   frankly; so that from such conference the sincerity of the Catholic
   position, which has been conspicuous for so long a time, might be
   perceived even by those who from ignorance or obstinacy were opposing
   themselves to it.  But deterred by their want of confidence they
   scarcely ventured to reply.  And forsooth, because we had discharged
   toward them the offices which become bishops and peacemakers, and they
   had no answer to make to the truth, they betook themselves to
   unreasonable acts of brute force, and treacherously oppressed many of
   the bishops and clergy, to say nothing of the laity.  And some of the
   churches they actually invaded, and tried to assault still others.

   And now, it behoves the gracious clemency of their Majesties to take
   measures that the Catholic Church, which has begotten them as
   worshippers of Christ in her womb, and has nourished them with the
   strong meat of the faith, should by their forethought, be defended,
   lest violent men, taking advantage of the times of religious
   excitement, should by fear overcome a weak people, whom by argument
   they were not able to pervert.  It is well known how often the vile
   gatherings (detestabilis manus) of the Circumcelliones [471] have been
   forbidden by the laws, and also condemned by many decrees of the
   Emperors, their majesties most religious predecessors.  Against the
   madness of these people it is not unusual nor contrary to the holy
   Scriptures to ask for secular [theias in the Greek] protection, since
   Paul the Apostle, as is related in the authentic Acts of the Apostles,
   warded off a conspiracy of certain lawless men by the help of the
   military.  Now then we ask that there be extended to the Catholic
   Churches, without any dissimulation, the protection of the ordinum
   [i.e. companies of soldiers, stationed] in each city, and of the
   holders of the suburban estates in the various places. [472]   At the
   same time it will be necessary to ask that they give commandment that
   the law, set forth by their father Theodosius, of pious memory, which
   imposed a fine of ten pounds of gold upon both the ordainers and the
   ordained among heretics, and which was also directed against
   proprietors at whose houses conventicles were held, be confirmed anew;
   so that it may be effective with persons of this sort when Catholics,
   provoked by their wiles, shall lay complaint against them; so that
   through fear at least, they may cease from making schisms and from the
   wickedness of the heretics, since they refuse to be cleansed and
   corrected by the thought of the eternal punishment.

   Let request be also made that the law depriving heretics of the power
   of being able to receive or bequeath by gift or by will, be straightway
   renewed by their Piety, so that all right of giving or receiving may be
   taken away from those who, blinded by the madness of obstinacy, are
   determined to continue in the error of the Donatists.

   With regard to those who by considerations of unity and peace are
   willing to correct themselves, let permission be granted to them to
   receive their inheritance, the law notwithstanding, even though the
   bequest by gift or inheritance was made while they were yet living in
   the error of the heretics; those of course being excepted, who under
   the stress of legal proceedings have sought to enter the Catholic
   Church; for it may well be supposed, that persons of this latter sort
   desired Catholic unity, not so much from fear of the judgment of
   heaven, as from the greed of earthly gain.

   For the furtherance of all these things the help of the Powers
   (Potestatum) of each one of the provinces is needed.  With regard to
   other matters, whatever they shall perceive is for the Church's
   interests, this we have resolved that the legation have full authority
   to do and to carry into effect.  Moreover it seemed good to us all,
   that letters from our assembly should be sent to the most glorious
   Emperors and most Excellent Worthinesses, whereby they may be assured
   of the agreement of us all that the legates should be sent by us to
   their most blessed court.

   Since it is a very slow business for us all to set our names to these
   letters, and in order that they may not be burdened with the signature
   of each one of us, we desire thee, brother Aurelius, that thy charity
   be good enough to sign them in the name of us all.  And to this they
   all agreed.

   I, Aurelius, Bishop of the Church of Carthage have consented to this
   decree and have subscribed my name.  And so all the other bishops
   subscribed.

   Letters ought likewise to be sent to the judges that, until the lord
   permit the legates to return to us, they give protection through the
   soldiers of the cities, and through the holders of the farms of the
   Catholic Church.  It ought also to be added concerning the dishonest
   Equitius, which he had shewn by laying claim to the jus sacerdotum,
   that he be rejected from the diocese of Hippo according to the statutes
   of the Emperors.  Letters ought also to be sent to the Bishop of the
   Church of Rome in commendation of the legates, and to the other Bishops
   who may be where the Emperor is.  To this they assented.

   Likewise I, Aurelius, Bishop of the Church of Carthage, have consented
   to this decree, and having read it, have set my name to it.

   And all the other bishops likewise subscribed.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCIII.

   The Emperors who were born in the true religion and were educated in
   the faith, ought to stretch forth a helping hand to the Churches.  For
   the military band overthrew the dire conspiracy which was threatening
   Paul.

   Here follows a brief declaration of what things were decreed in this
   Synod.

   When Stilico a second time and Anthemius, those illustrious men, were
   consuls, on the tenth before the calends of September, at Carthage in
   the basilica of the second region.  I have not written out in full the
   acts of this council [473] because they treat of the necessities of the
   time rather than of matters of general interest, but for the
   instruction of the studious I have added a brief digest of the same
   council. [474]

   Canon XCIV.  (Greek xcvii.)

   Summary of Chapters.

   That a free delegation be sent to the council from all the provinces to
   Mizoneum.  Legates [475] and letters were ordered to be sent for the
   purpose of directing the free legation:  that became the unity had been
   made only at Carthage, letters should also be given to the judges, that
   they might order in the other provinces and cities the work of union to
   be proceeded with, and the thanksgivings of the Church of Carthage for
   the whole of Africa concerning the exclusion of the Donatists should be
   sent with the letters of the bishops to Court (ad Comitatum).

   The letters of Pope Innocent were read:  that bishops ought not readily
   to carry causes across seas, and this very thing was confirmed by the
   judgment of the bishops themselves; that on account of thanksgiving and
   the exclusion of the Donatists, two clerics of the Church of Carthage
   should be sent to Court.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCIV.

   It seemed good that letters be sent to the Magistrates that the
   Donatists be expelled. [476]

   This introduction is taken from the Synod of Carthage of August 23,
   405.  There is also added the introduction of the Synod of Carthage of
   June 13, 407.

   In this synod certain things already decreed are corrected.

   Under the most illustrious emperors Honorius for the VII^th time, and
   Theodosius for the second time, the consuls being the Augusti, on the
   Ides of July in Carthage in the basilica of the second region, when
   bishop Aurelius together with his other bishops had taken his seat, and
   while the deacons stood by, he said:  Since it was decreed in the
   council of Hippo, that each year there should assemble a plenary
   council of Africa, not only here in Carthage but also in the different
   provinces in their order, and this was reserved that we should
   determine its place of meeting sometimes in Numidia and sometimes in
   Byzacium.  But this seemed laborious to all the brethren.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XCV.  (Greek xcviii.)

   An universal council to be held only when necessary.

   It seemed good that there should be no more the yearly necessity of
   fatiguing the brethren; but as often as common cause, that is of the
   whole of Africa, demands, that letters shall be given on every side to
   that see in this matter, that a synod should be gathered in that
   province, where the desirability of it induces; but let the causes
   which are not of general interest be judged in their own provinces.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCV.

   When general necessity so urges, letters are to be sent to the chief
   see, and a synod held in a convenient place.  But let ordinary causes
   be settled in their own provinces.

   This canon is Canon j. of the Synod of Carthage, a.d. 407.

   Johnson.

   This canon is a tacit revocation of that clause for annual synods in
   the 18th canon, which was made in a former council.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XCVI.  (Greek xcix.)

   That from judges who have been chosen, no appeals may be taken.

   If an appeal be taken, let him who makes it choose the judges, and with
   him he also against whom the appeal is taken; and from their decision
   no appeal may be made.

   Concerning the delegates of the different provinces.

   When all the delegates of the different provinces came together, they
   have been most graciously received, that is those of the Numidians,
   Byzacenes, Stifensian Moors, as well as Cæsarians and Tripolitans.

   Concerning the executors of Churches.

   It has seemed good moreover that the appointment of five executors
   should be asked for in all matters pertaining to the necessities of the
   Church, who shall be portioned off in the different provinces.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVI.

   If one party to a suit takes an appeal, and if both choose together a
   judge, no further appeal shall be allowed.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XCVII.  (Greek c.)

   That there be sought from the Emperor the protection of Advocates in
   causes ecclesiastical.

   It seemed good that the legates who were about leaving, viz., Vincent
   and Fortunatian, should in the name of all the provinces ask from the
   most glorious Emperors to give a faculty for the establishment of
   scholastic defensors, whose shall be the care of this very kind of
   business:  so that as the priests [477] of the province, they who have
   received the faculty as defensors of the Churches in ecclesiastical
   affairs, as often as necessity arises, may be able to enter the private
   apartments of the judges, so as to resist what is urged on the other
   side, or to make necessary explanations.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVII.

   That there be asked of the Emperor the appointment of Patrons for
   ecclesiastical heads, whose care it should be to defend the Church in
   its affairs, and who as priests could easily refer what things were
   urgent.

   (Greek ci.)

   That the legation be free.

   It seemed good that the chosen legates should have at the meeting
   freedom of action (legationem liberam).

   The protest of the Mauritanian bishops against Primosus.

   It is evident that those of Mauritania Cæsariensis gave evidence in
   their own writings that Primosus had been summoned by the chiefs of the
   Thiganensian city, that he should present himself to the plenary
   council according to the imperial constitutions, and, when sought for,
   as was right, Primosus was not found, at least so the deacons
   reported.  But since the same Mauritanians petitioned that letters be
   sent from the whole synod to the venerable brother, the aged Innocent,
   it seemed good that they should be sent, that he might know that
   Primosus had been sought at the council and not found at all.

   These officers [i.e. "defensors"] seem to be called "executores" in the
   acts of synod just before this canon.

   The "priest of the province" was one chosen out of the body of
   advocates to be counsel to the province, to act and plead in their
   behalf; and that he might do it more effectually he was allowed to have
   private conference with the judge.

   Canon XCVIII.  (Greek cii.)

   Of the peoples which never had bishops.

   It seemed good that such peoples as had never had bishops of their own
   should in no way receive such unless it had been decreed in a plenary
   council of each province and by the primates, and with the consent of
   the bishop of that diocese to which the church belonged.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVIII.

   Whoso never heretofore had a bishop of their own, unless the general
   synod of the Province shall agree to it, and the Primate, in agreement
   with him to whom the province in which the Church is, is subject, shall
   not have bishops of their own.

   This canon is Canon iv. of the Synod of Carthage, a.d. 407.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XCIX.  (Greek ciii.)

   Of people or dioceses returned from the Donatists.

   Such communities as have returned from the Donatists and have had
   bishops, without doubt may continue to have them even without any
   action of the councils, but such a community as had a bishop and when
   he dies wish no longer to have a bishop of their own, but to belong to
   the diocese of some other bishop, this is not to be denied them.  Also
   such bishops as before the promulgation of the imperial law concerning
   unity as brought back their people to the Catholic Church, they ought
   to be allowed still to rule them:  but from the time of that law of
   unity, all the Churches, and their dioceses, and if perchance there be
   any instruments of the Church or things pertaining to its rights should
   belong to the Catholic bishops of those places to whom the places
   pertained while under the heretics, whether they be converted to the
   Catholic Church or remain unconverted heretics.  Whoever after this law
   shall make any such usurpation, shall restore as is meet the usurped
   possessions.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XCIX.

   Whoever are converted from the Donatists may retain their own bishops,
   although they had them without the consent of the synod; and when the
   bishop is dead, if they do not wish another to be substituted in his
   room, but desire to place themselves under some other bishop, they
   shall be allowed to do so.  And such bishops as before the union have
   brought back the people they ruled, let them still rule them.  After
   the imperial Edict on Unity every church must defend its own rights.

   This canon is Canon v. of Carthage, a.d. 407.

   Johnson.

   "An imperial law concerning unity" i.e. For uniting all in the catholic
   faith, and ejecting the donatistical bishops.

   Canon C.  (Greek civ.)

   Of the suggestion of Bishop Maurentius.

   [Hefele says "The text of this canon is much corrupted and very
   difficult to be understood."  He gives as a synopsis, "The council
   appoints judges in the affair of Bishop Maurentius."  (Hefele, Vol. II,
   p. 443.)]

   Johnson thus condenses and translates.

   Bishop Maurentius having an information against him, lying before the
   council, moves for a hearing; but the informers don't appear upon three
   calls made by the deacons on the day appointed.  The cause is referred
   to Senex Xantippus, Augustinus, and five more summoned by the council,
   the informers were to make up the number twelve.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon C.

   It is right that sentence be given on the subdeacons who are said to be
   present from Nova Germania, who have thrice been sought and not found.
   But out of regard to ecclesiastical gentleness, let some be sent to
   look into the matter.

   Canon CI.  (Greek civ. bis)

   Of making peace between the Churches of Rome and Alexandria.

   It seemed good that a letter be written to the holy Pope Innocent
   concerning the dissension between the Churches of Rome and Alexandria,
   so that each Church might keep peace with the other as the Lord
   commanded.

   Notes.

   It seemed good to write to Innocent that the Roman and Alexandrian
   churches might be at peace between themselves.

   Canon CII.  (Greek cv.)

   Of those who put away their wives or husbands, that so they remain.

   It seemed good that according to evangelical and apostolical discipline
   a man who had been put away from his wife, and a woman put away from
   her husband should not be married to another, but so should remain, or
   else be reconciled the one to the other; but if they spurn this law,
   they shall be forced to do penance, covering which case we must
   petition that an imperial law be promulgated.

   Married people who are loosed must remain unmarried or else be
   reconciled, otherwise they shall be forced to do penance.

   Canon CIII.  (Greek cvi.)

   Of the prayers to be said at the Altar.

   This also seemed good, that the prayers which had been approved in
   synod should be used by all, whether prefaces, commendations, or laying
   on of the hand, and that others contrary to the faith should not be
   used by any means, but that those only should be said which had been
   collected by the learned.

   That is, such forms fitted for the present time or occasion, as our
   Church uses in her Communion Office before the trisagium, on Christmas,
   Easter, etc.  These prefaces were very ancient in the Christian
   church.  Prayers used to recommend the catechumens, penitents, and
   dying souls to God's protection were styled "Commendations."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CIV.  (Greek cvii.)

   Of these who ask from the Emperor that secular judges may take
   cognizance of their causes.

   It seemed good that whoever should seek from the Emperor, that secular
   judges should take cognizance of his business, should be deprived of
   his office; if however, he had asked from the Emperor an episcopal
   trial, no objection should be made.

   Canon CVI.  (Greek cix.)

   That those who are going to carry their case to court should be careful
   to inform either the bishop of Carthage or [478] the bishop of Rome.

   It seemed good that whoever wished to go to court, should give notice
   in the form which is sent to the Church of the city of Rome, that from
   thence also he should receive a formed letter to court.  But if
   receiving only a formed letter to Rome, and saying nothing about the
   necessity which he had of going to court, he willed immediately to go
   thither, let him be cut off from communion.  But if while at Rome the
   necessity of going to court suddenly arose, let him state his necessity
   to the bishop of Rome and let him carry with him a rescript of the same
   Roman bishop.  But let the formed letters which are issued by primates
   and by certain bishops to their own clergy have the date of Easter; but
   if it be yet uncertain what is the date of Easter of that year, let the
   preceding Easter's date be set down, as it is customary to date public
   acts after the consulship.

   It further seemed good that those who were sent as delegates from this
   glorious council should ask of the most glorious princes whatever they
   saw would be useful against the Donatists and Pagans, and their
   superstitions.

   It also seemed good to all the bishops that all conciliar letters be
   signed by your holiness alone.  And they subscribed:  I, Aurelius,
   Bishop of Carthage, have consented to this decree, and having read it,
   now subscribe my name.  Likewise also the rest of the bishops
   subscribed.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CVI.

   Whoever from any necessity was going to court, must declare his
   intention to the bishop of Carthage and to the bishop of Rome, and
   receive a letter dimissory, and otherwise he shall be excommunicated.

   Whatever shall seem to the legates useful against the Donatists and
   Greeks, and their superstitions, that shall be sought from the Emperor.

   (Greek cx.)

   Synod against the pagans and heretics.

   In the consulship of those most illustrious men Bassus and Philip, the
   xvi^th Calends of July, at Carthage, in the secretarium of the restored

   second appointment as legate against the pagans and heretics.

   Item, a council against the pagans and heretics.

   In the consulship of those most illustrious men Bassus and Philip, the
   iii. Ides of October at Carthage, in the Secretarium of the restored

   A Council concerning a bishop taking cognizance.

   In the consulate of the most glorious Emperors Honorius for the VII^th
   time and Theodosius for the IIId, Augusti, xvii. Calends of July, a
   synod was held at Carthage in the basilica of the second region.  In
   this council it seemed good that no one bishop should claim the right
   to take cognizance of a cause.  The acts of this council I have not
   here written down, because it was only provincial and not general.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CVII.

   One bishop shall not claim for himself to take cognizance of a cause
   alone.

   Synod against the Donatists.

   After the consulate of the most illustrious Emperors Honorius for the
   VIII^th time and Theodosius for the IV^th time, Augusti, xviii. Calends
   of July, at Carthage in the basilica of the second region.  In this
   council the bishops, Florentius, Possidius, Præsidius and Benenatus
   received legation against the Donatists, at that time at which a law
   was given that anyone might practice the Christian worship at his own
   will.

   Calends of May, at Carthage in the secretarium of the Basilica of
   Faustus.  When Aurelius the bishop presided over the whole council, the

   That whosoever says that Adam, the first man, was created mortal, so
   that whether he had sinned or not, he would have died in body--that is,

   but by natural necessity, let him be anathema.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CIX.

   Whoso shall assert that the protoplast would have died without sin and

   a.d. 418; and Canon CIX. is Canon j. of that synod.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CX.  (Greek cxii. bis)

   That infants are baptized for the remission of sins.

   Likewise it seemed good that whosoever denies that infants newly from
   their mother's wombs should be baptized, or says that baptism is for
   remission of sins, but that they derive from Adam no original sin,
   which needs to be removed by the laver of regeneration, from whence the
   conclusion follows, that in them the form of baptism for the remission
   of sins, is to be understood as false and not true, let him be
   anathema.

   For no otherwise can be understood what the Apostle says, "By one man
   sin is come into the world, and death through sin, and so death passed
   upon all men in that all have sinned," than the Catholic Church
   everywhere diffused has always understood it.  For on account of this
   rule of faith (regulam fidei) even infants, who could have committed as
   yet no sin themselves, therefore are truly baptized for the remission
   of sins, in order that what in them is the result of generation may be
   cleansed by regeneration.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CX.

   Whoso affirms that those newly born and baptized contract nothing from
   Adam's transgression, which needs to be washed away by baptism, is to
   be execrated:  for through one both death and sin invaded the whole
   world.

   This is Canon ij. of Carthage, a.d. 418 [Greek Canon 112].

   Johnson.

   See Can. 63, 104, both which are double, as this likewise is in the old
   Greek scholiasts.

   [Also it seemed good, that if anyone should say that the saying of the
   Lord, "In my Father's house are many mansions" is to be understood as
   meaning that in the kingdom of heaven there will be a certain middle
   place, or some place somewhere, in which infants live in happiness who
   have gone forth from this life without baptism, without which they
   cannot enter the kingdom of heaven, which is eternal life, let him be
   anathema.  For after our Lord has said:  "Except a man be born again of
   water and of the Holy Spirit he shall not enter the kingdom of heaven,"
   what Catholic can doubt that he who has not merited to be coheir with
   Christ shall become a sharer with the devil:  for he who fails of the
   right hand without doubt shall receive the left hand portion.]

   Notes.

   The foregoing, says Surius, is found in this place in a very ancient
   codex.  It does not occur in the Greek, nor in Dionysius.  Bruns
   relegates it to a foot-note.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXI.  (Greek cxiij.)

   That the grace of God not only gives remission of sins, but also
   affords aid that we sin no more.

   Likewise it seemed good, that whoever should say that the grace of God,
   by which a man is justified through Jesus Christ our Lord, avails only
   for the remission of past sins, and not for assistance against
   committing sins in the future, let him be anathema.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXI.

   Whoever is of opinion that the grace of God only gives remission of
   those sins we have already committed, and does not afford aid against
   sin in the future, is to be twice execrated.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXII.  (Greek cxiij. continued.)

   That the grace of Christ gives not only the knowledge of our duty, but
   also inspires us with a desire that we may be able to accomplish what
   we know.

   Also, whoever shall say that the same grace of God through Jesus Christ
   our Lord helps us only in not sinning by revealing to us and opening to
   our understanding the commandments, so that we may know what to seek,
   what we ought to avoid, and also that we should love to do so, but that
   through it we are not helped so that we are able to do what we know we
   should do, let him be anathema.  For when the Apostle says:  "Wisdom
   puffeth up, but charity edifieth" it were truly infamous were we to
   believe that we have the grace of Christ for that which puffeth us up,
   but have it not for that which edifieth, since in each case it is the
   gift of God, both to know what we ought to do, and to love to do it; so
   that wisdom cannot puff us up while charity is edifying us.  For as of
   God it is written, "Who teacheth man knowledge," so also it is written,
   "Love is of God."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXII.

   Whoever says that the grace of God is given to us only that we may know
   what we ought to do and what to flee from, but not also that we may
   love the thing known, and be able to accomplish it, let him be
   anathema.

   Canon cxi. is Canon iij. of Carthage, a.d. 418, and Canon cxii. is
   Canon iv. of the same synod.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXIII.  (Greek cxiiii.)

   That without the grace of God we can do no good thing.

   It seemed good that whosoever should say that the grace of
   justification was given to us only that we might be able more readily
   by grace to perform what we were ordered to do through our free will;
   as if though grace was not given, although not easily, yet nevertheless
   we could even without grace fulfil the divine commandments, let him be
   anathema.  For the Lord spake concerning the fruits of the
   commandments, when he said:  "Without me ye can do nothing," and not
   "Without me ye could do it but with difficulty."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXIII.

   Whoso preaches that without grace we could keep the commandments
   although with difficulty, is to be thrice execrated.  For the Lord
   says, "Without me ye can do nothing."

   This is Canon V. of Carthage, a.d. 418.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXIV.  (Greek cxv.)

   That not only humble but also true is that voice of the Saints:  "If we
   say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves."

   It also seemed good that as St. John the Apostle says, "If we shall say
   that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us,"
   whosoever thinks that this should be so understood as to mean that out
   of humility, we ought to say that we have sin, and not because it is
   really so, let him be anathema.  For the Apostle goes on to add, "But
   if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins
   and to cleanse us from all iniquity," where it is sufficiently clear
   that this is said not only of humility but also truly.  For the Apostle
   might have said, "If we shall say we have no sins we shall extoll
   ourselves, and humility shall have no place in us;" but when he says,
   "we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us" he sufficiently
   intimates that he who affirmed that he had no sin would speak not that
   which is true but that which is false.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXIV.

   Whosoever shall interpret the saying of the Divine [i.e. St. John]:
   "If we shall say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves" as not
   being really true but as spoken out of humility, let him be anathema.

   This is Canon vj. of Carthage, a.d. 418.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXV.  (Greek cxvi.)

   That in the Lord's Prayer the Saints say for themselves:  "Forgive us
   our trespasses."

   It has seemed good that whoever should say that when in the Lord's
   prayer, the saints say, "forgive us our trespasses," they say this not
   for themselves, because they have no need of this petition, but for the
   rest who are sinners of the people; and that therefore no one of the
   saints can say, "Forgive me my trespasses," but "Forgive us our
   trespasses;" so that the just is understood to seek this for others
   rather than for himself; let him be anathema.  For holy and just was
   the Apostle James, when he said, "For in many things we offend all."
   For why was it added "all," unless that this sentence might agree also
   with the psalm, where we read, "Enter not into judgment with thy
   servant, O Lord, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified;"
   and in the prayer of the most wise Solomon:  "There is no man that
   sinneth not;" and in the book of the holy Job:  "He sealeth in the hand
   of every man, that every man may know his own infirmity;" wherefore
   even the holy and just Daniel when in prayer said several times:  "We
   have sinned, we have done iniquity," and other things which there truly
   and humbly he confessed; nor let it be thought (as some have thought)
   that this was said not of his own but rather of the people's sins, for
   he said further on:  "When I shall pray and confess my sins and the
   sins of my people to the Lord my God;" he did not wish to say our sins,
   but he said the sins of his people and his own sins, since he as a
   prophet foresaw that those who were to come would thus misunderstand
   his words.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXV.

   Whoso expounds this, "forgive us our trespasses" as speaking only of
   the multitude and not of individuals let him be anathema:  Since Daniel
   even he can behold saying with the multitude "I confessed my sins and
   the sins of my people."

   This is Canon vij. of Carthage, a.d. 418.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXVI.  (Greek cxvii.)

   That the Saints say with accuracy, "Forgive us our trespasses."

   Likewise also it seemed good, that whoever wished that these words of
   the Lord's prayer, when we say, "Forgive us our trespasses" are said by
   the saints out of humility and not in truth let them be anathema.  For
   who would make a lying prayer, not to men but to God?  Who would say
   with his lips that he wished his sins forgiven him, but in his heart
   that he had no sins to be forgiven.

   Canon CXVII.  (Greek cxviii.)

   Of peoples converted from the Donatists.

   Item, it seemed good, since it was so decreed some years ago by a
   plenary council, that whatever churches were erected in a diocese
   before the laws were made concerning Donatists when they became
   Catholic, should pertain to the sees of those bishops through whom
   their return to Catholic unity was brought about; but after the laws
   whatever churches communicated were to belong there where they belonged
   when they were Donatists.  But because many controversies afterward
   arose and are still springing up between bishops concerning dioceses,
   which were not then at all in prospect, now it has seemed good to this
   council, that wherever there was a Catholic and a Donatist party,
   pertaining to different sees, at whatever time unity has been or shall
   be made, whether before or after the laws, the churches shall belong to
   that see to which the Catholic church which was already there belonged.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXVII.

   Whenever conversions and unions of Donatists are effected, let them be
   subject to that throne to which the Catholic Church which was formerly
   there was subject.

   This is Canon ix. of Carthage, a.d. 418.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXVIII.  (Greek cxix.)

   How bishops as well Catholic as those who have been converted from the
   Donatists are to divide between themselves the dioceses.

   So, too, it has seemed good that if a bishop has been converted from
   the Donatists to Catholic unity, that equally there should be divided
   what shall have been so found where there were two parties; that is,
   that some places should pertain to one and some to the other; and let
   the division be made by him who has been the longest time in the
   episcopate, and let the younger choose.  But should there be only one
   place let it belong to him who is found to be the nearer.  But should
   the distance be equal to each of the two cathedrals let it belong to
   the one the people may choose.  But should the old Catholics wish their
   own bishop, and if the same be the case with the converted Donatists,
   let the will of the greater number prevail, but should the parties be
   equal, let it belong to him who has been longest bishop.  But if so
   many places be found in which there were both parties, that an equal
   division is impossible, as for example, if they are unequal in number,
   after those places have been distributed which have an equal number,
   the place that remains over shall be disposed of as is provided above
   in the case where there is but one place to be treated.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXVIII.

   Those who have been converted from Donatus, let them divide the
   dioceses; and let the senior bishop make the division, and the junior
   choose which he will.

   This is Canon x. of Carthage, a.d. 418.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXIX.  (Greek cxx.)

   That if a bishop shall possess a diocese which he has snatched from
   heresy for three years, no one may take it from him.

   Item, it seemed good that if anyone after the laws should convert any
   place to Catholic unity and retain it for three years without
   opposition, it should not be taken away from him afterwards.  If
   however there was during those three years a bishop who could claim it
   and was silent, he shall lose the opportunity.  But if there was no
   bishop, no prejudice shall happen to the see, [482] but it shall be
   lawful when the place that had none shall receive a bishop, to make the
   claim within three years of that day.  Item, if a Donatist bishop shall
   be converted to the Catholic party, the time that has elapsed shall not
   count against him, but from the day of his conversion for three years
   he shall have the right of making a claim on the places which belonged
   to his See.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXIX.

   Whosoever shall convert a region to Orthodoxy and shall keep it
   converted for three years, let him be without blame.  But if the bishop
   converted from Donatus within three years of its conversion seeks his
   diocese again, let it be returned to him (ei enagei, enageto.)

   This is Canon xj. of Carthage, a.d. 418.

   Canon CXX.  (Greek cxxi.)

   Of those who intrude upon peoples which they think belong to them,
   without the consent of those by whom they are held.

   Item, it seemed good that whatever bishops seek the peoples whom they
   consider to pertain to their see, not by bringing their causes before
   the episcopal judges, but rush in while another is holding the place,
   all such, (whether said people are willing to receive them or no) shall
   lose their case.  And whoever have done this, if the contention between
   the two bishops is not yet finished but still going on, let him depart
   who intruded without the decree of the ecclesiastical judges; nor let
   anyone flatter himself that he will retain [what he has seized] if he
   shall obtain letters from the primate, but whether he has such letters
   or has them not, it is suitable that he who holds and receives his
   letters should make it appear then that he has held the church
   pertaining to him peaceably.  But if he has referred any question, let
   the cause be decided by the episcopal judges, whether those whom the
   primates have appointed for them, or the neighbouring bishops whom they
   have chosen by common consent.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXX.

   Let no one seize for himself what he thinks belongs to him:  but let
   the bishops judge or whom the Primate will give, or whom the
   neighbouring bishops shall give with his consent.  But whosoever has
   received letters from the primate concerning the keeping [of such
   regions and churches] merely deceives himself.

   This is Canon xij. of Carthage, a.d. 418.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXXI.  (Greek cxxii.)

   Of those who neglect the peoples belonging to them.

   Item, it seemed good that whoever neglect to bring the places belonging
   to their see into Catholic unity should be admonished by the
   neighbouring diligent bishops, that they delay no longer to do this;
   but if within six months from the day of the convention they do
   nothing, let them pertain to him who can win them:  but with this
   proviso however, that if he to whom it seemed they naturally belonged
   can prove that this neglect was intentional and more efficacious in
   winning them than the greater apparent diligence of others; when the
   episcopal judges shall be convinced that this is the case, they shall
   restore the places to his see.  If the bishops between whom the cause
   lies are of different provinces, let the Primate in whose province the
   place is situated about which there is the dispute, appoint judges; but
   if by mutual consent they have chosen as judges the neighbouring
   bishops, let one or three be chosen:  so that if they choose three they
   may follow the sentence of all or of two.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXI.

   If any neglect what belongs to their jurisdiction, let them be
   admonished; and if they shall do nothing within a six month, let them
   be adjudged to him who can win them.  But if they have committed the
   neglect out of policy so as not to irritate the heretics, and this
   shall appear to have been the case, their sees shall be restored to
   them, by the judgment of the bishops either appointed or elected.

   This is Canon xiij. of Carthage, a.d. 418.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXXII.  (Greek cxxiii.)

   The sentence of the elected judges ought not to be spurned.

   From the judges chosen by common consent of the parties, no appeal can
   be taken; and whoever shall be found to have carried such an appeal and
   contumaciously to be unwilling to submit to the judges, when this has
   been proved to the primate, let him give letters, that no one of the
   bishops should communicate with him until he yield.

   Canon CXXIII.  (Greek cxxiv.)

   That if a bishop neglects his diocese he is to be deprived of
   communion.

   If in the mother cathedrals a bishop should have been negligent against
   the heretics, let a meeting be held of the neighbouring diligent
   bishops, and let his negligence be pointed out to him, so that he can
   have no excuse.  But if within six months after this meeting, if an
   execution was in his own province, and he had taken no care to convert
   them to Catholic unity, no one shall communicate with him till he does
   his duty.  But if no executor shall have come to the places, then the
   fault shall not be laid to the bishop.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXIII.

   A bishop who spurns the care of heretics, and if after being warned he

   Canon CXXV.  (Greek cxxvi.)

   That presbyters and clerics are not to appeal except to African Synods.

   Item, it seemed good that presbyters, deacons, or other of the lower
   clergy who are to be tried, if they question the decision of their
   bishops, the neighbouring bishops having been invited by them with the
   consent of their bishops, shall hear them and determine whatever
   separates them.  But should they think an appeal should be carried from
   them, let them not carry the appeal except to African councils or to
   the primates of their provinces.  But whoso shall think of carrying an
   appeal across seas he shall be admitted to communion by no one in
   Africa.

   Canon CXXVI.  (Greek cxxvii.)

   That Virgins, even when minors, should be given the veil.

   Item, it seemed good that whatever bishop, by the necessity of the
   dangers of virginal purity, when either a powerful suitor or some
   ravisher is feared, or if she shall be pricked with some scruple of
   death that she might die unveiled, at the demand either of her parents
   or of those to whose care she has been entrusted, shall give the veil
   to a virgin, or shall have given it while she was under twenty-five
   years of age, the council which has appointed that number of years
   shall not oppose him.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXVI.

   Whosoever has veiled or shall veil a virgin before she is twenty-five
   years of age (that is give her the habit, or clothe her), being forced
   thereto on account of a powerful lover, or a ravisher, or deadly
   disease, provided those who have the charge of her so exhort, shall
   receive no damage from the synod concerning that age.

   This is Canon xviij. of Carthage, a.d. 418.  The reference to a former
   canon is to Canon j. of the second series of the canons of the Synod of
   Hippo in a.d. 393.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXXVII.  (Greek cxxviii.)

   That bishops be not detained too long in council, let them choose three
   judges from themselves of the singular provinces.

   Item, it seemed good, lest all the bishops who are assembled at a
   council be kept too long, that the whole synod should choose three
   judges of the several provinces; and they elected for the province of
   Carthage Vincent, Fortunatian, and Clarus; for the province of Numidia
   Alypius, Augustine, and Restitutus; for the province of Byzacena, with
   the holy Senex Donatian the Primate, Cresconius, Jocundus, and Æmilian;
   for Mauritania Sitephensis Severian, Asiaticus, and Donatus; for the
   Tripolitan province Plautius, who alone was sent as legate according to
   custom; all these were to take cognizance of all things with the holy
   senex Aurelius, from whom the whole council sought that he should
   subscribe all things done by the council whether acts or letters.  And
   they subscribed:  I, Aurelius, bishop of the church of Carthage consent
   to this decree and having read it sign my name.  Likewise also signed
   they all.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXVII.

   Whenever the bishops who come to synod can remain no longer in
   attendance, let three be chosen from each province.

   This is Canon xix. of Carthage, a.d. 418.

   Carpi, Rufinian of Muzuba, Prætextatus of Sicily, Quodvultdeus of Veri
   (Verensis), Candidus of Abbirita, Gallonian of Utica, legates of the
   proconsular province; Alypius of Tagaste, Augustine of Hippo Regia and
   Posidonius of Calama, legates of the province of Numidia; Maximian of
   Aquæ, Jocundus of Sufetula, and Hilary of Horrea-Cascilia, legates of
   the province of Byzacena; Novatus of Sitifi and Leo of Mocta, legates
   of the province of Mauritania Sitiphensis; Ninellus of Rusucarrum,
   Laurence of Icosium and Numerian of Rusgunium, legates of the Province
   of Mauritania Cæsariensis, the judges chosen by the plenary council,
   had taken their seats, the deacons standing by, and when, after certain
   things had been accomplished, many bishops complained that it was not
   possible for them to wait for the completion of the rest of the
   business to be treated of, and that they must hasten to their own
   churches; it seemed good to the whole council, that by all some should
   be chosen from each province who should remain to finish up what was
   left to be done.  And it came about that those were present whose
   subscriptions testify that they were present.

   Canon CXXVIII.  (Greek cxxix.)

   That those out of communion should not be allowed to bring accusation.

   It seemed good to all, as it had been decreed by the former councils,
   concerning what persons were to be admitted to bring accusations
   against clerics; and since it had not been expressed what persons
   should not be admitted, therefore we define, that he cannot properly be
   admitted to bring an accusation, who had been already excommunicated,
   and was still lying under that censure, whether he that wished to be
   the accuser were cleric or layman.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome OF Canon CXXVIII.

   One excommunicated is not to give witness.

   The Council of Carthage of 419 had at its first session on May 25th
   done thus much.  But when it met again on the 30th of the same month,
   it continued the code.  The introduction in regard to this new session
   is this introduction.  The Canons then enacted were original, viz.
   numbers 128, 129, 130, 131, 132 and 133.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXXIX.  (Greek cxxx.)

   That slaves and freedmen and all infamous persons ought not to bring
   accusation.

   To all it seemed good that no slaves or freedmen, properly so called,
   be admitted to accusation nor any of those who by the public laws are
   debarred from bringing accusation in criminal proceedings.  This also
   is the case with all those who have the stain of infamy, that is
   actors, and persons subject to turpitudes, also heretics, or heathen,
   or Jews; but even all those to whom the right of bringing accusation is
   denied, are not forbidden to bring accusation in their own suits.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXIX.

   A slave, and a freedman, and he who before was accused of any of these
   crimes on account of which he is not admitted in court, and a player,
   and a heathen, and a heretic, and a Jew.

   [There is no verb to finish the sentence.  However, this is intended as
   a continuation of the epitome of the former canon, the words to be
   supplied being "are not to give witness."]

     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXXX.  (Greek cxxxi.)

   That he who has failed to prove one charge shall not be allowed to give
   evidence to another.

   So, too, it seemed good that as often as many crimes were laid to
   clerics by their accusers, and one of the first examined could not be
   proved, [484] they should not be allowed to go on giving evidence on
   the other counts.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXX.

   He who makes many accusations and proves nothing [is not to give

   They who are forbidden to be admitted as accusers are not to be allowed
   to appear as witnesses, nor any that the accuser may bring from his own
   household.  And none shall be admitted to give witness under fourteen
   years of age.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXXXII.  (Greek cxxxiii.)

   Concerning a bishop who removes a man from communion who says he has
   confessed to the bishop alone his crime.

   It also seemed good that if on any occasion a bishop said that someone
   had confessed to him alone a personal crime, and that the man now
   denies it; let not the bishop think that any slight is laid upon him if
   he is not believed on his own word alone, although he says he is not
   willing to communicate with the man so denying through a scruple of his
   own conscience.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXXII.

   If a bishop says "someone has confessed to me alone a crime," if the
   someone denies it, he [i.e. the bishop] is not easily to be believed.

   N.B.  The word used for "someone" in the Epitome is pelas, which
   ordinarily means a "neighbour" but may mean "any one."  Vide Liddell
   and Scott.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon CXXXIII.  (Greek cxxxiv.)

   That a bishop should not rashly deprive anyone of communion.

   As long as his own bishop will not communicate with one excommunicated,
   the other bishops should have no communion with that bishop, that the
   bishop may be more careful not to charge anyone with what he cannot
   prove by documentary evidence to others.

   (Greek cxxxv.)

   Bishop Aurelius said:  According to the statutes of this whole
   assembled council, and the opinion of my littleness, it seems good to
   make an end of all the matters of the whole of the before-manifested
   title, and let the ecclesiastical acts receive the discussion of the
   present day's constitution.

   And what things have not yet been expressed ("treated of" in the Greek)
   we shall write on the next day through our brethren, Bishop Faustinus
   and the Presbyters Philip and Asellus to our venerable brother and
   fellow-bishop Boniface; and they gave their assent in writing.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXXIII.

   If a bishop deprives of communion an unconvicted man, he shall likewise
   be deprived of communion with his fellows.

   Johnson.

   Never was a more impartial law made, especially when all the
   legislators were bishops except two.  There were 217 bishops, and two
   priests, being legates from the bishop of Rome.

   The Greeks make a canon of the ratifications, and reckon no more than
   135.  Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, subscribes first, and after him 217
   bishops, then Asellus and Philippus, priests, legates of the church of
   Rome.  And it does not appear that any other priests were present in
   any of the councils, mentioned in the body of this code; but there is
   several times notice taken of the deacons who stood by.

   Canon CXXXIV.  (Continuation of cxxxv. in the Greek.)

   Here beginneth the letter directed from the whole African Council to
   Boniface, bishop of the City of Rome, by Faustinus the bishop, and
   Philip and Asellus the presbyters, legates of the Roman Church.

   To the most blessed lord, and our honourable brother Boniface,
   Aurelius, Valentine of the primatial See of Numidia, and others present
   with us to the number of 217 from the whole council in Africa.

   Since it has pleased the Lord that our humility should write concerning
   those things which with us our holy brethren, Faustinus a fellow-bishop
   and Philip and Asellus, fellow presbyters, have done, not to the bishop
   Zosimus of blessed memory, from whom they brought commands and letters
   to us, but to your holiness, who art constituted in his room by divine
   authority, we ought briefly to set forth what has been determined upon
   by mutual consent; not indeed those things which are contained in the
   prolix volumes of the acts, in which, while charity was preserved, yet
   we loitered not without some little labour of altercation, deliberating
   those things in the acts which now pertain to the cause.  However the
   more gratefully would he have received this news as he would have seen
   a more peaceful ending of the matter, my lord and brother, had he been
   still in the body!  Apiarius the presbyter, concerning whose
   ordination, excommunication, and appeal no small scandal arose not only
   at Sicca but also in the whole African Church, has been restored to
   communion upon his seeking pardon for all his sins.  First our fellow
   bishop Urban of Sicca doubtless corrected whatever in him seemed to
   need correction.  For there should have been kept in mind the peace and
   quiet of the Church not only in the present but also in the future,
   since so many evils of such a kind had gone before, that it was
   incumbent to take care that like or even graver evils should be
   prevented thereafter.  It seemed good to us that the presbyter Apiarius
   should be removed from the church of Sicca, retaining only the honour
   of his grade, and that he should exercise the office of the
   presbyterate wherever else he wished and could, having received a
   letter to this effect.  This we granted without difficulty at his own
   petition made in a letter.  But truly before this case should be thus
   closed, among other things which we were treating of in daily
   discussions, the nature of the case demanded that we should ask our
   brothers, Faustinus our fellow bishop, and Philip and Asellus our
   fellow presbyters, to set forth what they had been enjoined to treat of
   with us that they might be inserted in the ecclesiastical acts.  And
   they proceeded to make a verbal statement, but when we earnestly asked
   that they would present it rather in writing, then they produced the
   Commonitory.  This was read to us and also set down in the acts, which
   they are bringing with them to you.  In this they were bidden to treat
   of four things with us, first concerning the appeal of bishops to the
   Pontiff of the Roman Church, second that bishops should not
   unbecomingly be sailing to court, thirdly concerning the treating the
   causes of presbyters and deacons by contiguous bishops, if they had
   been wrongly excommunicated by their own, and fourthly concerning the
   bishop Urban who should be excommunicated or even sent to Rome, unless
   he should have corrected what seemed to need correction.  Of all which
   things concerning the first and third, that is that it is allowed to
   bishops to appeal to Rome and that the causes of clerics should be
   settled by the bishops of their own provinces, already last year we
   have taken pains to insinuate, in our letter to the same bishop Zosimus
   of venerable memory, that we were willing to observe these provisions
   for a little while without any injury to him, until the search for the
   statutes of the Council of Nice had been finished.  And now we ask of
   your holiness that you would cause to be observed by us the acts and
   constitutions of our fathers at the Council of Nice, and that you cause
   to be exercised by you there, those things which they brought in the
   commonitory:  that is to say, If a bishop shall have been accused,
   etc.  [Here follows Canon vii. of Sardica.]

   Item concerning presbyters and deacons.  If any bishop has been quickly
   angered, etc.  [Here follows Canon xvii. of Sardica.]

   These are the things which have been inserted in the acts until the
   arrival of the most accurate copies of the Nicene Council, which
   things, [485] if they are contained there (as in the Commonitory, which
   our brethren directed to us from the Apostolic See alleged) and be even
   kept according to that order by you in Italy, in no way could we be
   compelled either to endure such treatment as we are unwilling to
   mention or could suffer what is unbearable: [486]   but we believe,
   through the mercy of our Lord God, while your holiness presides over
   the Roman Church, we shall not have to suffer that pride (istum typhum
   passuri).  And there will be kept toward us, what should be kept with
   brotherly love to us who are making no dispute.  You will also perceive
   according to the wisdom and the justice which the most Highest has
   given thee, what should be observed, [487] if perchance the canons of
   the Council of Nice are other [than you suppose].  For although we have
   read very many copies, yet never have we read in the Latin copies that
   there were any such decrees as are contained in the commonitory before
   mentioned.  So too, because we can find them in no Greek text here, we
   have desired that there should be brought to us from the Eastern
   Churches copies of the decrees, for it is said that there correct
   copies of the decrees are to be found.  For which end we beg your
   reverence, that you would deign yourself also to write to the pontiffs
   of these parts, that is of the churches of Antioch, Alexandria, and
   Constantinople, [488] and to any others also if it shall please your
   holiness, that thence there may come to us the same canons decreed by
   the Fathers in the city of Nice, and thus you would confer by the help
   of the Lord this most great benefit upon all the churches of the West.
   For who can doubt that the copies of the Nicene Council gathered in the
   Greek empire are most accurate, which although brought together from so
   diverse and from such noble Greek churches are found to agree when
   compared together?  And until this be done, the provisions laid down to
   us in the Commonitory aforesaid, concerning the appeals of bishops to
   the pontiff of the Roman Church and concerning the causes of clerics
   which should be terminated by the bishops of their own provinces, we
   are willing to allow to be observed until the proof arrives and we
   trust your blessedness will help us in this according to the will of
   God.  The rest of the matters treated and defined in our synod, since
   the aforesaid brethren, our fellow bishop Faustinus, and the presbyters
   Philip and Asellus are carrying the acts with them, if you deign to
   receive them, will make known to your holiness.  And they signed. [489]
     Our Lord keep thee to us for many years, most blessed brother.
   Alypius, Augustine, Possidius, Marinus and the rest of the bishops
   (217) also signed.

   Here begin the rescripts to the African Council from Cyril bishop of
   Alexandria in which he sends the authentic proceedings of the Nicene
   Council, [490] translated from the Greek by Innocent the presbyter:
   these letters with the same Nicene council were also sent through the
   aforementioned presbyter Innocent and by Marcellus a subdeacon of the
   Church of Carthage, to the holy Boniface, bishop of the Roman Church,
   on the sixth day before the calends of December in the year 419. [491]

   To the most honourable lords, our holy brethren and fellow bishops,
   Aurelius, Valentinus, as well as to the whole holy synod met in
   Carthage, Cyril salutes your holiness in God.

   I have received with all joy at the hands of our son, the presbyter
   Innocent, the letters of your reverence so full of piety, in which you
   express the hope that we will send you most accurate copies of the
   decrees of the holy Fathers at the Synod held at Nice the metropolis of
   Bithynia from the archives of our church; with our own certificate of
   accuracy attached thereto.  In answer to which request, most honourable
   lords and brethren, I have thought it necessary to send to you, with
   our compliments, by our son, Innocent the presbyter, the bearer of
   these, most faithful copies of the decisions of the synod held at Nice
   in Bithynia.  And when ye have sought in the history of the church, you
   will find them there also.  Concerning Easter, as you have written, we
   announce to you that we shall celebrate it on the xviii^th [492] before
   the calends of May of the next indiction.  The subscription.  May God
   and our Lord preserve your holy synod as we desire, dear brethren.

   together in the Synod held at Carthage, Atticus the bishop.

   By our son Marcellus the subdeacon, I have received with all
   thanksgiving the writings of your holiness, praising the Lord that I
   enjoyed the blessing of so many of my brethren.  O my lords and most
   blessed brethren, ye have written asking me to send you most accurate
   copies of the canons enacted at the city of Nice, the metropolis of
   Bithynia, by the Fathers for the exposition of the faith.  And who is
   there that would deny to his brethren the common faith, or the statutes
   decreed by the Fathers.  Wherefore by the same son of mine, Marcellus,
   your subdeacon, who was in great haste, I have sent to you the canons
   in full as they were adopted by the Fathers in the city of Nice; and I
   ask of you that your holy synod would have me much in your prayers.
   The subscription.  May our God keep your sanctity, as we desire, most

   Canon CXXXVIII.  (Not numbered in the Greek.)

   Here beginneth the epistle of the African synod to Pope Celestine,
   bishop of the City of Rome.

   To the lord and most beloved and our honourable brother Celestine,
   Aurelius, Palatinus, Antony, Totus, Servusdei, Terentius, Fortunatus,
   Martin, Januarius, Optatus, Ceticius, Donatus, Theasius, Vincent,
   Fortunatian, and the rest of us, assembled at Carthage in the General
   Council of Africa.

   We could wish that, like as your Holiness intimated to us, in your
   letter sent by our fellow presbyter Leo, your pleasure at the arrival
   of Apiarius, so we also could send to you these writings with pleasure
   respecting his clearing.  Then in truth both our own satisfaction, and
   yours of late would be more reasonable; nor would that lately expressed
   by you concerning the hearing of him then to come, as well as that
   already past, seem hasty and inconsiderate.  Upon the arrival, then, of
   our holy Brother and fellow-Bishop Faustinus, we assembled a council,
   and believed that he was sent with that man, in order that, as he
   [Apiarius] had before been restored to the presbyterate by his
   assistance, so now he might with his exertions be cleared of the very
   great crimes charged against him by the inhabitants of Tabraca.  But
   the due course of examination in our council discovered in him such
   great and monstrous crimes as to overbear even Faustinus, who acted
   rather as an advocate of the aforementioned person than as a judge, and
   to prevail against what was more the zeal of a defender, than the
   justice of an inquirer.  For first he vehemently opposed the whole
   assembly, inflicting on us many injuries, under pretence of asserting
   the privileges of the Roman Church, and wishing that he should be
   received into communion by us, on the ground that your Holiness,
   believing him to have appealed, though unable to prove it, had restored
   him to communion.  But this we by no means allowed, as you will also
   better see by reading the acts.  After however, a most laborious
   inquiry carried on for three days, during which in the greatest
   affliction we took cognizance of various charges against him, God the
   just Judge, strong and long suffering, cut short by a sudden stroke
   both the delays of our fellow-bishop Faustinus and the evasions of
   Apiarius himself, by which he was endeavouring to veil his foul
   enormities.  For his strong and shameless obstinacy was overcome, by
   which he endeavoured to cover, through an impudent denial, the mire of
   his lusts, and God so wrought upon his conscience and published, even
   to the eyes of men, the secret crimes which he was already condemning
   in that man's heart, a very sty of wickedness, that, after his false
   denial he suddenly burst forth into a confession of all the crimes he
   was charged with, and at length convicted himself of his own accord of
   all infamies beyond belief, and changed to groans even the hope we had
   entertained, believing and desiring that he might be cleared from such
   shameful blots, except indeed that it was so far a relief to our
   sorrow, that he had delivered us from the labour of a longer inquiry,
   and by confession had applied some sort of remedy to his own wounds,
   though, lord and brother, it was unwilling, and done with a struggling
   conscience.  Premising, therefore, our due regards to you, we earnestly
   conjure you, that for the future you do not readily admit to a hearing
   persons coming hence, nor choose to receive to your communion those who
   have been excommunicated by us, because you, venerable Sir, will
   readily perceive that this has been prescribed even by the Nicene
   council.  For though this seems to be there forbidden in respect of the
   inferior clergy, or the laity, how much more did it will this to be
   observed in the case of bishops, lest those who had been suspended from
   communion in their own Province might seem to be restored to communion
   hastily or unfitly by your Holiness.  Let your Holiness reject, as is
   worthy of you, that unprincipled taking shelter with you of presbyters
   likewise, and the inferior clergy, both because by no ordinance of the
   Fathers hath the Church of Africa been deprived of this authority, and
   the Nicene decrees have most plainly committed not only the clergy of
   inferior rank, but the bishops themselves to their own Metropolitans.
   For they have ordained with great wisdom and justice, that all matters
   should be terminated in the places where they arise; and did not think
   that the grace of the Holy Spirit would be wanting to any Province, for
   the bishops of Christ (Sacerdotibus) wisely to discern, and firmly to
   maintain the right:  especially since whosoever thinks himself wronged
   by any judgment may appeal to the council of his Province, or even to a
   General Council [i.e. of Africa] unless it be imagined that God can
   inspire a single individual with justice, and refuse it to an
   innumerable multitude of bishops (sacerdotum) assembled in council.
   And how shall we be able to rely on a sentence passed beyond the sea,
   since it will not be possible to send thither the necessary witnesses,
   whether from the weakness of sex, or advanced age, or any other
   impediment?  For that your Holiness should send any on your part we can
   find ordained by no council of Fathers.  Because with regard to what
   you have sent us by the same our brother bishop Faustinus, as being
   contained in the Nicene Council, we can find nothing of the kind in the
   more authentic copies of that council, which we have received from the
   holy Cyril our brother, Bishop of the Alexandrine Church, and from the
   venerable Atticus the Prelate of Constantinople, and which we formerly
   sent by Innocent the presbyter, and Marcellus the subdeacon through
   whom we received them, to Boniface the Bishop, your predecessor of
   venerable memory.  Moreover whoever desires you to delegate any of your
   clergy to execute your orders, do not comply, lest it seem that we are
   introducing the pride of secular dominion into the Church of Christ
   which exhibiteth to all that desire to see God the light of simplicity
   and the day of humility.  For now that the miserable Apiarius has been
   removed out of the Church of Christ for his horrible crimes, we feel
   confident respecting our brother Faustinus, that through the
   uprightness and moderation of your Holiness, Africa, without violating
   brotherly charity, will by no means have to endure him any longer.
   Lord and brother, may our Lord long preserve your Holiness to pray for
   us. [497]

   Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXXVIII.

   Those excommunicated by us, ye are not be willing to admit afterwards
   to communion, according to the decree of the Nicene Synod.  For
   Apiarius, who was restored by you, has resisted the Synod, and treated
   it with scorn, and at length has been converted and confessed himself
   guilty with sighs and tears.

   Introductory Note.

   The acts of this Council are found in Balsamon, page 761 of the Paris
   edition, with Hervetus's translation.  Labbe [498] has taken Balsamon's
   text and inserted it into his Collection, from which the following
   translation is made.  There is another version extant in Leunclavius,
   Jus Græco-Roman. p. 247.

   On September the twenty-ninth of the year 394, a magnificent church,
   dedicated to SS. Peter and Paul, built by the munificence of Rufinus
   the Prætoreal prefect, and situated at a place called "the Oaks," a
   suburb of Chalcedon, was consecrated.  Most scholars have adopted
   Tillemont's suggestion that this was the occasion which brought the
   patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch to Constantinople, and that
   occasion was taken advantage of to hold a synod with regard to the
   dispute as to the see of Bostra.  At this council, in accordance with
   the canon of the Second Ecumenical Council, adopted only a dozen years
   before, Constantinople took the first place and its bishop presided,
   but so strong was the hold of Alexandria that three centuries
   afterwards the Quinisext Synod speaks of this council as held "under
   Nectarius and Theophilus."  In passing it may not be amiss to remark
   that St. Gregory of Nyssa and Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Flavian were
   present at this council!  Well may Tillemont [499] exclaim, "It is
   remarkable to see Theophilus there with Flavian, although they were not
   in communion with each other."

   Council of Constantinople Under Nectarius of Constantinople and

   (Found in Beveridge, Synodicon.  Tom. I., p. 678; Labbe and Cossart,
   Concilia, Tom. II., col. 1151.  Both taken from Balsamon.)

   In the consulate of our most religious and beloved-of-God Emperors,
   Flavius Arcadius Augustus, for the third time, and Honorius for the
   second time, on the third day before the calends of October, in the
   baptistery of the most holy church of Constantinople, when the most
   holy bishops had taken their seats [here follow the names], Nectarius,
   the bishop of Constantinople, said:  Since by the grace of God this
   synod has met in this holy place, if the synod of my holy brethren and
   fellow ministers in holy things thinks good, since I see our brothers
   Bagadius and Agapius, who contend between themselves about the
   bishopric of Bostra, are also present, let these begin to set forth
   their mutual rights.  And after some things had been done by them for
   the sake of this cause, and it had been shewn that the afore-named
   Bagadius was deposed by only two bishops, both of whom were dead,
   Arabianus, bishop of Ancyra, said:  Not on account of this judgment,
   but fearing henceforth for my whole life, I desire the holy Synod to
   make a decree, whether or no, a bishop can be deposed by only two
   bishops, and whether the Metropolitan is absent or not, without
   prejudice to the present cause.  For I fear that some, taking their
   power from these acts, may dare to attempt such things.  I wish
   therefore your response.

   Nectarius, the bishop of Constantinople, said:  The most religious
   bishop Arabianus hath spoken most laudably.  But since it is impossible
   to go backward in judgment, let us, without condemning that which is
   past, establish things for the future.  Arabianus, bishop of Ancyra,
   said:  The synod of blessed fathers who met at Nice condemns what has
   taken place, for it orders that not less than three shall ordain, nor
   even so without the metropolitan.  But of the future I, full of fear,
   have made this question.  I would wish therefore that you would say
   clearly and without delay or doubt, that a bishop could not, according
   to the decree of the Synod of Nice, lawfully be ordained or deposed by
   two men.

   And, after some further debate, Theophilus, the bishop of Alexandria,
   said:  Against those who have gone forth, no sentence of indignation
   can be pronounced, since those to be condemned were not present.  But
   if any one were to consider those who are to be deposed in future, it
   seems to me that not only these ought to assemble, but so far as
   possible all the other provincials, that by the sentence of many there
   may be rendered a more accurate condemnation of him who is present and
   is being judged, and who deserves deposition.  Nectarius, the bishop of
   Constantinople, said:  Since, the controversy is concerning legitimate
   institutions and decrees, it follows that nothing must be decreed on
   account of personal causes.  Wherefore as the most holy bishop
   Arabianus has said, wishing to make the future certain, the sentence of
   the most holy bishop Theophilus hath consistently and considerately
   decreed that for the future it shall be lawful not even for three, far
   less for two bishops to depose him who is examined as a defendant:  but
   by the sentence of the greater synod and of the bishops of the
   province, according to the Apostolic Canons.  Flavian, the bishop of
   Antioch, said:  What things the most holy bishop Nectarius, and the
   most holy bishop Theophilus have set forth are clearly right.  And all
   the ecclesiastics agreed with these.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome.

   In future when a defendant is examined, he ought not to be deposed by
   two or three bishops:  but by the sentence of the greater Synod and of
   his own provincials, as also the Apostolic Canons provide.

   Balsamon.

   As Bagadius, the bishop of Bostra, had been deposed by only two
   bishops, the matter was considered in the synod at Constantinople,
   whether that deposition had been rightly decreed.  Agapius, the elect,
   laying claim to it under the decision.  And it was decreed that the
   deposition was not canonical, since not two but a number should judge
   of those accusations which are made against bishops.  But know that
   this constitution has no force to-day, for by the twelfth canon of the
   synod of Carthage, which is much later, crimes charged against bishops
   are to be judged of by twelve bishops.  Read that canon, and know that
   this synod was held in the time of the Emperor Arcadius, while that of
   Carthage was in the days of Theodosius the younger.

   Zonaras explains that by the words "have gone forth" in the speech of
   Theophilus of Alexandria is to be understood have died.

   Introductory Note.

   It is commonly supposed by the commentators that what follows is the
   "Canon of St. Cyprian" referred to in the Second canon of the Synod in
   Trullo.  Johnson [500] thinks that that canon comes down to us as Canon
   XXXIX. of the Apostolic Canons.  Baronius [501] agrees with Asseman
   [502] in thinking that from hatred to Rome the Greeks adopted the
   theory of the non-validity of heretical baptism.  "But," as Hefele
   [503] well remarks, "in that case they would have contradicted
   themselves."

   Zonaras remarks:  "This is the most ancient of all the synods.  For
   that which was held at Antioch in Syria concerning Paul of Samosata was
   more ancient than the others, being holden in the time of the Roman
   Emperor Aurelius, but this one is still earlier.  For the great Cyprian
   finished his martyr course in the time of the Emperor Decius:  but
   there was a long interval between Aurelian and Decius.  For many
   emperors reigned after the death of Decius, to whom at last Aurelian
   succeeded on the throne.  Therefore this is by far the most ancient of
   all synods.  In it moreover above eighty-four bishops were gathered
   together, and considered the question as to what was to be done about
   the baptism of those who came to the Church after abandoning their
   heresies, and of schismatics who returned to the Church."

   a.d. 257.

   (Found in Beveridge, Synodicon, Tom. I., p. 365, and in Labbe and
   Cossart, Concilia, Tom. I., col. 786.)

   When very many bishops were met together at Carthage on the Calends of
   September from the province of Africa, Numidia and Mauritania, with the
   presbyters and deacons (the greater part of the people being likewise
   present) and when the holy letters of Jubaianus to Cyprian had been
   read, and Cyprian's answers to Jubaianus, concerning heretical
   baptisms, as well as what the same Jubaianus afterwards wrote to
   Cyprian,

   Cyprian said:  Ye have heard, my dearly beloved colleagues, what our
   fellow bishop Jubaianus has written to me, taking counsel of my
   littleness concerning the illicit and profane baptisms of heretics, and
   the answer which I made him; being of the same opinion as we have been
   on former occasions, that heretics coming to the Church should be
   baptized and sanctified with the Church's baptism.  Moreover there has
   been read to you also the other letter of Jubaianus, in which answering
   for his sincere and pious devotion to our letter, not only he agrees
   therewith but offered thanks that he has been so instructed by it.  It
   only remains therefore that we, each one of us, one by one, say what
   our mind is in this matter, without condemning any one or removing any
   one from the right of communion who does not agree with us.

   For no one [of us [504] ] has set himself up [to be] bishop [of
   bishops], [505] or attempted with tyrannical dread to force his
   colleagues to obedience to him, since every bishop has, for the license
   of liberty and power, his own will, and as he cannot be judged by
   another, so neither can he judge another.  But we await the judgment of
   our universal Lord, our Lord Jesus Christ, who one and alone hath the
   power, both of advancing us in the governance of his Church, and of
   judging of our actions [in that position].

   [The bishops then one by one declared against heretical baptism. [506]
   Last of all (col. 796)]:

   Cyprian, the Confessor and Martyr of Carthage, said:  The letter which
   was written to Jubaianus, my colleague, most fully set forth my
   opinion, that heretics who, according to the evangelical and apostolic
   witness, are called adversaries of Christ's and anti-Christs, when they
   come to the Church, should be baptized with the one (unico) baptism of
   the Church, that they may become instead of adversaries friends, and
   Christians instead of Antichrists.

   Notes.

   Zonaras.

   These are the opinions therefore of the fathers, which assembled in
   council with the great Cyprian:  but they do not apply to all heretics
   nor to all schismatics.  For the Second Ecumenical Council, as we have
   just said [i.e. in the Preface he has placed to the acts of the synod.
   Vide L. and C., Conc., Tom. i., col. 801] makes an exception of some
   heretics, and give its sanction to their reception without baptism,
   only requiring their anointing with the holy chrism, and then
   anathematizing at the same time their own and all heresies.

   Balsamon does not print the acts of the Council at all but only the
   letter of St. Cyprian (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. I., col.
   799.)  I have not thought it worth while to place here the remarks of
   the eighty-six bishops, hos me anankaiai, hoia mede energousai, to
   quote Zonaras's words.

   Binius.

   The allusion here is to the decree of Stephen, who was wont, according
   to the custom of his elders, to be styled "Bishop of bishops," and
   because he had acrimoniously threatened excommunication to all not
   agreeing with him.

   On the disputed historical fact as to whether St. Cyprian died in or
   out of the communion of the See of Rome the reader will do well to
   consult Puller, The Primitive Saints and the See of Rome.

   I place here St. Cyprian's Seventieth Epistle in the Oxford Translation
   (Epistle of St. Cyprian, pp. 232 et seqq.).  This letter is addressed
   to Januarius, Satterninus, etc., and is headed in Beveridge's Synodicon
   "Canon I."

   Epistle LXX.

   Cyprian, Liberalis, Caldonius, etc., to their brethren Januarius, etc.
   Greeting.

   When we were together in council, dearest brethren, we read the letter
   which you addressed to us respecting those who are thought to be
   baptized by heretics and schismatics, whether, when they come to the
   one true Catholic Church, they ought to be baptized.  Wherein, although
   ye yourselves also hold the Catholic rule in its truth and fixedness,
   yet since, out of our mutual affection, ye have thought good to consult
   us, we deliver not our sentence as though new but, by a kindred
   harmony, we unite with you in that long since settled by our
   predecessors, and observed by us; thinking, namely, and holding for
   certain, that no one can be baptized without the Church, in that there
   is one Baptism appointed in the holy Church, and it is written, the
   Lord himself speaking, "They have forsaken me, the Fountain of living
   water, and hewed them out broken cisterns that can hold no water."
   Again, holy Scripture admonishes us, and says, "Keep thee from the
   strange water, and drink not from a fountain of strange water."  The
   water then must first be cleansed and sanctified by the priest, that it
   may be able, by Baptism therein, to wash away the sins of the baptized,
   for the Lord says by the prophet Ezekiel, "Then will I sprinkle clean
   water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and
   from all your idols will I cleanse you; a new heart also will I give
   you, and a new spirit will I put within you."  But how can he cleanse
   and sanctify the water, who is himself unclean, and with whom the
   Spirit is not? whereas the Lord says in Numbers, "And whatsoever the
   unclean person toucheth shall be unclean."  Or how can he that
   baptizeth give remission of sins to another, who cannot himself free
   himself from his own sins, out of the Church?

   Moreover, the very interrogatory which is put in Baptism, is a witness
   of the truth.  For when we say, "Dost thou believe in eternal life, and
   remission of sins through the holy Church?" we mean, that remission of
   sins is not given, except in the Church; but that, with heretics, where
   the Church is not, sins cannot be remitted.  They, therefore, who claim
   that heretics can baptize, let them either change the interrogatory, or
   maintain the truth; unless indeed they ascribe a Church also to those
   who they contend have Baptism.

   Anointed also must he of necessity be, who is baptized, that having
   received the chrism--that is, unction, he may be the anointed of God,
   and have within him the grace of Christ.  Moreover, it is the Eucharist
   through which the baptized are anointed, the oil sanctified on the
   altar.  But he cannot sanctify the creature of oil, who has neither
   altar nor church.  Whence neither can the spiritual unction be with
   heretics, since it is acknowledged that the oil cannot be sanctified
   nor the Eucharist celebrated among them.  But we ought to know and
   remember that it is written, "Let not the oil of a sinner anoint my
   head;" which the Holy Ghost forewarned in the Psalms, lest any,
   quitting the track, and wandering out of the path of truth, be anointed
   by heretics and adversaries of Christ.  Moreover, when baptized, what
   kind of prayer can a profane priest and a sinner offer? in that it is
   written, "God heareth not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of
   God, and doeth his will, him he heareth."

   But who can give what himself hath not? or how can he perform spiritual
   acts, who hath himself lost the Holy Spirit?  Wherefore he is to be
   baptized and received, who comes uninitiated to the Church, that within
   he may be hallowed through the holy; for it is written, "Be ye holy,
   for I am holy, saith the Lord."  So that he who has been seduced into
   error and washed without should, in the true Baptism of the Church, put
   off this very thing also; that he, a man coming to God, while seeking
   for a priest, fell, through the deceit of error, upon one profane.  But
   to acknowledge any case where they have baptized, is to approve the
   baptism of heretics and schismatics.

   For neither can part of what they do be void and part avail.  If he
   could baptize, he could also give the Holy Ghost.  But if he cannot
   give the Holy Ghost because, being set without, he is not with the Holy
   Ghost, neither can he baptize any that cometh:  for that there is both
   one Baptism, and one Holy Ghost, and one Church, founded by Christ the
   Lord upon Peter, through an original and principle of unity; so it
   results, that since all among them is void and false, nothing that they
   have done ought to be approved by us.  For what can be ratified and
   confirmed by God, which they do whom the Lord calls his enemies and
   adversaries, propounding in his Gospel, "He that is not with me, is
   against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth."  And the
   blessed Apostle John also, keeping the commandments and precepts of the
   Lord, has written in his Epistle, "Ye have heard that Antichrist shall
   come; even now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is
   the last time.  They went out from us, but were not of us; for if they
   had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us."  Whence
   we, too, ought to infer and consider, whether they who are the
   adversaries of the Lord, and are called Antichrists, can give the grace
   of Christ.  Wherefore we who are with the Lord, and who hold the unity
   of the Lord, and according to this vouchsafement administer his
   priesthood in the Church, ought to repudiate and reject and account as
   profane, whatever his adversaries and Antichrists do; and to those who,
   coming from error and wickedness, acknowledge the true faith of the one
   Church, we should impart the reality of unity and faith by all the
   sacraments of Divine grace.

   We bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Introduction.

   Gibbon thus describes the Seventh Ecumenical Council of the Christian
   Church:  "The decrees were framed by the president [507] Tarasius, and
   ratified by the acclamations and subscriptions of three hundred and
   fifty bishops.  They unanimously pronounced that the worship of images
   is agreeable to Scripture and reason, to the Fathers and councils of
   the Church; but they hesitated whether that worship be relative or
   direct; whether the godhead and the figure of Christ be entitled to the
   same mode of adoration. [508]   Of this second Nicene Council the acts
   are still extant; a curious monument of superstition and ignorance, of
   falsehood and folly."  (Decline and Fall, chapter xlix.)

   And this has been read as history, and has passed as such in the
   estimation of the overwhelming majority of educated English-speaking
   people for several generations, and yet it is a statement as full of
   absolute and inexcusable errors as the passage in another part of the
   same work which the late Bishop Lightfoot so unmercifully exposed, and
   which the most recent editor, Bury, has taken pains to correct.

   I do not know whether it is worth while to do so, but perhaps it may be
   as well to state, that whatever may be his opinion of the truths of the
   conclusions arrived at by the council, no impartial reader can fail to
   recognize the profound learning [509] of the assembly, the singular
   acumen displayed in the arguments employed, and the remarkable freedom
   from what Gibbon and many others would consider "superstition."  So
   radical is this that Gibbon would have noticed it had he read the acts
   of the synod he is criticising (which we have good reason for believing
   that he never did).  There he would have found the Patriarch declaring
   that at that time the venerable images worked no miracles, a statement
   that would be made by no prelate of the Latin or Greek Church to-day,
   even in the light of the nineteenth century.

   As I have noted in the previous pages my task is not that of a
   controversialist.  To me at present it is a matter of no concern
   whether the decision of the council is true or false.  I shall
   therefore strictly confine myself to two points:  1. That the Council
   was Ecumenical.  2. What its decision was; explaining the technical
   meaning of the Greek words employed during this controversy and finally
   incorporated in the decree.

   1.  This Council was certainly Ecumenical.

   It seems strange that any person familiar with the facts of the case
   could for a moment entertain a doubt as to the ecumenical character of
   the council which met at Nice in 787.

   (a)  It was called by the Roman Emperors to be an Ecumenical Council.
   Vide letter of Tarasius.

   (b)  It was called with the approval of the Pope (not like I.
   Constantinople, without his knowledge; or like Chalcedon, contrary to
   his expressed wish), and two papal legates were present at its
   deliberations and signed its decrees.

   (c)  The Patriarch of Constantinople was present in person.

   (d)  The other Patriarchates were represented, although on account of
   the Moslem tyranny the Patriarchs could not attend in person, nor could
   they even send proctors.

   (e)  The decrees were adopted by an unanimous vote of the three hundred
   and fifty bishops.

   (f)  They were immediately received in all the four Eastern
   Patriarchates. [510]

   (g)  They were immediately accepted by the Pope.

   (h)  For a full thousand years they have been received by the Latin and
   Greek Churches with but a few exceptions altogether insignificant, save
   the Frankish kingdom.

   In the face of such undisputed facts, it would be strange were anyone
   to doubt the historical fact that the Second Council of Nice is one of
   the Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church, and indeed so far as I
   am aware none have done so except such as have been forced into this
   position for doctrinal consistency.

   Nor have all Protestants allowed their judgment to be warped in this
   matter.  As a sample I may quote from that stanch Protestant whom Queen
   Elizabeth appointed a chaplain in ordinary in 1598, and who in 1610 was
   made Dean of Gloucester, the profoundly learned Richard Field.  In his
   famous "Book of the Church" (Book V. chap. lj.), he says:  "These"
   [six, which he had just described] "were all the lawful General
   Councils (lawful, I say, both in their beginning and proceeding and
   continuance) that ever were holden in the Christian Church, touching
   matters of faith.  For the Seventh, which is the Second of Nice, was
   not called about any question of faith but of manners.  So that there
   are but Seven General Councils that the whole Church acknowledgeth,
   called to determine matters of faith and manners.  For the rest that
   were holden afterwards, which our adversaries [the Roman Catholics]
   would have to be acknowledged general, they are not only rejected by us
   but by the Grecians also, as not general, but patriarchal only, etc."

   Of course there are a number of writers (principally of the Anglican
   Communion), who have argued thus:  "The doctrine taught by the Second
   Council of Nice we reject, ergo it cannot have been an Ecumenical
   Council of the Catholic Church."  And they have then gone on to prove
   their conclusion.  With such writers I have no concern.  My simple
   contention is that the Council is admitted by all to have been
   representative of East and West, and to have been accepted for a
   thousand years as such, and to be to-day accepted as Ecumenical by the
   Latin and Greek Churches.  If its doctrines are false, then one of the
   Ecumenical Synods set forth false doctrine, a statement which should
   give no trouble, so far as I can understand, to anyone who does not
   hold the necessary infallibility of Ecumenical Synods. [511]

   Among those who have argued against the ecumenical character of the
   Seventh Council there are, however, two whose eminent learning and high
   standing demand a consideration of anything they may advance on any
   subject they treat of, these are the Rev. John Mason Neale and the Rev.
   Sir William Palmer.

   Dr. Neale considers the matter at some length in a foot-note to his
   History of the Eastern Church (Vol. II., pp. 132-135), but I think it
   not improper to remark that the author ingenuously confesses in this
   very note that if he came to the conclusion that the council was
   ecumenical, "it would be difficult to clear our own Church from the
   charge of heresy."  Entertaining such an opinion at the start, his
   conclusion could hardly be unbiassed.

   The only argument which is advanced in this note which is different
   from those of other opponents of the Council, is that it had not the
   authentication of a subsequent Ecumenical Synod.  The argument seems to
   me so extraordinary that I think Dr. Neale's exact words should be
   cited:  "In the first place, we may remark that the Second Council of
   Nicæa wants one mark of authority, shared according to the more general
   belief by the six--according to the opinions which an English Churchman
   must necessarily embrace by the first five Councils--its recognition as
   Ecumenical by a later Council undoubtedly so."  But surely this
   involves an absurdity, for if it is not known whether the last one is
   ecumenical or no, how will its approval of the next to the last give
   that council any certainty?  If III. Constantinople is doubtful being
   the sixth, because there is no seventh to have confirmed it; then II.
   Constantinople, the fifth, is doubtful because it has only been
   confirmed by a synod itself doubtful and so on, which is absurd.  The
   test of the ecumenicity of a council is not its acceptance by a
   subsequent synod, but its acceptance by the whole Church, and this Dr.
   Neale frankly confesses is the case with regard to II. Nice:  "It
   cannot be denied," he admits, "that at the present day both the Eastern
   and the Latin Churches receive it as Ecumenical" (p. 132).  He might
   have added, "and have done so without any controversy on the subject
   for nearly a thousand years."

   I do not think there is any need of my delaying longer over Dr. Neale's
   note, which I have noticed at all only because of his profound
   scholarship, and not because on this particular point I thought he had
   thrown any new light upon the matter, nor urged any argument really
   calling for an answer.

   Sir William Palmer's argument (A Treatise on the Church of Christ, Pt.
   IV., Chapter X., Sect. IV.) is one of much greater force, and needs an
   answer.  He points out how, long after the Council of Nice, the number
   of the General Councils was still spoken of as being Six, and that in
   some instances this council is referred to as the "pseudo" General
   Council of Nice.  Now at first sight this argument seems to be of great
   force.  But upon further consideration it will be seen to be after all
   of no great weight.  We may not be able to explain, nor are we called
   upon to do so, why in certain cases writers chose still to speak of Six
   instead of Seven General Councils, but we would point out that the same
   continuance of the old expression can be found with regard to others of
   the General Councils.  For example, St. Gregory the Great says that he
   "revered the four Ecumenical Councils as he did the four Gospels," but
   the fifth Ecumenical Synod had been held a number of years before.
   Will anyone pretend from this to draw the conclusion that at that time
   the Ecumenical character of the Fifth Synod (II. Constantinople) was
   not recognized at Rome?  Moreover, among the instances cited (and there
   are but a very few all told) one of them is fatal to the argument.  For
   if Pope Hadrian in 871 still speaks of only six Ecumenical Synods, he
   omits two (according to Roman count), for this date is after the synod
   which deposed Photius--a synod rejected indeed afterwards by the
   Greeks, but always accepted by the Latins as the Eighth of the
   Ecumenical Councils.  Would Sir William pretend for an instant that
   Hadrian and the Church of Rome did not recognize that Council as
   Ecumenical and as the Eighth Synod?  He could not, for on page 208 he
   ingenuously confesses that that Council "had been approved and
   confirmed by that Pope."

   But after all, the contention fails in its very beginning, for Sir
   William frankly recognizes that the Popes from the first espoused the
   cause of the council and were ready to defend it.  Now this involved
   the acknowledgment of its ecumenical character, for it was called as an
   Ecumenical Synod, this we expressly learn from the letter of Tarasius
   to the other Eastern Patriarchs (Labbe, Conc., Tom. VII., col. 165),
   from the letter of the Emperor and Empress to the bishops throughout
   the empire (L. and C., Conc., Tom. VII., col. 53), and (above all) from
   the witness of the Council itself, assuming the style of the "Holy
   Ecumenical Synod."  In the face of such evidence any further proof is
   surely uncalled for.

   We come now to the only other argument brought against the ecumenical
   character of this council--to wit, that many writers, even until after
   the beginning of the XVI^th century, call the Seventh a
   "pseudo-Council."  But surely this proves too much, for it would seem
   to imply that even down to that time the cultus of images was not
   established in the West, a proposition too ridiculous to be defended by
   anyone.  It is indeed worthy of notice that all the authors cited are
   Frankish, (1) the Annales Francorum (a.d. 808) in the continuation of
   the same (a.d. 814), in an anonymous life of Charlemagne, and the
   Annales written after 819; (2) Eginhard in his Annales Francorum (a.d.
   829); (3) the Gallican bishops at Paris, 824; [512] (4) Hincmar of
   Rheims; (5) Ado, bishop of Vienne (died 875); (6) Anastasius
   acknowledges that the French had not accepted the veneration of the
   sacred images; (7) The Chronicle of St. Bertinus (after 884); (8) The
   Annales Francorum after the council still speak of it as pseudo; (9)
   Regino, Abbot of Prum (circa 910); (10) the Chronicle of St. Bertinus,
   of the X^th Century.  (11) Hermanus Contractus:  (12) the author who
   continued the Gestes Francorum to a.d. 1165; (13) Roger Hoverden (a.d.
   1204); (14) Conrade à Lichtenau, Abbot of Urspurg (circa 1230); (15)
   Matthew of Westminster.

   No doubt to these, given in Palmer, who has made much use of Lannoy,
   others could be added; but they are enough to shew that the council was
   very little known, and that none of these writers had ever seen its
   acts.

   Sir William is of opinion that by what precedes in his book he has
   "proved that for at least five centuries and a half the Council of Nice
   remained rejected in the Western Church."  I venture to think that the
   most he has proved is that during that period of time he has been able
   to find fifteen individuals who for one reason or another wrote
   rejecting that council, that is to say three in a century, a number
   which does not seem quite sufficient to make the foundation of so
   considerable a generalization as "the Western Church."  The further
   conclusion of Sir William, I think, every scholar will reject as simply
   preposterous, viz.:  "In fact the doctrine of the adoration of images
   [by which he means the doctrine taught by the II. Council of Nice] was
   never received in the West, except where the influence of the Roman See
   was predominant" (p. 211).

   Sir William is always, however, honest, and the following quotation
   which he himself makes from Cardinal Bellarmine may well go far toward
   explaining the erroneous or imperfect statements he has so learnedly
   and laboriously gathered together.  "Bellarmine says:  It is very
   credible that St. Thomas, Alexander of Hales, and other scholastic
   doctors had not seen the second synod of Nice, nor the eighth general
   synod;' he adds that they were long in obscurity, and were first
   published in our own age, as may be known from their not being extant
   in the older volumes of the councils; and St. Thomas and the other
   ancient schoolmen never make any mention of this Nicene Synod.'  (Bell.
   De Imag. Sanct. Lib. II. cap. xxij.)"

   2.  What the Council decreed.

   The council decreed that similar veneration and honour should be paid
   to the representations of the Lord and of the Saints as was accustomed
   to be paid to the "laurata" and tablets representing the Christian
   emperors, to wit, that they should be bowed to, and saluted with
   kisses, and attended with lights and the offering of incense. [513]
   But the Council was most explicit in declaring that this was merely a
   veneration of honour and affection, such as can be given to the
   creature, and that under no circumstances could the adoration of divine
   worship be given to them but to God alone.

   The Greek language has in this respect a great advantage over the
   Hebrew, the Latin and the English; it has a word which is a general
   word and is properly used of the affectionate regard and veneration
   shown to any person or thing, whether to the divine Creator or to any
   of his creatures, this word is proskunesis; it has also another word
   which can properly be used to denote only the worship due to the most
   high, God, this word is latreia.  When then the Council defined that
   the worship of "latria "was never to be given to any but God alone, it
   cut off all possibility for idolatry, mariolatry, iconolatry, or any
   other "latry" except "theo-latry."  If therefore any of these other
   "latries" exist or ever have existed, they exist or have existed not in
   accordance with, but in defiance of, the decree of the Second Council
   of Nice.

   But unfortunately, as I have said, we have neither in Hebrew, Latin,
   nor English any word with this restricted meaning, and therefore when
   it became necessary to translate the Greek acts and the decree, great
   difficulty was experienced, and by the use of "adoro" as the equivalent
   of proskuneo many were scandalized, thinking that it was divine
   adoration which they were to give to the sacred images, which they knew
   would be idolatry.  The same trouble is found in rendering into English
   the acts and decrees; for while indeed properly speaking "worship" no
   more means necessarily divine worship in English than "adoratio" does
   in Latin (e.g. I. Chr. xxix. 20, "All the congregation bowed down their
   heads and worshipped the Lord and the King" [i.e. Solomon]; Luke xiv.
   10, "Then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at
   meat with thee"), yet to the popular mind "the worship of images" is
   the equivalent of idolatry.  In the following translations I have
   uniformly translated as follows and the reader from the English will
   know what the word is in the original.

   Proskuneo, to venerate; timao, to honour; latreuo, to adore; aspazomai,
   to salute; douleuo, to serve; eikon, an image.

   The relative force of proskunesis and latreia cannot better be set
   forth than by Archbishop Trench's illustration of two circles having
   the same centre, the larger including the less (New Testament Synonyms,
   sub voce Latreuo).

   To make this matter still clearer I must ask the reader's attention to
   the use of the words abadh and shachah in the Hebrew; the one abadh,
   which finds, when used with reference to God or to false gods its
   equivalent in latreuo; the other shachah, which is represented by
   proskuneo .  Now in the Old Testament no distinction in the Hebrew is
   drawn between these words when applied to creator or creature.  The one
   denotes service primarily for hire; the other bowing down and kissing
   the hand to any in salutation.  Both words are constantly used and
   sometimes refer to the Creator and sometimes to the creature--e.g., we
   read that Jacob served (abadh) Laban (Gen. xxix. 20); and that Joshua
   commanded the people not to serve the gods of their fathers but to
   serve (abadh) the Lord (Josh. xxiv. 14).  And for the use of shachah
   the following may suffice:  "And all the congregation blessed the Lord
   God of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshipped (Hebrew,
   shachah; Greek, proskuneo ; Latin, adoro) the Lord and the King" (I.
   Chr. xxix. 20).  But while it is true of the Hebrew of the Old
   Testament that there is no word which refers alone to Divine Worship
   this is not true of the Septuagint Greek nor of the Greek of the New
   Testament, for in both proskuneo has always its general meaning,
   sometimes applying to the creature and sometimes to the Creator; but
   latreuo is used to denote divine worship alone, as St. Augustine
   pointed out long ago.

   This distinction comes out very clearly in the inspired translation of
   the Hebrew found in Matthew iv. 10, "Thou shalt worship (proskuneseis)
   the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve (latreuseis )."
   "Worship" was due indeed to God above all but not exclusively to him,
   but latria is to be given to "him only." [514]

   I think I have now said enough to let the reader understand the
   doctrine taught by the council and to prove that in its decree it
   simply adopted the technical use of words found in the Greek of the
   Septuagint and of the New Testament.  I may then close this
   introduction with a few remarks upon outward acts of veneration in
   general.

   Of course, the outward manifestation in bodily acts of reverence will
   vary with times and with the habits of peoples.  To those accustomed to
   kiss the earth on which the Emperor had trodden, it would be natural to
   kiss the feet of the image of the King of Kings.  The same is
   manifestly true of any outward acts whatever, such as bowing, kneeling,
   burning of lights, and offering of incense.  All these when offered
   before an image are, according to the mind of the Council, but outward
   signs of the reverence due to that which the image represents and pass
   backward to the prototype, and thus it defined, citing the example of
   the serpent in the wilderness, of which we read, "For he that turned
   himself toward it was not saved by the thing that he saw, but by thee,
   that art the Saviour of all" (Wisdom xvi. 17).  If anyone feels
   disposed to attribute to outward acts any necessary religious value he
   is falling back into Judaism, and it were well for him to remember that
   the nod which the Quakers adopted out of protest to the bow of
   Christians was once the expression of divine worship to the most sacred
   idols; that in the Eastern Church the priest only bows before the Lord
   believed to be present in the Holy Sacrament while he prostrates
   himself before the infidel Sultan; and that throughout the Latin
   communion the acolytes genuflect before the Bishop, as they pass him,
   with the same genuflection that they give to the Holy Sacrament upon
   the Altar.  In this connexion I quote in closing the fine satire in the
   letter of this very council to the Emperor and Empress.  St. Paul "says
   of Jacob (Heb. xi. 21), He worshipped the top of his staff,' and like
   to this is that said by Gregory, surnamed the theologian, Revere
   Bethlehem and worship the manger.'  But who of those truly
   understanding the Divine Scriptures would suppose that here was
   intended the Divine worship of latria?  Such an opinion could only be
   entertained by an idiot or one ignorant of Scriptural and Patristic
   knowledge.  Would Jacob give divine worship to his staff?  Or would
   Gregory, the theologian, give command to worship as God a manger!"

   [508] Worship is "relative" or "absolute," what Gibbon means by
   "direct" would be hard to say.  How entirely false the whole statement
   is, Gibbon himself would have recognized had he read the acts.

   [509] Dr. Neale complains that the acts display a painful lack of
   critical knowledge and that several spurious passages are attributed to
   the Fathers.  But I confess this does not seem to me either surprising
   or disgraceful.  The attributing of books, even in our critical days,
   to persons who were not their authors is not so uncommon as to make us
   wonder such a thing might have occurred in such stormy times, when
   learning of this sort must have suffered by the adversities of the
   Church and State, the Iconoclastic persecutions and the Moslem
   incursions.

   [510] "It is certain," confesses Dr. Neale (History of the Holy Eastern
   Church, Vol. II., p. 113; in his attempt to overthrow the authority of
   this council) "that Politian approved (S. Theod. Stud. Ep. xviij.)
   although he was not present at the council of Nicæa; and the
   controversy, which had never much disturbed Africa, may henceforth be
   considered as terminated in the Diocese of Alexandria."

   [511] As a sample of all that bigotry and dishonesty can do when
   writing on such a subject, the reader is referred to a little book by
   the Rev. F. Meyrick (a canon of the Church of England) published in
   Paris for the Anglo-Continental Society, 1877, entitled, Du Schisme
   d'Orient et de l'authorité du prétendu septième concile.

   The Divine [516] Sacra [517] Sent by the Emperors Constantine and Irene
   to the Most Holy and Most Blessed Hadrian, Pope of Old Rome.

   (Found in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 32.)

   They who receive the dignity of the empire, or the honour of the
   principal priesthood from our Lord Jesus Christ, ought to provide and
   to care for those things which please him, and rule and govern the
   people committed to their care according to his will and good pleasure.

   Therefore, O most holy Head (Caput), it is incumbent upon us and you,
   that irreprehensibly we know the things which be his, and that in these
   we exercise ourselves, since from him we have received the imperatorial
   dignity, and you the dignity of the chief priesthood.

   But now to speak more to the point.  Your paternal blessedness knows
   what hath been done in times past in this our royal city against the
   venerable images, how those who reigned immediately before us destroyed
   them and subjected them to disgrace and injury:  (O may it not be
   imputed to them, for it had been better for them had they not laid
   their hands upon the Church!)--and how they seduced and brought over to
   their own opinion all the people who live in these parts--yea, even the
   whole of the East, in like manner, up to the time in which God hath
   exalted us to this kingdom, who seek his glory in truth, and hold that
   which has been handed down by his Apostles together with all other
   teachers.  Whence now with pure heart and unfeigned religion we have,
   together with all our subjects and our most learned divines, had
   constant conferences respecting the things which relate to God, and by
   their advice have determined to summon a General Council.  And we
   entreat your paternal blessedness, or rather the Lord God entreats,
   "who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the
   truth," that you will give yourself to us and make no delay, but come
   up hither to aid us in the confirmation and establishment of the
   ancient tradition of venerable images.  It is, indeed, incumbent on
   your holiness to do this, since you know how it is written--"Comfort
   ye, comfort ye, my people, ye priests, saith the Lord," and "the lips
   of the priest shall keep knowledge, and the law shall go forth out of
   his mouth, for he is the angel of the Lord of Hosts."  And again, the
   divine Apostle, the preacher of the truth, who, "from Jerusalem and
   round about unto Illyricum, preached the Gospel," hath thus commanded--
   "Feed with discipline the flock of Christ which he purchased with his
   own blood."  As then you are the veritable chief priest (primus
   sacerdos) who presides in the place and in the see of the holy and
   superlaudable Apostle Peter, let your paternal blessedness come to us,
   as we have said before, and add your presence to all those other
   priests who shall be assembled together here, that thus the will of the
   Lord may be accomplished.  For as we are taught in the Gospels our Lord
   saith--"When two or three are met together in my name, there am I in
   the midst of them"--let your paternal and sacred blessedness be
   certified and confirmed by the great God and King of all, our Lord
   Jesus Christ, and by us his servants, that if you come up hither you
   shall be received with all honour and glory, and that everything
   necessary for you shall be granted.  And again, when the definition
   (capitulum) shall be completed, which by the good pleasure of Christ
   our God we hope shall be done, we take upon us to provide for you every
   facility of returning with honour and distinction.  If, however, your
   blessedness cannot attend upon us (which we can scarcely imagine,
   knowing what is your zeal about divine things), at least, pray select
   for us men of understanding, having with them letters from your
   holiness, that they may be present here in the person of your sacred
   and paternal blessedness.  So, when they meet with the other priests
   who are here, the ancient tradition of our holy fathers may be
   synodically confirmed, and every evil plant of tares may be rooted out,
   and the words of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ may be fulfilled,
   that "the gates of hell shall not prevail against her."  And after
   this, may there be no further schism and separation in the one holy
   Catholic and Apostolic Church, of which Christ our true God is the
   Head.

   We have had Constantine, beloved in Christ, most holy Bishop of
   Leontina in our beloved Sicily, with whom your paternal blessedness is
   well acquainted, into our presence; and, having spoken with him face to
   face, have sent him with this our present venerable jussio to you.
   Whom, after that he hath seen you, forthwith dismiss, that he may come
   back to us, and write us by him concerning your coming--what time we
   may expect will be spent in your journeying thence and coming to us.
   Moreover, he can retain with him the most holy Bishop of Naples, and
   come up hither together with him.  And, as your journey will be by way
   of Naples and Sicily we have given orders to the Governor of Sicily
   about this, that he take due care to have every needful preparation
   made for your honour and rest, which is necessary in order that your
   paternal blessedness may come to us.  Given on the iv^th before the
   calends of September, the seventh indiction, from the Royal City.

   The Imperial Sacra.

   Read at the First Session.

   (Found in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 49.)

   Constantine and Irene--Sovereigns of the Romans in the Faith, to the
   most holy Bishops, who, by the grace of God and by the command of our
   pious Sovereignty, have met together in the Council of Nice.

   The Wisdom which is truly according to the nature of God and the
   Father--our Lord Jesus Christ, our true God--who, by his most divine
   and wonderful dispensation in the flesh, hath delivered us from all
   idolatrous error:  and, by taking on him our nature, hath renewed the
   same by the co-operation of the Spirit, which is of the same nature
   with himself; and having himself become the first High Priest, hath
   counted you holy men, worthy of the same dignity.

   He is that good Shepherd who, bearing on his own shoulders that
   wandering sheep--fallen man, hath brought him back to his own peculiar
   folds--that is, the party of angelic and ministering powers (Eph. ii.
   14, 15), and hath reconciled us in himself and having taken away the
   wall of partition, hath broken down the enmity through his flesh, and
   hath bestowed upon us a rule of conduct tending to peace; wherefore,
   preaching to all, he saith in the Gospel, Blessed are the peacemakers,
   for they shall be called the children of God (Matt. v. 9).  Of which
   blessedness, confirming as it does the exaltation of the adoption of
   sons, our pious Sovereignty desiring above all things to be made
   partakers, hath ever applied the utmost diligence to direct all our
   Roman Commonwealth into the ways of unity and concord; and more
   especially have we been solicitous concerning the right regulation of
   the Church of God, and most anxious in every way to promote the unity
   of the priesthood.  For which cause the Chiefs of the Sacerdotal Order
   of the East and of the North, of the West and of the South, are present
   in the person of their Representative Bishops, who have with them
   respectively the replies written in answers to the Synodical Epistle
   sent from the most holy Patriarch; for such was from the beginning the
   synodical regulation of the Church Catholic, which, from the one end of
   the earth to the other, hath received the Gospel.  On this account we
   have, by the good will and permission of God, caused you, his most holy
   Priests, to meet together --you who are accustomed to dispense his
   Testimony in the unbloody sacrifice--that your decision may be in
   accordance with the definitions of former councils who decreed rightly,
   and that the splendour of the Spirit may illumine you in all things,
   for, as our Lord teaches, No man lighteth a candle and putteth it under
   a bushel, but on a candlestick, that it may give light to all that are
   in the house; even so, should ye make such use of the various
   regulations which have been piously handed down to us of old by our
   Fathers, that all the Holy Churches of God may remain in peaceful
   order.

   As for us, such was our zeal for the truth--such our earnest desire for
   the interests of religion, our care for ecclesiastical order, our
   anxiety that the ancient rules and orders should maintain their
   ground--that though fully engaged in military councils--though all our
   attention was occupied in political cares--yet, treating all these
   affairs as but of minor importance, we would allow nothing whatever to
   interfere with the convocation of your most holy council.  To every one
   is given the utmost freedom of expressing his sentiments without the
   least hesitation, that thus the subject under enquiry may be most fully
   discussed and truth may be the more boldly spoken, that so all
   dissensions may be banished from the Church and we all may be united in
   the bonds of peace.

   For, when the most holy Patriarch Paul, by the divine will, was about
   to be liberated from the bands of mortality and to exchange his earthly
   pilgrimage for a heavenly home with his Master Christ, he abdicated the
   Patriarchate and took upon him the monastic life, and when we asked
   him, Why hast thou done this? he answered, Because I fear that, if
   death should surprise me still in the episcopate of this royal and
   heaven-defended city, I should have to carry with me the anathema of
   the whole Catholic Church, which consigns me to that outer darkness
   which is prepared for the devil and his angels; for they say that a
   certain synod hath been held here in order to the subversion of
   pictures and images which the Catholic Church holds, embraces, and
   receives, in memory of the persons whom they represent.  This is that
   which distracts my soul--this is that which makes me anxiously to
   enquire how I may escape the judgment of God--since among such men I
   have been brought up and with such am I numbered.  No sooner had he
   thus spoken in the presence of some of our most illustrious nobles than
   he expired.

   When our Pious Sovereignty reflected on this awful declaration (and
   truly, even before this event, we had heard of similar questionings
   from many around), we took counsel with ourselves as to what ought to
   be done; and we determined, after mature deliberation, that when a new
   Patriarch had been elected, we should endeavour to bring this subject
   to some decisive conclusion.  Wherefore, having summoned those whom we
   knew to be most experienced in ecclesiastical matters, and having
   called upon Christ our God, we consulted with them who was worthy to be
   exalted to the chair of the Priesthood of this Royal and God-preserved
   city; and they all with one heart and soul gave their vote in favour of
   Tarasius--he who now occupies the Pontifical Presidency.  Having,
   therefore, sent for him, we laid before him our deliberations and our
   vote; but he would by no means consent, nor at all yield to that which
   had been determined.  And when we enquired, Wherefore he thus refused
   his consent?--at first he answered evasively, That the yoke of the
   Chief Priesthood was too much for him.  But we, knowing this to be a
   mere pretext coveting his unwillingness to obey us, would not desist
   from our importunity, but persisted in pressing the acceptance of the
   dignity of the Chief Priesthood upon him.  When he found how urgent we
   were with him, he told us the cause of his refusal.  It is (said he)
   because I perceive that the Church which has been founded on the rock,
   Christ our God, is rent and torn asunder by schisms, and that we are
   unstable in our confession, and that Christians in the East, of the
   same faith with ourselves, decline communion with us, and unite them
   with those of the West; and so we are estranged from all, and each day
   are anathematized by all:  and, moreover, I should demand that an
   Ecumenical Council should be held, at which should be found Legates
   from the Pope of Rome and from the Chief Priests of the East.  We,
   therefore, fully understanding these things, introduced him to the
   assembled company of the Priests--of our most illustrious Princes--and
   of all our Christian people; and then, in their presence, he repeated
   to them all that he had before said to us; which, when they heard, they
   received him joyfully, and earnestly entreated our peace-making and
   pious Sovereignty that an Ecumenical Council might be assembled.  To
   this their request, we gave our hearty consent; for, to speak the
   truth, it is by the good will and under the direction of our God that
   we have assembled you together.  Wherefore as God, willing to establish
   his own counsel, hath for this purpose brought you together from all
   parts of the world, behold the Gospels now lying before you, and
   plainly crying aloud, "Judge justly;" stand firm as champions of
   religion, and be ready with unsparing hand to cut away all innovations
   and new fangled inventions.  And, as Peter the Chief of the Apostolic
   College, struck the mad slave and cut off his Jewish ear with the
   sword, so in like manner do ye wield the axe of the Spirit, and every
   tree which bears the fruit of contention, of strife, or newly-imported
   innovation, either renew by transplanting through the words of sound
   doctrine, or lay it low with canonical censure, and send it to the
   fires of the future Gehenna, so that the peace of the Spirit may
   evermore protect the whole body of the Church, compacted and united in
   one, and confirmed by the traditions of the Fathers; and so may all our
   Roman State enjoy peace as well as the Church.

   We have received letters from Hadrian, most Holy Pope of old Rome, by
   his Legates--namely, Peter, the God-beloved Archpresbyter, and Peter,
   the God-beloved Presbyter and Abbot--who will be present in council
   with you; and we command that, according to synodical custom, these be
   read in the hearing of you all; and that, having heard these with
   becoming silence, and moreover the Epistles contained in two octavos
   sent by the Chief Priest and other Priests of the Eastern dioceses by
   John, most pious Monk and Chancellor of the Patriarchal throne of
   Antioch, and Thomas, Priest and Abbot, who also are present together
   with you, ye may by these understand what are the sentiments of the
   Church Catholic on this point.

   Extracts from the Acts.

   Session I.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 53.)

   [Certain bishops who had been led astray by the Iconoclasts came,
   asking to be received back.  The first of these was Basil of Ancyra.]

   The bishop Basil of Ancyra read as follows from a book; Inasmuch as
   ecclesiastical legislation has canonically been handed down from past
   time, even from the beginning from the holy Apostles, and from their
   successors, who were our holy fathers and teachers, and also from the
   six holy and ecumenical synods, and from the local synods which were
   gathered in the interests of orthodoxy, that those returning from any
   heresy whatever to the orthodox faith and to the tradition of the
   Catholic Church, might deny their own heresy, and confess the orthodox
   faith,

   Wherefore I, Basil, bishop of the city of Ancyra, proposing to be
   united to the Catholic Church, and to Hadrian the most holy Pope of Old
   Rome, and to Tarasius the most blessed Patriarch, and to the most holy
   apostolic sees, to wit, Alexandria, Antioch, and the Holy City, as well
   as to all orthodox high-priests and priests, make this written
   confession of my faith, and I offer it to you as to those who have
   received power by apostolic authority.  And in this also I beg pardon
   from your divinely gathered holiness for my tardiness in this matter.
   For it was not right that I should have fallen behind in the confession
   of orthodoxy, but it arose from my entire lack of knowledge, and
   slothful and negligent mind in the matter.  Wherefore the rather I ask
   your blessedness to grant me indulgence in God's sight.

   I believe, therefore, and make my confession in one God, the Father
   Almighty, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, and in
   the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life.  The Trinity, one in
   essence and one in majesty, must be worshipped and glorified in one
   godhead, power, and authority.  I confess all things pertaining to the
   incarnation of one of the Holy Trinity, our Lord and God, Jesus Christ,
   as the Saints and the six Ecumenical Synods have handed down.  And I
   reject and anathematize every heretical babbling, as they also have
   rejected them.  I ask for the intercessions (presbeias ) of our
   spotless Lady the Holy Mother of God, and those of the holy and
   heavenly powers, and those of all the Saints. [518]

   And receiving their holy and honourable reliques with all honour
   (times), I salute and venerate these with honour (timetikos proskuneo),
   hoping to have a share in their holiness.  Likewise also the venerable
   images (eikonas) of the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
   humanity he assumed for our salvation; and of our spotless Lady, the
   holy Mother of God; and of the angels like unto God; and of the holy
   Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs, and of all the Saints--the sacred images
   of all these, I salute and venerate--rejecting and anathematizing with
   my whole soul and mind the synod which was gathered together out of
   stubbornness and madness, and which styled itself the Seventh Synod,
   but which by those who think accurately was called lawfully and
   canonically a pseudo-synod, as being contrary to all truth and piety,
   and audaciously and temerariously against the divinely handed down
   ecclesiastical legislation, yea, even impiously having yelped at and
   scoffed at the holy and venerable images, and having ordered these to
   be taken away out of the holy churches of God; over which assembly
   presided Theodosius with the pseudonym of Ephesius, Sisinnius of Perga,
   with the surname Pastillas, Basilius of Pisidia, falsely called
   "tricaccabus;" with whom the wretched Constantine, the then Patriarch,
   was led (emataiothe) astray.

   These things thus I confess and to these I assent, and therefore in
   simplicity of heart and in uprightness of mind, in the presence of God,
   I have made the subjoined anathematisms.

   Anathema to the calumniators of the Christians, that is to the image
   breakers.

   Anathema to those who apply the words of Holy Scripture which were
   spoken against idols, to the venerable images.

   Anathema to those who do not salute the holy and venerable images.

   Anathema to those who say that Christians have recourse to the images
   as to gods.

   Anathema to those who call the sacred images idols.

   Anathema to those who knowingly communicate with those who revile and
   dishonour the venerable images.

   Anathema to those who say that another than Christ our Lord hath
   delivered us from idols.

   Anathema to those who spurn the teachings of the holy Fathers and the
   tradition of the Catholic Church, taking as a pretext and making their
   own the arguments of Arius, Nestorius, Eutyches, and Dioscorus, that
   unless we were evidently taught by the Old and New Testaments, we
   should not follow the teachings of the holy Fathers and of the holy
   Ecumenical Synods, and the tradition of the Catholic Church.

   Anathema to those who dare to say that the Catholic Church hath at any
   time sanctioned idols.

   Anathema to those who say that the making of images is a diabolical
   invention and not a tradition of our holy Fathers.

   This is my confession [of faith] and to these propositions I give my
   assent.  And I pronounce this with my whole heart, and soul, and mind.

   And if at any time by the fraud of the devil (which may God forbid!) I
   voluntarily or involuntarily shall be opposed to what I have now
   professed, may I be anathema from the Father, the Son and the Holy
   Ghost, and from the Catholic Church and every hierarchical order a
   stranger.

   I will keep myself from every acceptance of a bribe and from filthy
   lucre in accordance with the divine canons of the holy Apostles and of
   the approved Fathers.

   Tarasius, the most holy Patriarch, said:  This whole sacred gathering
   yields glory and thanks to God for this confession of yours, which you
   have made to the Catholic Church.

   The Holy Synod said:  Glory to God which maketh one that which was
   severed.

   [Theodore, bishop of Myra, then read the same confession, and was
   received.  The next bishop who asked to be received read as follows:
   (col. 60)]

   Theodosius, the humble Christian, to the holy and Ecumenical Synod:  I
   confess and I agree to (suntithemai) and I receive and I salute and I
   venerate in the first place the spotless image of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, our true God, and the holy image of her who bore him without
   seed, the holy Mother of God, and her help and protection and
   intercessions each day and night as a sinner to my aid I call for,
   since she has confidence with Christ our God, as he was born of her.
   Likewise also I receive and venerate the images of the holy and most
   laudable Apostles, prophets, and martyrs and the fathers and
   cultivators of the desert.  Not indeed as gods (God forbid!) do I ask
   all these with my whole heart to pray for me to God, that he may grant
   me through their intercessions to find mercy at his hands at the day of
   judgment, for in this I am but showing forth more clearly the affection
   and love of my soul which I have borne them from the first.  Likewise
   also I venerate and honour and salute the reliques of the Saints as of
   those who fought for Christ and who have received grace from him for
   the healing of diseases and the curing of sicknesses and the casting
   out of devils, as the Christian Church has received from the holy
   Apostles and Fathers even down to us to-day.

   Moreover, I am well pleased that there should be images in the churches
   of the faithful, especially the image of our Lord Jesus Christ and of
   the holy Mother of God, of every kind of material, both gold and silver
   and of every colour, so that his incarnation may be set forth to all
   men.  Likewise there may be painted the lives of the Saints and
   Prophets and Martyrs, so that their struggles and agonies may be set
   forth in brief, for the stirring up and teaching of the people,
   especially of the unlearned.

   For if the people go forth with lights and incense to meet the
   "laurata" and images of the Emperors when they are sent to cities or
   rural districts, they honour surely not the tablet covered over with
   wax, but the Emperor himself.  How much more is it necessary that in
   the churches of Christ our God, the image of God our Saviour and of his
   spotless Mother and of all the holy and blessed fathers and ascetics
   should be painted?  Even as also St. Basil says:  "Writers and painters
   set forth the great deeds of war; the one by word, the other by their
   pencils; and each stirs many to courage."  And again the same author
   "How much pains have you ever taken that you might find one of the
   Saints who was willing to be your importunate intercessor to the Lord?"
   [519]   And Chrysostom says, "The charity of the Saints is not
   diminished by their death, nor does it come to an end with their exit
   from life, but after their death they are still more powerful than when
   they were alive," and many other things without measure.  Therefore I
   ask you, O ye Saints!  I call out to you.  I have sinned against heaven
   and in your sight.  Receive me as God received the luxurious man, and
   the harlot, and the thief.  Seek me out, as Christ sought out the sheep
   that was lost, which he carried on his shoulders; so that there may be
   joy in the presence of God and of his angels over my salvation and
   repentance, through your intervention, O all-holy lords!  Let them who
   do not venerate the holy and venerable images be anathema!  Anathema to
   those who blaspheme against the honourable and venerable images!  To
   those who dare to attack and blaspheme the venerable images and call
   them idols, anathema!  To the calumniators of Christianity, that is to
   say the Iconoclasts, anathema!  To those who do not diligently teach
   all the Christ-loving people to venerate and salute the venerable and
   sacred and honourable images of all the Saints who pleased God in their
   several generations, anathema!  To those who have a doubtful mind and
   do not confess with their whole hearts that they venerate the sacred
   images, anathema!

   Sabbas, the most reverend hegumenus of the monastery of the Studium,
   said:  According to the Apostolic precepts and the Ecumenical Synods he
   is worthy to be received back.

   Tarasius, the most holy Patriarch, said:  Those who formerly were the
   calumniators of orthodoxy, now are become the advocates of the truth.

   [Near the end of this session, (col. 77)]

   John, the most reverend bishop and legate of the Eastern high priests
   said:  This heresy is the worst of all heresies.  Woe to the
   iconoclasts!  It is the worst of heresies, as it subverts the
   incarnation (oikonomian ) of our Saviour. [520]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [518] Thus far there was no expression of opinion from which the
   Iconoclasts would have dissented, for in all that regarded the Blessed
   Virgin and the Saints and their invocation and patronage, the heretics
   agreed with the orthodox.  Protestants have been in the habit of
   treating the Iconoclasts as if they were substantially agreed with them
   with regard to the cultus of the Blessed Virgin and of the other
   Saints.  What an error this is, is easily proved by citing two of the
   anathematisms of their Conciliabulum. "If anyone shall not confess that
   the Ever-virgin Mary is properly and truly the Mother of God, and more
   exalted than every creature, whether visible or invisible, and does not
   seek her intercessions with sincere faith because she has confidence in
   approaching our God. who was born of her, let him be anathema." (L. and
   C., Conc., Tom. VII., col. 524.) "If anyone does not confess that all
   the Saints from the beginning down to now, who whether before the Law,
   or under the Law, or in grace pleased God, should be honoured in his
   presence both with soul and body, and does not seek their prayers,
   according to the tradition of the Church as of those having confidence
   to plead for the world, let him be anathema."  (Ibid. col. 528.)

   [519] Mendham seems to have reversed the sense here altogether.

   [520] In the English Hefele (Vol. V., p. 363) this appears in the
   following most extraordinary form.  "John...declared that the
   veneration of images was the worst of all heresies because it detracted
   from the Economy (Incarnation) of the Redeemer.'"  (!)

   Session II.

   [The Papal Letters were presented by the Legates.  First was read that
   to Constantine and Irene, but not in its entirety, if we may trust
   Anastasius the Librarian, who gives what he says is the original Latin
   text.  Here follows a translation of this and of the Greek, also a
   translation of the Latin passage altogether omitted, (as we are told)
   with the consent of the Roman Legates.]

   Part of Pope Hadrian's Letter.

   [As written by the Pope.]

   (Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. XCVI., col. 1217.)

   If you persevere in that orthodox Faith in which you have begun, and
   the sacred and venerable images be by your means erected again in those
   parts, as by the lord, the Emperor Constantine of pious memory, and the
   blessed Helen, who promulgated the orthodox Faith, and exalted the holy
   Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church your spiritual mother, and with the
   other orthodox Emperors venerated it as the head of all Churches, so
   will your Clemency, that is protected of God, receive the name of
   another Constantine, and another Helen, through whom at the beginning
   the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church derived strength, and like whom
   your own imperial fame is spread abroad by triumphs, so as to be
   brilliant and deeply fixed in the whole world.  But the more, if
   following the traditions of the orthodox Faith, you embrace the
   judgment of the Church of blessed Peter, chief of the Apostles, and, as
   of old your predecessors the holy Emperors acted, so you, too,
   venerating it with honour, love with all your heart his Vicar, and if
   your sacred majesty follow by preference their orthodox Faith,
   according to our holy Roman Church.  May the chief of the Apostles
   himself, to whom the power was given by our Lord God to bind and remit
   sins in heaven and earth, be often your protector, and trample all
   barbarous nations under your feet, and everywhere make you conquerors.
   For let sacred authority lay open the marks of his dignity, and how
   great veneration ought to be shewn to his, the highest See, by all the
   faithful in the world.  For the Lord set him who bears the keys of the
   kingdom of heaven as chief over all, and by Him is he honoured with
   this privilege, by which the keys of the kingdom of heaven are
   entrusted to him.  He, therefore, that was preferred with so exalted an
   honour was thought worthy to confess that Faith on which the Church of
   Christ is founded.  A blessed reward followed that blessed confession,
   by the preaching of which the holy universal Church was illumined, and
   from it the other Churches of God have derived the proofs of Faith.
   For the blessed Peter himself, the chief of the Apostles, who first sat
   in the Apostolic See, left the chiefship of his Apostolate, and
   pastoral care, to his successors, who are to sit in his most holy seat
   for ever.  And that power of authority, which he received from the Lord
   God our Saviour, he too bestowed and delivered by divine command to the
   Pontiffs, his successors, etc.

   [As read in Greek to the Council.]

   (Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. XCVI., col. 1218.)

   If the ancient orthodoxy be perfected and restored by your means in
   those regions, and the venerable icons be placed in their original
   state, you will be partakers with the Lord Constantine, Emperor of old,
   now in the Divine keeping, and the Empress Helena, who made conspicuous
   and confirmed the orthodox Faith, and exalted still more your holy
   mother, the Catholic and Roman and spiritual Church, and with the
   orthodox Emperors who ruled after them, and so your most pious and
   heaven-protected name likewise will be set forth as that of another
   Constantine and another Helena, being renowned and praised through the
   whole world, by whom the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church is
   restored.  And especially if you follow the tradition of the orthodox
   Faith of the Church of the holy Peter and Paul, the chief Apostles, and
   embrace their Vicar, as the Emperors who reigned before you of old both
   honoured their Vicar, and loved him with all their heart:  and if your
   sacred majesty honour the most holy Roman Church of the chief Apostles,
   to whom was given power by God the Word himself to loose and to bind
   sins in heaven and earth.  For they will extend their shield over your
   power, and all barbarous nations shall be put under your feet:  and
   wherever you go they will make you conquerors.  For the holy and chief
   Apostles themselves, who set up the Catholic and orthodox Faith, have
   laid it down as a written law that all who after them are to be
   successors of their seats, should hold their Faith and remain in it to
   the end.

   [The part which was never read to the Council at all.]

   (Found in L. and C., Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 117.)

   We greatly wondered that in your imperial commands, directed for the
   Patriarch of the royal city, Tarasius, we find him there called
   Universal:  but we know not whether this was written through ignorance
   or schism, or the heresy of the wicked.  But henceforth we advise your
   most merciful and imperial majesty, that he be by no means called
   Universal in your writings, because it appears to be contrary to the
   institutions of the holy Canons and the decrees of the traditions of
   the holy Fathers.  For he never could have ranked second, save for the
   authority of our holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, as is plain to
   all. [521]   Because if he be named Universal, above the holy Roman
   Church which has a prior rank, which is the head of all the Churches of
   God, it is certain that he shews himself as a rebel against the holy
   Councils, and a heretic.  For, if he is Universal, he is recognized to
   have the Primacy even over the Church of our See, which appears
   ridiculous to all faithful Christians:  because in the whole world the
   chief rank and power was given to the blessed Apostle Peter by the
   Redeemer of the world himself; and through the same Apostle, whose
   place we unworthily hold, the holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church
   holds the first rank, and the authority of power, now and for ever, so
   that if any one, which we believe not, has called him, or assents to
   his being called Universal, let him know that he is estranged from the
   orthodox Faith, and a rebel against our holy Catholic and Apostolic
   Church.

   [After the reading was ended (col. 120)]

   Tarasius the most holy patriarch said:  Did you yourselves receive
   these letters from the most holy Pope, and did you carry them to our
   pious Emperor?

   Peter and Peter the most beloved-of-God presbyters who held the place
   of Hadrian, the most holy pope of Rome, said:  We ourselves received
   such letters from our apostolic father and delivered them to the pious
   lords.

   John, the most magnificent Logothete, said:  That this is the case is
   also known to the Sicilians, the beloved of God Theodore, the bishop of
   Catanea, and the most revered deacon Epiphanius who is with him, who
   holds the place of the archbishop of Sardinia.  For both of these at
   the bidding of our pious Emperors, went to Rome with the most reverend
   apocrisarius of our most holy patriarch.

   Theodore the God-beloved bishop of Catanea, standing in the midst,
   said:  The pious emperor, by his honourable jussio, bid send Leo, the
   most god-beloved presbyter (who together with myself is a slave of your
   holiness), with the precious letter of his most sacred majesty; and he
   who reveres our [sic in Greek, "your," in Latin] holiness, being the
   governor (strategos ) of my province of Sicily, sent me to Rome with
   the pious jussio of our orthodox Emperors. [522]

   And when we were gone, we announced the orthodox faith of the pious
   emperors.

   And when the most blessed Pope heard it, he said:  Since this has come
   to pass in the days of their reign, God has magnified their pious rule
   above all former reigns.  And this suggestion (anaphoran) which has
   been read he sent to our most pious kings together with a letter to
   your holiness and with his vicars who are here present and presiding.

   Cosmas, the deacon, notary, and chamberlain (Cubuclesius) said:  And
   another letter was sent by the most holy Pope of Old Rome to Tarasius,
   our most holy and oecumenical Patriarch.  Let it be disposed of as your
   holy assembly shall direct.

   The Holy Synod said, Let it be read.

   [Then was read Hadrian's letter to Tarasius of Constantinople, which
   ends by saying that, "our dearly-loved proto-presbyter of the Holy
   Church of Rome, and Peter, a monk, a presbyter, and an abbot, who have
   been sent by us to the most tranquil and pious emperors, we beg you
   will deem them worthy of all kindness and humane amenity for the sake
   of St. Peter, coropheus of the Apostles, and for our sakes, so that for
   this we may be able to offer you our sincere thanks." [523] The letter
   being ended (col. 128),]

   Peter and Peter, the most reverend presbyters and representatives of
   the most holy Pope of Old Rome said:  Let the most holy Tarasius,
   Patriarch of the royal city, say whether he agrees (stoichei) with the
   letters of the most holy Pope of Old Rome or not.

   Tarasius the most holy patriarch said:  The divine Apostle Paul, who
   was filled with the light of Christ, and who hath begotten us through
   the gospel, in writing to the Romans, commending their zeal for the
   true faith which they had in Christ our true God, thus said:  "Your
   faith is gone forth into all the world."  It is necessary to follow out
   this witness, and he that would contradict it is without good sense.
   Wherefore Hadrian, the ruler of Old Rome, since he was a sharer of
   these things, thus borne witness to, wrote expressly and truly to our
   religious Emperors, and to our humility, confirming admirably and
   beautifully the ancient tradition of the Catholic Church.  And we also
   ourselves, having examined both in writing, [524] and by inquisition,
   and syllogistically and by demonstration, and having been taught by the
   teachings of the Fathers, so have confessed, so do confess, and so will
   confess; and shall be fast, and shall remain, and shall stand firm in
   the sense of the letters which have just been read, receiving the
   imaged representations according to the ancient tradition of our holy
   fathers; and these we venerate with firmly-attached [525] affection, as
   made in the name of Christ our God, and of our Spotless Lady the Holy
   Mother of God, and of the Holy Angels, and of all the Saints, most
   clearly giving our adoration and faith to the one only true God.

   And the holy Synod said:  The whole holy Synod thus teaches.

   Peter and Peter, the God-loved presbyters and legates of the Apostolic
   See, said:  Let the holy Synod say whether it receives the letters of
   the most holy Pope of Old Rome.

   The holy Synod said:  We follow, we receive, we admit them.

   [The bishops then give one by one their votes all in the same sense.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [521] This statement seems somewhat open to criticism in view of the
   position taken by St. Leo, and of the assertion of Pope Gelasius that
   Constantinople was a suffragan see to Heraclea.

   [522] The meaning of the passage is obscure, but Mendham's translation
   seems clearly wrong.

   [523] Compare with this the statement of the famous historian, Gibbon
   (Chapter XLIX., N. 79), "The pope's legates were casual messengers, two
   priests without any special commission, and who were disavowed on their
   return.  Some vagabond monks were persuaded by the Catholics to
   represent the Oriental patriarchs.  This curious anecdote is revealed
   by Theodore Studites, one of the warmest Iconoclasts of the age."  And
   yet to this tissue of false statements Bury, in his just-published
   edition of Gibbon (1898), has no note of correction to make!  And this
   has passed, and will pass, for history among the overwhelming majority
   of English readers!  Nor does there seem to be any possible excuse for
   Gibbon in either particular, the first statement is proved to be false
   by the letters of Hadrian, the second statement is equally disproved by
   the letters of the "high priests of the East," in which it is quite
   clear that no claim was set up that they represented the Patriarchs,
   but the Patriarchates, which they did, as they proved, in a very real
   sense.  This letter Gibbon must have seen, if indeed he ever took the
   trouble to read the Acts, for it is spread out in full in Actio Secunda
   and was read at length to the Council.

   [524] Mendham here has translated "The Scriptures," following the
   Latin, the Greek is graphikos.

   [525] Mendham translates schetiko "relative," which is a quite possible
   rendering.

   Session III.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 188.)

   Constantine, the most holy bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, said:  Since
   I, unworthy that I am, find that the letter which has just been read,
   which was sent from the East to Tarasius the most holy archbishop and
   ecumenical patriarch, is in no sense changed from that confession of
   faith which he himself had before made, to these I consent and become
   of one mind, receiving and saluting with honour the holy and venerable
   images.  But the worship of adoration I reserve alone to the
   supersubstantial and life-giving Trinity.  And those who are not so
   minded, and do not so teach I cast out of the holy Catholic and
   Apostolic Church, and I smite them with anathema, and I deliver them
   over to the lot of those who deny the incarnation and the bodily
   economy of Christ our true God.

   Notes.

   Hefele.

   (Hist. Councils, Vol. V., p. 366.)

   By false translation and misunderstanding the Frankish bishops
   subsequently at the Synod of Frankfort, a.d. 794, and also in the
   Carolingian books (iii. 17), understood this to mean that a demand had
   been made at Nicæa that the same devotion should be offered to the
   images as to the Most Holy Trinity.

   Under these circumstances it is clear that the Franks could do nothing
   but reject the decrees.  I have treated of this whole matter elsewhere.

   Extracts from the Acts.

   Session IV.

   [Among numerous passages of the Fathers one was read from a sermon by
   St. Gregory Nyssen in which he describes a painting representing the
   sacrifice of Isaac and tells how he could not pass it "without tears."]

   The most glorious princes said:  See how our father grieved at the
   depicted history, even so that he wept.

   Basil, the most holy bishop of Ancyra, said:  Many times the father had
   read the story, but perchance he had not wept; but when once he saw it
   painted, he wept.

   John the most reverend monk and presbyter and representative of the
   Eastern high priests, said:  If to such a doctor the picture was
   helpful and drew forth tears, how much more in the case of the ignorant
   and simple will it bring compunction and benefit.

   The holy Synod said:  We have seen in several places the history of
   Abraham painted as the father says.

   Theodore the most holy bishop of Catanea, said:  If the holy Gregory,
   vigilant [526] in divine cogitation, was moved to tears at the sight of
   the story of Abraham, how much more shall a painting of the incarnation
   of our Lord Christ, who for us was made man, move the beholders to
   their profit and to tears?

   Tarasius the most holy Patriarch said:  Shall we not weep when we see
   an image of our crucified Lord?

   The holy Synod said:  We shall indeed--for in that shall be found
   perfectly the profundity of the abasement of the incarnate God for our
   sakes.

   [Post nonnulla a passage is read from St. Athanasius in which he
   describes the miracles worked at Berytus, after which there is found
   the following (col. 224),]

   Tarasius, the most holy Patriarch, said:  But perhaps someone will say,
   Why do not the images which we have work miracles?  To which we answer,
   that as the Apostle has said, signs are for those who do not believe,
   not for believers.  For they who approached that image were
   unbelievers.  Therefore God gave them a sign through the image, to draw
   them to our Christian faith.  But "an evil and adulterous generation
   that seeketh after a sign and no sign shall be given it."

   [After a number of other quotations, was read the Canon of the Council
   in Trullo as a canon of the Sixth Synod (col. 233).]

   Tarasius, the most holy Patriarch said:  There are certain affected
   with the sickness of ignorance who are scandalized by these canons
   [viz. of the Trullan Synod] and say, And do you really think they were
   adopted at the Sixth Synod?  Now let all such know that the holy great
   Sixth Synod was assembled at Constantinople concerning those who said
   that there was but one energy and will in Christ.  These anathematized
   the heretics, and having expounded the orthodox faith, they went to
   their homes in the fourteenth year of Constantine.  But after four or
   five years the same [527] fathers came together under Justinian, the
   son of Constantine, and set forth the before-mentioned canons.  And let
   no one doubt concerning them.  For they who subscribed under
   Constantine were the same as they who under Justinian signed the
   present chart, as can manifestly be established from the unchangeable
   similarity of their own handwriting.  For it was right that they who
   had appeared at an ecumenical synod should also set forth
   ecclesiastical canons.  They said that we should be led as (by the
   hand) by the venerable images to the recollection of the incarnation of
   Christ and of his saving death, and if by them we are led to the
   realization of the incarnation of Christ our God, what sort of an
   opinion shall we have of them who break down the venerable images?

   [At the close of the Session, after a number of anathematisms had been
   pronounced, the following was read, to which all the bishops subscribed
   (col. 317).]

   Fulfilling the divine precept of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ, our
   holy Fathers did not hide the light of the divine knowledge given by
   him to them under a bushel, but they set it upon the candlestick of
   most useful teaching, so that it might give light to all in the
   house--that is to say, to those who are born in the Catholic Church;
   lest perchance anyone of those who piously confess the Lord might
   strike his foot against the stone of heretical evil doctrine.  For they
   expelled every error of heretics and they cut off the rotten member if
   it was incurably sick.  And with a fan they purged the floor.  And the
   good wheat, that is to say the word which nourisheth and which maketh
   strong the heart of man, they laid up in the granary of the Catholic
   Church; but throwing outside the chaff of heretical evil opinion they
   burned it with unquenchable fire.  Therefore also this holy and
   ecumenical Synod, met together for the second time in this illustrious
   metropolis of Nice, by the will of God and at the bidding of our pious
   and most faithful Emperors, Irene a new Helena, and a new Constantine,
   her God-protected offspring, having considered by their perusal the
   teachings of our approved and blessed Fathers, hath glorified God
   himself, from whom there was given to them wisdom for our instruction,
   and for the perfecting of the Catholic and Apostolic Church:  and
   against those who do not believe as they did, but have attempted to
   overshadow the truth through their novelty, they have chanted the words
   of the psalm: [528]   "Oh how much evil have thine enemies done in thy
   sanctuary; and have glorified themselves, saying, There is not a
   teacher any more, and they shall not know that we treated with guile
   the word of truth."  But we, in all things holding the doctrines and
   precepts of the same our God-bearing Fathers, make proclamation with
   one mouth and one heart, neither adding anything, nor taking anything
   away from those things which have been delivered to us by them.  But in
   these things we are strengthened, in these things we are confirmed.
   Thus we confess, thus we teach, just as the holy and ecumenical six
   Synods have decreed and ratified.  We believe in one God the Father
   Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible; and in one Lord
   Jesus Christ, his only-begotten Son and Word, through whom all things
   were made, and in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life,
   consubstantial and coeternal with the same Father and with his Son who
   hath had no beginning.  The unbuilt-up, indivisible, incomprehensible,
   and non-circumscribed Trinity; he, wholly and alone, is to be
   worshipped and revered with adoration; one Godhead, one Lordship, one
   dominion, one realm and dynasty, which without division is apportioned
   to the Persons, and is fitted to the essence severally.  For we confess
   that one of the same holy and consubstantial Trinity, our Lord Jesus
   Christ the true God, in these last days was incarnate and made man for
   our salvation, and having saved our race through his saving
   incarnation, and passion, and resurrection, and ascension into heaven;
   and having delivered us from the error of idols; as also the prophet
   says, Not an ambassador, not an angel, but the Lord himself hath saved
   us.  Him we also follow, and adopt his voice, and cry aloud; No Synod,
   no power of kings, no God-hated agreement hath delivered the Church
   from the error of the idols, as the Jewdaizing conciliabulum hath madly
   dreamed, which raved against the venerable images; but the Lord of
   glory himself, the incarnate God, hath saved us and hath snatched us
   from idolatrous deceit.  To him therefore be glory, to him be thanks,
   to him be eucharists, to him be praise, to him be magnificence.  For
   his redemption and his salvation alone can perfectly save, and not that
   of other men who come of the earth.  For he himself hath fulfilled for
   us, upon whom the ends of the earth are come through the economy of his
   incarnation, the words spoken beforehand by his prophets, for he dwelt
   among us, and went in and out among us, and cast out the names of idols
   from the earth, as it was written.  But we salute the voices of the
   Lord and of his Apostles through which we have been taught to honour in
   the first place her who is properly and truly the Mother of God and
   exalted above all the heavenly powers; also the holy and angelic
   powers; and the blessed and altogether lauded Apostles, and the
   glorious Prophets and the triumphant Martyrs which fought for Christ,
   and the holy and God-bearing Doctors, and all holy men; and to seek for
   their intercessions, as able to render us at home with the all-royal
   God of all, so long as we keep his commandments, and strive to live
   virtuously.  Moreover we salute the image of the honourable and
   life-giving Cross, and the holy reliques of the Saints; and we receive
   the holy and venerable images:  and we salute them, and we embrace
   them, according to the ancient traditions of the holy Catholic Church
   of God, that is to say of our holy Fathers, who also received these
   things and established them in all the most holy Churches of God, and
   in every place of his dominion.  These honourable and venerable images,
   as has been said, we honour and salute and reverently venerate:  to
   wit, the image of the incarnation of our great God and Saviour Jesus
   Christ, and that of our spotless Lady the all-holy Mother of God, from
   whom he pleased to take flesh, and to save and deliver us from all
   impious idolatry; also the images of the holy and incorporeal Angels,
   who as men appeared to the just.  Likewise also the figures and
   effigies of the divine and all-lauded Apostles, also of the
   God-speaking Prophets, and of the struggling Martyrs and of holy men.
   So that through their representations we may be able to be led back in
   memory and recollection to the prototype, and have a share in the
   holiness of some one of them.

   Thus we have learned to think of these things, and we have been
   strengthened by our holy Fathers, and we have been strengthened by
   their divinely handed down teaching.  And thanks be to God for his
   ineffable gift, that he hath not deserted us at the end nor hath the
   rod of the ungodly come into the lot of the righteous, lest the
   righteous put their hands, that is to say their actual deeds, [529]
   unto wickedness.  But he doeth well unto those who are good and true of
   heart, as the psalmist David melodiously has sung; with whom also we
   sing the rest of the psalm:  As for such as turn back unto their own
   wickedness, the Lord shall lead them forth with the evil doers; and
   peace shall be upon the Israel of God.

   Session VI.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 389.)

   Leo the most renowned secretary said:  The holy and blessed Synod know
   how at the last session we examined divers sayings of the God-forsaken
   heretics, who had brought charges against the holy and spotless Church
   of the Christians for the setting up of the holy images.  But to-day we
   have in our hands the written blasphemy of those calumniators of the
   Christians, that is to say, the absurd, and easily answered, and
   self-convicting definition (horon) of the pseudosyllogus, in all
   respects agreeing with the impious opinion of the God-hated heretics.
   But not only have we this, but also the artful and most drastic
   refutation thereof, which the Holy Spirit had supervised.  For it was
   right that this definition should be made a triumph by wise
   contradictions, and should be torn to pieces with strong refutations.
   This also we submit so as to know your pleasure with regard to it.

   The holy Synod said:  Let it be read.

   John, the deacon and chancellor [of the most holy great Church of
   Constantinople, in Lat. only] read.

   [John, the deacon, then read the orthodox refutation, and Gregory, the
   bishop of Neocæsarea, the Definition of the Mock Council, the one
   reading the heretical statement and the other the orthodox answer.]

   The Definition of the Holy, Great, and Ecumenical Seventh Synod.

   The holy and Ecumenical synod, which by the grace of God and most pious
   command of the God-beloved and orthodox Emperors, Constantine and Leo,
   [531] now assembled in the imperial residence city, in the temple of
   the holy and inviolate Mother of God and Virgin Mary, surnamed in
   Blachernæ, have decreed as follows.

   Satan misguided men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of
   the Creator.  The Mosaic law and the prophets cooperated to undo this
   ruin; but in order to save mankind thoroughly, God sent his own Son,
   who turned us away from error and the worshipping of idols, and taught
   us the worshipping of God in spirit and in truth.  As messengers of his
   saving doctrine, he left us his Apostles and disciples, and these
   adorned the Church, his Bride, with his glorious doctrines.  This
   ornament of the Church the holy Fathers and the six Ecumenical Councils
   have preserved inviolate.  But the before-mentioned demi-urgos of
   wickedness could not endure the sight of this adornment, and gradually
   brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.  As then
   Christ armed his Apostles against the ancient idolatry with the power
   of the Holy Spirit, and sent them out into all the world, so has he
   awakened against the new idolatry his servants our faithful Emperors,
   and endowed them with the same wisdom of the Holy Spirit.  Impelled by
   the Holy Spirit they could no longer be witnesses of the Church being
   laid waste by the deception of demons, and summoned the sanctified
   assembly of the God-beloved bishops, that they might institute at a
   synod a scriptural examination into the deceitful colouring of the
   pictures (homoiomaton) which draws down the spirit of man from the
   lofty adoration (latreias) of God to the low and material adoration
   (latreian) of the creature, and that they, under divine guidance, might
   express their view on the subject.

   Our holy synod therefore assembled, and we, its 338 members, follow the
   older synodal decrees, and accept and proclaim joyfully the dogmas
   handed down, principally those of the six holy Ecumenical Synods.  In
   the first place the holy and ecumenical great synod assembled at Nice,
   etc.

   After we had carefully examined their decrees under the guidance of the
   Holy Spirit, we found that the unlawful art of painting living
   creatures blasphemed the fundamental doctrine of our salvation--namely,
   the Incarnation of Christ, and contradicted the six holy synods.  These
   condemned Nestorius because he divided the one Son and Word of God into
   two sons, and on the other side, Arius, Dioscorus, Eutyches, and
   Severus, because they maintained a mingling of the two natures of the
   one Christ.

   Wherefore we thought it right, to shew forth with all accuracy, in our
   present definition the error of such as make and venerate these, for it
   is the unanimous doctrine of all the holy Fathers and of the six
   Ecumenical Synods, that no one may imagine any kind of separation or
   mingling in opposition to the unsearchable, unspeakable, and
   incomprehensible union of the two natures in the one hypostasis or
   person.  What avails, then, the folly of the painter, who from sinful
   love of gain depicts that which should not be depicted--that is, with
   his polluted hands he tries to fashion that which should only be
   believed in the heart and confessed with the mouth?  He makes an image
   and calls it Christ.  The name Christ signifies God and man.
   Consequently it is an image of God and man, and consequently he has in
   his foolish mind, in his representation of the created flesh, depicted
   the Godhead which cannot be represented, and thus mingled what should
   not be mingled.  Thus he is guilty of a double blasphemy--the one in
   making an image of the Godhead, and the other by mingling the Godhead
   and manhood.  Those fall into the same blasphemy who venerate the
   image, and the same woe rests upon both, because they err with Arius,
   Dioscorus, and Eutyches, and with the heresy of the Acephali.  When,
   however, they are blamed for undertaking to depict the divine nature of
   Christ, which should not be depicted, they take refuge in the excuse:
   We represent only the flesh of Christ which we have seen and handled.
   But that is a Nestorian error.  For it should be considered that that
   flesh was also the flesh of God the Word, without any separation,
   perfectly assumed by the divine nature and made wholly divine.  How
   could it now be separated and represented apart?  So is it with the
   human soul of Christ which mediates between the Godhead of the Son and
   the dulness of the flesh.  As the human flesh is at the same time flesh
   of God the Word, so is the human soul also soul of God the Word, and
   both at the same time, the soul being deified as well as the body, and
   the Godhead remained undivided even in the separation of the soul from
   the body in his voluntary passion.  For where the soul of Christ is,
   there is also his Godhead; and where the body of Christ is, there too
   is his Godhead.  If then in his passion the divinity remained
   inseparable from these, how do the fools venture to separate the flesh
   from the Godhead, and represent it by itself as the image of a mere
   man?  They fall into the abyss of impiety, since they separate the
   flesh from the Godhead, ascribe to it a subsistence of its own, a
   personality of its own, which they depict, and thus introduce a fourth
   person into the Trinity.  Moreover, they represent as not being made
   divine, that which has been made divine by being assumed by the
   Godhead.  Whoever, then, makes an image of Christ, either depicts the
   Godhead which cannot be depicted, and mingles it with the manhood (like
   the Monophysites), or he represents the body of Christ as not made
   divine and separate and as a person apart, like the Nestorians.

   The only admissible figure of the humanity of Christ, however, is bread
   and wine in the holy Supper.  This and no other form, this and no other
   type, has he chosen to represent his incarnation.  Bread he ordered to
   be brought, but not a representation of the human form, so that
   idolatry might not arise.  And as the body of Christ is made divine, so
   also this figure of the body of Christ, the bread, is made divine by
   the descent of the Holy Spirit; it becomes the divine body of Christ by
   the mediation of the priest who, separating the oblation from that
   which is common, sanctifies it.

   The evil custom of assigning names to the images does not come down
   from Christ and the Apostles and the holy Fathers; nor have these left
   behind them any prayer by which an image should be hallowed or made
   anything else than ordinary matter.

   If, however, some say, we might be right in regard to the images of
   Christ, on account of the mysterious union of the two natures, but it
   is not right for us to forbid also the images of the altogether
   spotless and ever-glorious Mother of God, of the prophets, apostles,
   and martyrs, who were mere men and did not consist of two natures; we
   may reply, first of all:  If those fall away, there is no longer need
   of these.  But we will also consider what may be said against these in
   particular.  Christianity has rejected the whole of heathenism, and so
   not merely heathen sacrifices, but also the heathen worship of images.
   The Saints live on eternally with God, although they have died.  If
   anyone thinks to call them back again to life by a dead art, discovered
   by the heathen, he makes himself guilty of blasphemy.  Who dares
   attempt with heathenish art to paint the Mother of God, who is exalted
   above all heavens and the Saints?  It is not permitted to Christians,
   who have the hope of the resurrection, to imitate the customs of
   demon-worshippers, and to insult the Saints, who shine in so great
   glory, by common dead matter.

   Moreover, we can prove our view by Holy Scripture and the Fathers.  In
   the former it is said:  "God is a Spirit:  and they that worship him
   must worship him in spirit and in truth;" and:  "Thou shalt not make
   thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven
   above, or that is in the earth beneath;" on which account God spoke to
   the Israelites on the Mount, from the midst of the fire, but showed
   them no image.  Further:  "They changed the glory of the incorruptible
   God into an image made like to corruptible man,...and served the
   creature more than the Creator."  [Several other passages, even less to
   the point, are cited.] [532]

   The same is taught also by the holy Fathers.  [The Synod appeals to a
   spurious passage from Epiphanius and to one inserted into the writings
   of Theodotus of Ancyra, a friend of St. Cyril's; to utterances--in no
   way striking--of Gregory of Nazianzum, of SS. Chrysostom, Basil,
   Athanasius of Amphilochius and of Eusebius Pamphili, from his Letter to
   the Empress Constantia, who had asked him for a picture of Christ.]
   [533]

   Supported by the Holy Scriptures and the Fathers, we declare
   unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be
   rejected and removed and cursed out of the Christian Church every
   likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the
   evil art of painters.

   Whoever in future dares to make such a thing, or to venerate it, or set
   it up in a church, or in a private house, or possesses it in secret,
   shall, if bishop, presbyter, or deacon, be deposed; if monk or layman,
   be anathematised, and become liable to be tried by the secular laws as
   an adversary of God and an enemy of the doctrines handed down by the
   Fathers.  At the same time we ordain that no incumbent of a church
   shall venture, under pretext of destroying the error in regard to
   images, to lay his hands on the holy vessels in order to have them
   altered, because they are adorned with figures.  The same is provided
   in regard to the vestments of churches, cloths, and all that is
   dedicated to divine service.  If, however, the incumbent of a church
   wishes to have such church vessels and vestments altered, he must do
   this only with the assent of the holy Ecumenical patriarch and at the
   bidding of our pious Emperors.  So also no prince or secular official
   shall rob the churches, as some have done in former times, under the
   pretext of destroying images.  All this we ordain, believing that we
   speak as doth the Apostle, for we also believe that we have the spirit
   of Christ; and as our predecessors who believed the same thing spake
   what they had synodically defined, so we believe and therefore do we
   speak, and set forth a definition of what has seemed good to us
   following and in accordance with the definitions of our Fathers.

   (1)  If anyone shall not confess, according to the tradition of the
   Apostles and Fathers, in the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost one
   godhead, nature and substance, will and operation, virtue and dominion,
   kingdom and power in three subsistences, that is in their most glorious
   Persons, let him be anathema.

   (2)  If anyone does not confess that one of the Trinity was made flesh,
   let him be anathema.

   (3)  If anyone does not confess that the holy Virgin is truly the
   Mother of God, etc.

   (4)  If anyone does not confess one Christ both God and man, etc.

   (5)  If anyone does not confess that the flesh of the Lord is
   life-giving because it is the flesh of the Word of God, etc.

   (6)  If anyone does not confess two natures in Christ, etc.

   (7)  If anyone does not confess that Christ is seated with God the
   Father in body and soul, and so will come to judge, and that he will
   remain God forever without any grossness, etc.

   (8)  If anyone ventures to represent the divine image (charakter) of
   the Word after the Incarnation with material colours, let him be
   anathema!

   (9)  If anyone ventures to represent in human figures, by means of
   material colours, by reason of the incarnation, the substance or person
   (ousia or hypostasis) of the Word, which cannot be depicted, and does
   not rather confess that even after the Incarnation he [i.e., the Word]
   cannot be depicted, let him be anathema!

   (10)  If anyone ventures to represent the hypostatic union of the two
   natures in a picture, and calls it Christ, and thus falsely represents
   a union of the two natures, etc.!

   (11)  If anyone separates the flesh united with the person of the Word
   from it, and endeavours to represent it separately in a picture, etc.!

   (12)  If anyone separates the one Christ into two persons, and
   endeavours to represent Him who was born of the Virgin separately, and
   thus accepts only a relative (schetike) union of the natures, etc.

   (13)  If anyone represents in a picture the flesh deified by its union
   with the Word, and thus separates it from the Godhead, etc.

   (14)  If anyone endeavours to represent by material colours, God the
   Word as a mere man, who, although bearing the form of God, yet has
   assumed the form of a servant in his own person, and thus endeavours to
   separate him from his inseparable Godhead, so that he thereby
   introduces a quaternity into the Holy Trinity, etc.

   (15)  If anyone shall not confess the holy ever-virgin Mary, truly and
   properly the Mother of God, to be higher than every creature whether
   visible or invisible, and does not with sincere faith seek her
   intercessions as of one having confidence in her access to our God,
   since she bare him, etc.

   (16)  If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in
   lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this
   notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather
   represent their virtues as living images in himself, etc.

   (17)  If anyone denies the profit of the invocation of Saints, etc.

   (18)  If anyone denies the resurrection of the dead, and the judgment,
   and the condign retribution to everyone, endless torment and endless
   bliss, etc.

   (19)  If anyone does not accept this our Holy and Ecumenical Seventh
   Synod, let him be anathema from the Father and the Son and the Holy
   Ghost, and from the seven holy Ecumenical Synods!

   [Then follows the prohibition of the making or teaching any other
   faith, and the penalties for disobedience.  After this follow the
   acclamations.]

   The divine Kings Constantine and Leo said:  Let the holy and ecumenical
   synod say, if with the consent of all the most holy bishops the
   definition just read has been set forth.

   The holy synod cried out:  Thus we all believe, we all are of the same
   mind.  We have all with one voice and voluntarily subscribed.  This is
   the faith of the Apostles.  Many years to the Emperors!  They are the
   light of orthodoxy!  Many years to the orthodox Emperors!  God preserve
   your Empire!  You have now more firmly proclaimed the inseparability of
   the two natures of Christ!  You have banished all idolatry!  You have
   destroyed the heresies of Germanus [of Constantinople], George and
   Mansur [mansour, John Damascene].  Anathema to Germanus, the
   double-minded, and worshipper of wood!  Anathema to George, his
   associate, to the falsifier of the doctrine of the Fathers!  Anathema
   to Mansur, who has an evil name and Saracen opinions!  To the betrayer
   of Christ and the enemy of the Empire, to the teacher of impiety, the
   perverter of Scripture, Mansur, anathema!  The Trinity has deposed
   these three! [534]

   Excursus on the Conciliabulum Styling Itself the Seventh Ecumenical
   Council, But Commonly Called the Mock Synod of Constantinople.

   a.d. 754.

   The reader will find all the information he desires with regard to the
   great iconoclastic controversy in the ordinary church-histories, and
   the theological side of the matter in the writings of St. John
   Damascene.  It seems, however, that in order to render the meaning of
   the action of the last of the Ecumenical Councils clear it is necessary
   to provide an account of the synod which was held to condemn what it so
   shortly afterward expressly approved.  I quote from Hefele in loco, and
   would only further draw the reader's attention to the fact that the
   main thing objected to was not (as is commonly supposed) the outward
   veneration of the sacred icons, but the making and setting up of them,
   as architectural ornaments; and that it was not only representations of
   the persons of the Most Holy Trinity, and of the Divine Son in his
   incarnate form that were denounced, but even pictures of the Blessed
   Virgin and of the other saints; all this is evident to anyone reading
   the foregoing abstract of the decree.

   (Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. V., p. 308 et seqq.)

   The Emperor, after the death of the Patriarch Anastasius (a.d. 753),
   summoned the bishops of his Empire to a great synod in the palace
   Hieria, which lay opposite to Constantinople on the Asiatic side of the
   Bosphorus, between Chrysopolis and Chalcedon, a little to the north of
   the latter.  The vacancy of the patriarchate, facilitated his plans,
   since the hope of succeeding to this see kept down, in the most
   ambitious and aspiring of the bishops, any possible thought of
   opposition.  The number of those present amounted to 338 bishops, and
   the place of president was occupied by Archbishop Theodosius of
   Ephesus, already known to us as son of a former Emperor--Apsimar, from
   the beginning an assistant in the iconoclastic movement.  Nicephorus
   names him alone as president of the synod; Theophanes, on the contrary,
   mentions Bishop Pastillas of Perga as second president, and adds, "The
   Patriarchates of Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem were not
   represented [the last three were then in the hands of the Saracens],
   the transactions began on February 10th, and lasted until August 8th
   (in Hieria); on the latter date, however, the synod assembled in St.
   Mary's Church in Blachernæ, the northern suburb of Constantinople, and
   the Emperor now solemnly nominated Bishop Constantine of Sylæum, a
   monk, as patriarch of Constantinople.  On August 27th, the heretical
   decree [of the Synod] was published."

   We see from this that the last sessions of this Conciliabulum were held
   no longer in Hieria, but in the Blachernæ of Constantinople.  We have
   no complete Acts of this assembly, but its very verbose horos (decree),
   together with a short introduction, is preserved among the acts of the
   Seventh Ecumenical Council.

   This decree was by no means suffered to remain inoperative.

   (W. M. Sinclair.  Smith and Wace, Dictionary of Chr. Biog., sub voce
   Constantinus VI.)

   The Emperor singled out the more noted monks, and required them to
   comply with the decrees of the synod.  In a.d. 766 he exacted an oath
   against images from all the inhabitants of the empire.  The monks
   refused with violent obstinacy, and Copronymus appears to have amused
   himself by treating them with ruthless harshness.  The Emperor, indeed,
   seems to have contemplated the extirpation of monachism.  John the
   Damascene he persuaded his bishops to excommunicate.  Monks were forced
   to appear in the hippodrome at Constantinople hand in hand with
   harlots, while the populace spat at them.  The new patriarch
   Constantinus, presented by the emperor to the council the last day of
   its session, was forced to foreswear images, to attend banquets, to eat
   and drink freely against his monastic vows, to wear garlands, to
   witness the coarse spectacles and hear the coarse language which
   entertained the Emperor.  Monasteries were destroyed, made into
   barracks, or secularized.  Lachanodraco, governor of the Thracian
   Theme, seems to have exceeded Copronymus in his ribaldry and
   injustice.  He collected a number of monks into a plain, clothed them
   with white, presented them with wives, and forced them to choose
   between marriage and loss of eyesight.  He sold the property of the
   monasteries, and sent the price to the Emperor.  Copronymus publicly
   thanked him, and commended his example to other governors.

   (Harnack.  History of Dogma, Vol. V., p. 325 [Eng. Tr.].)

   The clergy obeyed when the decrees were published; but resistance was
   offered in the ranks of the monks.  Many took to flight, some became
   martyrs.  The imperial police stormed the churches, and destroyed those
   images and pictures that had not been secured.  The iconoclastic zeal
   by no means sprang from enthusiasm for divine service in spirit and in
   truth.  The Emperor now also directly attacked the monks; he meant to
   extirpate the hated order, and to overthrow the throne of Peter.  We
   see how the idea of an absolute military state rose powerfully in
   Constantinople; how it strove to establish itself by brute force.  The
   Emperor, according to trustworthy evidence, made the inhabitants of the
   city swear that they would henceforth worship no image, and give up all
   intercourse with monks.  Cloisters were turned into arsenals and
   barracks, relics were hurled into the sea, and the monks, as far as
   possible, secularized.  And the politically far-seeing Emperor, at the
   same time entered into correspondence with France (Synod of Gentilly,
   a.d. 767), and sought to win Pepin.  History seemed to have suffered a
   violent rupture, a new era was dawning which should supersede the
   history of the Church.

   But the Church was too powerful, and the Emperor was not even master of
   Oriental Christendom, but only of part of it.  The orthodox Patriarchs
   of the East (under the rule of Islam) declared against the iconoclastic
   movement, and a Church without monks or pictures, in schism with the
   other orthodox Churches, was a nonentity.  A spiritual reformer was
   wanting.  Thus the great reaction set in after the death of the Emperor
   (a.d. 775), the ablest ruler Constantinople had seen for a long time.
   This is not the place to describe how it was inaugurated and cautiously
   carried out by the skilful policy of the Empress Irene; cautiously, for
   a generation had already grown up that was accustomed to the cultus
   without images.  An important part was played by the miracles performed
   by the re-emerging relics and pictures.  But the lower classes had
   always been really favourable to them; only the army and the not
   inconsiderable number of bishops who were of the school of Constantine
   had to be carefully handled.  Tarasius, the new Patriarch of
   Constantinople and a supporter of images, succeeded, after overcoming
   much difficulty, and especially distrust in Rome and the East, after
   also removing the excited army, in bringing together a General Council
   of about 350 bishops at Nicæa, a.d. 787, which reversed the decrees of
   a.d. 754.  The proceedings of the seven sittings are of great value,
   because very important patristic passages have been preserved in them
   which otherwise would have perished; for at this synod also the
   discussions turned chiefly on the Fathers.  The decision (horos)
   restored orthodoxy and finally settled it.

   I cannot do better than to cite in conclusion the words of the
   profoundly learned Archbishop of Dublin, himself a quasi-Iconoclast.

   (Trench.  Lect. Medieval Ch. Hist., p. 93.)

   It is only fair to state that the most zealous favourers and promoters
   of this ill-directed homage always disclaimed with indignation the
   charge of offering to the images any reverence which did not differ in
   kind, and not merely in degree, from the worship which they offered to
   Almighty God, designating it as they did by altogether a different
   name.  We shall very probably feel that in these distinctions which
   they drew between the one and the other, between the "honour" which
   they gave to these icons and the "worship" which they withheld from
   these and gave only to God, there lay no slightest justification of
   that in which they allowed themselves; but these distinctions acquit
   them of idolatry, and it is the merest justice to remember this.

   (Trench.  Ut supra, p. 99.)

   I can close this Lecture with no better or wiser words than those with
   which Dean Milman reads to us the lesson of this mournful story:
   "There was this irremediable weakness in the cause of iconoclasm; it
   was a mere negative doctrine, a proscription of those sentiments which
   had full possession of the popular mind, without any strong
   countervailing excitement.  The senses were robbed of their habitual
   and cherished objects of devotion, but there was no awakening of an
   inner life of intense and passionate piety.  The cold, naked walls from
   whence the Scriptural histories had been effaced, the despoiled
   shrines, the mutilated images, could not compel the mind to a more pure
   and immaterial conception of God and the Saviour.  Hatred of images, in
   the process of the strife, might become, as it did, a fanaticism, it
   could never become a religion.  Iconoclasm might proscribe idolatry;
   but it had no power of kindling a purer faith."

   The Decree of the Holy, Great, Ecumenical Synod, the Second of Nice.

   (Found in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia.  Tom. VII., col. 552.)

   The holy, great, and Ecumenical Synod which by the grace of God and the
   will of the pious and Christ-loving Emperors, Constantine and Irene,
   his mother, was gathered together for the second time at Nice, the
   illustrious metropolis of Bithynia, in the holy church of God which is
   named Sophia, having followed the tradition of the Catholic Church,
   hath defined as follows:

   Christ our Lord, who hath bestowed upon us the light of the knowledge
   of himself, and hath redeemed us from the darkness of idolatrous
   madness, having espoused to himself the Holy Catholic Church without
   spot or defect, promised that he would so preserve her:  and gave his
   word to this effect to his holy disciples when he said:  "Lo!  I am
   with you always, even unto the end of the world," which promise he
   made, not only to them, but to us also who should believe in his name
   through their word.  But some, not considering of this gift, and having
   become fickle through the temptation of the wily enemy, have fallen
   from the right faith; for, withdrawing from the traditions of the
   Catholic Church, they have erred from the truth and as the proverb
   saith:  "The husbandmen have gone astray in their own husbandry and
   have gathered in their hands nothingness," because certain priests,
   priests in name only, not in fact, had dared to speak against the
   God-approved ornament of the sacred monuments, of whom God cries aloud
   through the prophet, "Many pastors have corrupted my vineyard, they
   have polluted my portion."

   And, forsooth, following profane men, led astray by their carnal sense,
   they have calumniated the Church of Christ our God, which he hath
   espoused to himself, and have failed to distinguish between holy and
   profane, styling the images of our Lord and of his Saints by the same
   name as the statues of diabolical idols.  Seeing which things, our Lord
   God (not willing to behold his people corrupted by such manner of
   plague) hath of his good pleasure called us together, the chief of his
   priests, from every quarter, moved with a divine zeal and brought
   hither by the will of our princes, Constantine and Irene, to the end
   that the traditions of the Catholic Church may receive stability by our
   common decree.  Therefore, with all diligence, making a thorough
   examination and analysis, and following the trend of the truth, we
   diminish nought, we add nought, but we preserve unchanged all things
   which pertain to the Catholic Church, and following the Six Ecumenical
   Synods, especially that which met in this illustrious metropolis of
   Nice, as also that which was afterwards gathered together in the
   God-protected Royal City.

   We believe...life of the world to come.  Amen. [535]

   We detest and anathematize Arius and all the sharers of his absurd
   opinion; also Macedonius and those who following him are well styled
   "Foes of the Spirit" (Pneumatomachi).  We confess that our Lady, St.
   Mary, is properly and truly the Mother of God, because she was the
   Mother after the flesh of One Person of the Holy Trinity, to wit,
   Christ our God, as the Council of Ephesus has already defined when it
   cast out of the Church the impious Nestorius with his colleagues,
   because he taught that there were two Persons [in Christ].  With the
   Fathers of this synod we confess that he who was incarnate of the
   immaculate Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary has two natures,
   recognizing him as perfect God and perfect man, as also the Council of
   Chalcedon hath promulgated, expelling from the divine Atrium [aules] as
   blasphemers, Eutyches and Dioscorus; and placing in the same category
   Severus, Peter and a number of others, blaspheming in divers fashions.
   Moreover, with these we anathematize the fables of Origen, Evagrius,
   and Didymus, in accordance with the decision of the Fifth Council held
   at Constantinople.  We affirm that in Christ there be two wills and two
   operations according to the reality of each nature, as also the Sixth
   Synod, held at Constantinople, taught, casting out Sergius, Honorius,
   Cyrus, Pyrrhus, Macarius, and those who agree with them, and all those
   who are unwilling to be reverent.

   To make our confession short, we keep unchanged all the ecclesiastical
   traditions handed down to us, whether in writing or verbally, one of
   which is the making of pictorial representations, agreeable to the
   history of the preaching of the Gospel, a tradition useful in many
   respects, but especially in this, that so the incarnation of the Word
   of God is shown forth as real and not merely phantastic, for these have
   mutual indications and without doubt have also mutual significations.

   We, therefore, following the royal pathway and the divinely inspired
   authority of our Holy Fathers and the traditions of the Catholic Church
   (for, as we all know, the Holy Spirit indwells her), define with all
   certitude and accuracy that just as the figure of the precious and
   life-giving Cross, so also the venerable and holy images, as well in
   painting and mosaic as of other fit materials, should be set forth in
   the holy churches of God, and on the sacred vessels and on the
   vestments and on hangings and in pictures both in houses and by the
   wayside, to wit, the figure of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
   of our spotless Lady, the Mother of God, of the honourable Angels, of
   all Saints and of all pious people.  For by so much more frequently as
   they are seen in artistic representation, by so much more readily are
   men lifted up to the memory of their prototypes, and to a longing after
   them; and to these should be given due salutation and honourable
   reverence (aspasmon kai timetiken proskunesin), not indeed that true
   worship of faith (latreian) which pertains alone to the divine nature;
   but to these, as to the figure of the precious and life-giving Cross
   and to the Book of the Gospels and to the other holy objects, incense
   and lights may be offered according to ancient pious custom.  For the
   honour which is paid to the image passes on to that which the image
   represents, and he who reveres the image reveres in it the subject
   represented.  For thus the teaching of our holy Fathers, that is the
   tradition of the Catholic Church, which from one end of the earth to
   the other hath received the Gospel, is strengthened.  Thus we follow
   Paul, who spake in Christ, and the whole divine Apostolic company and
   the holy Fathers, holding fast the traditions which we have received.
   So we sing prophetically the triumphal hymns of the Church, "Rejoice
   greatly, O daughter of Sion; Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem.  Rejoice
   and be glad with all thy heart.  The Lord hath taken away from thee the
   oppression of thy adversaries; thou art redeemed from the hand of thine
   enemies.  The Lord is a King in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see
   evil any more, and peace be unto thee forever."

   Those, therefore who dare to think or teach otherwise, or as wicked
   heretics to spurn the traditions of the Church and to invent some
   novelty, or else to reject some of those things which the Church hath
   received (e.g., the Book of the Gospels, or the image of the cross, or
   the pictorial icons, or the holy reliques of a martyr), or evilly and
   sharply to devise anything subversive of the lawful traditions of the
   Catholic Church or to turn to common uses the sacred vessels or the
   venerable monasteries, [536] if they be Bishops or Clerics, we command
   that they be deposed; if religious or laics, that they be cut off from
   communion.

   [After all had signed, the acclamations began (col. 576).]

   The holy Synod cried out:  So we all believe, we all are so minded, we
   all give our consent and have signed.  This is the faith of the
   Apostles, this is the faith of the orthodox, this is the faith which
   hath made firm the whole world.  Believing in one God, to be celebrated
   in Trinity, we salute the honourable images!  Those who do not so hold,
   let them be anathema.  Those who do not thus think, let them be driven
   far away from the Church.  For we follow the most ancient legislation
   of the Catholic Church.  We keep the laws of the Fathers.  We
   anathematize those who add anything to or take anything away from the
   Catholic Church.  We anathematize the introduced novelty of the
   revilers of Christians.  We salute the venerable images.  We place
   under anathema those who do not do this.  Anathema to them who presume
   to apply to the venerable images the things said in Holy Scripture
   about idols.  Anathema to those who do not salute the holy and
   venerable images.  Anathema to those who call the sacred images idols.
   Anathema to those who say that Christians resort to the sacred images
   as to gods.  Anathema to those who say that any other delivered us from
   idols except Christ our God.  Anathema to those who dare to say that at
   any time the Catholic Church received idols.

   Many years to the Emperors, etc., etc.

   Excursus on the Present Teaching of the Latin and Greek Churches on the
   Subject.

   To set forth the present teaching of the Latin Church upon the subject
   of images and the cultus which is due them, I cite the decree of the
   Council of Trent and a passage from the Catechism set forth by the
   authority of the same synod.

   (Conc. Trid., Sess. xxv.  December 3d and 4th, 1563.  [Buckley's
   Trans.])

   The holy synod enjoins on all bishops, and others sustaining the office
   and charge of teaching that, according to the usage of the Catholic and
   Apostolic Church received from the primitive times of the Christian
   religion, and according to the consent of the holy Fathers, and to the
   decrees of sacred councils, they especially instruct the faithful
   diligently touching the intercession and invocation of saints; the
   honour paid to relics; and the lawful use of images--teaching them,
   that the saints, who reign together with Christ, offer up their own
   prayers to God for men; that it is good and useful suppliantly to
   invoke them, and to resort to their prayers, aid and help, for
   obtaining benefits from God, through his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord,
   who alone is our Redeemer and Saviour; but that they think impiously,
   who deny that the saints, who enjoy eternal happiness in heaven, are to
   be invoked; or to assert either that they do not pray for men; or, that
   the invocation of them to pray for each of  us, even in particular, is
   idolatry; or, that it is repugnant to the word of God, and is opposed
   to the honour of the one mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus,
   or, that it is foolish to supplicate, orally or inwardly, those who
   reign in heaven.  Also, that the holy bodies of holy martyrs and of
   others now living with Christ, which were the living members of Christ,
   and the temples of the Holy Ghost, and which are by him to be raised
   unto eternal life, and to be glorified, are to be venerated by the
   faithful, through which [bodies] many benefits are bestowed by God on
   men; so that they who affirm that veneration and honour are not due to
   the relics of saints; or, that these, and other sacred monuments, are
   uselessly honoured by the faithful; and that the places dedicated to
   the memories of the Saints are vainly visited for the purpose of
   obtaining their aid; are wholly to be condemned, as the Church has
   already long since condemned, and doth now also condemn them.

   Moreover, that the images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God and of
   the other Saints, are to be had and retained particularly in temples,
   and that due honour and veneration are to be awarded them; not that any
   divinity or virtue is believed to be in them, on account of which they
   are to be worshipped; or that anything is to be asked of them; or that
   confidence is to be reposed in images, as was of old done by Gentiles,
   who placed their hope in idols; but because the honour which is shown
   unto them is referred to the prototypes which they represent; in such
   wise that by the images which we kiss, and before which we uncover the
   head, and prostrate ourselves, we adore Christ, and venerate the
   Saints, whose similitude they bear.  And this, by the decrees of
   councils, and especially of the second synod of Nicæa, has been
   ordained against the opponents of images.

   And the bishops shall carefully teach this; that, by means of the
   histories of the mysteries of our Redemption, depicted by paintings or
   other representations, the people are instructed, and strengthened in
   remembering, and continually reflecting on the articles of faith; as
   also that great profit is derived from all sacred images, not only
   because the people are thereby admonished of the benefits and gifts
   which have been bestowed upon them by Christ, but also because the
   miracles of God through the means of the Saints, and their salutary
   examples, are set before the eyes of the faithful; that so, for those
   things they may give God thanks; may order their own life and manners
   in imitation of the Saints; and may be excited to adore and love God,
   and to cultivate piety.  But if any one shall teach or think contrary
   to these decrees, let him be anathema.  And if any abuses have crept in
   amongst these holy and salutary observances, the holy synod earnestly
   desires that they be utterly abolished; in such wise that no images
   conducive to false doctrine, and furnishing occasion of dangerous error
   to the uneducated, be set up.  And if at times, when it shall be
   expedient for the unlearned people, it happen that the histories and
   narratives of Holy Scripture are pourtrayed and represented; the people
   shall be taught, that not thereby is the Divinity represented, as
   though it could be perceived by the eyes of the body, or be depictured
   by colours or figures.  Moreover, in the invocation of saints, the
   veneration of relics, and the sacred use of images, every superstition
   shall be removed, all filthy lucre be abolished, finally, all
   lasciviousness be avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be
   painted or adorned with a wantonness of beauty:  nor shall men also
   pervert the celebration of the saints, and the visitation of relics,
   into revellings and drunkenness; as if festivals are celebrated to the
   honour of the saints by luxury and wantonness.  Finally, let so great
   care and diligence be used by bishops touching these matters, as that
   there appear nothing disorderly, or unbecomingly or confusedly
   arranged, nothing profane, nothing indecorous; since holiness becometh
   the house of God.

   And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy
   synod ordains, that it be lawful for no one to place, or cause to be
   placed, any unusual image in any place, or church, howsoever exempted,
   except it shall have been approved of by the bishop:  also, that no new
   miracles are to be admitted, or new relics received, unless the said
   bishop has taken cognizance and approved thereof; who, as soon as he
   has obtained some certain information in regard of these matters shall,
   after having taken advice with theologians, and other pious men, act
   therein as he shall judge to be agreeable to truth and piety.  But if
   any doubtful, or difficult abuse is to be extirpated, or, in fine, if
   any more serious question shall arise touching these matters, the
   bishop, before he decides the controversy, shall await the sentence of
   the metropolitan and of the bishops of the same province, in a
   provincial council; yet so, that nothing new, or that has not
   previously been usual in the Church, shall be decreed, without the most
   holy Roman Pontiff having been first consulted.

   (Catechism of the Council of Trent. [537]   Pt. IV., Chap. VI.
   [Buckley's Trans.])

   Question III.

   God and the Saints addressed differently.

   From God and from the Saints we implore assistance not after the same
   manner:  for we implore God to grant us the blessing which we want, or
   to deliver us from evils; but the Saints, because favourites with God,
   we solicit to undertake our advocacy with God, to obtain of him for us
   those things of which we stand in need.  Hence we employ two different
   forms of prayer:  for to God, we properly say, Have mercy on us, hear
   us; to the saints, Pray for us.

   Question IV.

   In what Manner we may beseech the Saints to have mercy on us.

   We may, however, also ask the saints themselves to have mercy on us,
   for they are most merciful; but we do so on a different principle, for
   we may beseech them that, touched with the misery of our condition,
   they would interpose, in our behalf, their favour and intercession with
   God.  In the performance of this duty, it is most strictly incumbent on
   all, to beware lest they transfer to any creature the right which
   belongs exclusively to the Deity; and when we repeat before the image
   of any Saint the Lord's Prayer, our idea must then be to beg of the
   Saint to pray with us, and ask for us those favours that are contained
   in the form of the Lord's Prayer, to become, in fine, our interpreter
   and intercessor with God; for that this is an office which the saints
   discharge, St. John the apostle has taught in the Revelation.

   The doctrine of the Eastern Church may be seen from the following from
   The Orthodox Confession of the faith of the Catholic and Apostolic
   Church of the East.

   (Confes. Orthodox.  P. III. Q. LII. [apud Kimmel, Libri Symbolici
   Ecclesiæ Orientalis [538] ].)

   Rightly therefore do we honour the Saints of God, as it is written (Ps.
   cxxxix. 17) "How dear are thy friends unto me, O God."  And divine
   assistance we ask for through them, just as God ordered the friends of
   Job to go to his faithful servant, and that he should offer sacrifice
   and pray for them that they might obtain remission of sin through their
   patronage.  And in the second place this [First] commandment forbids
   men to adore any creature with the veneration of adoration (latreias).
   For we do not honour the Saints as though adoring them, but we call
   upon them as our brothers, and as friends of God, and therefore we seek
   the divine assistance through these, our brethren.  For they go between
   the Lord and us for our advantage.  And this in no respect is opposed
   to this commandment of the decalogue.

   Wherefore just as the Israelites did not sin when they called upon
   Moses to mediate between them and God, so neither do we sin, when we
   call for the aid and intercession of the Saints.

   (Ibid.  Quæstio LIV.)

   This [Second] Commandment is separate from the first.  For that treated
   of the Unity of the true God, forbidding and taking away the multitude
   of gods.  But the present treats of external religious ceremonies.  For
   besides the not honouring of false gods, we ought to dedicate no carved
   likeness in their honour, nor to venerate with adoration such things,
   nor to offer the sacrifices of adoration to them.  Therefore they sin
   against this commandment who venerate idols as gods, and offer
   sacrifices to them, and place their whole confidence and hope in them;
   as also the Psalmist says (Ps. cxxxv. 15), "The images of the heathen
   are silver and gold, etc."  They also transgress this precept who are
   given up to covetousness, etc.

   (Ibid.  Quæstio LV.)

   There is a great distinction between idols and images (ton eidolon kai
   ton eikonon).  For idols are the figments and inventions of men, as the
   Apostle testifies when he says (1 Cor. viii. 4), "We know that an idol
   is nothing in the world."  But an image is a representation of a true
   thing having a real existence in the world.  Thus, for example, the
   image of our Saviour Jesus Christ and of the holy Virgin Mary, and of
   all the Saints.  Moreover, the Pagans venerated their idols as gods,
   and offered to them sacrifices, esteeming the gold and silver to be
   God, as did Nebuchadnezzar.

   But when we honour and venerate the images, we in no way venerate the
   colours or the wood of which they are made; but we glorify with the
   veneration of dulia (douleias), those holy beings of which these are
   the images, making them by this means present to our minds as if we
   could see them with our eyes.  For this reason we venerate the image of
   the crucifixion, and place before our minds Christ hung upon the cross
   for our salvation, and to such like we bow the head, and bend the knee
   with thanksgiving.  Likewise we venerate the image of the Virgin Mary,
   we lift up our mind to her the most holy Mother of God, bowing both
   head and knees before her; calling her blessed above all men and women,
   with the Archangel Gabriel.  The veneration, moreover, of the holy
   images as received in the orthodox Church, in no respect transgresses
   this commandment.

   But this is not one and the same with that we offer to God; nor do the
   orthodox give it to the art of the painting, but to those very Saints
   whom the images represent.  The Cherubim which overshadowed the
   mercy-seat, representing the true Cherubim which stand before God in
   heaven, the Israelites revered and honoured without any violation of
   the commandment of God, and likewise the children of Israel revered the
   tabernacle of witness with a suitable honour (II Sam. vi. 13), and yet
   in no respect sinned nor set at naught this precept, but rather the
   more glorified God.  From these considerations it is evident that when
   we honour the holy images, we do not transgress the commandment of the
   decalogue, but we most especially praise God, who is "to be admired in
   his Saints" (Ps. lxviii. 35).  But this only we should be careful of,
   that every image has a label, telling of what Saint it is, that thus
   the intention of him who venerates it may be the more easily fulfilled.

   And for the greater establishment of the veneration of the holy images,
   the Church of God at the Seventh Ecumenical Synod anathematized all
   those who made war against the images, and set forth the veneration of
   the august images, and established it forever, as is evident from the
   ninth canon of that synod.

   (Ibid.  Quæstio LVI.)

   Why was he praised in the Old Testament who broke down the brazen
   serpent (II Kgs. xviii. 4) which long before Moses had set up on high?
   Answer:  Because the Jews were beginning an apostasy from the
   veneration of the true God, venerating that serpent as the true God;
   and offering to it incense as the Scripture saith.  Therefore wishing
   to cut off this evil, lest it might spread further, he broke up that
   serpent in order that the Israelites might have no longer that
   incentive to idolatry.  But before they honoured the serpent with the
   veneration of adoration, no one was condemned in that respect nor was
   the serpent broken.

   But Christians in no respect honour images as gods, neither in their
   veneration do they take anything from the true adoration due to God.
   Nay, rather they are led by the hand, as it were, by the image to God,
   while under their visible representations they honour the Saints with
   the veneration of dulia (doulikos) as the friends of God; asking for
   their mediation (mesiteuousin) to the Lord.  And if perchance some have
   strayed, from their lack of knowledge, in their veneration, it were
   better to teach such an one, rather than that the veneration of the
   august images should be banished from the Church.

   The Canons of the Holy and Ecumenical Seventh Council. [539]

   Canon I.

   That the sacred Canons are in all things to be observed.

   The pattern for those who have received the sacerdotal dignity is found
   in the testimonies and instructions laid down in the canonical
   constitutions, which we receiving with a glad mind, sing unto the Lord
   God in the words of the God-inspired David, saying:  "I have had as
   great delight in the way of thy testimonies as in all manner of
   riches."  "Thou hast commanded righteousness as thy testimonies for
   ever."  "Grant me understanding and I shall live."  Now if the word of
   prophesy bids us keep the testimonies of God forever and to live by
   them, it is evident that they must abide unshaken and without change.
   Therefore Moses, the prophet of God, speaketh after this manner:  "To
   them nothing is to be added, and from them nothing is to be taken
   away."  And the divine Apostle glorying in them cries out, "which
   things the angels desire to look into," and, "if an angel preach to you
   anything besides that which ye have received, let him be anathema."
   Seeing these things are so, being thus well-testified unto us, we
   rejoice over them as he that hath found great spoil, and press to our
   bosom with gladness the divine canons, holding fast all the precepts of
   the same, complete and without change, whether they have been set forth
   by the holy trumpets of the Spirit, the renowned Apostles, or by the
   Six Ecumenical Councils, or by Councils locally assembled for
   promulgating the decrees of the said Ecumenical Councils, or by our
   holy Fathers.  For all these, being illumined by the same Spirit,
   defined such things as were expedient.  Accordingly those whom they
   placed under anathema, we likewise anathematize; those whom they
   deposed, we also depose; those whom they excommunicated, we also
   excommunicate; and those whom they delivered over to punishment, we
   subject to the same penalty.  And now "let your conversation be without
   covetousness," crieth out Paul the divine Apostle, who was caught up
   into the third heaven and heard unspeakable words.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon I.

   We gladly embrace the Divine Canons, viz.:  those of the Holy Apostles,
   of the Six Ecumenical Synods, as also of the local synods and of our
   Holy Fathers, as inspired by one and the same Holy Spirit.  Whom they
   anathematize we also anathematize; whom they depose, we depose; whom
   they cut off, we cut off; and whom they subject to penalties, we also
   so subject.

   Harnack.

   (Hist. of Dogma [Eng. Trans.], Vol. V., p. 327).

   Just as at Trent, in addition to the restoration of mediæval doctrine,
   a series of reforming decrees was published, so this Synod promulgated
   twenty-two canons which can be similarly described.  The attack on
   monachism and the constitution of the Church had been of some use.
   They are the best canons drawn up by an Ecumenical Synod.  The bishops
   were enjoined to study, to live simply, and be unselfish, and to attend
   to the cure of souls; the monks to observe order, decorum, and also to
   be unselfish.  With the State and the Emperor no compromise was made;
   on the contrary, the demands of Maximus Confessor and John of Damascus
   are heard, though in muffled tones, from the canons.

   Van Espen.

   From the wording of this canon it is clearly seen that by the Fathers
   of this Council the canons commonly called "Apostolical" are attributed
   to the Apostles themselves as to their true authors, conformably to the
   Trullan Synod [540] and to the opinion then prevalent among the Greeks.

   For since the Fathers were well persuaded that the discipline and
   doctrine contained in these canons could be received and confirmed,
   they cared but little to enquire anxiously who were their true authors,
   being content in this question to follow and embrace the then commonly
   received opinion, and to ascribe these canons to them, just as, the
   other day, the Tridentine Synod (Sess. XXV., cap. j., De Reform) calls
   these, without any explanation, the "Canons of the Apostles," because
   then as now they were commonly called by that name.

   Beveridge.

   (Annotat., p. 166, at end of Vol. II.).

   Here are recognized and confirmed the canons set forth by the Six
   Ecumenical Councils.  And although all agree that the fifth and sixth
   Synods adopted no canons, unless that those of the Council in Trullo be
   attributed to them, yet when Tarasius the Patriarch of Constantinople
   claimed Canon 82 of the Trullan Canons as having been set forth by the
   sixth synod (as is evident from the annotations on that canon), all the
   canons of Trullo seem to be confirmed as having issued from the Sixth
   Synod.  Or else, perchance, as is supposed by Balsamon and Zonaras, as
   also by this present synod, the Trullan was held to be Quinisext
   (penthekte), and the canons decreed by it to belong to both the fifth
   and the sixth council.  Otherwise I do not see what meaning these words
   ["of the Six Ecumenical Synods"] can have, for it will be remembered
   that the reference is to the ecclesiastical canons of the Six
   Ecumenical Synods, and not to their dogmatic decrees.

   Canon II.

   That he who is to be ordained a Bishop must be steadfastly resolved to
   observe the canons, otherwise he shall not be ordained.

   When we recite the psalter, we promise God:  "I will meditate upon thy
   statutes, and will not forget thy words."  It is a salutary thing for
   all Christians to observe this, but it is especially incumbent upon
   those who have received the sacerdotal dignity.  Therefore we decree,
   that every one who is raised to the rank of the episcopate shall know
   the psalter by heart, so that from it he may admonish and instruct all
   the clergy who are subject to him.  And diligent examination shall be
   made by the metropolitan whether he be zealously inclined to read
   diligently, and not merely now and then, the sacred canons, the holy
   Gospel, and the book of the divine Apostle, and all other divine
   Scripture; and whether he lives according to God's commandments, and
   also teaches the same to his people.  For the special treasure (ousia)
   of our high priesthood is the oracles which have been divinely
   delivered to us, that is the true science of the Divine Scriptures, as
   says Dionysius the Great.  And if his mind be not set, and even glad,
   so to do and teach, let him not be ordained.  For says God by the
   prophet, "Thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that
   thou shalt be no priest to me."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon II.

   Whoever is to be a bishop must know the Psalter by heart:  he must
   thoroughly understand what he reads, and not merely superficially, but
   with diligent care, that is to say the Sacred Canons, the Holy Gospel,
   the book of the Apostle, and the whole of the Divine Scripture.  And
   should he not have such knowledge, he is not to be ordained.

   Aristenus.

   Whoso is to be elevated to the grade of the episcopate should
   know...the book of the Apostle Paul, and the whole divine scripture and
   search out its meaning and understand the things that are written.  For
   the very foundation and essence of the high priesthood is the true
   knowledge of holy Scripture, according to Dionysius the Great.  And if
   he has this knowledge let him be ordained, but if not, not.  For God
   hath said by the prophet:  "Thou hast put away from thee knowledge,
   therefore I have also put thee away from me, that thou mayest not be my
   priest."

   Fleury.

   The persecution of the Iconoclasts had driven all the best Christians
   into hiding, or into far distant exile; this had made them rustic, and
   had taken from them their taste for study.  The council therefore is
   forced to be content with a knowledge of only what is absolutely
   necessary, provided it was united with a willingness to learn.  The
   examination with which the ceremony of the ordination of bishops begins
   seems to be a remains of this discipline.

   Van Espen.

   The Synod teaches in this canon that "all Christians" will find it most
   profitable to meditate upon God's justifyings and to keep his words in
   remembrance, and especially is this the case with bishops.

   And it should be noted that formerly not only the clergy, but also the
   lay people, learned the Psalms, that is the whole Psalter, by heart,
   and made a most sweet sound by chanting them while about their work.

   But as time went on, little by little this pious custom of reciting the
   Psalter and of imposing its recitation and a meditation thereon at
   certain intervals, slipped away to the clergy only and to monks and
   nuns, as to those specially consecrated to the service of God and to
   meditation upon the divine words, as Lupus points out.  And from this
   discipline and practice the appointment of the Ecclesiastical or
   Canonical Office had its rise, which imposes the necessity of reciting
   the Psalms at certain intervals of time.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xxxviij., C. vj., in Anastasius's translation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon III.

   That it does not pertain to princes to choose a Bishop.

   Let every election of a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, made by princes
   stand null, according to the canon which says:  If any bishop making
   use of the secular powers shall by their means obtain jurisdiction over
   any church, he shall be deposed, and also excommunicated, together with
   all who remain in communion with him.  For he who is raised to the
   episcopate must be chosen by bishops, as was decreed by the holy
   fathers of Nice in the canon which says:  It is most fitting that a
   bishop be ordained by all the bishops in the province; but if this is
   difficult to arrange, either on account of urgent necessity, or because
   of the length of the journey, three bishops at least having met
   together and given their votes, those also who are absent having
   signified their assent by letters, the ordination shall take place.
   The confirmation of what is thus done, shall in each province be given
   by the metropolitan thereof.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon III.

   Every election made by a secular magistrate is null.

   This is a canon of a synod recognized by East and West as ecumenical!
   The reader can hardly resist the reflection that in this case there
   have been and are a great many intruding clergymen in the world, whose
   appointment to their several offices is "null."  Van Espen, however,
   suggests an ingenious way out of the difficulty, which is followed with
   great approval by Hefele.

   Van Espen.

   Canon xxix. of those commonly called Apostolic, and canon iv. of Nice
   are renewed in this canon.

   From the words of this canon it is sufficiently clear that in this
   canon the synod is treating of the choice and intrusion of persons into
   ecclesiastical offices which the magistrates and Princes had arrogated
   to themselves under the title of Domination (Dominatio); and by no
   means of that choice or rather nomination which Catholic princes and
   kings have everywhere and always used.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. xciii., C. vij.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IV.

   That Bishops are to abstain from all receiving of gifts.

   The Church's herald, Paul the divine Apostle, laying down a rule
   (kanona) not only for the presbyters of Ephesus but for the whole
   company of the priesthood, speaks thus explicitly, saying, "I have
   coveted no man's silver or gold, or apparel.  I have shewed you all
   things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak;" for he
   accounted it more blessed to give.  Therefore we being taught by him do
   decree, that under no circumstances, shall a Bishop for the sake of
   filthy lucre invent feigned excuses for sins, and exact gold or silver
   or other gifts from the bishops, clergy, or monks who are subject to
   him.  For says the Apostle, "The unrighteous shall not possess the
   kingdom of God," and, "The children ought not to lay up for the
   parents, but the parents for the children."  If then any is found, who
   for the sake of exacting gold or any other gift, or who from personal
   feeling, has suspended from the ministry, or even excommunicated, any
   of the clergy subject to his jurisdiction, or who has closed any of the
   venerable temples, so that the service of God may not be celebrated in
   it, pouring out his madness even upon things insensible, and thus
   shewing himself to be without understanding, he shall be subjected to
   the same punishment he devised for others, and his trouble shall return
   on his own head, as a transgressor of God's commandment and of the
   apostolic precepts.  For Peter the supreme head (he keruphaia akrotes)
   of the Apostles commands, "Feed the flock of God which is among you,
   taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for
   filthy lucre but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over the
   clergy (ton kleron [A.V. God's heritage]); but being ensamples to the
   flock.  And when the chief shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a
   crown of glory that fadeth not away."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.

   We decree that no bishop shall extort gold or silver, or anything else
   from bishops, clerics, or monks subject to his jurisdiction.  And if
   anyone through the power of gold or of any other thing or through his
   own whims, shall be found to have prevented any one of the clergy who
   are subject to him, from the celebration of the holy offices, or shall
   have shut up a venerable temple so that the sacred worship of God could
   not be performed in it, he shall be subject to the lex talionis.  For
   Peter the Apostle says:  Feed the flock of God, not of necessity but
   willingly, and according to God; not for filthy lucre's sake, but with
   a prompt mind; not exercising lordship over the clergy, but being an
   example to the flock.

   Balsamon.

   Note the present canon, which punishes those bishops by the lex
   talionis, who for filthy lucre's sake, or out of private affection,
   separate any from themselves, or close temples.  Wherefore he who cuts
   off others thus, let him be cut off.  But he who shuts off a temple
   shall be punished even more than by cutting off.  But lest any one
   should say, by the argument á contrario, that a bishop should not be
   punished who neither for the sake of filthy lucre nor out of private
   spite, but lawfully cuts some off, or closes temples, I answer that
   this argument only holds good of the cutting off.  For a bishop who for
   any reason, whether just or unjust, shuts up a temple, should be
   punished, so it seems to me, as I have said above.

   Van Espen.

   It would seem that at that time among the Greeks the use of local
   interdict (interdicti localis) was not known.  But very many
   theologians wish to find a vestige of this interdict in the IV^th
   century, in St. Basil's epistle cclxx. (otherwise ccxliv.), where the
   holy doctor teaches that the person who carries off by force a virgin,
   and those who are cognizant of this wickedness ought to be smitten with
   excommunication, and that the village or its inhabitants, to which the
   ravisher shall escape and where he shall be kept in safety, shall be
   shut out from the prayers.

   This canon, or rather the first part of it, is found in the Corpus
   Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum, Pars II., Causa XVI., Q. I., Canon
   lxiv.; all the latter part is represented by the words "et infra."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon V.

   That they who cast contumely upon clerics because they have been
   ordained in the church without bringing a gift with them, are to be
   published with a fine.

   It is a sin unto death when men incorrigibly continue in their sin, but
   they sin more deeply, who proudly lifting themselves up oppose piety
   and sincerity, accounting mammon of more worth than obedience to God,
   and caring nothing for his canonical precepts.  The Lord God is not
   found among such, unless, perchance, having been humbled by their own
   fall, they return to a sober mind.  It behoves them the rather to turn
   to God with a contrite heart and to pray for forgiveness and pardon of
   so grave a sin, and no longer to boast in an unholy gift.  For the Lord
   is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart.  With regard,
   therefore, to those who pride themselves that because of their
   benefactions of gold they were ordained in the Church, and resting
   confidently in this evil custom (so alien from God and inconsistent
   with the whole priesthood), with a proud look and open mouth vilify
   with abusive words those who on account of the strictness of their life
   were chosen by the Holy Ghost and have been ordained without any gift
   of money, we decree in the first place that they take the lowest place
   in their order; but if they do not amend let them be subjected to a
   fine.  But if it appear that any one has done this [i.e., given money],
   at any time as a price for ordination, let him be dealt with according
   to the Apostolic Canon which says:  "If a bishop has obtained
   possession of his dignity by means of money (the same rule applies also
   to a presbyter or deacon) let him be deposed and also the one who
   ordained him, and let him also be altogether cut off from communion,
   even as Simon Magus was by me Peter."  To the same effect is the second
   canon of our holy fathers of Chalcedon, which says:  If any bishop
   gives ordination in return for money, and puts up for sale that which
   cannot be sold, and ordains for money a bishop or chorepiscopus, or
   presbyter, or deacon, or any other of those who are reckoned among the
   clergy; or who for money shall appoint anyone to the office of
   oeconomus, advocate, or paramonarius; or, in a word, who hath done
   anything else contrary to the canon, for the sake of filthy lucre--he
   who hath undertaken to do anything of this sort, having been convicted,
   shall be in danger of losing his degree.  And he who has been ordained
   shall derive no advantage from the ordination or promotion thus
   negotiated; but let him remain a stranger to the dignity and
   responsibility which he attained by means of money.  And if any one
   shall appear to have acted as a go-between in so shameful and godless a
   traffic, he also, if he be a cleric, shall be removed from his degree;
   if he be a layman or a monk, let him be excommunicated.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon V.

   It seems that such as glory in the fact that they owe their position to
   their liberality in gold to the Church, and who contemn those who were
   chosen because of their virtue and were appointed without any largess,
   should receive the lowest place in their order.  And should they
   continue in their ways, let them be punished.  But those who made such
   gifts so as to get ordinations, let such be cast forth from communion,
   as Simon Magus was by Peter.

   Hefele.

   Zonaras and Balsamon in earlier times, and later Christian Lupus and
   Van Espen, remarked that the second part of this canon treats of
   simony, but not the first.  This has in view rather those who, on
   account of their large expenditure on churches and the poor, have been
   raised, without simony, to the clerical estate as a reward and
   recognition of their beneficence; and being proud of this, now
   depreciate other clergymen who were unable or unwilling to make such
   foundations and the like.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VI.

   Concerning the holding of a local Synod at the time appointed.

   Since there is a canon which says, twice a year in each province, the
   canonical enquiries shall be made in the gatherings of the bishops; but
   because of the inconveniences which those who thus came together had to
   undergo in travelling, the holy fathers of the Sixth Council decreed
   that once each year, without regard to place or excuse which might be
   urged, a council should be held and the things which are amiss
   corrected.  This canon we now renew.  And if any prince be found
   hindering this being carried out, let him be excommunicated.  But if
   any of the metropolitans shall take no care that this be done, he being
   free from constraint or fear or other reasonable excuse, let him be
   subjected to the canonical penalties.  While the council is engaged in
   considering the canons or matters which have regard to the Gospel, it
   behoves the assembled Bishops, with all attention and grave thought to
   guard the divine and life-giving commandments of God, for in keeping of
   them there is great reward; because our lamp is the commandment, and
   our light is the law, and trial and discipline are the way of life, and
   the commandment of the Lord shining afar giveth light to the eyes.  It
   is not permitted to a metropolitan to demand any of those things which
   the bishops bring with them, whether it be a horse or any other gift.
   If he be convicted of doing anything of this sort, he shall restore
   fourfold.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.

   Whenever it is not possible for a synod to meet according to the decree
   formulated long ago, twice in each year, at least let it be held once,
   as seemed good to the Sixth Synod.  Should any magistrate forbid such
   meeting, let him be cast out:  and a bishop who shall take no pains to
   assemble it, shall be subject to punishment.  And when the synod is
   held, should it appear that the Metropolitan has taken anything away
   from any bishop, let him restore four-fold.

   Hefele.

   Anastasius remarks on this, that this ordinance (whether the whole
   canon or only its last passage must remain undecided) was not accepted
   by the Latins.  That this canon did not forbid the so-called Synodicum,
   which the metropolitans had lawfully to receive from the bishops, and
   the bishops from the priests, is remarked by Van Espen, l. c. p. 464.

   Compare with this (as Balsamon advises) the eighth canon of the Council
   in Trullo.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars I., Dist. XVIII., C. vij.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VII.

   That to churches consecrated without any deposit of the reliques of the
   Saints, the defect should be made good.

   Paul the divine Apostle says:  "The sins of some are open beforehand,
   and some they follow after."  These are their primary sins, and other
   sins follow these.  Accordingly upon the heels of the heresy of the
   traducers of the Christians, there followed close other ungodliness.
   For as they took out of the churches the presence of the venerable
   images, so likewise they cast aside other customs which we must now
   revive and maintain in accordance with the written and unwritten law.
   We decree therefore that relics shall be placed with the accustomed
   service in as many of the sacred temples as have been consecrated
   without the relics of the Martyrs.  And if any bishop from this time
   forward is found consecrating a temple without holy relics, he shall be
   deposed, as a transgressor of the ecclesiastical traditions.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.

   Let reliques of the Holy Martyrs be placed in such churches as have
   been consecrated without them, and this with the accustomed prayers.
   But whoever shall consecrate a church without these shall be deposed as
   a transgressor of the traditions of the Church.

   Balsamon.

   But someone may be surprised that oratories to-day are consecrated
   without any deposition of reliques.  And they may ask why the Divine
   Liturgy is not celebrated in them by bishops and not by priests only.
   The answer is that the superaltars (antimensia) which are made by the
   bishops when a church is consecrated, suffice oratories in lieu of
   consecration or enthronement when they are sent to them, on the
   occasion of their dedication or opening.  They are called antimensia
   because they are in place of, and are antitypes of those many like
   tables which furnish thoroughly the holy Lord's table.

   On the rite of consecrating churches with reliques see Cardinal Bona.
   (De Rebus Lit., Lib. I., cap. xix.)

   The Antimensia are consecrated at the same time as the church; a full
   account of the ceremony is found in the Euchologion (Goar's ed., p.
   648).  A piece of cloth is placed on the altar and blessed, and then
   subsequently, as need requires, pieces are cut off from it and sent to
   the various oratories, etc.  The main outline of the ceremony of
   consecration is as follows.

   J. M. Neale.

   (Int. Hist. East. Ch., p. 187. )

   Relics being pounded up with fragrant gum, oil is poured over them by
   the bishop, and, distilling out to the corporals, is supposed to convey
   to them the mysterious virtues of the relics themselves.  The holy
   Eucharist must then be celebrated on them for seven days, after which
   they are sent forth as they are wanted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon VIII.

   That Hebrews ought not to be received unless they have been converted
   in sincerity of heart.

   Since certain, erring in the superstitions of the Hebrews, have thought
   to mock at Christ our God, and feigning to be converted to the religion
   of Christ do deny him, and in private and secretly keep the Sabbath and
   observe other Jewish customs, we decree that such persons be not
   received to communion, nor to prayers, nor into the Church; but let
   them be openly Hebrews according to their religion, and let them not
   bring their children to baptism, nor purchase or possess a slave.  But
   if any of them, out of a sincere heart and in faith, is converted and
   makes profession with his whole heart, setting at naught their customs
   and observances, and so that others may be convinced and converted,
   such an one is to be received and baptized, and his children likewise;
   and let them be taught to take care to hold aloof from the ordinances
   of the Hebrews.  But if they will not do this, let them in no wise be
   received.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.

   Hebrews must not be received unless they are manifestly converted with
   sincerity of heart.

   Hefele.

   The Greek commentators Balsamon and Zonaras understood the words "nor
   to baptize their children" to mean, "these seeming Christians may not
   baptize their own children,'" because they only seem to be Christians.
   But parents were never allowed to baptize their own children, and the
   true sense of the words in question comes out clearly from the second
   half of the canon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon IX.

   That none of the books containing the heresy of the traducers of the
   Christians are to be hid.

   All the childish devices and mad ravings which have been falsely
   written against the venerable images, must be delivered up to the
   Episcopium of Constantinople, that they may be locked away with other
   heretical books.  And if anyone is found hiding such books, if he be a
   bishop or presbyter or deacon, let him be deposed; but if he be a monk
   or layman, let him be anathema.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.

   If any one is found to have concealed a book written against the
   venerable images, if he is on the clergy list let him be deposed; if a
   layman or monk let him be cut off.

   Van Espen.

   What here is styled Episcopium was the palace of the Patriarch.  In
   this palace were the archives, and this was called the
   "Cartophylacium," in which the charts and episcopal laws were laid up.
   To this there was a prefect, the grand Chartophylax, one of the
   principal officials and of most exalted dignity of the Church of
   Constantinople, whose office Codinus explains as follows:  "The
   Chartophylax has in his keeping all the charts which pertain to
   ecclesiastical law (that is to say the letters in which privileges and
   other rights of the Church are contained) and is the judge of all
   ecclesiastical causes, and presides over marriage controversies which
   are taken cognizance of, and proceedings for dissolution of the
   marriage bond; moreover, he is judge in other clerical strifes, as the
   right hand of the Patriarch."

   In this Cartophylaceum or Archives, therefore, under the faithful
   guardianship of the Chartophylax, the fathers willed that the writings
   of the Iconoclasts should be laid up, lest in their perusal simple
   Catholics might be led astray.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon X.

   That no cleric ought to leave his diocese and go into another without
   the knowledge of the Bishop.

   Since certain of the clergy, misinterpreting the canonical
   constitutions, leave their own diocese and run into other dioceses,
   especially into this God-protected royal city, and take up their abode
   with princes, celebrating liturgies in their oratories, it is not
   permitted to receive such persons into any house or church without the
   license of their own Bishop and also that of the Bishop of
   Constantinople.  And if any clerk shall do this without such license,
   and shall so continue, let him be deposed.  With regard to those who
   have done this with the knowledge of the aforesaid Bishops, it is not
   lawful for them to undertake mundane and secular responsibilities,
   since this is forbidden by the sacred canons.  And if anyone is
   discovered holding the office of those who are called Meizoteroi; let
   him either lay it down, or be deposed from the priesthood.  Let him
   rather be the instructor of the children and others of the household,
   reading to them the Divine Scriptures, for to this end he received the
   priesthood.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon X.

   A clergyman who after leaving his own parish has settled in another far
   off from his own bishop and from the bishop of Constantinople, shall be
   received neither into house nor church.  And if he shall persevere in
   his course, he shall be deposed.  But if they shall do this with a
   knowledge of what we have said, they shall not receive a secular
   position; or should they have received them, they shall cease from
   them.  And if they refuse they shall be deposed.

   Hefele.

   On the office of the meizoteroi , the Greek commentators Zonaras and
   Balsamon give us more exact information.  We give the substance of it,
   viz.:  they were majores domus stewards of the estates of high
   personages.

   Balsamon.

   On account of this canon it seems to me that the most holy Patriarch at
   the time and his Chartophylax allow alien clergymen to celebrate the
   liturgy in this royal city, even without letters dimissory of the local
   bishop of each one.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XI.

   That OEconomi ought to be in the Episcopal palaces and in the
   Monasteries.

   Since we are under obligation to guard all the divine canons, we ought
   by all means to maintain in its integrity that one which says oeconomi
   are to be in each church.  If the metropolitan appoints in his Church
   an oeconomus, he does well; but if he does not, it is permitted to the
   Bishop of Constantinople by his own (idias) authority to choose an
   oeconomus for the Church of the Metropolitan.  A like authority belongs
   to the metropolitans, if the Bishops who are subject to them do not
   wish to appoint oeconomi in their churches.  The same rule is also to
   be observed with respect to monasteries.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.

   If the Metropolitan does not elect an oeconomus of the metropolis, the
   patriarch shall do so.  If the bishop shall not do so, the Metropolitan
   shall; for so it seemed good to the fathers assembled at Chalcedon.
   The same law shall hold in monasteries.

   Hefele.

   The Synod of Chalcedon required the appointment of special oeconomi
   only for all bishops' churches; but our synod extended this
   prescription also to monasteries.

   Van Espen.

   Bishops at their ordination among other things promise that they will
   observe the canons, and the bishops of the Synod say that among these
   canons they are bound to keep the one that orders them to appoint an
   OEconomus.

   Among the officials of the Constantinopolitan Church, Codinus names
   first The Grand OEconomus, "who" (he says) "holds in his own power all
   the faculties of the Church, and all their returns; and is the
   dispenser in this matter as well to the Patriarch as to the Church."

   Balsamon and Aristenus refer to Canon xxvj. of Chalcedon; and point out
   how here the power of Constantinople was added to.

   This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian's Decretum,
   Pars. II., Causa IX., Quæst. III., Canon iij.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XII.

   That a Bishop or Hegumenos ought not to alienate any part of the
   suburban estate of the church.

   If bishop or hegumenos is found alienating any part of the farm lands
   of the bishoprick or monastery into the hands of secular princes, or
   surrendering them to any other person, such act is null according to
   the canon of the holy Apostles, which says:  "Let the bishop take care
   of all the Church's goods, and let him administer the same according as
   in the sight of God."  It is not lawful for him to appropriate any part
   himself, or to confer upon his relations the things which belong to
   God.  If they are poor let them be helped among the poor; but let them
   not be used as a pretext for smuggling away the Church's property.  And
   if it be urged that the land is only a loss and yields no profit, the
   place is not on that account to be given to the secular rulers, who are
   in the neighbourhood; but let it be given to clergymen or husbandmen.
   And if they have resorted to dishonest craft, so that the ruler has
   bought the land from the husbandman or cleric, such transaction shall
   likewise be null, and the land shall be restored to the bishoprick or
   monastery.  And the bishop or hegumenos doing this shall be turned out,
   the bishop from his bishoprick and the hegumenos from his monastery, as
   those who wasted what they did not gather.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.

   According to what seemed good to the Holy Apostles, any act of
   alienation of the goods of a diocese or of a monastery made by the
   bishop, or by the superior of the monastery, shall be null.  And the
   Bishop or Superior who shall have done this shall be expelled.

   Van Espen.

   As at the time of this Synod by the favour of kings and princes the way
   was frequently open to ecclesiastical dignities, clergymen might easily
   be induced through ambition to make over to princes some part of the
   Church's possessions, if only by so doing they might arrive at the
   coveted preferment through their patronage, and then desiring to make
   good this simoniacal promise, they studied to transfer the church's
   goods to their patrons; with regard to these the present decree of the
   synod was made.

   But because human ambition is cunning, and solicitously seeks a way of
   attaining its ends, ambitious clerics tried by various colouring to
   give a tone to and to palliate these translations of church-goods to
   princes and magistrates, so that they might attain to that they aimed
   at by the favour of said princes and magistrates.

   Two such pretexts the synod exposes and rejects in the present canon.

   Canon XIII.

   That they are worthy of special condemnation who turn the monasteries
   into public houses.

   During the calamity which was brought to pass in the Churches, because
   of our sins, some of the sacred houses, for example, bishops' palaces
   and monasteries, were seized by certain men and became public inns.  If
   those who now hold them choose to give them back, so that they may be
   restored to their original use, well and good; but if not, and these
   persons are on the sacerdotal list, we command that they be deposed; if
   they be monks or laymen, that they be excommunicated, as those who have
   been condemned from the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and
   assigned their place where the worm dieth not and the fire is not
   quenched, because they set themselves against the voice of the Lord,
   which says:  "Make not my Father's house an house of merchandise."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.

   Those who make common diocesan or monastic goods, unless they restore
   to the bishop or superior the things belonging to the diocese or
   monastery, the whole proceeding shall be null.  If they are persons in
   Holy Orders they shall be deposed, but if laymen or monks they shall be
   cast out.

   Van Espen.

   No doubt by "the calamity" here is intended a reference to the troubles
   occasioned by the Iconoclasts, during whose time of domination many
   nefarious things were perpetrated against the orthodox, and most bitter
   of all was the persecution of the monks and priests by Leo the Isaurian
   and by his son Constantine Copronymus, both of them supporters of the
   Iconoclasts.

   And so it came to pass that by this persecution and through the
   nefarious vexations of the Iconoclasts, many monks and clerics fled
   from their monasteries and left vacant the Episcopia or holy houses,
   and so it became easy for people to come in and occupy the empty
   monasteries and religious houses, and to turn them to common and
   profane uses, especially when the anger of the Emperors and of the
   Iconoclasts was known to be fierce against the monks, and such bishops
   and priests as were worshippers of images.

   xix., Quæst. III., canon v., in Anastasius's version but lacking the
   opening words which are supplied by the Roman Correctors.

   Canon XIV.

   That no one without ordination ought to read in the ambo during the
   synaxis.

   That there is a certain order established in the priesthood is very
   evident to all, and to guard diligently the promotions of the
   priesthood is well pleasing to God.  Since therefore we see certain
   youths who have received the clerical tonsure, but who have not yet
   received ordination from the bishop, reading in the ambo during the
   Synaxis, and in doing this violating the canons, we forbid this to be
   done (from henceforth,) and let this prohibition be observed also
   amongst the monks.  It is permitted to each hegumenos in his own
   monastery to ordain a reader, if he himself had received the laying on
   of hands by a bishop to the dignity of hegumenos, and is known to be a
   presbyter.  Chorepiscopi may likewise, according to ancient custom and
   with the bishop's authorization, appoint readers. [541]

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.

   No one shall read from the ambon unless he has been ordained by the
   bishop.  And this shall be in force also among monks.  The superior of
   a monastery, if he has been ordained by the bishop, may ordain a lector
   but only in his own monastery.  A chorepiscopus also can make a lector.

   Balsamon.

   I say therefore from this present canon and from canon xix. that they
   may properly be made superiors, who have never received holy orders;
   since women may be placed in such positions in our monasteries.  And as
   these women do not hear confessions, nor make readers, so neither do
   superiors do this who are neither monks nor priests, nor could they

   Hefele.

   Van Espen (l. c. p. 469 sqq., and Jus Canon., t. i. pt. xxxi. tit. 31,
   c. 6), professes to show (a) that at that time there was no special
   benediction of abbots (different from their ordination as priests), and
   that therefore the words, "if he (the superior of the monastery)
   himself is consecrated by the bishop to the office of hegumenus," and
   "evidently is a priest," mean the same; (b) that at the time of our
   Synod every superior of a monastery, a prior as well as an abbot, had
   the power of conferring upon the monks of his monastery the order of
   lector; but (c) that the way in which Anastasius translated the canon
   (si dumtaxat Abbati manus impositio facta noscatur ab episcopo secundum
   morem præficiendorum abbatum), and the reception of this translation
   into the Corpus juris canonici, c.l., Dist. lxix., gave occasion to
   concede the right in question, of ordaining lectors, only to the
   solemnly consecrated (and insulated) abbots.

   This canon is found (as just noted) in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Pars
   I., Dist. LXIX, c.j.

   Canon XV.

   That a clerk ought not to be set over two churches.

   From henceforth no clergyman shall be appointed over two churches, for
   this savours of merchandise and filthy lucre, and is altogether alien
   from ecclesiastical custom.  We have heard by the very voice of the
   Lord that, "No man can serve two masters, for either he will hate the
   one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the
   other."  Each one, therefore, as says the Apostle, in the calling
   wherein he was called, in the same he ought to abide, and in one only
   church to give attendance.  For in the affairs of the Church, what is
   gained through filthy lucre is altogether separate from God.  To meet
   the necessities of this life, there are various occupations, by means
   of which, if one so desire, let him procure the things needful for the
   body.  For says the Apostle, "These hands have ministered unto my
   necessities, and to them that were with me."  Occupations of this sort
   may be obtained in the God-protected city.  But in the country places
   outside, because of the small number of people, let a dispensation be
   granted.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.

   Hereafter at Constantinople a cleric may not serve two churches.  But
   in the outskirts this may be permitted on account of the scarcity of
   men.

   Van Espen.

   This means that in the country or where men are so scarce that each
   parish cannot have its own presbyter, one presbyter should be allowed
   to serve two churches, not that so he may supply his own need, (as
   to-day is allowed by the combination of benefices), but that so the
   necessities of the parishioners may be provided for.

   It should be noted that the synod deems it "filthy lucre" and "separate
   from God" if ecclesiastical ministries are performed "for the
   necessaries of life," and is of opinion that the clergy should seek
   their support from some honest employment or work by the example of
   Paul, rather than to turn ecclesiastical ministrations to the attaining
   of temporal things, and to use these as an art by which to gain bread.

   XXI., Quæst. I, canon j. where the gloss is "because there the clergy
   are few."

   Canon XVI.

   That it does not become one in holy orders to be clad in costly
   apparel.

   All buffoonery and decking of the body ill becomes the priestly rank.
   Therefore those bishops and clerics who array themselves in gay and
   showy clothing ought to correct themselves, and if they do not amend
   they ought to be subjected to punishment.  So likewise they who anoint
   themselves with perfumes.  When the root of bitterness sprang up, there
   was poured into the Catholic Church the pollution of the heresy of the
   traducers of the Christians.  And such as were defiled by it, not only
   detested the pictured images, but also set at naught all decorum, being
   exceedingly mad against those who lived gravely and religiously; so
   that in them was fulfilled that which is written, "The service of God
   is abominable to the sinner."  If therefore, any are found deriding
   those who are clad in poor and grave raiment, let them be corrected by
   punishment.  For from early times every man in holy orders wore modest
   and grave clothing; and verily whatever is worn, not so much because of
   necessity, as for the sake of outward show, savours of dandyism, as
   says Basil the Great.  Nor did anyone array himself in raiment
   embroidered with silk, nor put many coloured ornaments on the border of
   his garments; for they had heard from the lips of God that "They that
   wear soft clothing are in kings' houses."

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.

   Bishops and clergymen arraying themselves in splendid clothes and
   anointed with perfumes must be corrected.  Should they persist, they
   must be punished.

   Balsamon and Zonaras tell of the magnificence in dress assumed by some
   of the superior clergy among the Iconoclasts, wearing stuffs woven with
   threads of gold, and their loins girt with golden girdles, and
   sentences embroidered in gold on the edge of their raiment.  It is
   curious to note how often heretics fall into extremes.  We have seen
   how Eustathius wore a conspicuous garb and was not willing to appear in
   the ordinary dress of a clergyman of his day.  His was the one extreme
   of ultra clerical or, I should say, ascetic clothing.  These
   Iconoclasts went to the other extreme and dressed themselves like men
   of the world, giving themselves the dandy airs of the fops of the day,
   thus, as always, making themselves ridiculous in the eyes of the wise,
   and their office contemptible in the eyes of the common people.

   That he shall not be allowed to begin the building of an oratory, who
   has not the means wherewith to finish it.

   Certain monks having left their monasteries because they desired to
   rule, and, unwilling to obey, are undertaking to build oratories, but
   have not the means to finish them.  Now whoever shall undertake to do
   anything of this sort, let him be forbidden by the bishop of the
   place.  But if he have the means wherewith to finish, let what he has
   designed be carried on to completion.  The same rule is to be observed
   with regard to laymen and clerics.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.

   Whoever wishes to build a monastery, if he has the wherewithal to
   finish it, let him begin the work, and let him bring it to a
   conclusion.  But if not, let him be prohibited by the bishop of the
   place.  The same law shall apply to laymen and monks.

   Van Espen refers to Gratian's Decretum, Pars. III., De Consecrat.,

   Balsamon also refers his readers to the Fourth Book of the Basilica,

   to the first canon of the so-called First-and-Second Council held at
   Constantinople in the Church of the Holy Apostles.

   Canon XVIII.

   That women ought not to live in bishops' houses, nor in monasteries of
   men.

   "Be ye without offence to those who are without," says the divine
   Apostle.  Now for women to live in Bishops' houses or in monasteries is
   ground for grave offence.  Whoever therefore is known to have a female
   slave or freewoman in the episcopal palace or in a monastery for the
   discharge of some service, let him be rebuked.  And if he still
   continue to retain her, let him be deposed.  If it happens that women
   are on the suburban estates, and the bishop or hegumenos desires to go
   thither, so long as the bishop or hegumenos is present, let no woman at
   that time continue her work, but let her betake herself to some other
   place until the bishop [or hegumenos [542] ] has departed, so that
   there be no occasion of complaint.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.

   It is not fitting that women should be kept in episcopal houses or in
   monasteries.  If anyone shall dare to do so, he shall be reproved; but
   if he persists, he shall be deposed.  No woman is allowed to serve or
   even to appear where a bishop or a superior of a monastery is present,
   but let her keep herself apart until he be gone.

   Van Espen.

   Every woman the present canon expels from the Episcopium or bishop's
   house, agreeably to Novel CXXIII, chapter 29, of the Emperor Justinian,
   which, (although the Nicene canon on the subject makes a mother,
   sister, daughter and other persons free from all suspicions,
   exceptions), admits no exceptions in the case of a bishop, but says,
   "We allow no bishop to have any woman or to live with one."

   For as bishops are set in a higher grade above the rest of the clergy,
   and ought to be like lights set on a candlestick to give light, rightly
   they are ordered more than others to take care to avoid all appearance
   of evil, and to remove all from them that might cause suspicion.

   With regard to monks and their houses see Justinian's Novel CXXXIII.,

   Canon XIX.

   That the vows of those in holy orders and of monks, and of nuns are to
   be made without the exaction of gifts.

   The abomination of filthy lucre has made such inroads among the rulers
   of the churches, that certain of those who call themselves religious
   men and women, forgetting the commandments of the Lord have been
   altogether led astray, and for the sake of money have received those
   presenting themselves for the sacerdotal order and the monastic life.
   And hence the first step of those so received being unlawful, the whole
   proceeding is rendered null, as says Basil the Great.  For it is not
   possible that God should be served by means of mammon. [543]   If
   therefore, anyone is found doing anything of this kind, if he be a
   bishop or hegumenos, or one of the priesthood, either let him cease to
   do so any longer or else let him be deposed, according to the second
   canon of the Holy Council of Chalcedon.  If the offender be an abbess,
   let her be sent away from her monastery, and placed in another in a
   subordinate position.  In like manner is a hegumenos to be dealt with,
   who has not the ordination of a presbyter.  With regard to what has
   been given by parents as a dowry for their children, or which persons
   themselves have contributed out of their own property, with the
   declaration that such gifts were made to God, we have decreed, that
   whether the persons in whose behalf the gifts were made, continue to
   live in the monastery or not, the gifts are to remain with the
   monastery in accordance with their first determination; unless indeed
   there be ground for complaint against the superior.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.

   Whoever for money admits those coming to Holy Orders or to the monastic
   life, if he be bishop, or superior of a monastery or any other in
   sacred orders, shall either cease or be deposed.  And the Superior of a
   monastery of women shall be expelled [if she have done so] and shall be
   given over to subjection.  The same shall be the case with a superior
   of monks, if he be not a priest.  But the possessions brought by those
   who come in, let them remain, whether the persons remain or not,
   provided the superior be not to blame.

   Balsamon.

   But someone may ask how it is that canon V., orders that he that
   performs an ordination for money is eo ipso to be deposed, whereas this
   canon provides that he who receives a cleric or monk on account of a
   pecuniary gift is to cease or else to be deposed.  The answer is, that
   whenever anyone performs an ordination for money, according to canon
   V., he is to be deposed; but when it was only a reception of a person
   which took place, whether into the list of the clergy or into a
   monastery by reason of money, who did this is only to be deposed, if
   after being denounced he persists in this evil.  The canons therefore
   are diverse in their scope.  The fifth treats of unlawful ordination,
   but this one of improper receptions.

   Canon XX.

   That from henceforth, no double monastery shall be erected; and
   concerning the double monasteries already in existence.

   We decree that from henceforth, no double monastery shall be erected;
   because this has become an offence and cause of complaint to many.  In
   the case of those persons who with the members of their family propose
   to leave the world and follow the monastic life, let the men go into a
   monastery for men, and the women into a monastery for women; for this
   is well-pleasing to God.  The double monasteries which are already in
   existence, shall observe the rule of our holy Father Basil, and shall
   be ordered by his precepts, monks and nuns shall not dwell together in
   the same monastery, for in thus living together adultery finds its
   occasion.  No monk shall have access to a nunnery; nor shall a nun be
   permitted to enter a monastery for the sake of conversing with anyone
   therein.  No monk shall sleep in a monastery for women, nor eat alone
   with a nun. [544]   When food is brought by men to the canonesses, let
   the abbess accompanied by some one of the aged nuns, receive it outside
   the gates of the women's monastery.  When a monk desires to see one of
   his kinswomen, who may be in the nunnery, let him converse with her in
   the presence of the abbess, and that in a very few words, and then let
   him speedily take his departure.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.

   Monasteries shall not be double, neither shall monks and nuns live in
   the same building, nor shall they talk together apart.  Moreover if a
   man takes anything to a canoness, let him wait without and hand it to
   her, and let him see his relative in the presence of her superior.

   Van Espen.

   It is evident, as Zonaras remarks, that the double monasteries here
   referred to are not those in which men and women live together, in one
   house, which in this canon is not tolerated at all, but those which
   were situated so close together that it was evident there could easily
   be an entrance from one to the other, these are allowed under certain
   cautions by this canon.

   But not only the Greeks but the Latins also often disapproved of such
   monasteries.  See decree in Gratian, Pars. II., Causa XVIII., Q. II.,
   canon xxviij., and Pope Paschal's letter (Epis. X) to Didacus, Abp. of
   Compostella.

   Despite all this St. Bridget of Sweden again instituted double
   monasteries in the XV^th century, concerning which Thomas Walsingham, a
   monk of St. Alban's Abbey, in England, writes that in 1414, King Henry
   founded three monasteries, of which the third was a Brigittine,
   professing the rule of St. Augustine, with the additions called by them
   the Rule of the Saviour.  "These two convents had one church in common,
   the nuns lived in the upper part under the roof, the brothers on the
   ground-floor, and each convent had a separate inclosure; and after
   profession no one went forth, except by special licence of the Lord
   Pope."

   With regard to the chaplains of nuns, provision is found in Justinian's
   Code.  (Lib. xliv., De Epis. et clericis. )

   That monks are not to leave their monasteries and go into others.

   A monk or nun ought not to leave the monastery to which he or she is
   attached, and betake themselves to others.  But if one do this, he
   ought to be received as a guest.  It is not however proper that he be
   made a member of the monastery, without the consent of his hegumenos.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.

   It is not allowed to a monk or a nun to leave her own house and enter
   another; but if he (or she) enters let (him or her) be received as a
   guest; but let him (or her) not be admitted at all nor given
   hospitality contrary to the will of the superior.

   Aristenus.

   The present canon does not allow a monk or a nun who goes to another
   house to be received into, nor even to be admitted as a guest, lest by
   force of necessity he be led astray to worldly things and so remain.
   Moreover it does not permit a woman to be admitted and received and
   reckoned in the number of the sisters without the consent of the
   superior.

   It seems to me that in Aristenus an ouk must have crept into the text
   and that the first sentence should read as now but omitting the "not."
   This makes him agree with Zonaras who says "the man must be received as
   a guest lest he go to a profane tavern and be forced to associate with
   those who have never learned how to live decently."  It is clear that
   the "superior" referred to is that of the house whence the monk or nun
   went forth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canon XXII.

   That when it happens that monks have to eat with women they ought to
   observe giving of thanks, and abstemiousness, and discretion.

   To surrender all things to God, and not to serve our own wills, is
   great gain.  For says the divine Apostle, "whether ye eat or drink, do
   all to the glory of God."  And Christ our God has bidden us in his
   Gospels, to cut off the beginning of sins; for not only is adultery
   rebuked by him, but even the movement of the mind towards the act of
   adultery when he says, "Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her,
   hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."  We who have
   been thus taught ought therefore to purify our minds.  Now although all
   things are lawful, all things are not expedient, as we have been taught
   by the mouth of the Apostle.  It is needful that all men should eat in
   order that they may live.  And for those to whom life consists of
   marrying, and bringing forth children, and of the condition of the lay
   state, there is nothing unbecoming in men and women eating together,
   only let them give thanks to the giver of the food; but if there be the
   entertainments of the theatre, that is, Satanic songs accompanied with
   the meretricious inflections of harps, there come upon them, through
   these things, the curse of the prophet, who thus speaks:  "Woe to them
   who drink wine with harp and psaltery, but they regard not the works of
   the Lord, and consider not the works of his hands."  Whenever persons
   of this sort are found among Christians, let them amend their ways; but
   if they will not do so, let there overtake them the penalties which
   have been enacted in the canons by our predecessors.  With regard to
   those whose life is free from care and apart from men, that is, those
   who have resolved before the Lord God to carry the solitary yoke, they
   should sit down alone and in silence.  Moreover it is also altogether
   unlawful for those who have chosen the priestly life to eat in private
   with women, unless it be with God-fearing and discreet men and women,
   so that even their feast may be turned to spiritual edification.  The
   same rule is to be observed with relatives.  Again, if it happen that a
   monk or priest while on a journey does not have with him what is
   absolutely necessary for him, and, because of his pressing needs,
   thinks well to turn aside into an inn or into someone's house, this he
   is permitted to do, seeing that need compels.

   Notes.

   Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.

   There is no objection to laywomen eating with men:  it is not right
   however for men who have chosen the lonely life, to eat privately with
   women; unless perchance together with them that fear God and with
   religious men and women.  But when travelling, a monk or anyone in
   sacred orders, not carrying necessary provisions with him, may enter a
   public house.

   The Letter of the Synod to the Emperor and Empress.

   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 577.)

   To our most religious and most serene princes, Constantine and Irene
   his mother.  Tarasius, the unworthy bishop of your God-protected royal
   city, new Rome, and all the holy Council which met at the good pleasure
   of God and upon the command of your Christ-loving majesty in the
   renowned metropolis of Nice, the second council to assemble in this
   city.

   Christ our God (who is the head of the Church) was glorified, most
   noble princes, when your heart, which he holds in his hands, gave forth
   that good word bidding us to assemble in his name, in order that we
   might strengthen our hold on the sure, immovable, and God-given truth
   contained in the Church's dogmas.  As your heads were crowned with gold
   and most brilliant stones, so likewise were your minds adorned with the
   precepts of the Gospel and the teachings of the Fathers.  And being the
   disciples and companions, as it were, of those whose sounds went forth
   into all the earth, ye became the leaders in the way of piety of all
   who bore the name of Christ, setting forth clearly the word of truth,
   and giving a brilliant example of orthodoxy and piety; so that ye were
   to the faithful as so many burning lamps.  The Church which was ready
   to fall, ye upheld with your hands, strengthening it with sound
   doctrine, and bringing into the unity of a right judgment those who
   were at variance.  We may therefore well say with boldness that it was
   through you that the good pleasure of God brought about the triumph of
   godliness, and filled our mouth with joy and our tongue with gladness.
   And these things our lips utter with a formal decree.  For what is more
   glorious than to maintain the Church's interests; and what else is more
   calculated to provoke our gladness?

   Certain men rose up, having the form of godliness, inasmuch as they
   were clothed with the dignity of the priesthood, but denying the power
   thereof; and thus deserving for themselves the charge of being but
   priests of Babylon.  Of such the word of prophecy had before declared
   that "lawlessness went forth from the priests [545] of Babylon."  Nay
   more, they banded themselves together in a sanhedrim, like to that
   which Caiaphas held, and became the propagators of ungodly doctrines.
   And having a mouth full of cursing and bitterness, they thought to win
   the mastery by means of abusive words.  With a slanderous tongue and a
   pen of a like character, and objecting to the very terms used by God
   himself, they devised marvellous tales, and then proceeded to
   stigmatise as idolaters the royal priesthood and the holy nation, even
   those who had put on Christ, and by his grace had been kept safe from
   the folly of idols.  And having a mind set upon evil, they took in hand
   unlawful deeds, thinking to suppress altogether the depicting of the
   venerable images.  Accordingly, as many icons as were set in mosaic
   work they dug out, and those which were in painted waxwork, they
   scraped away; thus turning the comely beauty of the sacred temples into
   complete disorder.  Among doings of this sort, it is to be specially
   noted that the pictures set up on tablets in memory of Christ our God
   and of his Saints, they gave over to the flames.  Finally, in a word,
   having desecrated our churches, they reduced them to utter confusion.
   Then some bishops became the leaders of this heresy and where before
   was peace, they fomented strife among the people; and instead of wheat
   sowed tares in the Church's fields.  They mingled wine with water, and
   gave the foul draught to those about them.  Although but Arabian
   wolves, they hid themselves under sheeps' clothing, and by specious
   reasoning against the truth sought to commend their lie.  But all the
   while "they hatched asps' eggs and wove a spider's web," as says the
   prophet; and "he that would eat of their eggs, having crushed one,
   found it to be addled, with a basilisk within it," and giving forth a
   deadly stench.

   In such a state of affairs, with a lie busy destroying the truth, ye,
   most gracious and most noble princes, did not idly allow so grave a
   plague, and such soul-destroying error long to continue in your day.
   But moved by the divine Spirit which abideth in you, ye set yourselves
   with all your strength utterly to exterminate it, and thus preserve the
   stability of the Church's government, and likewise concord among your
   subjects; so that your whole empire might be established in peace
   agreeably with the name [Irene] you bear.  Ye rightly reasoned, that it
   was not to be patiently endured, that while in other matters we could
   be of one mind and live in concord, yet in what ought to be the chief
   concern of our life, the peace of the Churches, there was amongst us
   strife and division.  And that too, when Christ being our head, we
   ought to be members one of another, and one body, by our mutual
   agreement and faith.  Accordingly, ye commanded our holy and
   numerously-attended council to assemble in the metropolis of Nice, in
   order that after having rid the Church of division, we might restore to
   unity the separated members, and might be careful to rend and utterly
   destroy the coarse cloak of false doctrine, which they had woven of
   thorn fibre, and unfold again the fair robe of orthodoxy.

   And now having carefully traced the traditions of the Apostles and
   Fathers, we are bold to speak.  Having but one mind by the inbreathing
   of the most Holy Spirit, and being all knit together in one, and
   understanding the harmonious tradition of the Catholic Church, we are
   in perfect harmony with the symphonies set forth by the six, holy and
   ecumenical councils; and accordingly we have anathematised the madness
   of Arius, the frenzy of Macedonius, the senseless understanding of
   Appolinarius, the man-worship of Nestorius, the irreverent mingling of
   the natures devised by Eutyches and Dioscorus, and the many-headed
   hydra which is their companion.  We have also anathematised the idle
   tales of Origen, Didymus, and Evagrius; and the doctrine of one will
   held by Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus, and Pyrrhus, or rather, we have
   anathematised their own evil will.  Finally, taught by the Spirit, from
   whom we have drawn pure water, we have with one accord and one soul,
   altogether wiped out with the sponge of the divine dogmas the newly
   devised heresy, well-worthy to be classed with those just mentioned,
   which springing up after them, uttered such empty nonsense about the
   sacred icons.  And the contrivers of this vain, but revolutionary
   babbling we have cast forth far from the Church's precincts.

   And as the hands and feet are moved in accordance with the directions
   of the mind, so likewise, we, having received the grace and strength of
   the Spirit, and having also the assistance and co-operation of your
   royal authority, have with one voice declared as piety and proclaimed
   as truth:  that the sacred icons of our Lord Jesus Christ are to be had
   and retained, inasmuch as he was very man; also those which set forth
   what is historically narrated in the Gospels; and those which represent
   our undefiled Lady, the holy Mother of God; and likewise those of the
   Holy Angels (for they have manifested themselves in human form to those
   who were counted worthy of the vision of them), or of any of the
   Saints.  [We have also decreed] that the brave deeds of the Saints be
   pourtrayed on tablets and on the walls, and upon the sacred vessels and
   vestments, as hath been the custom of the holy Catholic Church of God
   from ancient times; which custom was regarded as having the force of
   law in the teaching both of those holy leaders who lived in the first
   ages of the Church, and also of their successors our reverend Fathers.
   [We have likewise decreed] that these images are to be reverenced
   (proskunein), that is, salutations are to be offered to them.  The
   reason for using the word is, that it has a two-fold signification.
   For kunein in the old Greek tongue signifies both "to salute" and "to
   kiss."  And the preposition pros gives to it the additional idea of
   strong desire towards the subject; as for example, we have phero and
   prosphero, kuro and proskuro, and so also we have kuneo and proskuneo.
   Which last word implies salutation and strong love; for that which one
   loves he also reverences (proskunei) and what he reverences that he
   greatly loves, as the everyday custom, which we observe towards those
   we love, bears witness, and in which both ideas are practically
   illustrated when two friends meet together.  The word is not only made
   use of by us, but we also find it set down in the Divine Scriptures by
   the ancients.  For it is written in the histories of the Kings, "And
   David rose up and fell upon his face and did reverence to (prosekunese)
   Jonathan three times and kissed him" (1 Kings xx. 41).  And what is it
   that the Lord in the Gospel says concerning the Pharisees?  "They love
   the uppermost rooms at feasts and greetings (aspasmous) in the
   markets."  It is evident that by "greetings" here, he means reverence
   (proskunesin) for the Pharisees being very high-minded and thinking
   themselves to be righteous were eager to be reverenced by all, but not
   [merely] to be kissed.  For to receive salutations of this latter sort
   savoured too much of lowly humility, and this was not to the Pharisees'
   liking.  We have also the example of Paul the divine Apostle, as Luke
   in the Acts of the Apostles relates:  "When we were come to Jerusalem,
   the brethren received us gladly, and the day following Paul went in
   with us unto James, and all the presbyters were present.  And when he
   had saluted (aspasamenos) them, he declared particularly what things
   God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry" (Acts xxi. 17, 18,
   19).  By the salutation here mentioned, the Apostle evidently intended
   to render that reverence of honour (timetiken proskunesin) which we
   shew to one another, and of which he speaks when he says concerning
   Jacob, that "he reverenced (prosekunesen) the top of his staff" (Heb.
   xi. 21).  With these examples agrees what Gregory surnamed Theologus
   says:  "Honour Bethlehem, and reverence (proskuneson) the manger."

   Now who of those rightly and sincerely understanding the Divine
   Scriptures, has ever supposed that these examples which we have cited
   speak of the worship in spirit (tes en pneumati latreias)?  [Certainly
   no one has ever thought so] except perhaps some persons utterly bereft
   of sense and ignorant of all knowledge of the Scriptures and of the
   teaching of the Fathers.  Surely Jacob did not adore (elatreusen) the
   top of his staff; and surely Gregory Theologus does not bid us to adore
   (latreuein) the manger?  By no means.

   Again, when offering salutations to the life-giving Cross, we together
   sing:  "We reverence (proskunomen), thy cross, O Lord, and we also
   reverence (proskunomen) the spear which opened the life-giving side of
   thy goodness."  This is clearly but a salutation, and is so called, and
   its character is evinced by our touching the things mentioned with our
   lips.  We grant that the word proskunesis is frequently found in the
   Divine Scriptures and in the writings of our learned and holy Fathers
   for the worship in spirit (epi tes en pneumati latreias), since, being
   a word of many significations, it may be used to express that kind of
   reverence which is service.  As there is also the veneration of honour,
   love and fear.  In this sense it is, that we venerate your glorious and
   most noble majesty.  So also there is another veneration which comes of
   fear alone, thus Jacob venerated Esau.  Then there is the veneration of
   gratitude, as Abraham reverenced the sons of Heth, for the field which
   he received from them for a burying place for Sarah his wife.  And
   finally, those looking to obtain some gift, venerate those who are
   above them, as Jacob venerated Pharaoh.  Therefore because this term
   has these many significations, the Divine Scriptures teaching us, "Thou
   shalt venerate the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve," says
   simply that veneration is to be given to God, but does not add the word
   "only;" for veneration being a word of wide meaning is an ambiguous
   term; but it goes on to say "thou shalt serve (latreuseis) him only,"
   for to God alone do we render latria.

   The things which we have decreed, being thus well supported, it is
   confessedly and beyond all question acceptable and well-pleasing before
   God, that the images of our Lord Jesus Christ as man, and those of the
   undefiled Mother of God, the ever-virgin Mary, and of the honourable
   Angels and of all Saints, should be venerated and saluted.  And if
   anyone does not so believe, but undertakes to debate the matter further
   and is evil affected with regard to the veneration due the sacred
   images, such an one our holy ecumenical council (fortified by the
   inward working of the Spirit of God, and by the traditions of the
   Fathers and of the Church) anathematises.  Now anathema is nothing less
   than complete separation from God.  For if any are quarrelsome and will
   not obediently accept what has now been decreed, they but kick against
   the pricks, and injure their own souls in their fighting against
   Christ.  And in taking pleasure at the insults which are offered to the
   Church, they clearly shew themselves to be of those who madly make war
   upon piety, and are therefore to be regarded as in the same category
   with the heretics of old times, and their companions and brethren in
   ungodliness.

   We have sent our brethren and fellow priests, God-beloved Bishops,
   together with certain of the Hegumenoi and clergy, that they may give a
   full report of our proceedings to your godly-hearing ears.  In proof
   and confirmation of what we have decreed, and also for the assurance of
   your most religious majesty, we have submitted proofs from the Fathers,
   a few of the many we have gathered together in illustration of the
   brightly shining truth.

   And now may the Saviour of us all, who reigns with you (sumbasileuon
   humin) and who was pleased to vouchsafe his peace to the Churches
   through you, preserve your kingdom for many years, and also your
   council, princes, and faithful army, and the whole estate of the
   empire; and may he also give you victory over all your enemies.  For he
   it is, who says:  "As I live, saith the Lord, they that glorify me, I
   will glorify."  He it is also who hath girded you with strength, and
   will smite all your enemies, and make your people to rejoice.

   And do thou, O city, the new Sion, rejoice and be glad; thou that art
   the wonder of the whole world.  For although David hath not reigned in
   thee, nevertheless thy pious princes here preside over thy affairs as
   David would have done.  The Lord is in the midst of thee; may his name
   be blessed forever and ever.  Amen.

   Excursus on the Two Letters of Gregory II. To the Emperor Leo.

   (J. B. Bury, Appendix 14 to Vol. V. of his edition of Gibbon's Rome.
   1898.)

   It is incorrect to say that "the two epistles of Gregory II. have been
   preserved in the Acts of the Nicene Council" [as Gibbon does].  In
   modern collections of the Acts of Ecclesiastical Councils, they have
   been printed at the end of the Acts of the Second Nicene Council.  But
   they first came to light at the end of the XVI^th. century and were
   printed for the first time in the Annales Ecclesiastici of Baronius,
   who had obtained them from Fronton le Duc.  This scholar had copied the
   text from a Greek ms. at Rheims.  Since then other mss. have been
   found, the earliest belonging to the XI^th., if not the Xth century.

   In another case we should say that the external evidence for the
   genuineness of the epistles was good.  We know on the authority of
   Theophanes that Gregory wrote one or more letters to Leo (epistolen
   dogmatiken , sub a. m. 6172, oi epistolon, sub a. m. 6221); and we
   should have no external reasons to suspect copies dating from about 300
   years later.  But the omission of these letters in the Acts of the
   Nicene Council, though they are stated to have been read at the
   council, introduces a shadow of suspicion.  If they were preserved, how
   comes it that they were not preserved in the Acts of the Council, like
   the letter of Gregory to the Patriarch Germanus?  There is no trace
   anywhere of the Latin originals.

   Turning to the contents, we find enough to convert suspicion into a
   practical certainty that the documents are forgeries.  This is the
   opinion of M. l'abbé Duchesne (the editor of the Liber Pontificalis),
   M. L. Guérard (Mélanges d'Archéologie et d'Histoire, p. 44 sqq., 1890);
   Mr. Hodgkin (Italy and her Invaders, Vol. vi., p. 501 sqq.).  A false
   date (the beginning of Leo's reign is placed in the XIV^th. instead of
   the XV^th. indiction), and the false implication that the Imperial
   territory of the "Ducatus Romæ" terminated at twenty-four stadia, or
   three miles, from Rome, point to an author who was neither a
   contemporary of Leo nor a resident in Rome.  But the insolent tone of
   the letters is enough to condemn them.  Gregory II. would never have
   addressed to his sovereign the crude abuse with which these documents
   teem.  Another objection (which I have never seen noticed) is that in
   the First Letter the famous image of Christ which was pulled down by
   Leo, is stated to have been in the "Chalkoprateia" (bronzesmith's
   quarter), whereas, according to the trustworthy sources, it was above
   the Chalkâ gate of the Palace.

   Rejecting the letters on these grounds--which are supported by a number
   of smaller points--we get rid of the difficulty about a Lombard siege
   of Ravenna before a.d. 727:  a siege which is not mentioned elsewhere
   and was doubtless created by the confused knowledge of the fabricator.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Excursus on the Reception of the Seventh Council.

   The reception of the Seventh Council in the East was practically
   universal.  No historian pretends that the iconoclastic opinions had
   any hold over the masses of the people.  It was strictly speaking a
   court movement, backed by the army, and whenever the images were laid
   low and their veneration condemned it was by the power of the State,
   enforcing its will upon a yielding and (as we would call them to-day)
   Erastian clergy.  (Cf. Harnack, History of Dogma, Eng. tr. Vol. iv., p.
   326.)

   The struggle indeed was not quite put an end to by the conciliar
   decree.  After the death of the Empress in a.d. 803, several
   iconoclastic rulers sat on the throne of the East, among them Michael
   the Stammerer, who (as Michaud wittily says) "fought the images and
   married the nuns." [546]   He sent a letter, which is still extant, to
   Louis le Débonnaire of France, setting forth the superstitions of the
   orthodox, which is most curious and interesting reading.  (Vide Mansi.)

   His successor was Theophilus, who reigned from 829 until 842, and was a
   fanatical iconoclast.  The Patriarchs of Antioch, Alexandria, and
   Jerusalem wrote to him officially, several years after his accession,
   begging him not to imitate the bad example of the iconoclasts.  At that
   time the only Patriarch who sided with the heretics was John the
   Grammarian, the Patriarch of Constantinople, the very same who in 814
   had repudiated the iconoclast doctrine!  With the death of this
   Emperor, the power of the Iconoclasts likewise died; and at the
   accession of Michael III with his mother Theodora and his sister Thecla
   came the final triumph of the images.  I shall quote here the words of
   Harnack:  "Then came an Empress, Theodora, who finally restored the
   worship.  This took place at the Synod held at Constantinople a.d.
   842.  This Synod decreed that a Feast of Orthodoxy (he kuriake tes
   orthodoxias ) should be celebrated annually, at which the victory over
   the iconoclasts should be regularly remembered.  Thus the whole of
   orthodoxy was united in image-worship.  In this way the Eastern Church
   reached the position which suited its nature.  We have here the
   conclusion of a development, consistent in the main points.  The divine
   and sacred, as that had descended into the sensuous world by the
   incarnation, had created for itself in the Church a system of material,
   supernatural things, which offered themselves for man's use."  (Hist.
   Dogma.  Vol. iv., p. 328.)

   Much has been written, and truly written, of the superiority of the
   iconoclastic rulers; but when all has been said that can be, the fact
   still remains, that they were most of them but sorry Christians, and
   the justice of the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin's summing up of the
   matter will not be disputed by any impartial student.  He says, "No one
   will deny that with rarest exceptions, all the religious earnestness,
   all which constituted the quickening power of a church, was ranged upon
   the other [i.e. the orthodox] side.  Had the Iconoclasts triumphed,
   when their work showed itself at last in its true colours, it would
   have proved to be the triumph, not of faith in an invisible God, but of
   frivolous unbelief in an incarnate Saviour."  (Trench.  Mediæval
   History, Chap. vii.)

   We come now to consider what reception the Seventh of the General
   Councils met with in the West.  And first we find that it was accepted,
   so far at least as its dogmatic decrees went, by the Pope, the whole
   Roman Church and, so far as we know, by all the West except the realm
   of Charlemagne and, as would naturally be expected, the English Church.

   It is true that this was a large and very important exception; so large
   and so important that it becomes necessary to examine in detail the
   causes which led to this rejection.

   Some persons have supposed that the English council held at Calcuth in
   787 rejected the ecumenical character of II. Nice, because in two of
   its canons (the 1st and the 4th) it only speaks of "the faith of the
   Six General Councils."  But it is evident that the reason for this was
   that it had not yet heard of the Nicene synod; moreover such action
   would have been clearly impossible, since the council was presided over
   by the Bishop of Ostia, the legate of Pope Hadrian.

   The first opposition to the council in the West was made apparently by
   Charlemagne himself.  Pope Hadrian sent him a translation of the acts
   into Latin and signified his acceptance of the council.  But this
   translation was so badly done that not only was a large part of the
   acts utterly unintelligible, but also, in at least one place, a bishop
   of the council was made to say that the sacred images were to be adored
   with the same supreme worship as is paid to the Holy Trinity.

   It may not be wholly charitable to suggest the possibility of such a
   thing having any influence in the matter.  On the other hand it would
   be unfair to the reader not to state that Charlemagne had, or thought
   that he had, serious grievances against the Empress Irene, and that he
   might not have been sorry to have discovered some reason for which to
   reject her council.  It should, moreover, be remembered how much the
   Pope in his struggle for independence of the Eastern Empire trusted to
   Charlemagne, and therefore how reluctant he might readily have been to
   break with so important an ally; and so might be induced to tolerate
   the rejection by the Frankish Emperor of what had been received by him,
   the Vicar of Christ and the successor of Peter, as the Seventh
   Ecumenical Synod of the Catholic Church.

   As a result of this feeling of Charlemagne's, there were written what
   we call the "Caroline Books," and these exercised so mighty an
   influence on this whole question, and so completely misled even the
   learned, that I shall give a careful examination of their authorship,
   authority, and contents; for there can be no doubt that it was the
   influence of these books (which appeared in 790) that induced the
   unfortunate action of the Council of Frankfort four years later (in
   794); and that of the Convention of Paris in 825.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [546] It was during this period that St. Theodore, writing in 826 to
   Arsenius, observes: "Rome has not received it as an Ecumenical Council,
   but only as a provincial Synod, assembled to remedy a particular evil;
   Legates of the other Patriarchs were not there; those of Rome had come
   on different business:  Legates, indeed, there were from the East, but
   they were brought by our deputies, not sent by their Patriarchs, who
   knew nothing of the matter till afterwards.  Our countrymen acted thus
   for the purpose of more easily bringing back the heretics by persuading
   them that it was an OEcumenical Council."  "Theodore, however, it is
   fair to add, afterwards changed his opinion."  Such is Dr. Neale's
   candid admission.  Hist. of the East. Ch., Vol. II., p. 135.  How
   often, alas! has this passage been quoted by controversialists, and the
   word of warning to the reader been wholly omitted.

   Examination of the Caroline Books.

   I.  Authorship of the Caroline Books.

   I find that many writers on the subject of what they call "image
   worship," speak frequently of these "Caroline Books," and refer to them
   with great admiration.  It is also absolutely certain that many of
   these writers have never read, possibly never seen, the books of which
   they write so eloquently.  I have used the reprint of Melchior
   Goldast's edition (Frankfort, 1608) in Migne's Patrologia Latina, Tom.
   xcviij., in this article.

   The work begins thus.  "In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
   beginneth the work of the most illustrious and glorious man Charles, by
   the will of God, king of the Franks, Gauls, Germany, etc., against the
   Synod which in Greek parts firmly and proudly decreed in favour of
   adoring (adorandis) images," then follows immediately what is called
   "Charlemagne's Preface."

   Now of course nobody supposes for a moment that Charlemagne wrote these
   books himself.  But Sir William Palmer (Treatise on the Church, Vol.
   II., p. 204) says that the prelates of the realm of France "composed a
   reply to this Synod," he further says that "This work was published by
   the authority and in the name of the Emperor Charlemagne and with the
   consent of his bishops, in 790" (p. 205).  I am entirely at a loss to
   know on what authority these statements rest.  The authorship of the
   work has not without great show of reason, been attributed to Alcuin.
   Besides the English tradition that he had written such a book, there
   has been pointed out the remarkable similarity of his commentary on St.
   John (4, 5, et seqq.) to a passage in Liber IV., cap. vj., of these
   Caroline Books.  (On this point see Forster, General Preface to the
   Works of Alcuin n. 10.)  But after all whether Alcuin was the author or
   no, matters little, the statement that the "bishops of France" were in
   any sense responsible for it is entirely gratuitous, unless indeed some
   should think it may be gathered from the statement of the Preface;

   "We have undertaken this work with the priests who are prelates of the
   Catholic flocks in the kingdom which has been granted to us of God."
   [547]   But this would not be the only book written at the command of,
   and set forth by, a secular prince and yet claiming the authority of
   the Church.  I need only give as examples "The Institution of a
   Christian Man" and the Second Prayer Book of Edward the VI^th.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [547] It is curious that Michaud (Sept. Conciles OEcuméniques, p. 294)
   should say "the title priest given to those who composed the book
   proves that no one of them was a bishop."  The Latin is "Sacerdotum
   Prælatorum"!
     __________________________________________________________________

   II.  Authority of the Caroline Books.

   But be their authorship what it may, we come next to consider their
   authority; and here we are met with the greatest difficulty, for it is
   certain that despite the statements to the contrary, these books were
   not those sent to Pope Hadrian by Charlemagne, those of which the Pope
   deigned to write a refutation.  This Hefele has clearly proved, by
   pointing out that those sent to the Pope treated the matter in an
   entirely different order; that there were in those sent only 85
   chapters, while these books have 120 (or 121 if the authenticity of the
   last chapter is granted).  Moreover the quotations made by Hadrian do
   not occur verbatim in the Caroline books, but are in some cases
   enlarged, in others abbreviated.  (Cf. Hefele's treatment of the whole
   subject in the original German.)  Petavius thinks that what Hadrian
   received were extracts from the Caroline Books, made by the Council of
   Frankfort.

   Hefele arrives at a directly opposite conclusion, viz., that the
   Caroline Books are an expansion of the Capitula sent to the Pope, and
   that this expansion was made at the bidding of Charlemagne.

   It should be noted here that Baronius, Bellarmine, Binius, and Surius
   all question the authenticity of the Caroline Books altogether.  (Vide
   Baron, Annal., a.d., 794.)  But this extreme position seems to be
   refuted by the fact that certain quotations made by Hincmar are found
   in the books as we have them.  (Cf. Sirmond in Mansi, Tom. XIII., 905,
   Labbe, Tom. VII., col. 1054.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   III.  Contents of the Caroline Books.

   If the authorship and authority of these books are difficult subjects,
   the contents of the books are still more extraordinary, for it seems to
   be certain, past all possibility of doubt, that the authors of these
   books had never read the acts nor decrees of the Seventh Ecumenical
   Synod, of which they were writing; and further that he or they were
   also completely ignorant of what took place at the Conciliabulum of
   754.

   One example will be sufficient to prove this point.  In Book IV.,
   Chapter XIV., and also in chapter XX., (Migne's ed., col. 1213 and col.
   1226), the charge is made that the Seventh Council, especially Gregory,
   the bishop of Neocæsarea, unduly flattered the Empress.  Now as a
   matter of fact the remarks referred to were made at the Conciliabulum
   of 754, and not at the Second Council of Nice; they were not made by
   Gregory of Neocæsarea at all, and the reason they are attributed to him
   is because he read them in the proceedings of that pseudo-council to
   the true council of 787.

   Other examples could easily be given, but this is sufficient.  Ab uno
   disce omnes.  The most famous however of all the ignorant blunders
   found in these books must not here be omitted.  It occurs in Book III.,
   chapter xvij., and is no less serious than to attribute to Constantius,
   the bishop of Cyprus, the monstrous statement that the sacred images
   were to be given the supreme adoration due to the Holy Trinity.  What a
   complete mistake this was, we have already pointed out, and will have
   been evident to anyone who has read the extracts of the acts given in
   the foregoing pages.  I have said "mistake;" and I have said so
   deliberately, because I am convinced that the Caroline books, the
   decree of Frankfort, and the decision of the Convention of Paris, all
   sprung from ignorance and blundering; and largely through the force of
   this particular false statement on which I am writing.  But I must not
   omit the statement of Sir William Palmer, a champion of these books,
   that "the acts of the synod of Nice having been sent to Rome in the
   year 787, Pope Hadrian himself, according to Hincmar, transmitted them
   into France to Charlemagne, to be confirmed by the bishops of his
   kingdom; and the Emperor [i.e. Charlemagne] also received the acts
   directly from Constantinople according to Roger Hovedon.  These
   prelates, thus furnished with an authentic copy and not a mere
   translation, composed a reply to the synod" (Treatise on the Church,
   Vol. II., p. 203).

   If Sir William is right, then the author of the Caroline books is
   thrown into a dark shade indeed, for either he was too ignorant or too
   careless to read the original Greek, or else, knowing the real state of
   the case, deliberately misrepresented the synod.  Sir William feels
   this difficulty, and, a few lines below the sentence I have quoted,
   attributes the misstatements to a "mistranslation," viz. the false
   statement--upon which alone all the rest hung--attributed to the bishop
   of Cyprus.  But the two claims are contraria inter se.  If they were
   using an authentic copy of the original sent from Constantinople then
   they could not have been misled by a "mistranslation;" if they used a
   mistranslation and took no pains to read the decrees, their opinion and
   their writings--as well as the decrees which followed from them--were
   evidently entirely without theological value, and this is the
   estimation in which they have been held by all unprejudiced scholars
   without exception, whether agreeing with their conclusions or no.

   It will be well to set plainly before the reader the foundation upon
   which rests the dogmatic teaching of the Caroline Books.  This is, in
   short, the authority of the Roman See.  That there may be no possible
   doubt upon this point, I proceed to quote somewhat at length chapter
   vi., of Book I.; the heading of which reads as follows:  "That the Holy
   Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church is placed above all other Churches,
   and is to be consulted at every turn when any controversy arises with
   regard to the faith."

   "Before entering upon a discussion of the witnesses which the Easterns
   have absurdly brought forward in their Synod, we think well to set
   forth how greatly the holy Roman Church has been exalted by the Lord
   above the other Churches, and how she is to be consulted by the
   faithful:  and this is especially the case since only such books as she
   receives as canonical and only such Fathers as she has recognized by
   Gelasius and the other Pontiffs, his successors, are to be accepted and
   followed; nor are they to be interpreted by the private will of anyone,
   but wisely and soberly....For as the Apostolic Sees in general are to
   be preferred to all the other dioceses of the world, much more is that
   see to be preferred which is placed over all the other apostolic sees.
   For just as the Apostles were exalted above the other disciples, and
   Peter was exalted above the other Apostles, so the apostolic sees are
   exalted above the other sees, and the Roman See is eminent over the
   other apostolic sees.  And this exaltation arises from no synodical
   action of the other Churches, but she holds the primacy (primatum) by
   the authority of the Lord himself, when he said, Thou art Peter,
   etc.'...

   "This church, therefore, fortified with the spiritual arms of the holy
   faith, and satiated with the health-giving fountains which flow from
   the well of light and from the source of goodness, resists the horrible
   and atrocious monsters of heresies, and ministers the honey-sweet cups
   of teaching to the Catholic Churches of the whole world....Whence [i.e.
   from St. Jerome consulting the Pope] we can understand how Saints and
   learned men who were shining lights in different parts of the world,
   not only did not depart in faith from the holy Roman Church, but also
   asked aid of her in time of necessity for the strengthening of the
   faith.  And this all Catholic Churches should regularly observe, so
   that they may seek help from her, after Christ, for protecting the
   faith:  which (quæ) having neither spot nor wrinkle, smites the
   portentous heads of heresies, and strengthens the minds of the faithful
   in the faith.  And although many have separated from this holy and
   venerable communion, nevertheless never have the Churches of our part
   done so, but instructed by that apostolical erudition, and by his
   assistance from whom cometh every good and perfect gift, have always
   received the venerable charismata...; and are careful to follow the see
   of blessed Peter in all things, as they desire thither to arrive where
   he sits as keeper of the keys.  To which blessedness may he who deigned
   to found his Church upon Peter bring us, and make us to persevere in
   the unity of the holy Church; and may we merit a place in that kingdom
   of heaven through the intervention of him whose See we follow and to
   whom have been given the keys."

   Such is the doctrinal foundation of the Caroline books, viz.:  the
   absolute authority of the Roman See in matters pertaining to the faith
   of the Church.  It is certainly very difficult to understand how the
   author of these books could have known that the doctrinal decree of the
   Synod of Nice had received the approbation of this supreme power which
   it was so necessary to consult and defer to; and that the Synod which
   he denounces and rejects had been received by that chief of all the
   Apostolic Sees as the Seventh of the Ecumenical Councils of the
   Catholic Church.

   Whether the author [or authors] had ever seen the Pope's letter or no,
   one thing is certain, he never read with any care even the imperfect
   translation with which he had been furnished, and of that translation
   Anastasius Bibliothetius says:  "The translator both misunderstood the
   genius of the Greek language as well as that of the Latin, and has
   merely translated word for word; and in such a fashion that it is
   scarcely ever possible to know (aut vix aut nunquam) what it means;
   moreover nobody ever reads this translation and no copies of it are
   made." [548]

   This being the case, when we come to examine the Caroline Books, we are
   not astonished to find them full of false statements.

   In the Preface we are told that the Conciliabulum was "held in
   Bithynia;" of course as a matter of fact it met in Constantinople.

   In Bk. I., chapter j., we find certain words said to occur in the
   letters of the Empress and her son.  On this Hefele remarks:  "One
   cannot find the words in either of the two letters of these sovereigns,
   which are preserved in the acts of the Council of Nice, it is the synod
   that uses them. [549] "

   In the Second Book, chapter xxvij., the council is charged with saying
   "Just as the Lord's body and blood pass over from fruits of the earth
   to a notable mystery, so also the images, made by the skill of the
   artificers, pass over to the veneration of those persons whose images
   they bear."  Now this was never said nor taught by the Nicene Synod,
   but something like it was taught by the Constantinopolitan
   conciliabulum of 754; but the very words cited occur neither in the one
   set of acts nor in the other!  The underlying thought however was, as
   we have said, clearly exposed by the iconoclastic synod of 754 and as
   clearly refuted by the orthodox synod of 787.

   In Book III., chapter V., we are told that "Tarasius said in his
   confession of faith that the Holy Spirit was the companion (contribulum
   in the Caroline Books) of the Father and of the Son."  It was not
   Tarasius who said so at all, but Theodore of Jerusalem, and in using
   the word homophulos he was but copying Sophronius of Jerusalem.

   Chapter XVII. begins thus:  "How rashly and (so to speak) like a fool,
   Constantine, bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, spoke when he said, with
   the approval of the rest of the bishops, that he would receive and
   honourably embrace the images; and babbled that the service of
   adoration which is due to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity,
   should be given images, we need not here discuss, since to all who
   either read or hear this it will be clear that he was swamped in no
   small error, to wit to confess that he exhibited to creatures the
   service due to the Creator alone, and through his desire to favour the
   pictures overturned all the Holy Scriptures.  For what sane man ever
   either said or thought of saying such an absurdity, as that different
   pictures should be held in the same honour as the holy, victorious
   Trinity, the creator of all things, etc."  But as will be seen by a
   glance at the acts this is exactly the opposite of what Constantine did
   say.  Now if, as Sir William Palmer asserts, the author had before him
   the genuine acts in the original, I do not see how his honesty can be
   defended, or if his honesty is kept intact, it must be at the expense
   of his learning or carefulness.  Bower felt this so keenly that he
   thinks the Caroline Books attribute the words to Constantine the bishop
   alone and not to the council.  But the subterfuge is vain, for, as we
   have just seen, the author affirms that Constantine's speech received
   "the assent of the rest of the bishops (cæteris consentientibus)," and
   further not obscurely suggests that Constantine had the courage to say
   what the others were content to think, but did not dare to say.

   In Book IV., the third chapter distinctly states that while lights and
   incense were used by them in their churches, yet that neither the one
   nor the other was placed before images.  If this can be relied upon it
   would seem to fix the Frankish custom of that date.

   Chapters XIV. and XX. are distinguished by the most glaring blunders,
   for they attribute to the Council of Nice the teachings of the
   Conciliabulum, and in particular they lay them to the door of Gregory
   of Neocæsarea because he it was who read them.

   Finally, in chapter the twenty-eighth, the ecumenical character of II.
   Nice is denied, on the ground that it has not preserved the faith of
   the Fathers, and that it was not universal in its constitution.  I beg
   the reader, who has fresh in his memory the Papal claims set forth in a
   previous chapter, to consider whether it is possible that the author of
   that chapter should have seen and known of the Papal acceptance of the
   Seventh Synod and yet have written as follows:  "Among all the
   inanities said and done by this synod, this does not seem by any means
   to be the least, that they styled it ecumenical, for it neither held
   the purity of the ecumenical faith, nor did it obtain authority through
   the ecumenical action of the Churches....If this synod had kept clear
   of novelties and had rested satisfied with the teachings of the ancient
   Fathers, it might have been styled ecumenical.  But since it was not
   contented with the teachings of the ancient Fathers it cannot be styled
   ecumenical," etc., etc.

   Such are in brief the contents and spirit of the Caroline Books.
   Binius indeed says that he found a twenty-ninth chapter in a French ms.
   of Hadrian's Epistle.  It is lacking in the ordinary codices.  Petavius
   thinks it was added by the Council of Frankfort.  It is found in Migne
   (col. 1218) and the main point is that St. Gregory's advice is to be
   followed, viz.:  "We permit images of the Saints to be made by whoever
   is so disposed, as well in churches as out of them, for the love of God
   and of his Saints; but never compel anyone who does not wish to do so
   to bow to them (adorare eas); nor do we permit anyone to destroy them,
   even if he should so desire."  I cannot but think that this would be a
   very lame conclusion to all the denunciation of the preceding chapters.

   IV.  The Chief Cause of Trouble a Logomachy.

   Now from all this one thing is abundantly clear, that the great point
   set forth with such learning and perspicuity by the Seventh Synod, to
   wit, the distinction between latreia and proskunesis was wholly lost
   upon these Frankish writers; and that their translation of both words
   by "adoro" gave rise to nine-tenths of the trouble that followed.  The
   student of ecclesiastical history will remember how a similar logomachy
   followed nearly every one of the Ecumenical Synods, and will not
   therefore be astonished to find it likewise here.  The "homousion," the
   "theotocos," the "two natures," "the two wills," each one gave rise to
   heated discussion in different sections of the Church, even after it
   had been accepted and approved by a Synod which no one now for an
   instant disputes to have been ecumenical.

   Moreover, that after this serious error and bungling on the part of the
   Caroline divines and of the French and Allemanic Churches, the Pope did
   not proceed to enforce the acceptance of the council will not cause
   astonishment to any who are familiar with what St. Athanasius said with
   regard to the Semi-Arians, who even after I. Nice refused to use the
   word "homousios;" or with the extreme gentleness and moderation of St.
   Cyril of Alexandria in his treatment of John of Antioch.

   Perhaps before leaving the subject I should give here the chief
   strictures which Hefele makes upon these books (§ 400).

   (1)  The Caroline Books condemn passages which they quote (without
   saying so) from Pope Hadrian's own letter to the Empress.

   (2)  They blame St. Basil for teaching that the reverence done to the
   image passes on to the prototype.

   (3)  They treat St. Gregory Nyssen with contempt, and refuse to listen
   to him (Lib. II., c. xvij.).

   (4)  They are full of most careless and inexcusable blunders.

   (a)  They attribute to the Emperors a phrase which belongs to the Synod
   (I. j.).

   (b)  They confound Leontius with John (I. xxj.).

   (c)  They confound Tarasius with Theodore of Jerusalem (III. v.).

   (d)  They impute to the Council the opinions of the Iconoclastic
   Conciliabulum (IV., xiv. and xx. ).

   (e)  They attribute to Epiphanius the deacon the propositions of others
   when he merely read (IV., xv.)

   It had usually been supposed that these Four Books were the "quædam
   capitula" which Charlemagne had sent by Angelbert to Pope Hadrian "to
   be corrected by his judgment (ut illius judicio corrigerentur).
   Considering the nature of the contents of the Caroline Books as we now
   have them, such would seem à priori highly improbable, but this matter
   has been practically settled, as we have already pointed out, by Bishop
   Hefele, who has shown from Pope Hadrian's answer "correcting" those
   "capitula," that they must have been entirely different in order though
   no doubt their contents were similar.  The differing views of Petavius
   and Walch will be found in full in Hefele (§ 401).

   In concluding his masterly treatment of this whole matter, Hefele makes
   (§ 402) a remark well worthy of repetition in this place:

   "The great friendship which Charles shewed to Pope Hadrian down to the
   hour of his death proves that their way of thinking with regard to the
   cultus of images was not so opposite as many suppose, and--above
   all--as many have tried to make out."

   I shall close this matter with the admirably learned and judicious
   words of Michaud.

   "No doubt there had been abuses in connexion with the worship of
   images; but the Council of Nice never approved of these.  No doubt,
   too, certain marks of veneration used in the East were not practised in
   Gaul; but the Council of Nice did not go into these particulars.  It
   merely determined the principle, to wit, the lawfulness and moral
   necessity of honouring the holy images; and in doing this it did not in
   any degree innovate.  Charlemagne ought to have known this, for,
   already in the sixth century Fortunatus, in his Poem on St. Martin,
   tells how in Gaul they lighted lamps before the images. [550]   The
   great point that Charlemagne made was that what was called in the West
   adoration,' in the strict sense (that is to say the worship of Latria)
   should be rendered to none other than God; now this is exactly the
   doctrine of the Council of Nice.  Charlemagne himself admits that the
   learned may venerate images, meaning thereby that the veneration is
   really addressed to the prototypes, but that such veneration is a
   source of scandal to the ignorant who in the image venerate [551]
   nothing but the material image itself (Lib. III., cap. xvj.)." [552]

   Excursus on the Council of Frankfort, a.d. 794.

   It has been commonly represented that the Council of Frankfort, which
   was a large Synod of the West, with legates of the Pope present and
   composed of the bishops of Gaul, Germany, and Aquitaine, devoted its
   attention to a consideration of the question of the veneration due to
   images and of the claims of the Second Council of Nice to being an
   Ecumenical Synod.  I do not know upon what grounds such statements have
   rested, but certainly not upon anything revealed by any remains of the
   council we possess, for among these we find but one brief paragraph
   upon the subject, to wit, the Second Canon, which reads as follows
   (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. vii, col. 1057):

   "II.  The question was brought forward concerning the recent synod
   which the Greeks had held at Constantinople concerning the adoration of
   images, that all should be judged as worthy of anathema who did not pay
   to the images of the Saints service and adoration as to the Divine
   Trinity.  Our most holy fathers rejected with scorn and in every way
   such adoration and service, and unanimously condemned it."

   Now in the first place I call the reader's attention to the fact that
   the Conciliabulum of 754 was held at Constantinople but that the
   Seventh Council was held at Nice.  It would seem as if the two had got
   mixed in the mind of the writer. [553]

   In the second place neither of these synods, nor any other synod,
   decreed that the "service" (latreia) and "adoration" (proskunesis) due
   to the holy Trinity was under pain of anathema to be given to "the
   images of the Saints."

   On this second canon Hefele writes as follows:

   (Hefele.  Concil., § 398).

   The second of these canons deserves our full attention; in it, as we
   have seen, the Synod of Frankfort expresses its feeling against the
   Second Ecumenical Council of Nice, and against the veneration of
   images; Eginhard also gives us the information that it took this
   action, viz.:  "for it was decided by all [i.e. at Frankfort] that the
   synod, which a few years before was gathered together in Constantinople
   (sic) under Irene and her son Constantine, and is called by them not
   only the Seventh but also Ecumenical, should neither be held nor
   declared to be the Seventh nor ecumenical but wholly without
   authority."

   Hefele rejects the views of Baronius, Bellarmine, Surius, and Binius.
   I have no intention of defending the position of any one of these
   writers but I translate Binius's note, merely remarking that it is
   easier to reject his conclusion than to answer the arguments upon which
   it rests.

   (Severinus Binius, Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 1070.)

   Baronius was of opinion that the Second Council of Nice was condemned
   by this council; and before him Bellarmine had taught the same thing.
   But two things make me dissent from their conclusion:

   First.  That as the history and acts of this council inform us that the
   legates of Pope Hadrian (whom Ado in his chronology names Theophylact
   and Stephen) were present at this council, it was not possible that the
   whole council was ignorant by what authority the true Seventh Council
   was assembled at Nice, and what its decrees had been.  For as this
   Synod at Nice was assembled under the same Pontiff, the legates of that
   same Pontiff could not have been ignorant of its authority and
   teaching.  Therefore even if false rumours concerning the Seventh Synod
   had been scattered about, as Genebrardus affirms (on what foundation I
   know not), the Fathers of the Council of Frankfort could have been
   instructed by the papal legates, and been given information and taught
   what were the writings of that Seventh Council.  Moreover since the
   celebration of that Nicene Council was an event most celebrated and
   most widely published throughout the whole Church, it is not credible
   that among the bishops of all France and Germany, assembled in this
   place, no single one was found who had accurate information concerning
   the manner in which the Council of Nice was assembled, or of how it had
   received the approval of the Supreme Pontiff.  For as a matter of fact,
   that error of adoring images as gods is rather an error of the Gentiles
   than of any heretics or of any who profess the faith of Christ.
   Therefore in no way is it credible that the fathers of the Council of
   Frankfort should have thought this, or rashly on account of certain
   rumours have believed this; especially since at that time in no Church
   was there the suspicion of any such error; and the bishops of the
   council were too pious and Catholic to allow the suspicion that out of
   base enmity to the Orientals they were led to attribute error to the
   fathers of the most sacred Council of Nice, or that they would have
   attached an heretical sense to their decision.

   Another reason is this; that the fathers of this council often made
   profession of acting under the obedience of the Roman Pontiffs; and in
   the book Sacrosyllabus at the end, when they gave sentence against the
   heretics, they subjoin these words:  "The privilege of our lord and
   father the Supreme Pontiff, Hadrian I. Pope of the most blessed See,
   being in all respects maintained."  And this same principle the same
   fathers often professed in this council, that they followed the
   tradition of their predecessors, and did not depart from their
   footsteps; and that Charlemagne, who was present, at this council, in
   his letter to the Spanish bishops, said that in the first place he had
   consulted the pontiff of the Apostolic See, what he thought concerning
   the matter treated of in that council:  and that a little further on he
   adds these words:  "I am united to the Apostolic see, and to the
   ancient Catholic traditions which have come down from the beginnings of
   the new-born Church, with my whole mind, and with complete alacrity of
   heart."

   Now the fathers of this council could not make such a profession if
   they had condemned the Sacrosant Synod of Nice, which had been
   confirmed by the Apostolic See.  For as I have shown above they could
   not have been misled by false information upon this point.  If
   therefore knowingly and through heretical pravity they did these
   things, so too they did them out of pertinacity and heresy; and so
   concerning the authority of the Apostolic See one way they had thought
   and another way spoken.  But in my judgment such things are not to be
   imputed to so great and to such an assembly of bishops, for it is not
   likely that the fathers of this council, in the presence of the legates
   of the Supreme Pontiff and of a Catholic Prince, would have condemned
   the Seventh Synod, confirmed as it was by the authority of the Pontiff
   and have referred the matter to Hadrian the Supreme Pontiff.

   Moreover it would have surely come to pass that if the Nicene Council
   had been condemned by the authority of this synod, and so the error of
   the Iconoclasts had been approved through erroneous information, before
   our days some follower of that error would have tried to back up
   himself and his opinion by its authority:  but no one did this, and
   this is all the more noteworthy since, only shortly after the time of
   Charlemagne, Claudius of Turin sprang up in that very Gaul, and wished
   to introduce that error into the Western Church, and he could have
   confirmed his teaching in the highest manner if he could have shewn
   that that plenary council of the West had confirmed his error.  But as
   a matter of fact Claudius did not quote it in his favour; nor did Jonas
   of Orleans, who wrote against him at that time, and overthrew his
   foundations, make any mention in this respect of the Council of
   Frankfort in his response.

   Lastly I add that the Roman Church never gave its approbation and
   received any provincial synod, so far as one part of its action was
   concerned while in another part it was persistently heretical.  But
   this provincial council so far as it defined concerning the servitude
   and filiation of Christ was received and approved by the Church, it is
   not then credible that in the same council the Nicene Synod would have
   been condemned.

   I need only add that every proposed theory is so full of difficulties
   as to seem to involve more absurdities and improbabilities than it
   explains.  The reader is referred especially to Vasquez (De adorat.
   imag., Lib. II., Dispt. VII., cap. vij.) and to Suarez (Tom. I, Disp.
   LIV., Sec. iij.), for learned and instructive discussions of the whole
   matter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [553] This has been explained by saying that the last meeting was in
   the palace at Constantinople.

   Excursus on the Convention said to have been held in Paris, a.d. 825.

   It is curious that besides the Caroline Books and the second canon of
   Frankfort, another matter of great difficulty springs up with regard to
   the subject of the authority of the Seventh Synod.  In 1596 there
   appeared what claims to be an ancient account of a convention of
   bishops in Paris in the year 824. [554]   The point in which this
   interests us is that the bishops at this meeting are supposed to have
   condemned the Seventh Council, and to have approved the Caroline
   books.  The whole story was rejected by Cardinal Bellarmine and he
   promptly wrote a refutation.  Sismondi accepted this view of the
   matter, and Labbe has excluded the pretended proceedings from his
   "Concilia" altogether.

   But while scholars are agreed that the assigned date is impossible and
   that it must be 825, they have usually accepted the facts as true, I
   need not mention others than such widely differing authors as Fleury
   (Hist. Eccles., Lib. xlvij. iv.), Roisselet de Sauclières (Hist.
   Chronol., Tome III., No. 792, p. 385), and Hefele (Concilien, § 425).

   It would be the height of presumption were I to express any opinion
   upon this most disputed point, the reader will find the whole matter at
   length in Walch (Bd. XI., S. 135, 139).  I only here note that if the
   account be genuine, then it is an established fact that as late as 825,
   an assembly of bishops rejected an Ecumenical Council accepted by the
   pope, and further charged the Supreme Pontiff with having "commanded
   men to adore superstitiously images (quod superstitiose eas adorare
   jussit)," and asked the reigning Pontiff to correct the errors of his
   predecessors, and all this without any reproof from the Holy See!

   Hefele points out also that they not only entirely misrepresent the
   teaching of Hadrian and the Seventh Council, but that they also cite a
   passage from St. Augustine, "which teaches exactly the opposite of that
   which this synod would make out, for the passage says that the word
   colere can be applied to men."

   Historical Note on the So-Called "Eighth General Council" and
   Subsequent Councils.

   Whatever may be the final verdict of history with regard to the
   Caroline books, to the action of this Synod of Frankfort, and to the
   genuineness of the account of the Convention of Paris, there can be no
   doubt with regard to the position held by the Seventh of the Ecumenical
   Synods in all subsequent conciliar action.

   In 869 [555] was held at Constantinople what both the Easterns and
   Westerns then considered to be the Eighth of the Ecumenical Synods.
   Its chief concern was to restore peace and it thought to accomplish
   this by taking the strongest position against Photius.  At this Synod
   the Second Council of Nice was accepted in the most explicit manner,
   not only its teaching but also its rank and number. [556]

   But not many years afterwards Photius again got the upper hand and
   another synod was held, also at Constantinople, in a.d. 879, which
   restored Photius and which was afterwards accepted by many Easterns as
   the Eighth of the Ecumenical Synods.  But at this synod, as well as in
   that of 869, the position of Second Nice was fully acknowledged.  So
   that after that date, roughly speaking one century after the meeting of
   the Seventh Synod, despite all opposition it was universally recognized
   and revered, even by those who were so rapidly drifting further and
   further apart as were the East and West in the time of Photius and his
   successors.

   At the Council of Lyons in a.d. 1274 there was consent on all hands
   that all were united in accepting the Seven Synods as a basis of union.

   And finally when the acts and agreements of the Council of Florence
   (1438) appeared in the first edition issued under papal authority, that
   synod was styled the "Eighth," and in this there was no accident, for
   during the debate the Cardinal Julian Cæsarini had asked the Greeks for
   the proceedings of the Eighth Synod and Mark answered:  "We cannot be
   forced to count that synod as ecumenical, since we do not at all
   recognize it but in fact reject it...."A few years afterwards was held
   a second synod which restored Photius and annulled the acts of the
   preceding assembly, and this synod also bears the title of the Eighth
   Ecumenical.  But Cardinal Julian did not enter on any defence of the
   Ecumenical character of this so-called "Eighth Synod." [557]

   For the purposes of this discussion, the matter is perfectly clear, and
   even if some later writers speak still of the "Six Ecumenical Councils"
   in doing so they are rejecting the Eighth as much as the Seventh; in
   fact they are rejecting neither, but speaking as did St. Gregory, who
   still mentioned the Four General Councils and compared them to the Four
   Gospels, although the fifth had been already held.  Those few Frankish
   writers who continued to speak of II. Nice as a pseudo council did so
   out of ignorance or else in contrariety to the teaching of the Roman
   Church to whose obedience they professed subjection.  It is no place of
   mine to offer moral reflections upon their doings.

   Prefatory Note.

   As this volume only professes to contain the conciliar decrees of the
   Ecumenical Councils, it would seem that canons and rulings which were
   of private or quasi-private origin should have no place in it; and yet
   a very considerable number of such determinations are expressly
   approved by name in the Canons of the Synod in Trullo, which canons
   were received, to some extent at least (as we have seen), by the
   Seventh Ecumenical Council.  Under these circumstances I have felt that
   the reader might justly expect to find some mention made of these
   decrees, which while indeed non-conciliar in origin, yet had received
   such high conciliar sanction.  I have therefore placed a translation of
   the text of the "Apostolical Canons" with a brief introduction, and
   have reprinted Johnson's epitome of the other decrees and canons,
   supplying a few omissions and adding a few notes, chiefly taken from
   the Greek scholiasts, Zonaras and Balsamon.  It is hoped that thus the
   present volume has been made practically complete, and that from it,
   any student can obtain a satisfactory knowledge of all the doctrinal
   definitions and of all the disciplinary enactments of the undivided
   Church.

   The Apostolical Canons.

   Introduction.

   To affirm that the "Apostolical Canons" were a collection of canons
   made by the Apostles would be about as sensible as to affirm that the
   "Psalterium Davidicum" [559] was a collection of his own psalms made by
   David, or that the "Proverbs of Solomon" was a collection of proverbs
   made by Solomon.

   Many of the Psalms had David for their composer; many of the Proverbs
   had Solomon for their originator; but neither the book we call "The
   Psalter" nor the book we call "The Proverbs" had David or Solomon for
   its compiler.  The matter contained in the one is largely, many think
   chiefly, of Davidic origin, the matter contained in the other is no
   doubt Solomonic; and just so "The Apostolical Canons" may well be to a
   great extent of Apostolic origin, committed to writing, some possibly
   by the Apostles themselves, others by their immediate successors, who
   heard them at their mouth; and these at some period not far removed
   from the date of the Nicene Council (a.d. 325), probably earlier than
   the Council of Antioch, were gathered together into a code which has
   since then been somewhat enlarged and modified.  This is the view of
   the matter to which the general drift of the learned seems to be
   moving, and it is substantially the view so ably defended by Bishop
   Beveridge in his Synodicon, and in his remarkably learned and
   convincing answer to his French opponent, [560] entitled Codex Canonum
   Ecclesiæ Primitivæ vindicatus ac illustratus.  (This last volume,
   together with the "Preface to the Notes on the Apostolical Canons" has
   been reprinted in Vol. XII. of Bishop Beveridge's Works in the "Library
   of Anglo-Catholic Theology.") [561]

   In thus accepting in the main the old conclusions I am far from
   intending to imply that more recent research has not shewn some of the
   details of the bishop's view to be erroneous.  In brief, the
   proposition which seems to be most tenable is that in the main the
   Apostolic Canons represent the very early canon-law of the Church, that
   the canons which make up the collection are of various dates, but that
   most of them are earlier than the year 300, and that while it is not
   possible to say exactly when the collection, as we now have it, was
   made, there is good reason for assigning it a date not later than the
   middle of the fourth century.  With regard to the name "Apostolic
   Canons" there need be no more hesitation in applying it to these canons
   than in calling Ignatius an "Apostolic Father," the adjective
   necessarily meaning nothing more than that the canons set forth the
   disciplinary principles which were given to the early Church by the
   Apostles, just as we speak of the "Apostles' Creed."

   While this is true there can be no question that in the East the
   Apostolic Canons were very generally looked upon as a genuine work
   prepared by the Holy Apostles.  I proceed now to quote Bishop Hefele,
   but I have already (Cf. Council in Trullo) expressed my own opinion
   that there is not contained in the Quinisext decree any absolute
   definition of what is technically known as the "authenticity" of the
   Canons of the Apostles.

   (Hefele.  Hist. of the Councils, Vol. I., p. 451 et seqq.).

   The Synod in Trullo being, as is well known, regarded as ecumenical by
   the Greek Church, the authenticity of the eighty-five canons was
   decided in the East for all future time.  It was otherwise in the
   West.  At the same period that Dionysius Exiguus translated the
   collection question for Bishop Stephen, Pope Gelasius promulgated his
   celebrated decree de libris non recipiendis.  Drey mentions it, but in
   a way which requires correction.  Following in this the usual opinion,
   he says that the Synod at Rome in which Gelasius published this decree
   was held in 494; but we shall see hereafter that this synod was held in
   496.  Also Drey considers himself obliged to adopt another erroneous
   opinion, according to which Gelasius declared in the same decree the
   Apostolic Canons to be apocryphal.  This opinion is to be maintained
   only so long as the usual text of this decree is consulted, since the
   original text as it is given in the ancient manuscripts does not
   contain the passage which mentions the Apostolic Canons. [562]   This
   passage was certainly added subsequently, with many others, probably by
   Pope Hormisdas (514-543) when he made a new edition of the decree of
   Gelasius.  As Dionysius Exiguus published his collection in all
   probability subsequently to the publication of the decree of Gelasius,
   properly so called, in 496, we can understand why this decree did not
   mention the Apostolical Canons.  Dionysius did not go to Rome while
   Gelasius was living, and did not know him personally, as he himself
   says plainly in the Præfatio of his collection of the papal decrees.
   It is hence also plain how it was that in another collection of canons
   subsequently made by Dionysius, of which the preface still remains to
   us, he does not insert the Apostolic Canons, but has simply this
   remark:  Quos non admisit uniniversalitas, ego quoque in hoc opere
   prætermisi.  Dionysius Exiguus in fact compiled this new collection at
   a time when Pope Hormisdas had already explicitly declared the
   Apostolic Canons to be apocryphal.

   Notwithstanding this, these canons, and particularly the fifty
   mentioned by Dionysius, did not entirely fall into discredit in the
   West; but rather they came to be received, because the first collection
   of Dionysius was considered of great authority.  They also passed into
   other collections, and particularly into that of the pseudo-Isidore;
   and in 1054, Humbert, legate of Pope Leo IX., made the following
   declaration:  Clementis libel, id est itinerarium Petri Apostoli et
   Canones Apostolorum numerantur inter apocrypha, Exceptis Capitulis
   Quisquaginta, quæ decreverunt regulis orthodoxis adjungenda.  Gratian
   also, in his decree, borrowed from the fifty Apostolic Canons, and they
   gradually obtained the force of laws.  But many writers, especially
   Hincmar of Rheims, like Dionysius Exiguus, raised doubts upon the
   apostolical origin of these canons.  From the sixteenth century the
   opinion has been universal that these documents are not authentic; with
   the exception, however, of the French Jesuit Turrianus, who endeavoured
   to defend their genuineness, as well as the authenticity of the
   pseudo-Isidorian decrees.  According to the Centuriators of Magdeburg,
   it was especially Gabriel d'Aubespine, Bishop of Orleans, the
   celebrated Archbishop Peter de Marca, and the Anglican Beveridge, who
   proved that they were not really compiled by the Apostles, but were
   made partly in the second and chiefly in the third century.  Beveridge
   considered this collection to be a repertory of ancient canons given by
   synods in the second and third centuries.  In opposition to them, the
   Calvinist Dallæus (Daillé) regarded it as the work of a forger who
   lived in the fifth and sixth centuries; but Beveridge refuted him so
   convincingly, that from that time his opinion, with some few
   modifications, has been that of all the learned.

   Beveridge begins with the principle, that the Church in the very
   earliest times must have had a collection of canons; and he
   demonstrates that from the commencement of the fourth century, bishops,
   synods, and other authorities often quote, as documents in common use,
   a kanon apostolikos, or ekklesiastikos, or archaios; as was done, for
   instance, at the Council of Nice, by Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria,
   and by the Emperor Constantine, etc. [563]   According to Beveridge,
   these quotations make allusion to the Apostolic Canons, and prove that
   they were already in use before the fourth century.

   In opposition to Beveridge Dr. von Drey wrote with profound learning;
   [564] and Bickell, in his work just quoted, to a great degree accepts
   his conclusions as being well-founded.

   These conclusions in short are that the so-called "Apostolic Canons"
   are a patchwork taken from the "Apostolic Constitutions," which are
   said to have been of Eastern origin and to date from the latter part of
   the third century, and from the canons of various synods, notably Nice,
   Antioch, and Chalcedon.

   But this last reference to Chalcedon is too much for Bickell to
   stomach; and for many reasons he makes the date of the collection
   earlier.

   Hefele points out a rather significant document which he says both
   "Drey and Bickell have overlooked.  In 1738 Scipio Maffei published
   three ancient documents, the first of which was a Latin translation of
   a letter written on the subject of Meletius by the Egyptian bishops
   Hesychius, Phileas, etc.  This letter was written during the
   persecution of Diocletian, that is, between 303 and 305:  it is
   addressed to Meletius himself, and especially accuses him of having
   ordained priests in other dioceses.  This conduct, they tell him, is
   contrary to all ecclesiastical rule (aliena a more divino et regula
   ecclesiastica), and Meletius himself knows very well that it is a lex
   patrum et propatrum...in alienis paræciis non licere alicui episcoporum
   ordinationes celebrare.  Maffei himself supposes that the Egyptian
   bishops were here referring to the thirty-fifth canon (the thirty-sixth
   according to the enumeration of Dionysius), and this opinion can hardly
   be controverted."

   After Bickell and Drey about ten years passed and then Bunsen and
   Ültzen wrote on the subject.  Of these Bunsen renewed Beveridge's
   arguments, and considers the "Apostolic Canons" as a reflex of the
   customs of the Primitive Church, if not in the Johannean age, at latest
   in that which immediately succeeded; and he is of opinion that the
   legend attributing them to the Apostles is earlier in date than the
   Council of Nice. Ültzen does not express himself definitely on the
   point, but in a note to p. xvj. of the Preface to his book regrets that
   Bunsen should have renewed Beveridge's argument with regard to the
   relative age of the Apostolic Canons and those of Antioch because in
   his judgment "all the more recent judges of this matter had refuted
   it."

   I think I should here interrupt my narrative to warn the reader that
   Beveridge has been often misunderstood and misrepresented.  For example
   he expressly says that according to his theory [565] "these canons were
   set forth by various synods, so too they seem to us to have been
   collected by different persons, of whom some collected more, some
   fewer....And these canons, thus collected, some called ecclesiastical
   and some called them Apostolical; not that they believed them to have
   been written by the very Apostles, for they had made the collection
   themselves, but because they were consonant to the doctrine and
   traditions of the Apostles, and they were persuaded that they had been
   originally established at least by apostolic men."  This is Beveridge's
   position in his own words.

   I come now to the most recent writings upon the subject.  Harnack has
   developed a theory which is partly his own with regard to the
   Apostolical Constitutions, in his edition of the "Didache," and has
   also considered the question of the Apostolic Canons.  The fullest
   discussion however of the matter is in a work entitled, Die
   Apostolischen Konstitutionem, Eine Litteran-historische Untersuchung,
   von Franz Zaver Funk.  Rottenburg am Neckar.  1891.

   Funk gives the history of the controversy, and refuses to allow that
   Hefele's citation of the Letter of the Egyptian bishops throws any
   light upon the point.  In most matters he agrees with Bickell, and
   declares (p. 188) that "the Synod of Antioch is certainly to be
   regarded as the source of the Apostolic Canons," and that thus by
   comparing the canons, it is manifest that the Apostolic "are certainly
   to be regarded as the dependent writing" (p. 185).  And after
   considering their relation to the Apostolical Constitutions, Funk
   states his conclusion as follows (p. 190):  "The drawing up of the
   canons falls therefore not earlier than the interpolation of the
   Didaskalia and the preparation of the two last books of the
   Constitution, hence not before the beginning of the fifth century.  On
   the other hand there is no ground for fixing the writing at a later
   period, not a single canon bears the mark of a later time."

   Such was the state of things until Mgr. Rihmani, the Syrian Archbishop
   of Aleppo, gave notice that he had found in a codex at Mossul a Syrian
   version of the Apocryphal book known as the Testamentum Jesu Christi.
   It is stated that in the discoverer's opinion the Testamentum is
   earlier in date than the Apostolic Canons, than the Canons of
   Hippolytus, and than the VIII^th Book of the Apostolic Constitutions;
   and further that it was the direct source of the Apostolic Canons.  As
   I know nothing further of this matter, I must simply note it for the
   guidance of the reader in his further study of the subject.

   Having now traced the history of the discussion, I need only add that
   Mr. Turner has just issued a very critical text of the version of
   Dionysius Exiguus, the full title of which is as follows:

   noted to the contrary, Hammond's translation.

   The Canons of the Holy and Altogether August Apostles. [566]

   Canon I. [567]

   Let a bishop be ordained by two or three bishops.

   Canon II.

   Let a presbyter, deacon, and the rest of the clergy, be ordained by one
   bishop,

   Canon III.  (III. and IV.)

   If any bishop or presbyter offer any other things at the altar, besides
   that which the Lord ordained for the sacrifice, as honey, or milk, or
   strong-made drink instead of wine, [568] or birds, or any living
   things, or vegetables, besides that which is ordained, let him be
   deposed.  Excepting only new ears of corn, and grapes at the suitable
   season.  Neither is it allowed to bring anything else to the altar at
   the time of the holy oblation, excepting oil for the lamps, and
   incense.

   Canon IV.  (V.)

   Let all other fruits be sent home as first-fruits for the bishops and
   presbyters, but not offered at the altar.  But the bishops and
   presbyters should of course give a share of these things to the
   deacons, and the rest of the clergy.

   Canon V.  (VI.)

   Let not a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, put away his wife under
   pretence of religion; but if he put her away, let him be
   excommunicated; and if he persists, let him be deposed.

   Canon VI.  (VII.)

   Let not a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, undertake worldly business;
   otherwise let him be deposed.

   Canon VII.  (VIII.)

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall celebrate the holy day of
   Easter before the vernal equinox, with the Jews, let him be deposed.

   Canon VIII (IX.)

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or any one on the sacerdotal list,
   when the offering is made, does not partake of it, let him declare the
   cause; and if it be a reasonable one, let him be excused; but if he
   does not declare it, let him be excommunicated, as being a cause of
   offence to the people, and occasioning a suspicion against the offerer,
   as if he had not made the offering properly.

   Canon IX.  (X.)

   All the faithful who come in and hear the Scriptures, but do not stay
   for the prayers and the Holy Communion, are to be excommunicated, as
   causing disorder in the Church.

   Canon X.  (XI.)

   If any one shall pray, even in a private house, with an excommunicated
   person, let him also be excommunicated.

   Canon XI.  (XII.)

   If any clergyman shall join in prayer with a deposed clergyman, as if
   he were a clergyman, [569] let him also be deposed.

   Canon XII. and XIII (XIII.)

   If any one of the clergy or laity who is excommunicated, or not to be
   received, shall go away, and be received in another city without
   commendatory letters, let both the receiver and the received be
   excommunicated.

   But if he be excommunicated already, let the time of his
   excommunication be lengthened.

   Canon XIV.

   A bishop is not to be allowed to leave his own parish, and pass over
   into another, although he may be pressed by many to do so, unless there
   be some proper cause constraining him, as if he can confer some greater
   benefit upon the persons of that place in the word of godliness.  And
   this must be done not of his own accord, but by the judgment of many
   bishops, and at their earnest exhortation.

   Canon XV.

   If any presbyter, or deacon, or any other of the list of the clergy,
   shall leave his own parish, and go into another, and having entirely
   forsaken his own, shall make his abode in the other parish without the
   permission of his own bishop, we ordain that he shall no longer perform
   divine service; more especially if his own bishop having exhorted him
   to return he has refused to do so, and persists in his disorderly
   conduct.  But let him communicate there as a layman.

   Canon XVI.

   If, however, the bishop, with whom any such persons are staying, shall
   disregard the command that they are to cease from performing divine
   offices, and shall receive them as clergymen, let him be
   excommunicated, as a teacher of disorder.

   Canon XVII.

   He who has been twice married after baptism, or who has had a
   concubine, cannot become a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or any other
   of the sacerdotal list.

   Canon XVIII.

   He who married a widow, or a divorced woman, or an harlot, or a
   servant-maid, or an actress, cannot be a bishop, presbyter, or deacon,
   or any other of the sacerdotal list.

   Canon XIX.

   He who has married two sisters, or a niece, cannot become a clergyman.

   Canon XX.

   If a clergyman becomes surety for any one, let him be deposed.

   Canon XXI.

   An eunuch, if he has been made so by the violence of men or [if his
   virilia have been amputated [570] ] in times of persecution, or if he
   has been born so, if in other respects he is worthy, may be made a
   bishop.

   Canon XXII.

   He who has mutilated himself, cannot become a clergyman, for he is a
   self-murderer, and an enemy to the workmanship of God.

   Canon XXIII.

   If any man being a clergyman shall mutilate himself, let him be
   deposed, for he is a self-murderer.

   Canon XXIV.

   If a layman mutilate himself, let him be excommunicated for three
   years, as practising against his own life.

   Canon XXV.  (XXV. and XXVI.)

   If a bishop, presbyter, or deacon be found guilty of fornication,
   perjury, or theft, let him be deposed, but let him not be
   excommunicated; for the Scripture says, "thou shalt not punish a man
   twice for the same offence."  In like manner the other clergy shall be
   subject to the same proceeding. [571]

   Canon XXVI.  (XXVII.)

   Of those who have been admitted to the clergy unmarried, we ordain,
   that the readers and singers only may, if they will, marry.

   Canon XXVII.  (XXVIII.)

   If a bishop, presbyter, or deacon shall strike any of the faithful who
   have sinned, or of the unbelievers who have done wrong, with the
   intention of frightening them, we command that he be deposed.  For our
   Lord has by no means taught us to do so, but, on the contrary, when he
   was smitten he smote not again, when he was reviled he reviled not
   again, when he suffered he threatened not.

   Canon XXVIII.  (XXIX.)

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, having been justly deposed upon
   open accusations, shall dare to meddle with any of the divine offices
   which had been intrusted to him, let him be altogether cut off from the
   Church.

   Canon XXIX.  (XXX.)

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall obtain possession of that
   dignity by money, let both him and the person who ordained him be
   deposed, and also altogether cut off from all communion, as Simon Magus
   was by me Peter.

   Canon XXX.  (XXXI.)

   If any bishop obtain possession of a church by the aid of the temporal
   powers, let him be deposed and excommunicated, and all who communicate
   with him.

   Canon XXXI.  (XXXII.)

   If any presbyter, despising his own bishop, shall collect a separate
   congregation, and erect another altar, not having any grounds for
   condemning the bishop with regard to religion or justice, let him be
   deposed for his ambition; for he is a tyrant; in like manner also the
   rest of the clergy, and as many as join him; and let laymen be
   excommunicated.  Let this, however, be done after a first, second, and
   third admonition from the bishop.

   Canon XXXII.  (XXXIII.)

   If any presbyter or deacon has been excommunicated by a bishop, he may
   not be received into communion again by any other than by him who
   excommunicated him, unless it happen that the bishop who excommunicated
   him be dead.

   Canon XXXIII.  (XXXIV.)

   No foreign bishop, presbyter, or deacon, may be received without
   commendatory letters; and when they are produced let the persons be
   examined; and if they be preachers of godliness, let them be received.
   Otherwise, although you supply them with what they need, you must not
   receive them into communion, for many things are done surreptitiously.

   Canon XXXIV.  (XXXV.)

   The bishops of every nation must acknowledge him who is first among
   them and account him as their head, and do nothing of consequence
   without his consent; but each may do those things only which concern
   his own parish, and the country places which belong to it.  But neither
   let him (who is the first) do anything without the consent of all; for
   so there will be unanimity, and God will be glorified through the Lord
   in the Holy Spirit. [572]

   Canon XXXV.  (XXXVI.)

   Let not a bishop dare to ordain beyond his own limits, in cities and
   places not subject to him.  But if he be convicted of doing so, without
   the consent of those persons who have authority over such cities and
   places, let him be deposed, and those also whom he has ordained.

   Canon XXXVI.  (XXXVII.)

   If any person, having been ordained bishop, does not undertake the
   ministry, and the care of the people committed to him, let him be
   excommunicated until he does undertake it.  In like manner a presbyter
   or deacon.  But if he has gone and has not been received, not of his
   own will but from the perverseness of the people, let him continue
   bishop; and let the clergy of the city be excommunicated, because they
   have not corrected the disobedient people.

   Canon XXXVII.  (XXXVIII.)

   Let there be a meeting of the bishops twice a year, and let them
   examine amongst themselves the decrees concerning religion and settle
   the ecclesiastical controversies which may have occurred.  One meeting
   to be held in the fourth week of Pentecost [i.e., the fourth week after
   Easter], and the other on the 12th day of the month Hyperberetæus
   [i.e., October].

   Canon XXXVIII.  (XXXIX.)

   Let the bishop have the care of all the goods of the Church, and let
   him administer them as under the inspection of God.  But he must not
   alienate any of them or give the things which belong to God to his own
   relations.  If they be poor let him relieve them as poor; but let him
   not, under that pretence, sell the goods of the Church.

   Canon XXXIX.  (XL.)

   Let not the presbyters or deacons do anything without the sanction of
   the bishop; for he it is who is intrusted with the people of the Lord,
   and of whom will be required the account of their souls.

   Canon XL.  (XL. Continued.)

   Let the private goods of the bishop, if he have any such, and those of
   the Lord, be clearly distinguished, that the bishop may have the power
   of leaving his own goods, when he dies, to whom he will, and how he
   will, and that the bishop's own property may not be lost under pretence
   of its being the property of the Church:  for it may be that he has a
   wife, or children, or relations, or servants; and it is just before God
   and man, that neither should the Church suffer any loss through
   ignorance of the bishop's own property, nor the bishop or his relations
   be injured under pretext of the Church:  nor that those who belong to
   him should be involved in contests, and cast reproaches upon his death.

   Canon XLI.

   We ordain that the bishop have authority over the goods of the Church:
   for if he is to be intrusted with the precious souls of men, much more
   are temporal possessions to be intrusted to him.  He is therefore to
   administer them all of his own authority, and supply those who need,
   through the presbyters and deacons, in the fear of God, and with all
   reverence.  He may also, if need be, take what is required for his own
   necessary wants, and for the brethren to whom he has to show
   hospitality, so that he may not be in any want.  For the law of God has
   ordained, that they who wait at the altar should be nourished of the
   altar.  Neither does any soldier bear arms against an enemy at his own
   cost.

   Canon XLII.

   If a bishop or presbyter, or deacon, is addicted to dice or drinking,
   let him either give it over, or be deposed.

   Canon XLIII.

   If a subdeacon, reader, or singer, commits the same things, let him
   either give over, or be excommunicated.  So also laymen.

   Canon XLIV.

   Let a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, who takes usury from those who
   borrow of him, give up doing so, or be deposed.

   Canon XLV.

   Let a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, who has only prayed with heretics,
   be excommunicated:  but if he has permitted them to perform any
   clerical office, let him be deposed.

   Canon XLVI.

   We ordain that a bishop, or presbyter, who has admitted the baptism or
   sacrifice of heretics, be deposed.  For what concord hath Christ with
   Belial, or what part hath a believer with an infidel?

   Canon XLVII.

   Let a bishop or presbyter who shall baptize again one who has rightly
   received baptism, or who shall not baptize one who has been polluted by
   the ungodly, be deposed, as despising the cross and death of the Lord,
   and not making a distinction between the true priests and the false.

   Canon XLVIII.

   If any layman put away his wife and marry another, or one who has been
   divorced by another man, let him be excommunicated.

   Canon XLIX.

   If any bishop or presbyter, contrary to the ordinance of the Lord, does
   not baptize into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, but into
   three Unoriginated Beings, or three Sons, or three Comforters, let him
   be deposed.

   Canon L.

   If any bishop or presbyter does not perform the one initiation with
   three immersions, but with giving one immersion only, into the death of
   the Lord, let him be deposed.  For the Lord said not, Baptize into my
   death, but, "Go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
   name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."

   Canon LI.

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or any one of the sacerdotal list,
   abstains from marriage, or flesh, or wine, not by way of religious
   restraint, but as abhorring them, forgetting that God made all things
   very good, and that he made man male and female, and blaspheming the
   work of creation, let him be corrected, or else be deposed, and cast
   out of the Church.  In like manner a layman.

   Canon LII.

   If any bishop or presbyter, [573] does not receive him who turns away
   from his sin, but rejects him, let him be deposed; for he grieveth
   Christ who said, "There is joy in heaven over one sinner that
   repenteth."

   Canon LIII.

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, does not on festival days partake
   of flesh and wine, from an abhorrence of them, and not out of religious
   restraint, let him be deposed, as being seared in his own conscience,
   and being the cause of offence to many.

   Canon LIV.

   If any of the clergy be found eating in a tavern, let him be
   excommunicated, unless he has been constrained by necessity, on a
   journey, to lodge in an inn.

   Canon LV.

   If any of the clergy insult the bishop, let him be deposed:  for "thou
   shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."

   Canon LVI.

   If any of the clergy insult a presbyter, or deacon, let him be
   excommunicated.

   Canon LVII.

   If any of the clergy mock the lame, or the deaf, or the blind, or him
   who is infirm in his legs, let him be excommunicated.  In like manner
   any of the laity.

   Canon LVIII.

   If any bishop or presbyter neglects the clergy or the people, and does
   not instruct them in the way of godliness, let him be excommunicated,
   and if he persists in his negligence and idleness, let him be deposed.

   Canon LIX.

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, when any of the clergy is in want,
   does not supply him with what he needs, let him be excommunicated; but
   if he persists, let him be deposed, as one who has killed his brother.

   Canon LX.

   If any one reads publicly in the church the falsely inscribed [574]
   books of impious men, as if they were holy Scripture, to the
   destruction of the people and clergy, let him be deposed.

   Canon LXI.

   If any accusation be brought against a believer of fornication or
   adultery, or any forbidden action, and he be convicted, let him not be
   promoted to the clergy.

   Canon LXII.

   If any of the clergy, through fear of men, whether Jew, heathen, or
   heretic, shall deny the name of Christ, let him be cast out.  If he
   deny the name of a clergyman, let him be deposed.  If he repent, let
   him be received as a layman.

   Canon LXIII.

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or any one of the sacerdotal
   order, shall eat flesh, with the blood of the life thereof, or anything
   killed by beasts, or that dies of itself, let him be deposed.  For the
   law has forbidden this.  If he be a layman, let him be excommunicated.

   Canon LXIV.

   If any clergyman or layman shall enter into a synagogue of Jews or
   heretics to pray, let the former be deposed and let the latter be
   excommunicated. [575]

   Canon LXV.

   If any clergyman shall strike anyone in a contest, and kill him with
   one blow, let him be deposed for his violence.  If a layman do so, let
   him be excommunicated.

   Canon LXVI.

   If any of the clergy be found fasting on the Lord's day, or on the
   Sabbath, [576] excepting the one only, let him be deposed.  If a
   layman, let him be excommunicated.

   Canon LXVII.

   If anyone shall force and keep a virgin not espoused, let him be
   excommunicated.  And he may not take any other, but must retain her
   whom he has chosen, though she be a poor person.

   Canon LXVIII.

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall receive from anyone a second
   ordination, let both the ordained and the ordainer be deposed; unless
   indeed it be proved that he had his ordination from heretics; for those
   who have been baptized or ordained by such persons cannot be either of
   the faithful or of the clergy.

   Canon LXIX.

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or reader, or singer, does not
   fast the holy Quadragesimal fast of Easter, or the fourth day, or the
   day of Preparation, let him be deposed, unless he be hindered by some
   bodily infirmity.  If he be a layman, let him be excommunicated.

   Canon LXX.

   If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or any one of the list of clergy,
   keeps fast or festival with the Jews, or receives from them any of the
   gifts of their feasts, as unleavened bread, any such things, let him be
   deposed.  If he be a layman, let him be excommunicated.

   Canon LXXI.

   If any Christian brings oil into a temple of the heathen or into a
   synagogue of the Jews at their feast, or lights lamps, let him be
   excommunicated.

   Canon LXXII.

   If any clergyman or layman takes away wax or oil from the holy Church,
   let him be excommunicated, [and let him restore a fifth part more than
   he took.] [577]

   Canon LXXIII.

   Let no one convert to his own use any vessel of gold or silver, or any
   veil which has been sanctified, for it is contrary to law; and if
   anyone be detected doing so, let him be excommunicated.

   Canon LXXIV.

   If any bishop has been accused of anything by men worthy of credit, he
   must be summoned by the bishops; and if he appears, and confesses, or
   is convicted, a suitable punishment must be inflicted upon him.  But if
   when he is summoned he does not attend, let him be summoned a second
   time, two bishops being sent to him, for that purpose.  [If even then
   he will not attend, let him be summoned a third time, two bishops being
   again sent to him. [578] ]  But if even then he shall disregard the
   summons and not come, let the synod pronounce such sentence against him
   as appears right, that he may not seem to profit by avoiding judgment.

   Canon LXXV.

   An heretic is not to be received as witness against a bishop, neither
   only one believer; for "in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every
   word shall be established."

   Canon LXXVI.

   A bishop must not out of favour to a brother or a son, or any other
   relation, ordain whom he will to the episcopal dignity; for it is not
   right to make heirs of the bishopric, giving the things of God to human
   affections.  Neither is it fitting to subject the Church of God to
   heirs.  But if anyone shall do so let the ordination be void, and the
   ordainer himself be punished with excommunication.

   Canon LXXVII.

   If any one be deprived of an eye, or lame of a leg, but in other
   respects be worthy of a bishopric, he may be ordained, for the defect
   of the body does not defile a man, but the pollution of the soul.

   Canon LXXVIII.

   But if a man be deaf or blind, he may not be made a bishop, not indeed
   as if he were thus defiled, but that the affairs of the Church may not
   be hindered.

   Canon LXXIX.

   If anyone has a devil, let him not be made a clergyman, neither let him
   pray with the faithful; but if he be freed, let him be received into
   communion, and if he is worthy he may be ordained.

   Canon LXXX.

   It is not allowed that a man who has come over from an heathen life,
   and been baptized or who has been converted from an evil course of
   living, should be immediately made a bishop, for it is not right that
   he who has not been tried himself should be a teacher of others.
   Unless indeed this be done upon a special manifestation of Divine grace
   in his favour.

   Canon LXXXI.

   We have said that a bishop or presbyter must not give himself to the
   management of public affairs, but devote himself to ecclesiastical
   business.  Let him then be persuaded to do so, or let him be deposed,
   for no man can serve two masters, according to the Lord's declaration.

   Canon LXXXII.

   We do not allow any servants to be promoted to the clergy without the
   consent of their masters, [to the troubling of their houses. [579] ]
   But if any servant should appear worthy of receiving an order, [580] as
   our Onesimus appeared, and his masters agree and liberate him, and send
   him out of their house, he may be ordained.

   Canon LXXXIII.

   If a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall serve in the army, and wish to
   retain both the Roman magistracy and the priestly office, let him be
   deposed; for the things of Cæsar belong to Cæsar, and those of God to
   God.

   Canon LXXXIV.

   Whosoever shall insult the King, or a ruler, contrary to what is right,
   let him suffer punishment.  If he be a clergyman, let him be deposed;
   if a layman, excommunicated.

   Canon LXXXV.

   Let the following books be counted venerable and sacred by all of you,
   both clergy and Laity.  Of the Old Testament, five books of Moses,
   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; of Joshua the Son of
   Nun, one; of the Judges, one; of Ruth, one; of the Kings, four; of the
   Chronicles of the book of the days, two; of Ezra, two; of Esther, one;
   [some texts read "of Judith, one";] of the Maccabees, three; of Job,
   one; of the Psalter, one; of Solomon, three, viz.:  Proverbs,
   Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs; of the Prophets, twelve; of
   Isaiah, one; of Jeremiah, one; of Ezekiel, one; of Daniel, one.  But
   besides these you are recommended to teach your young persons the
   Wisdom of the very learned Sirach.  Our own books, that is, those of
   the New Testament, are:  the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
   John; fourteen Epistles of Paul; two Epistles of Peter; three of John;
   one of James, and one of Jude.  Two Epistles of Clemens, and the
   Constitutions of me Clemens, addressed to you Bishops, in eight books,
   which are not to be published to all on account of the mystical things
   in them.  And the Acts of us the Apostles. [581]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [566] The Latin caption is "The Ecclesiastical Rules of the Holy
   Apostles, set forth by Clement, Pontiff of the Roman Church."

   [567] The numbering which I have followed is Hammond's, but, where it
   differs from that given by Hefele, I have placed Hefele's numbering in
   parenthesis.  With Hefele agree Van Espen and Bruns (in his alternative
   numbering) and Johnson's marginal numbering.  The numbering that
   Johnson himself follows is that of Cotelerius.

   [568] The text here varies.

   [569] Hammond seems to have omitted hos kleriko, which I have supplied.

   [570] Hammond has omitted these words.

   [571] I have changed Hammond's rendering of this last phrase, "in like
   manner with respect to the other clergy."

   [572] The text here differs; I follow Beveridge.  Hammond reads,
   "Through the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Father through the Lord by the
   Holy Spirit, even the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."

   [573] Hammond adds "or deacon."

   [574] Hammond translates "bearing false inscriptions," the Greek is
   pseudepigrapha.

   [575] Hammond translates differently with the same meaning.

   [576] Hammond substitutes "any Saturday," and omits the word "only."

   [577] This last phrase is omitted by Hammond, but is found in the Latin
   and in some of the Greek texts.

   [578] According to Hefele, these words are only in the Latin, but they
   are in the Greek text of Beveridge.

   [579] According to Hefele this is only in the Latin, but it is found in
   the Greek of Beveridge.

   [580] I have changed Hammond's translation here.

   [581] The text of this canon is quite different in the different
   codices and versions.  I have departed from Hammond's version.

   I.

   The Letter of the Blessed Dionysius, the Archbishop of Alexandria to
   Basilides the Bishop who made Enquiries on Various Subjects, to which
   Dionysius made Answer in this Epistle, which Answers have been received
   as Canons. [582]

   Dionysius to my beloved son, and brother, and fellow minister in holy
   things, Basilides faithful to God, salutation in the Lord.

   Note.

   Dionysius, Johnson says, wrote in about a.d. 247.

   Canon I. [583]

   When the Paschal fast is to be broken depends on the precise hour of
   our Saviour's resurrection, and this was not certainly to be known from
   the Four Evangelists; therefore they who have not fasted the Monday,
   Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday before Easter, do no great thing if
   they fast the Friday and Saturday, and so till past three on Easter
   morning.  But they who have fasted the whole six days, are not to be
   blamed if they break their fast after midnight.  Some do not fast any
   of these days.

   Canon II.

   Menstruous women ought not to come to the Holy Table, or touch the Holy
   of Holies, [584] nor to the churches, but pray elsewhere.

   Note.

   Balsamon notes how the canon educes the example of the woman who had
   had an issue of blood for twelve years and who therefore did not dare
   to touch the Lord, but only the "hem of his garment."  He also notes
   that the question proposed, was whether Christian women should be
   excluded from the church and need follow the example of the Hebrews,
   who "when the menstrual flux was upon them, sat in a solitary place by
   themselves and waited for seven days to pass, and their flux should be
   over."  The answer given is as above.

   Canon III.

   They that can contain and are aged ought to judge for themselves.  They
   have heard St. Paul say; that they should "for a time give themselves
   to prayer, and then come together again."

   Note.

   In this epitome Johnson has set forth the meaning of the canon, as
   understood by the Greek scholiasts, rather than translated and
   epitomized the canon itself.

   Canon IV.

   They who have had involuntary nocturnal pollutions be at their own
   discretion [whether to communicate or not].

   Note.

   The Saint ends this canon with these words:  "I have given opinion on
   the points about which you have consulted me, not as a doctor, but in
   all simplicity as it is suitable the relation between us should be.
   And when you have examined, my most learned son, what I have written
   you will let me know what seems to you better or whether you agree with
   my opinions.  Farewell, dear son, may your ministry be in the peace of
   the Lord."

   [582] I have followed in the captions to all these non-conciliar canons
   the Greek text of Beveridge in his Synodicon (Tom. II.).

   Epitome is lacking.

   II.

   The Canons of the Blessed Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria, and Martyr,
   [585] which are found in his Sermon on Penitence.

   Canon I.

   The fourth Easter from the beginning of the persecution was now come;
   and orders, that they who did not fall till after they had endured
   severe torments, and have already been "Mourners" three years, after
   forty days' fast, are to be admitted to communion, although they have
   not been before received [to penance]. [586]

   Canon II.

   But if they endured imprisonment only, without torments, let a year be
   added to their former penance.

   Canon III.

   If they fell voluntarily, without torments or imprisonments, but are
   come to repentance, four years are added to their former penance.

   Canon IV.

   The case of them who do not repent pronounced desperate.

   Canon V.

   They that used evasion, and did not right down subscribe the
   abnegation, or with their own hands incense the idols, but sent a
   heathen to do it for them, are enjoined six months' penance, though
   they have been pardoned by some of the Confessors.

   Canon VI.

   Slaves forced by their masters to incense idols, and doing it in their
   master's stead, are enjoined a year's penance.

   Canon VII.

   The masters who forced them to it, are enjoined three years' penance,
   as being hypocrites, and as forcing their slaves to sacrifice.

   Canon VIII.

   They who first fell, and afterwards recovered themselves, by professing
   themselves Christians, and endured torments, are forthwith admitted to
   communion.

   Canon IX.

   That they who provoked the magistrates to persecute themselves and
   others are to be blamed, yet not to be denied communion.

   Canon X.

   That clergymen, who run themselves into persecution, and fell, though
   they did afterward recover themselves, and suffer torments, yet are not
   to be admitted to perform the sacred offices.

   Canon XI.

   That they who prayed for them who fell after long torments, be connived
   at, and we pray together with them, since they lament for what they
   have done, with anguish and mortification. [587]

   Canon XII.

   That they who with money purchased their ease and freedom, are to be
   commended.

   Canon XIII.

   Nor should we accuse those who ran away, and left all, though others
   left behind might fare the worse for it. [588]

   Canon XIV.

   That they who endured tortures, and afterwards, when they were deprived
   of speech and motion, had their hands forced into the fire, to offer
   unholy sacrifice, be placed in the Liturgy [i.e., in the diptychs]
   among the Confessors.

   Canon XV.

   Wednesday is to be fasted, because then the Jews conspired to betray
   Jesus; Friday, because he then suffered for us.  We keep the Lord's Day
   as a day of joy, because then our Lord rose.  Our tradition is, not to
   kneel on that day.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [585] According to Johnson, St. Peter of Alexandria was martyred a.d.
   311 in the persecution in the time of Diocletian, carried on by
   Maximian.

   [586] In Beveridge will be found Balsamon's and Zonaras's notes.

   [587] Johnson remarks, "The truth is, there is occasion for a critic,
   for the Greek is certainly corrupted."

   [588] This canon contains the legend, refuted by St. Jerome, that St.
   John the Baptist was taken by St. Elizabeth away from the danger of
   Herod's edicts against the Innocents and escaped by flight, his father,
   Zacharias, the meanwhile, being slain between the temple and the altar.

   III.

   The Canonical Epistle of St. Gregory, Archbishop of Neocæsarea, who is
   called Thaumaturgus, concerning Them that, During the Incursion of the
   Barbarians, Ate of Things Offered to Idols and Committed Certain Other
   Sins. [589]

   Canon I.

   That they who have been taken captives by the barbarians, and have
   eaten with them, be not treated as persons that have eaten things
   offered to idols; especially because it is universally reported, that
   they do not sacrifice to idols; nor shall those women who have been
   ravished by them, be treated as guilty of fornication, unless they were
   before of lewd lives.

   Canon II.

   That those Christians who plundered their brethren during the invasion,
   be excommunicated, lest wrath come on the people, and especially on the
   presidents, [590] who enquire not into these matters.

   Canons III., IV., V.

   The pretence of having found those goods, or that they themselves lost
   things of equal value, shall stand them in no stead, but that they be
   excluded from prayer. [591]

   Canon VI.

   Against those who detain them prisoners who had escaped from the
   barbarians, the holy man [592] expects that such should be
   thunder-struck, and therefore desires that some enquiry be made upon
   the spot by persons sent for this purpose.

   Canon VII.

   That they who joined the barbarians in their murder and ravages, or
   were guides or informers to them, be not permitted to be hearers, till
   holy men assembled together do agree in common upon what shall seem
   good, first to the Holy Ghost, then to themselves.

   Canon VIII.

   But if they discover themselves, and make restitution, they shall be
   admitted to be Prostrators.

   Canon IX.

   They that are convicted to have found (though in their own houses)
   anything [of their neighbours'] left by the barbarians shall also be
   Prostrators; but if they shall confess themselves they shall
   communicate in prayer.

   Canon X.

   This last privilege is restrained to such as demand nothing as a reward
   for their discovery, and salvage, or under any pretence whatsoever.

   Canon XI.

   The station of Mourners is without the gate of the oratory; the station
   of the Hearers is within the oratory, in the porch with the
   catechumens; the station of Prostrators is within the door of the
   temple; the station of Co-standers is among the communicants; the last
   is the participation of Holy Mysteries. [593]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [589] Johnson says this was about the year of grace 240, after the
   Goths had ravaged Asia, during the reign of Galienus.  The letter, he
   thinks, was an Encyclical sent to every bishop of his province, by
   Euphrosynus, who was one of these bishops and whom he calls his "old
   friend."  In the beginning of the letter he addresses each one of the
   bishops as "most holy pope."

   [590] I.e., the bishops, cf. St. Justin Martyr, Tertullian, etc.

   [591] Literally "abdicate from Prayers."  Johnson explains this to mean
   that they became Prostrators.

   [592] I.e., St. Gregory.

   [593] Johnson has a note that this canon is not "St. Gregory's but an
   addition by some other hand."

   IV.

   The Epistle of St. Athanasius to the Monk Ammus. [594]

   (Panta men kala, k.t.l.)

   (This, as Epistle XLVIII, will be found translated in Vol. IV. of the
   Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (2d Series) p. 556 et seq.)

   Involuntary nocturnal pollutions are not sinful, [I add to Johnson the
   exact words of the Saint.  "For what sin or uncleanness can any natural
   excrement have in itself?  Think of the absurdity of making a sin of
   the wax which comes from the ears or of the spittle from the mouth.
   Moreover we might add many things and explain how the excretions from
   the belly are necessary to animal life.  But if we believe that man is
   the work of God's hand, as we are taught in holy Scripture, how can it
   be supposed necessary that we perform anything impure?  And if we are
   the children of God, as the holy Acts of the Apostles teaches, we have
   in us nothing unclean, etc., etc."]; nor is matrimony unclean, though
   virginity ["which is angelic and than which nothing can be more
   excellent"] is to be preferred before it.

   (Found translated in Vol. IV, of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (2d
   series), pp. 551 and 552.)

   [Johnson's epitome is so unsatisfactory that I have been compelled to
   relegate it to a footnote and to make one in its room of my own. [595]
   ]

   As the heretics are quoting apocryphal writings, an evil which was rife
   even as early as when St. Luke wrote his gospel, therefore I have
   thought good to set forth clearly what books have been received by us
   through tradition as belonging to the Canon, and which we believe to be
   divine.  For there are in all twenty-two books of the Old Testament.
   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.  After this comes
   Joshua, and Judges, and Ruth.  The four books of the Kings, counted as
   two.  Then Chronicles, counted the two as one.  Then First and Second
   Esdras [i.e. Ezra and Nehemiah].  After these Psalms, Proverbs,
   Ecclesiastes, and Cantica.  To these follow Job, and the Twelve
   Prophets, counted as one book.  Then Isaiah, Jeremiah together with the
   Epistle of Baruch, the Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel.

   Of the New Testament these are the books [then follows the complete
   list ending with "the Apocalypse of John"].  These are the fountains of
   salvation, that whoso thirsteth, may be satisfied by the eloquence
   which is in them.  In them alone (en toutois monois) is set forth the
   doctrine of piety.  Let no one add to them, nor take aught therefrom.

   I also add for further accuracy that there are certain other books, not
   edited in the Canon, but established by the Fathers, to be read by
   those who have just come to us and wish to be instructed in the
   doctrine of piety.  The Wisdom of Solomon, the Wisdom of Sirach,
   Esther, Judith, Tobit, the Doctrine (Didache) of the Apostles and the
   Pastor.  And let none of the Apocrypha of the heretics be read among
   you.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [595] Johnson says:  "This contains the Canon of Scripture as we now
   receive it in all respects, save that the Epistle of Baruch is reckoned
   in the Canon, but Esther is not.  He tells us, there are other books
   never reckoned in the Canon but authorized by the fathers to be read by
   the Catechumens, viz.:  Wisdom of Solomon, of Sirach, Esther, Judith,
   and Tobias, and that which is called The Doctrine of the Apostles, and
   Pastor.  These (says he) are read, the other reckoned of the Canons:
   Apocryphal books are the invention of heretics."  To this Johnson
   appends a note, to wit:  "It is the common opinion of learned men that
   the reason why some of the ancients reckoned the book of Esther not to
   belong to the Canon, was the Apocryphal chapters added to it by another
   hand.  That The Doctrine of the Apostles is a book now lost, see Dr.
   Grabe's Essay on this subject." Who these "learned men" may be, I do
   not know, but at the time of the writing of St. Athanasius the position
   of the Hebrew Esther was not well assured in the restricted Palestinian
   Jewish Canon.  On this point the reader should make himself familiar
   with The Canon of the Old Testament by the Rt. Rev. Tobias Mullen,
   Roman Catholic Bishop of Erie, U.S.A.

   Su men ta huio, k.t.l.

   (Found translated as Epistle LV. in Vol. IV. of the Nicene and
   Post-Nicene Fathers (2d Series) pp. 566 and 567.)

   It has been determined by synods in Greece, Spain, France, that they
   who have fallen, or been leaders of impiety [Arianism], be pardoned
   upon repentance, but that they have not the place of the clergy; but
   that they who were only drawn away by force, or that complied for fear
   the people should be corrupted, have the place of the clergy too.  Let
   the people who have been deceived, or forced, be pardoned, upon
   repentance and pronouncing anathema against the miscreancy of Eudoxius
   and Euzoius, ringleaders of the Arians (who assert that Christ is a
   creature); and upon professing the faith of the Fathers at Nice, and
   that no synod can prejudice that.

   V.

   The First Canonical Epistle of Our Holy Father Basil, Archbishop of
   Cæsarea in Cappadocia to Amphilochius, Bishop of Iconium. [596]

   (This Epistle, number ct xxxviij., is found translated in Volume VIII.
   of the Second Series of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, p. 223 et
   seqq.)

   Canon I.

   As to the question concerning the Puritans the custom of every country
   is to be observed, since they who have discussed this point are of
   various sentiments.  The [baptism] of the Pepuzenes I make no account
   of, and I wonder that Dionysius the canonist was of another mind.  The
   ancients speak of heresies, which entirely break men off, and make them
   aliens from the faith.  Such are the Manichæans, Valentinians,
   Marcionites and Pepuzenes, who sin against the Holy Ghost, who baptize
   into the Father, Son and Montanus, or Priscilla.  Schisms are caused by
   ecclesiastical disputes, and for causes that are not incurable, and for
   differences concerning penance.  The Puritans are such schismatics.
   The ancients, viz. Cyprian and Fermilian, put these, and the
   Encratites, and Hydroparastatæ, and Apotactites, under the same
   condemnation; because they have no longer the communication of the Holy
   Ghost, who have broken the succession.  They who first made the
   departure had the spiritual gift; but by being schismatics, they became
   laymen; and therefore they ordered those that were baptized by them,
   and came over to the Church, to be purged by the true baptism, as those
   that are baptized by laymen.  Because some in Asia have otherwise
   determined, let [their baptism] be allowed:  but not that of the
   Encratites; for they have altered their baptism, to make themselves
   incapable of being received by the Church.  Yet custom and the Fathers,
   that is bishops, who have the administration, must be followed; for I
   am afraid of putting an impediment to the saved; while I would raise
   fears in them concerning their baptism.  We are not to allow their
   baptism, because they allow ours, but strictly to observe the canons.
   But let none be received without unction.  When we received Zois and
   Saturninus to the Episcopal chair, we made, as it were, a canon to
   receive those in communion with them.

   Canon II.

   Let her that procures abortion undergo ten years' penance, whether the
   embryo were perfectly formed, or not.

   Canon III.

   A deacon guilty of fornication, is deposed, not excommunicated; for the
   ancient canon forbids a single crime to be twice punished.  And
   further, a layman excommunicated may be restored to the degree from
   which he falls, but a clergyman deposed cannot.  Yet it is better to
   cure men of their sins by mortification, and to execute the canon only
   in cases where we cannot reach what is more perfect.

   Canon IV.

   They that marry a second time, used to be under penance a year or two.
   They that marry a third time, three or four years.  But we have a
   custom, that he who marries a third time be under penance five years,
   not by canon, but tradition.  Half of this time they are to be hearers,
   afterwards Co-standers; but to abstain from the communion of the Good
   Thing, when they have shewed some fruit of repentance.

   Canon V.

   Heretics, upon their death-bed, giving good signs of their conversion,
   to be received.

   Canon VI.

   Let it not be counted a marriage, when one belonging to the canon
   commits fornication, but let them be forced to part. [597]

   Canon VII.

   They who have committed sodomy with men or brutes, murderers, wizards,
   adulterers, and idolaters, have been thought worthy of the same
   punishment; therefore observe the same method with these which you do
   with others.  We ought not to make any doubt of receiving those who
   have repented thirty years for the uncleanness which they committed
   through ignorance; for their ignorance pleads their pardon, and their
   willingness in confessing it; therefore command them to be forthwith
   received, especially if they have tears to prevail on your tenderness,
   and have [since their lapse] led such a life as to deserve your
   compassion.

   Canon VIII.

   He that kills another with a sword, or hurls an axe at his own wife and
   kills her, is guilty of wilful murder; not he who throws a stone at a
   dog, and undesignedly kills a man, or who corrects one with a rod, or
   scourge, in order to reform him, or who kills a man in his own defence,
   when he only designed to hurt him.  But the man, or woman, is a
   murderer that gives a philtrum, if the man that takes it die upon it;
   so are they who take medicines to procure abortion; and so are they who
   kill on the highway, and rapparees.

   Canon IX.

   Our Lord is equal, to the man and woman forbidding divorce, save in
   case of fornication; but custom requires women to retain their
   husbands, though they be guilty of fornication.  The man deserted by
   his wife may take another, and though he were deserted for adultery,
   yet St. Basil will be positive, that the other woman who afterward
   takes him is guilty of adultery; but the wife is not allowed this
   liberty.  And the man who deserts an innocent wife is not allowed to
   marry.

   Canon X.

   That they who swear that they will not be ordained, be not forced to
   break their oath.  Severus, Bishop of Masada, who had ordained Cyriacus
   priest to a country church, subject to the Bishop of Mesthia, is
   referred to the divine tribunal, upon his pretending that he did it by
   surprise.  Cyriacus had upon his ordination, been forced, contrary to
   canon, to swear that he would continue in that country church; but the
   Bishop of Mesthia, to whom that church properly belonged, forced him
   out.  St. Basil advises Amphilochius to lay the country church to
   Masada, and make it subject to Severus, and to permit Cyriacus to
   return to it and save his oath; and by this means he supposes that
   Longinus, the lord of that country, would be prevailed upon to alter
   his resolution of laying that church desolate, as he declared he would
   upon Cyriacus's expulsion.

   Canon XI.

   He that is guilty of involuntary murder, shall do eleven years'
   penance--that is, if the murdered person, after he had here received
   the wound, do again go abroad, and yet afterward die of the wound.

   Canon XII.

   The canon excludes from the ministry those who are guilty of digamy.

   Canon XIII.

   Our fathers did not think that killing in war was murder; yet I think
   it advisable for such as have been guilty of it to forbear communion
   three years.

   Canon XIV.

   An usurer, giving his unjust gain to the poor, and renouncing his love
   of money, may be admitted into the clergy.

   Canons XV. and XVI.

   Not properly canons, but explications of Scripture, and therefore
   neither Balsamon, nor Aristenus, regard them as canons.

   date of these canons as later than the year 370.

   The Second Canonical Epistle of the Same.

   (This is found translated in the same volume last referred to, Epistle
   cxcix., p. 236 et seqq.)

   Canon XVII.

   I made a canon, that they at Antioch, who had sworn not to perform the
   sacred offices should not do it publicly, but in private only:  As to
   Bianor, he is removed from thence to Iconium, and therefore is more at
   liberty; but let him repent of his rash oath which he made to an
   infidel for avoiding a small danger.

   Canon XVIII.

   That the ancients received a professed virgin that had married, as one
   guilty of digamy, viz., upon one year's penance; but they ought to be
   dealt with more severely than widows professing continency, and even as
   adulterers:  But they ought not to be admitted to profess virginity
   till they are above sixteen or seventeen years of age, after trial, and
   at their own earnest request; whereas relations often offer them that
   are under age, for their own secular ends, but such ought not easily to
   be admitted.

   Canon XIX.

   That men, though they seem tacitly to promise celibacy, by becoming
   monks, yet do it not expressly; yet I think fit that they be
   interrogated too, and that a profession should be demanded of them,
   that if they betake themselves to a carnal life, they may be punished
   as fornicators.

   Canon XX.

   Women professing virginity, though they did marry while they were
   heretics, or catechumens, yet are pardoned by baptism.  What is done by
   persons in the state of catechumens, is never laid to their charge.

   Canon XXI.

   A married man committing lewdness with a single woman, is severely
   punished as guilty of fornication, but we have no canon to treat such a
   man as an adulterer; but the wife must co-habit with such a one:  But
   if the wife be lewd, she is divorced, and he that retains her is
   [thought] impious; such is the custom, but the reason of it does not
   appear.

   Canon XXII.

   That they who have stolen virgins, and will not restore them, be
   treated as fornicators; that they be one year mourners, the second
   hearers, the third received to repentance and the fourth be
   co-standers, and then admitted to communion of the Good Thing.  If the
   virgins be restored to those who had espoused them, it is at their
   discretion to marry them, or not; if to their guardians, it is at their
   discretion to give them in marriage to the raptors, or not.

   Canon XXIII.

   That a man ought not to marry two sisters, nor a woman two brothers:
   That he who marries his brother's wife, be not admitted till he dismiss
   her.

   Canon XXIV.

   A widow put into the catalogue of widows, that is, a deaconess being
   sixty years old, and marrying, is not to be admitted to communion of
   the Good Thing, till she cease from her uncleanness; but to a widower
   that marries no penance is appointed, but that of digamy.  If the widow
   be less than sixty, it is the bishop's fault who admitted her
   deaconess, not the woman's.

   Canon XXV.

   He that marries a woman that he has corrupted, shall be under penance
   for corrupting her, but may retain her for his wife.

   Canon XXVI.

   Fornication is neither marriage, nor the beginning of marriage.  If it
   may be, it is better that they who have committed fornication together
   be parted; but if they be passionate lovers, let them not separate, for
   fear of what is worse.

   Canon XXVII.

   As for the priest that is engaged, through ignorance, in an unlawful
   marriage, I have decreed, that he retain the honour of the chair; but
   forbear all sacred operations, and not give the blessing either in
   private, or public, nor distribute the Body of Christ to another, nor
   perform any liturgy; but let him bewail himself to the Lord, and to
   men, that his sin of ignorance may be pardoned.

   Canon XXVIII.

   That it is ridiculous to vow not to eat swine's flesh, and to abstain
   from it is not necessary.

   Canon XXIX.

   That princes ought not to swear to wrong their subjects:  that such
   rash oaths ought to be repented of, and evil not to be justified under
   pretence of religion.

   Canon XXX.

   That they who steal women, and their accomplices, be not admitted to
   prayers, or be co-standers for three years.  Where no violence is used,
   there no crime is committed, except there be lewdness in the case.  A
   widow is at her own discretion.  We must not mind vain pretences.

   Canon XXXI.

   She, whose husband is absent from home, if she co-habits with another
   man, before she is persuaded of his death, commits adultery.

   Canon XXXII.

   The clergyman who is deposed for mortal sin, shall not be
   excommunicated.

   Canon XXXIII.

   That a woman being delivered of a child in a journey, and taking no
   care of it, shall be reputed guilty of murder.

   Canon XXXIV.

   That the crime of women under penance for adultery, upon their own
   confession, or otherwise convicted, be not published, lest it occasion
   their death; but that they remain out of communion the appointed time.

   Canon XXXV.

   If a woman leave her husband, and if it do upon inquiry appear, that
   she did it without reason, she deserves to be punished; but let him
   continue in communion.

   Canon XXXVI.

   A soldier's wife marrying after the long absence of her husband, but
   before she is certified of his death, is more pardonable than another
   woman, because it is more credible that he may be dead.

   Canon XXXVII.

   That he, who having another man's wife or spouse taken away from him,
   marries another, is guilty of adultery with the first, not with the
   second.

   Canon XXXVIII.

   If a woman run after him that has corrupted her, she shall be under
   penance three years, though the parents be reconciled to her.

   Canon XXXIX.

   She, who continues to live with an adulterer, is all that time an
   adulteress.

   Canon XL.

   She that [being a slave] gives herself up to the will of a man, without
   the consent of her master, commits fornication; for pacts of those who
   are under the power of others are null.

   Canon XLI.

   A widow being at her own discretion, may marry to whom she will.

   Canon XLII.

   Slaves marrying without the consent of their masters, or children
   without consent of their fathers, it is not matrimony but fornication,
   till they ratify it by consenting.

   Canon XLIII.

   That he who gives a mortal wound to another is a murderer, whether he
   were the first aggressor, or did it in his own defence.

   Canon XLIV.

   The deaconess that has committed lewdness with a pagan is not to be
   received to communion, but shall be admitted to the oblation, in the
   seventh year--that is, if she live in chastity.  The pagan, who after
   [he has professed] the faith, betakes himself again to sacrilege,
   returns [like the dog] to his vomit:  we therefore do not permit the
   sacred body of a deaconess to be carnally used.

   Canon XLV.

   He that assumes the name of a Christian, but reproaches Christ, shall
   have no advantage from his name.

   Canon XLVI.

   She that marries a man who was deserted for a while by his wife, but is
   afterward dismissed upon the return of the man's former wife, commits
   fornication, but ignorantly:  she shall not be prohibited marriage, but
   it is better that she do not marry.

   Canon XLVII.

   Encratites, Saccophorians, and Apotactites, are in the same case with
   the Novatians.  We re-baptize them all.  There is a diversity in the
   canons relating to the Novatians, no canon concerning the other.  If it
   be forbid with you, as it is at Rome for prudential causes, yet let
   reason prevail.  They are a branch of the Marcionists; and though they
   baptize in the name of the three divine Persons, yet they make God the
   author of evil, and assert, that wine and the creatures of God, are
   defiled.  The bishops ought to meet, and so to explain the canon, that
   he who does [baptize such heretics] may be out of danger, and that one
   may have a positive answer to give to those that ask it.

   Canon XLVIII.

   A woman dismissed from her husband, ought to remain unmarried, in my
   judgment.

   Canon XLIX.

   If a slave be forced by her master, she is innocent.

   Canon L.

   We look on third marriages as disgraceful to the Church, but do not
   absolutely condemn them, as being better than a vague fornication.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Third Epistle of the Same to the Same.

   (Found in lib. cit., p. 255, et seqq. Epistle ccxvij. )

   Canon LI.

   That one punishment be inflicted on lapsing clergymen, viz.:
   deposition, whether they be in dignity, or in the ministry which is
   given without imposition of hands.

   Canon LII.

   A woman delivered in the road, and neglecting her child, is guilty of
   murder, unless she was under necessity by reason of the solitude of the
   place, and the want of necessaries.

   Canon LIII.

   A widow slave desiring to be married a second time, has, perhaps, been
   guilty of no great crime in pretending that she was ravished; not her
   pretence, but voluntary choice is to be condemned; but it is clear,
   that the punishment of digamy is due to her.

   Canon LIV.

   That it is in the bishop's power to increase or lessen penance for
   involuntary murder.

   Canon LV.

   They that are not ecclesiastics setting upon highwaymen, are repelled
   from the communion of the Good Thing; clergymen are deposed.

   Canon LVI.

   He that wilfully commits murder, and afterwards repents, shall for
   twenty years remain without communicating of the Holy Sacrament.  Four
   years he must mourn without the door of the oratory, and beg of the
   communicants that go in, that prayer be offered for him; then for five
   years he shall be admitted among the hearers, for seven years among the
   prostrators; for four years he shall be a co-stander with the
   communicants, but shall not partake of the oblation; when these years
   are completed, he shall partake of the Holy Sacrament.

   Canon LVII.

   The involuntary murderer for two years shall be a mourner, for three
   years a hearer, four years a prostrator, one year a co-stander, and
   then communicate.

   Canon LVIII.

   The adulterer shall be four years a mourner, five a hearer, four a
   prostrator, two a co-stander.

   Canon LIX.

   The fornicator shall be a mourner two years, two a hearer, two a
   prostrator, one a co-stander.

   Canon LX.

   Professed virgins and monks, if they fall from their profession, shall
   undergo the penance of adulterers.

   Canon LXI.

   The thief, if he discover himself, shall do one year's penance; if he
   be discovered [by others] two; half the time he shall be a prostrator,
   the other half a co-stander.

   Canon LXII.

   He that abuses himself with mankind, shall do the penance of an
   adulterer.

   Canon LXIII.

   And so shall he who abuses himself with beasts, if they voluntarily
   confess it.

   Canon LXIV.

   The perjured person shall be a mourner two years, a hearer three, a
   prostrator four, a co-stander one.

   Canon LXV.

   He that confesses conjuration, or pharmacy, shall do penance as long as
   a murderer.

   Canon LXVI.

   He that digs the dead out of their graves, shall be a mourner two
   years, a hearer three years, a prostrator four years, a co-stander one
   year.

   Canon LXVII.

   Incest with a sister is punished as murder.

   Canon LXVIII.

   All incestuous conjunction, as adultery.

   Canon LXIX.

   A reader or minister lying with a woman he has only espoused, shall
   cease from his function one year; but if he have not espoused her, he
   shall [wholly] cease from his ministry.

   Canon LXX.

   The priest or deacon that is polluted in lips, shall be made to cease
   from his function, but shall communicate with the priests or deacons.
   He that does more shall be deposed.

   Canon LXXI.

   He that is convicted to have been conscious to any of these crimes, but
   not discovered it, shall be treated as the principal.

   Canon LXXII.

   He that gives himself to divination, shall be treated as a murderer.

   Canon LXXIII.

   He that denied Christ, is to be communicated at the hour of death, if
   he confess it, and be a mourner till that time.

   Canon LXXIV.

   [The bishop] that has the power of binding and loosing, may lessen the
   time of penance, to an earnest penitent.

   Canon LXXV.

   He that commits incest with a half-sister, shall be a mourner three
   years, a hearer three years, a co-stander two years.

   Canon LXXVI.

   And so shall he be who takes in marriage his son's wife.

   Canon LXXVII.

   He that divorces his wife, and marries another, is an adulterer; and
   according to the canons of the Fathers, he shall be a mourner one year,
   a hearer two years, a prostrator three years, a co-stander one year, if
   they repent with tears.

   Canon LXXVIII.

   So shall he who successively marries two sisters.

   Canon LXXIX.

   So shall he who madly loves his mother-in-law, or sister.

   Canon LXXX.

   The Fathers say nothing of polygamy as being beastly, and a thing
   unagreeable to human nature.  To us it appears a greater sin than
   fornication:  Let therefore such [as are guilty of it] be liable to the
   canons, viz.:  after they have been mourners one year--let them be
   prostrators three years--and then be received,

   Canon LXXXI.

   They who in the invasion of the barbarians have after long torments,
   eaten of magical things offered to idols, and have sworn heathen oaths,
   let them not be received for three years; for two years let them be
   hearers, for three years prostrators, so let them be received; but they
   who did it without force, let them be ejected three years, be hearers
   two years, prostrators three years, co-standers three years, so let
   them be admitted to communion.

   Canon LXXXII.

   They who by force have been driven to perjury, let them be admitted
   after six years; but if without force, let them be mourners two years,
   hearers two years, the fifth year prostrators, two years co-standers.

   Canon LXXXIII.

   They that follow heathenish customs, or bring men into their houses for
   the contriving pharmacies, or repelling them, shall be one year
   mourners, one year hearers, three years prostrators, one year
   co-standers.

   Canon LXXXIV.

   We do not judge altogether by the length of time, but by the
   circumstances of the penance.  If any will not be drawn from their
   carnal pleasures, and choose to serve them rather than the Lord, we
   have no communication with them.

   Canon LXXXV.

   Let us take care that we do not perish with them; let us warn them by
   night and day, that we may deliver them out of the snare or however
   save ourselves from their condemnation.

   shall die suspended from his office, and give account to God:  that he
   shall be an anathema to all the people, and they who receive him [to
   communion] be excommunicated.

   Of the Same to the Chorepiscopi, that No Ordinations Should Be Made
   Contrary to the Canons.

   Canon XC.

   A letter to his Village-bishop: [598]   he complains of the want of
   discipline of the multiplying of the clergy, and that without due
   examination and enquiry into their morals; that they had dropped the
   old custom, which was for the priests and deacons to recommend to the
   Village Bishop, who taking the testimonial, and giving notice of it to
   the [City] Bishop, did afterwards admit the minister into the
   sacerdotal list; that the number of the inferior clergy was
   unreasonably increased, especially in time of war, when men got into
   orders to avoid the press:  he orders a list of the clergy in every
   village to be sent to him, and who admitted him, if any have been
   admitted into the inferior orders by priests, that they be looked on as
   laymen.  Let not who will, put his name into the list.  Re-examine
   those who are there, expel the unworthy, admit none without my consent
   for the future; if you do he shall be counted a layman.

   Of the Same to His Suffragans that They Should Not Ordain for Money.

   (Found translated in lib. cit., pp. 156 and 157.  Epistle liii.)

   Canon XCI.

   One letter to the bishop subject to him, wherein he prohibits to take
   money for orders, and to bring merchandize into the church, which is
   entrusted with the Body, and Blood of Christ; they had their pay after
   the ordination was performed; this he calls an artifice, and declares,
   that he who is guilty of it shall depart from the altar in his country,
   and go buy and sell the gift of God where he can.

   From Chapter XVII. of the Book St. Basil Wrote to Blessed Amphilochius
   on the Holy Ghost.

   (Found translated in lib. cit., p. 40 et seqq.)

   Canon XCII.

   He speaks of the written doctrine, and the unwritten tradition of the
   Apostles, and says, that both have the same efficacy as to religion.
   The unwritten traditions which he mentions, are the signing those who
   hope in Christ with the Cross; praying toward the East, to denote, that
   we are in quest of Eden, that garden in the East from whence our first
   parents were ejected (as he afterwards explains it), the words of
   invocation at the consecration of the Bread of Eucharist, and the cup
   of eulogy; the benediction of the baptismal water, the chrism and of
   the baptized person; the trine immersion, and the renunciations made at
   baptism; all which the Fathers concealed from those who were not
   initiated.  He says the dogmata were always kept secret, the Kerugmata
   published; he adds the tradition of standing at prayer on the first day
   of the week, and the whole Pentecost (that is, from Easter to
   Whitsunday), not only to denote our rising with Christ, but as a
   prefiguration of our expecting an eternal perfect day, for the
   enjoyment of which we erect ourselves; and lastly, the profession of
   our faith in Father, Son and Holy Ghost at baptism.

   Canon XCIII.

   He asserts the Doxology [in these words] "with the Holy Spirit," to be
   an unwritten, Apostolic tradition.  For this is a dogma full of
   authority, venerable for its antiquity.

   From the Letter of Basil the Great to the Nicopolitans.

   There is also in Tilius and Bishop Beveridge here [599] inserted an
   epistle of St. Basil the Great to the Nicopolitans, comforting them
   under the loss of their church or oratory, and telling them, that they
   ought not to be concerned that they worship God in the open air, for
   that the eleven Apostles worshipped God in an upper room, where they
   were cooped up, while they that crucified Jesus performed their worship
   in a most famous Temple.

   VI.

   The Canonical Epistle of St. Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, to St. Letoïus,
   Bishop of Melitene. [600]

   Canon I.

   At Easter not only they who are transformed by the grace of the laver,
   i.e. baptism, but they who are penitents and converts, are to be
   brought to God, i.e. to the Communion:  for Easter is that Catholic
   feast in which there is a resurrection from the fall of sin.

   Canon II.

   They who lapse without any force, so as to deny Christ, or do by choice
   turn Jews, idolaters, or Manichees, or infidels of any sort, not to be
   admitted to communion till the hour of death; and if they chance to
   recover beyond expectation, to return to their penance.  But they who
   were forced by torments, to do the penance of fornication.

   Canon III.

   If they who run to conjurers or diviners, do it through unbelief, they
   shall be treated as they who wilfully lapse, but if through want of
   sense, and through a vain hope of being relieved under their
   necessities, they shall be treated as those who lapse through the
   violence of torment.

   Canon IV.

   That fornicators be three years wholly ejected from prayer, three years
   hearers, three years prostrators, and then admitted to communion; but
   the time of hearing and prostrating may be lessened to them who of
   their own accord confess, and are earnest penitents.  That this time be
   doubled in case of adultery, and unlawful lusts, but discretion to be
   used.

   Canon V.

   Voluntary murderers shall be nine years ejected out of the church, nine
   years hearers, nine years prostrators; but every one of these nine
   years may be reduced to seven or six, or even five, if the penitents be
   very diligent.  Involuntary murderers to be treated as fornicators, but
   still with discretion, and allowing the communion on a death-bed, but
   on condition, that they return to penance if they survive.

   Canon VI.

   That the Fathers have been too gentle toward the idolatry of covetous
   persons, in condemning to penance only robbery, digging of graves, and
   sacrilege, whereas usury and oppression, though under colour of
   contract, are forbidden by Scripture.  That highwaymen returning to the
   Church, be treated as murderers.  They that pilfer, and then confess
   their sin to the priest, are only obliged to amendment, and to be
   liberal to the poor; and if they have nothing, to labour and give their
   earnings.

   Canon VII.

   They who dig into graves, and rake into the ashes and bones of the
   dead, in order to find some valuable thing buried together with the
   corpse, (not they who only take some stones belonging to a sepulchre,
   in order to use them in building) to do the penance of fornicators.

   Canon VIII.

   He observes that by the law of Moses, sacrilege was punished as murder,
   and that the guilty person was stoned to death, and thinks the Fathers
   too gentle, in imposing a shorter penance on sacrilege than adultery.

   VII.

   From the Metre Poems of St. Gregory Theologus, Specifying which Books
   of the Old and New Testament Should Be Read. [601]

   Let not other books seduce your mind:  for many malignant writings have
   been disseminated.  The historical books are twelve in number by the
   Hebrew count, [then follow the names of the books of the Old Testament
   but Esther is omitted, one Esdras, and all the Deutero-Canonical
   books].  Thus there are twenty-two books of the Old Testament which
   correspond to the Hebrew letters.  The number of the books of the New
   Mystery are Matthew, who wrote the Miracles of Christ for the Hebrews;
   Mark for Italy; Luke, for Greece; John, the enterer of heaven, [602]
   was a preacher to all, then the Acts, the xiv. Epistles of Paul, the
   vii. Catholic Epistles, and so you have all the books.  If there is any
   beside these, do not repute it genuine.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [601] Not being satisfied with Johnson, I have supplied a translation
   from Beveridge.  It also is found in Aristenus's Epitome.  Balsamon has
   written a brief scholion adding nothing of importance to the text.

   [602] This seems to imply a knowledge of the Revelation, although it is
   not mentioned.
     __________________________________________________________________

   VIII.

   From the Iambics of St. Amphilochius the Bishop to Seleucus, on the
   Same Subject. [603]

   We should know that not every book which is called Scripture is to be
   received as a safe guide.  For some are tolerably sound and others are
   more than doubtful.  Therefore the books which the inspiration of God
   hath given I will enumerate.  [Then follows a list of the
   proto-canonical books of the Old Testament, Esther alone being
   omitted.  All the deutero-canonical books are omitted.  He then
   continues] to these some add Esther.  I must now show what are the
   books of the New Testament.  [Then follow all the books of the New
   Testament except the Revelation.  He continues,] But some add to these
   the Revelation of John, but by far the majority say that it is
   spurious.  This is the most true canon of the divinely given
   Scriptures.

   Note.

   We have thus four [five if we accept the Laodicean list as genuine,]
   different canons of Holy Scripture, all having the approval of the
   Council in Trullo and of the Seventh Ecumenical.  From this there seems
   but one conclusion possible, viz.:  that the approval given was not
   specific but general.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [603] That is the canon of Holy Scripture.  I have substituted my own
   Epitome, in the room of Johnson's, translating the original as it is
   found in Beveridge's Synodicon, Tom. II., p. 179.  It is also in
   Aristenus's Epitome.  Balsamon has no scholion on this passage.

   IX.

   The Canonical Answers of Timothy the Most Holy Bishop of Alexandria,
   Who was One of the CL Fathers Gathered Together at Constantinople, to
   the Questions Proposed to Him concerning Bishops and Clerics. [604]

   Question I.

   If a lad of seven years old, or a man, being a catechumen, being
   present at the oblation, does eat of it through ignorance, what shall
   be done in this case?

   Answer.  Let him be illuminated, i.e. baptized, for he is called by
   God.

   Question II.

   If baptism be desired for a catechumen that is possessed, what shall be
   done?

   Answer.  Let him be baptized at the hour of death, not otherwise.

   Question III.

   Ought a communicant to communicate, if he be possessed?

   Answer.  If he do not expose or blaspheme the Mysteries, let him
   communicate not always, but at certain times.

   Question IV.

   If a catechumen be sick, and in a frenzy, so that he cannot make
   profession of his faith, can he be baptized, at the entreaty of his
   friends?

   Answer.  He may, if he be not possessed.

   Question V.

   Can a man or woman communicate after performing the conjugal act over
   night?

   Answer.  No.  1 Cor. vii. 5.

   Question VI.

   The day appointed for the baptism of a woman; on that day it happened
   that the custom of women was upon her; ought she then to be baptized?

   Answer.  No, not till she be clean.

   Question VII.

   Can a menstruous woman communicate?

   Answer.  Not until she be clean.

   Question VIII.

   Ought a woman in child-bed to keep the Paschal fast?

   Answer.  No.

   Question IX.

   Ought a clergyman to perform the oblation, or pray, while an Arian or
   heretic is present?

   Answer.  As to the divine oblation, the deacon, after the kiss, makes a
   proclamation, "Let all that are not Communicants walk off;" therefore
   such persons ought not to be present, except they promise to repent,
   and renounce their heresy.

   Question X.

   Is a sick man obliged to keep the Paschal fast?

   Answer.  No.

   Question XI.

   If a clergyman be called to celebrate a marriage, and have heard that
   it is incestuous; ought he to comply, and perform the oblation?

   Answer.  No; he must not be partaker of other men's sins.

   Question XII.

   If a layman ask a clergyman whether he may communicate after a
   nocturnal pollution?

   Answer.  If it proceed from the desire of a woman, he ought not: but if
   it be a temptation from Satan, he ought; for the tempter will ply him
   when he is to communicate.

   Question XIII.

   When are man and wife to forbear the conjugal act?

   Answer.  On Saturday, and the Lord's day; for on those days the
   spiritual sacrifice is offered.

   Question XIV.

   Shall there be an oblation for him, who being distracted, murders
   himself?

   Answer.  Not except the case be very clear that he was distracted.

   Question XV.

   If one's wife be possessed to such a degree, as that she be bound with
   irons, and the man cannot contain, may he marry another?

   Answer.  I can only say it would be adultery so to do.

   Question XVI.

   If a man in washing or bathing, swallow a drop of water, may he
   communicate after it?

   Answer.  If Satan find an occasion of hindering us from the communion,
   he will the oftener do it.

   Question XVII.

   Are they, who hear the Word, and do it not, damned?

   Answer.  If we neither do it, or repent that we have not done it.

   Question XVIII.

   At what age are sins imputed to us by God?

   Answer.  According to every one's capacity and understanding; to one at
   ten, to another when older.

   X.

   The Prosphonesus of Theophilus, Archbishop of Alexandria, When the Holy
   Epiphanies Happened to Fall on a Sunday. [605]

   Canon I.

   Because the fast of Epiphany chances to fall on a Lord's day, let us
   take a few dates, and so break our fast, and honour the Lord's day, and
   shew our dislike of heresy, and yet not wholly neglect the fast which
   should be observed on this day; eating no more till our evening
   assembly at three afternoon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [605] Johnson gives the date as about a.d. 385.  These are annotated
   only by Balsamon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Commonitory of the Same which Ammon Received on Account of Lycus.

   Canon II.

   Let [the priests] who have communicated with the Arians, be retained or
   rejected, as the custom of every church is; but so, that other orthodox
   [priests] be ordained, though the others continue.  As the orthodox
   bishops did in Thebais, so let it be in other cities.  They who were
   ordained by Bishop Apollo, and afterwards communicated with the Arians,
   if they did it of their own accord, let them be censured; but if they
   only did it in obedience to the bishop, let them be continued; but if
   all the people abdicate them, others must be ordained.  And if Bistus
   the priest be found to have committed uncleanness with a woman
   dismissed from her husband, let him not be permitted to be a priest.
   But this is no prejudice to the bishop who ordained him, if he did it
   ignorantly; since the Holy Synod commands unworthy men to be ejected,
   though they be not convicted until after ordination.

   Canon III.

   Let Bishop Apollo's sentence against his priest Sur prevail, though he
   has the liberty of being further heard.

   Canon IV.

   If Panuph the deacon married his brother's daughter before baptism, let
   him continue among the clergy, if she be dead, and he had not to do
   with her after his baptism; but if he married her, and cohabited with
   her while he was a communicant, let him be ejected from the clergy,
   without prejudice to the bishop who ordained him, if he did it
   ignorantly.

   Canon V.

   If it do evidently appear, that Jacob, while he was reader, did commit
   fornication, and was ejected by the priests (presbuteron), and yet
   afterwards ordained, let him be ejected, and not otherwise.

   Canon VI.

   That all in holy orders unanimously choose those who are to be
   ordained, and then the bishop examine [them]; or that the bishop ordain
   them in the midst of the church, all that are in holy orders
   consenting, and the bishop with a loud voice asking the people, who are
   then to be present, whether they can give their testimony [to the
   parties to be ordained]; and that ordination be not performed in
   private; if there be in the remote country, who while they were
   communicants [with the Arians] communicated in their opinions, let them
   not be ordained until they be examined by orthodox clergymen, in the
   presence of the bishop, who is to charge the people, that there be no
   running up and down in the middle of the church, or service.

   Canon VII.

   Let the clergymen distribute all that is offered by way of sacrifice,
   after so much as was necessary has been consumed in the Mysteries.  Let
   not the catechumens taste of them, but clergymen and communicants only.
   [606]

   Canon VIII.

   One, Hierax, had delated a clergyman as guilty of fornication.  Bishop
   Apollo defended him.  Theophilus orders the matter to be examined.

   Canon IX.

   That an OEconomus be created, by the consent of all that are in Holy
   Orders, with the concurrence of Bishop Apollo, that so the goods of the
   Church be expended as they ought.

   Canon X.

   That the widows, poor, and travellers be not disturbed; and that no one
   make a property of the goods of the Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [606] Johnson gives this note.  "To eat the main of what was left, was
   not at all inconsistent with reserving so much as was necessary for
   foreseen and unforeseen emergencies."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of the Same to Agatho the Bishop.

   Whereas Maximus has for ten years lived in unlawful marriage, but
   pretends that it was through ignorance, and that they are now parted by
   mutual consent, let them stand among the catechumens, if it appear that
   they be in earnest.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of the Same to Menas the Bishop.

   Theophilus was informed, that the priest in Geminus, a village, had
   repelled Kyradium (a woman) from the communion:  Theophilus approves of
   it, because she had done wrong, and was unwilling to make satisfaction;
   but orders her to be admitted to communion upon repentance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Narrative of the Same concerning Those Called Cathari.

   Because the great synod held at Nice has decreed, That [the clergymen]
   who come over to the Church from the Novatians be ordained; do you
   ordain those that come over, if their life be upright, and there be no
   objection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   XI.

   The Canonical Epistle of Our Holy Father Among the Saints, Cyril,
   Archbishop of Alexandria, on the Hymns. [607]

   Cyril to Domnus.

   This letter contains a complaint of one, Peter, deposed from his See,
   yet retaining the character of a bishop, who thought his cause good,
   but complains that he had not time and opportunity given him for his
   defence; and that whatever he had, was taken away from him.  He desires
   Domnus, who was a Metropolitan, that he would call a synod, and let him
   have a hearing; and that such bishops as Peter suspected of prejudice
   against him should not be permitted to be his judges.  He thinks it
   very hard, that not only what belonged to the Church, but every thing
   else was taken from him; and complains that all bishops were called to
   account for every thing they received, whether from the Church, or by
   any other means.  Peter had indeed signed an instrument of resignation;
   but Cyril says, that he was terrified into it; and that he would have
   no such resignation be of force except he that made it deserved
   deposition.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [607] Johnson gives the date of this as about the year 412 a.d.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of the Same to the Bishops of Libya and Pentapolis.

   There is another Epistle of the same father, complaining to the bishops
   of Libya and Pentapolis.  That some who had been refused ordination by
   their own bishop, or cast out of the monasteries for their
   irregularity, were ordained by a surprise upon some other bishop, and
   that just as they came from their bride-bed, and then went and
   performed the oblation, or any other office, in the monasteries from
   which they had been ejected, which gave great offence.  He charges the
   bishops to take care of this for the future and, if any were to be
   ordained, to enquire into their lives, and whether they are married,
   and when, and how; and orders, that catechumens, who had been separated
   for lapsing, be baptized at the hour of death.
     __________________________________________________________________

   XII. [608]

   The Encyclical Letter of Gennadius, Patriarch of Constantinople and of
   the Holy Synod Met with Him to All the Holy Metropolitans and to the
   Pope of the City of Rome. [609]

   To the most beloved of God, fellow-minister, Gennadius and the most
   holy synod assembled in the royal city which is New Rome, sendeth
   greeting.

   As our Lord without money and without price ordained his Apostles, so
   should we ordain the clergy, for the Lord has placed us in their grade
   and in their stead (eis ton ekeinon batheon te kai topon).  Nor should
   we use any ingenious sophisms to avoid this plain duty, explicitly laid
   upon us, not only by the words of the Gospel but also by a canon of the
   great Ecumenical Synod of Chalcedon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [608] The Greeks speak of the canons of The Thirteen Holy Fathers,
   counting in the number St. Cyprian's canon, but as this was really
   Synodal I have placed it in that category.

   [609] In this I have not followed Johnson, but translated from
   Beveridge, Synod., Tom. II., p. 181.
